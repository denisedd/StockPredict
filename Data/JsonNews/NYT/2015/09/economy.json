{"Headline": "Jeb Bush Tax Plan Makes Forays Into Populism", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bush\u2019s proposals nevertheless drew a harsh rebuke from Democrats who are unhappy that he is seeking to lower taxes across all income brackets and slash the corporate tax rate. At the same time, conservative anti-tax activists were worried by his suggestion that \u201ccarried interest\u201d \u2014 the profits fund managers receive from investing other people\u2019s money \u2014 should be taxed at a higher rate, like ordinary income.\u201cNo Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains,\u201d said Ryan Ellis, the tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases. \u201cThis tax hike idea is supported by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The Democratic left deeply wishes to tax all capital gains as ordinary income.\u201dMitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential bid was dogged by the issue when he revealed that he paid an effective tax rate of about 15 percent, largely on his compensation from Bain Capital.But the effect of Mr. Bush\u2019s proposals on the wealthy would be muted by his proposal to cut the number of individual tax brackets from seven to three, taxing income at 28 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent. Currently, the top marginal income tax rate is 39.6 percent. His proposals would double the standard tax deduction that most filers take, end what Republicans call the \u201cdeath tax\u201d on estates of the deceased and seek to make marriage more beneficial for tax purposes.Speaking from the factory floor of a poultry-chilling-equipment company just south of Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Bush struck a series of populist notes.\u201cThe new normal is a comfortable ride for the affluent people that live off their portfolios,\u201d he told a crowd of supporters and workers with protective goggles resting on their foreheads. \u201cMy plan will help those who live on their paychecks, who haven\u2019t seen a raise in a while.\u201dMr. Bush also said he wanted to discourage \u201ccorporate inversions\u201d in which American companies use cross-border mergers to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad; he would do so by ending the practice of taxing the corporations\u2019 international profits. He would also assess a one-time tax on corporate money stashed overseas and eliminate the interest deductions companies take when they borrow, in addition to setting his sights on the issue of carried interest.The current system \u201cpunishes people for doing things we should encourage and rewards people for doing things that may not be so good,\u201d he said in his appearance in North Carolina on Wednesday.Mr. Bush\u2019s idea of taxing carried interest at his highest proposed rate of 28 percent, rather than at the lower capital gains rate of 23.8 percent, could draw the most consternation from Republicans, making the overhaul difficult to pass through Congress without bipartisan support.Wall Street donors and lobbyists have fought President Obama\u2019s effort to make such changes, and they were vocal in their opposition on Wednesday.\u201cIncreasing taxes on carried interest would discourage growth and investment and would make our tax code more complex and less fair,\u201d said James Maloney, a spokesman for Private Equity Growth Capital Council, which lobbies for the industry. \u201cInstead of increasing taxes on private equity, venture capital and real estate investment, it is our hope that as the debate over tax reform unfolds, presidential candidates will utilize the opportunity to encourage, not undermine, long-term investment in the United States.\u201dWhile Mr. Bush\u2019s plan embraces some of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist language, he also took a subtle jab at his rival, suggesting that the billionaire tycoon has not come forward with a specific proposal to overhaul taxes.\u201cYou have to be willing to take a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis political environment we\u2019re in now where the louder voices just turn up the volume \u2014 that\u2019s a sign of strength and leadership. It isn\u2019t.\u201dDemocrats pounced on Mr. Bush\u2019s proposals on Wednesday as a strategy that would most benefit the rich and impose new costs on the middle class, and they compared his tax cuts to those enacted by his brother former President George W. Bush.\u201cMore massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, all while exploding the deficit or shifting the burden onto the middle class \u2014 an even more extreme plan than his brother\u2019s,\u201d said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.A Bush spokeswoman would not say how long Mr. Bush projected it would take to achieve 4 percent economic growth, or how the lost tax revenue will be accounted for in the short term. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said that Mr. Bush\u2019s proposal was similar to Mr. Romney\u2019s plan in 2012, and that it would be a struggle to make such deep cuts pay for themselves through faster growth. Cutting the top income rate paid by the richest Americans by nearly a third while ratcheting up standard deductions, he said, will dwarf the effect of closing some loopholes. \u201cThe one thing that seems pretty obvious is that this has to be a big revenue loser,\u201d Mr. Williams said.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLots of buzz concerning the impact of higher interest rates in the United States. A major trading partner creating shock waves in the global economy. Stock market volatility spreading around the world.The country in question then was Mexico, as rising rates in the United States put pressure on an emerging market economy already suffering from a weakening currency and too much debt.Ultimately, Mexico had to be bailed out by the United States and the International Monetary Fund. And something like the so-called Tequila Crisis and other episodes of global economic turmoil in the 1990s are exactly what officials hope to avoid \u2014 or at least lessen \u2014 as they prepare for when the Fed finally raises rates.\u201cThere is no doubt that policy makers in emerging markets have been trembling in their boots at the prospect of a Fed rate hike,\u201d said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.In fact, Fed policy makers mainly cited global economic conditions \u2014 not domestic ones \u2014 when they decided not to raise rates at their meeting on Thursday.That was the right call, said Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and more recently was director of the National Economic Council in President Obama\u2019s first term.\u201cPeople often underestimate the risks, especially when you have a lot of volatility, and things can go wrong that you can\u2019t foresee,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven what\u2019s happening in China, Brazil and other emerging markets, there\u2019s still reason for being cautious if there are no signs of substantial inflationary pressures anywhere.\u201dMuch of Wall Street is now looking for the Fed to finally tighten monetary policy at its last meeting of the year in December.But if international conditions then are anything like they are now, and inflation still doesn\u2019t pose much of a threat, Mr. Summers said, \u201cit will be just as significant an error to move in December as it would have been to move in September.\u201dTo some observers, the delay by the Fed will help give emerging markets more time to prepare and also recover from China-induced volatility. But Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed board member from 2006 to 2008, said it could actually complicate the situation.\u201cThis exacerbates the risks and makes the communication even more difficult going forward,\u201d said Mr. Mishkin, now a professor at Columbia Business School. \u201cWhen will global conditions be strong enough to raise rates? This will create even more confusion.\u201dElsewhere in the world, it is no so much the initial increase itself, which is expected to be limited to a modest quarter of a percentage point, that worries experts as the prospect of further aftershocks as the Fed shifts from an easy money stance to a gradually tightening posture.Mr. Rogoff, who wrote the 2009 book \u201cThis Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\u201d (Princeton University Press), with Carmen Reinhart, said it was \u201cremarkable how focused the world is on the Fed, and there\u2019s no question emerging markets are very vulnerable right now.\u201dOfficials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.These strains are evident in measures like the spread between what emerging market countries have to pay to borrow vs. what it costs the United States, as well as the rapid depreciation of some emerging market currencies.At the beginning of the year, yields on Brazilian debt were about 2 percentage points more than American bonds. That spread has since doubled, to nearly four full percentage points. Over the same period, the value of Brazil\u2019s real has fallen by nearly a third against the dollar.That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Brazil and other emerging markets are heading for disaster. Many potentially vulnerable economies are better prepared this time around than they were two decades ago, officials say.A senior Treasury Department official, for example, said on Friday that many developing nations had taken steps over the last few years to prepare for the inevitable moment when the Fed starts to raise rates. The official, made available by Treasury on condition of anonymity, said that at the recent G-20 meetings, there was more concern about the impact of China\u2019s struggles than about actions in the United States.Mexico and Brazil, like most countries, have forgone attempting to fix their exchange rates in favor of more flexible arrangements that prevent them from having to deplete their hard currency reserves in a futile effort to preserve the dollar peg.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Still, while exchange rates may be less of a worry, there is an additional factor putting pressure on emerging market economies these days: crashing commodity prices.Because commodities are their main export, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia, along with the big oil producers of the Middle East, are feeling the pain from lower prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials.\u201cIf you did a regression analysis of emerging market debt crises, the two key variables are commodity prices and global interest rates,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said.But other analysts warn that such concerns are overblown and that further delays by the Fed in starting to \u201cnormalize\u201d interest rates carry their own risks as well.That\u2019s been plenty of advance notice, they say, that should have given emerging markets time to prepare for the new environment. That\u2019s the view, for example, of Glenn Hubbard, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and is now dean of Columbia\u2019s business school.\u201cIt\u2019s been so well telegraphed,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said. Whether the increase happens in October, December or next March, \u201cit will be gradual and it\u2019s already been priced in,\u201d he said.Using the classic metaphor to describe the Fed\u2019s role in preventing an economy from getting too exuberant, Mr. Hubbard said, \u201cPeople will realize the punch bowl is being taken away, but it\u2019s not like they are running out of the room with it. They can still get drinks as it\u2019s being taken away.\u201dWhen Fed policy makers do eventually decide to move, they should emphasize that it is not the beginning of a relentless new tightening phase, said Robert E. Rubin, President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary from 1995-99.At the time of the initial rate increase, he said, Fed officials should make clear that future increases will only come if the data suggests the economy continues to strengthen and that higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policy are required to head off the clear risk of inflation.\u201cYou need to defuse inferences about monetary conditions in the future,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, whose first major challenge after being sworn in was tackling the Tequila Crisis. \u201cIf they did that, I think it might actually reduce uncertainty and might not have the consequences that people worry about it in terms of a rate hike.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Military Parade in China Gives Xi Jinping a Platform to Show Grip on Power", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the highly public manner of Mr. Xi\u2019s announcement that 300,000 military personnel would be demobilized, China\u2019s largest troop reduction in nearly two decades, carried another implicit message. He was demonstrating his grip on the military and on the party, amid economic squalls and a grinding anticorruption campaign that have left some wondering whether he and his agenda of change \u2014 including in the People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 were faltering, several experts said.But he added that Mr. Xi faced challenges in forcing through his broader program to overhaul the military, which would reshape its command structure and knock away the longstanding power of regional military commands across China.\u201cIf it does happen, then this is confirmation that Xi Jinping is the most powerful commander in chief China has seen since Deng Xiaoping,\u201d Mr. Scobell said. \u201cThis is about showing Xi as the strongman.\u201dMr. Xi did not give any details of the troop reductions. But a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of National Defense later said the cuts would be completed by the end of 2017 and were intended to clear the way for deeper changes, and a leaner, more agile military.\u201cThe focus of these military personnel reductions is on shrinking forces with outdated equipment and slimming down bureaucracy and noncombat personnel,\u201d said the spokesman, Col. Yang Yujun, according to the Defense Ministry\u2019s website. \u201cIn the next step, we will roll out new reform measures one after another, actively and steadily advancing reform of national defense and the military.\u201dThe cut announced by Mr. Xi would shrink China\u2019s military personnel to two million, the biggest reduction since 500,000 were demobilized in 1997, said the China News Service, a state-run agency. The Chinese military would remain the world\u2019s largest, compared with the United States\u2019 active-duty force of 1.4 million.The reduction would come mostly from ground forces, with more resources going to the navy, the air force and the Second Artillery Corps, which holds China\u2019s land-based ballistic missiles, including nuclear warheads, said David Finkelstein, the vice president of CNA, an organization in Arlington, Va., that specializes in military analysis.\u201cThis decision was to be expected,\u201d a retired Chinese major general, Xu Guangyu, said of Mr. Xi\u2019s announcement in a telephone interview. \u201cThe modernization of weapons and equipment is encouraging a reduction in personnel numbers.\u201dWhether Mr. Xi can build on the new troop cuts to change how the Chinese military operates will test his political mettle. His plan to reorganize and reinvigorate the military is part of an ambitious program announced in 2013 that also includes an overhaul of the economy. Since then, the government has instituted some changes, but many observers say the moves have often been hesitant and opaque, failing to match Mr. Xi\u2019s bold promises.Turmoil in the Chinese stock market and worries about an economic slowdown in recent months have also dented Mr. Xi\u2019s reputation, while a sweeping anticorruption campaign that allowed him to purge high-level enemies has left many in the party elite grumbling, nervous or both.But Mr. Xi conveyed confidence on Thursday. Wearing a traditional suit of the kind favored by Mao, he addressed the troops and greeted the crowd while standing in a Red Flag limousine. Later, he watched the procession from a viewing stand overlooking the square with his two predecessors as president, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin.The weapons displayed included China\u2019s growing collection of advanced missiles, among them the \u201cDongfeng-5B, an intercontinental strategic missile designed to carry nuclear warheads, and the Dongfeng-21D antiship ballistic missile,\u201d according to the official Xinhua news agency.The new troop cuts are likely to be part of a broad restructuring of the military that may include new joint command arrangements to better coordinate land, sea, air and other forces, M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the Chinese military, said in an email.\u201cXi would not announce the size of the reduction publicly if a plan for how to achieve the reduction had not already been formulated, so the announcement indicates that reforms are definitely underway,\u201d Professor Fravel said.After the Communist Revolution in 1949, the People\u2019s Liberation Army emerged as both a bulwark against external threats and a domestic guardian of the party\u2019s power. Its numbers have always been heavily weighted toward the land armies stationed across China to maintain domestic control.But in recent decades, China\u2019s leaders have tried to invest more in air and naval forces to project influence abroad and assert the country\u2019s claims to disputed islands and waters. And Mr. Xi has indicated that he wants to accelerate that shift.The Chinese government does not issue regular statistics on its military forces. But experts estimate that the army has about 1.6 million personnel, the navy 240,000 and the air force 400,000. Many of its recruits are youths from the countryside, or just out of high school, lacking the skills that are needed to work well in a modern military equipped with computers.\u201cThe Chinese have come farther than any other military in the last decade,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cBut nobody recognizes the deficiencies of the P.L.A. more than China.\u201dBut with economic growth slowing, dismissing hundreds of thousands of soldiers could add pressure on the government. Decommissioned officers and former soldiers unhappy with their job prospects and welfare have been a persistent source of protests outside government offices.Instead of sending decommissioned officers and soldiers into the civilian work force, Mr. Xi could draw them into domestic security forces, especially the People\u2019s Armed Police, which was founded in the early 1980s from former units of the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\u201cWhat might happen is just a reshuffle,\u201d said Mr. Scobell, the expert at RAND. \u201cThe bulk of that may be transferred to another paramilitary force, whether as border guards or elements of the People\u2019s Armed Police.\u201dUnlike his recent predecessors, Mr. Xi had some experience in the military before his elevation to the leadership. He started his rise through the party as an aide to the minister of defense for several years starting in 1979, when China was smarting from a brief but disastrous war with Vietnam.He has often visited military units to rub shoulders with soldiers and to push the military to embrace change while praising it as a stronghold of party power. In disputes with Japan, Vietnam and other neighbors over rival maritime claims, Mr. Xi has also signaled that his government will back its demands with force.\u201cThey know that if they have to win any war, it must be a high-tech war,\u201d said Che-Po Chan, an assistant professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \u201cIt must be an advanced strategy now; it can\u2019t be a so-called people\u2019s war.\u201dThe government\u2019s efforts to attract more university graduates to the military through higher pay and better conditions have helped lift the educational levels of recruits in recent years, he said. But Mr. Xi faces the challenge of paying for further improvements as the economy is expanding at its slowest pace in a quarter-century.\u201cTo support their high-tech strategy, they need to have continuous economic development,\u201d Professor Chan said. \u201cThe recent economic challenges might be a problem. But we need more time to judge.\u201dJane Perlez contributed reporting from Beijing, and Javier C. Hern\u00e1ndez from Hong Kong.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For $14.50,\u00a0Afghan Refugees Make a Desperate Bet on a Way Out", "Date": "2015-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKabul JournalKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The winding road to Germany starts on the outskirts of Kabul, at the Ahmad Shah Baba bus depot.This is where some of the youngest and poorest Afghans hoping to migrate to Europe gather each day to leave. If they carry a backpack at all, it is usually slack, with little inside. Some have begun hearing that there is one country eager to have them.\u201cI am trying to go to Germany,\u201d Abdul Javed, 16, said after buying a bus ticket. \u201cHopefully I will pass this test and get there.\u201dHe stood in the depot\u2019s small office, where a red carpet had been thrown over the counter so passengers could rest their elbows as they counted out their cash.Until last year most of the teenagers headed toward Nimruz wanted to go no farther than Iran, to seek work as laborers. But these days, the province is better known as the first stop on the path to Europe.Now some 40 buses depart each day to Nimruz, according to ticket agents from a range of bus companies in Kabul.The Ahmad Shah Baba service is among the most popular, having gained a reputation for fast and reckless driving that can finish the journey in 12 hours.When Rahmatullah thinks of how many people are leaving Afghanistan \u2014 every ticket he sells is a reminder \u2014 he feels wonder and sadness. \u201cThere were never this many people leaving until now,\u201d he said.Many young Afghans feel a gloom settling over their future, as well as their country\u2019s. The Taliban are gaining more territory. The departure of foreign troops and organizations has left behind a shrunken economy. The new government, now almost a year old, has done little that anyone can recall.\u201cSome time ago, we entered into the dark ages,\u201d said Aynullah, who sells bus tickets from a stall along the crowded highway that leads south out of Kabul, toward Kandahar, and then swoops west to Nimruz.Of all the routes to Europe, this is among the worst.Any Afghan who can afford a flight to Turkey will take it and pick up the trail from there, avoiding Iran. The border police in Iran sometimes shoot at Afghans crossing the desert, migrants and Afghan officials said.\u201cThere have been weeks where we have had 44 corpses sent back across the border,\u201d Amir Mohammad Akhundzada, the former governor of Nimruz, said this year. \u201cThe bodies were of people who had been in accidents, or hanged for smuggling, or shot while crossing. We are facing a major crisis.\u201dThe latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.Those who get to Turkey through Iran often join fleeing Syrians and Iraqis heading across the sea to Greece and then up through the Balkans. But most do not make it far beyond the border of Iran, at least not on their first try.The odds of success become clear most days at 5 p.m., when the return buses from Nimruz start to roll into the depot. On a recent afternoon, one of the last passengers to stagger off a bus from Nimruz was 18-year-old Rehanullah, his face sallow from dehydration and hunger. Rehanullah, who like many Afghans uses a single name, had set out from Kabul eight days earlier.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a particular country in mind \u2014 I just wanted to go,\u201d he said.He had grown up in Jalalabad, in Afghanistan\u2019s east, where he worked in a mechanics shop, earning little. The war had touched his family: An older brother was killed three years ago.\u201cI believe Europe will treat us as humans,\u201d he said. But here, \u201cI have nothing in my hand \u2014 nothing.\u201dRehanullah recalled his father\u2019s words to him before he left home: \u201cYes, there is no future here. If you want to go, go.\u201dHe had set out with the equivalent of $65 in the pocket of his blue shalwar kameez, the traditional, loosefitting clothing of Afghanistan. In his backpack, he carried a pair of jeans and a T-shirt he would change into once Afghanistan was far behind him. He never got the chance.In Nimruz, he met a smuggler who agreed to ferry him across the border. An impossible number of people squeezed into a Toyota Corolla, Rehanullah said, explaining that he was one of four in the trunk.The next thing he knew, the car had stopped and other passengers were bleeding. The police had fired on the car, killing two people with him, he said.After a day in jail, he was deported. He made it back to Kabul, only after persuading the bus driver to let him on for free. \u201cI begged the driver for half an hour.\u201dIt is the sort of story that is not unusual to hear as the return buses arrive. But the pessimism of the passengers lingers in the bus depot for only as long as it takes everyone to disperse.The rest of the day, it is as though the people at the bus depot are bound by some communal decision to be optimistic, and they all keep worries to themselves.At the depot\u2019s entrance, a group of young men squatted, discussing the price of a ticket.Sher Mohammad, one of the bus drivers, watched them with a touch of pity. \u201cLook at them,\u201d he said. \u201cAll are 16, 17, 18, 19.\u201d\u201cThey are boys,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said, \u201cand they think they will have a better life \u2014 and their parents encourage them to leave.\u201dRahmatullah, the ticket agent, often sells enough tickets in a day to fill up two, sometimes three buses, each with 57 seats.But soon, he said, he may sell his last ticket and board a bus himself, heading toward Germany, by way of Nimruz.He knows the odds better than anyone, but he makes the equivalent of only $11 a day, not nearly enough to skip Iran by flying to Turkey.\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to go by road, but I can\u2019t afford air travel,\u201d he said. \u201cGod willing, I will go soon.\u201dThe Kabul Journal article on Sept. 14, about young Afghan men who are willing to risk a dangerous western crossing through Iran in hopes of reaching Europe, misstated the location of the Afghan province of Nimruz, which borders Iran, relative to the city of Kandahar. It is west of Kandahar, not east.Mujib Mashal contributed reporting from Nimruz Province, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Publisher Won\u2019t Print Book on Moroccan King After Authors\u2019 Arrest", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A major French publishing house has decided not to publish a book critical of King Mohammed VI of Morocco after its two authors were arrested last week in Paris and charged with blackmail and extortion on accusations they demanded 2 million euros, or about $2.3 million, to keep the book unpublished.Lawyers on both sides are now fighting a media battle to paint the authors either as devious journalists interested only in leveraging their work to make money or as respected but fallible professionals who fell into a financially tempting trap laid before them by the Moroccan leadership.The \u00c9ditions du Seuil publishing house said in a statement on Monday that its \u201crelationship of trust\u201d with the authors, Catherine Graciet and Eric Laurent, had been \u201cdissolved\u201d and that publication of their book, initially planned for early 2016, could not go ahead.Mr. Laurent has said that he will try to publish the book elsewhere. The two authors were arrested last week during a police sting operation after a meeting with a representative from the Moroccan royalty in a luxury hotel in Paris.The Moroccan authorities had filed a complaint of blackmail after a first meeting between Mr. Laurent and the royal representative, which led to the opening of a formal investigation in Paris.They left the hotel with a cash advance of 40,000 euros, or about $45,000, each, the newspaper reported. The police, who were monitoring the meeting, then swooped in to arrest them.Lawyers for Mr. Laurent and Ms. Graciet confirmed in telephone interviews that their clients had signed the document and received the cash advance, but said that the Journal du Dimanche had published truncated and misleading excerpts from the audio recordings made during the meetings.Both lawyers questioned the legal grounds of the sting operation and said they would try to have the case thrown out.Mr. Laurent and Ms. Graciet are currently free under court supervision and have been barred from speaking with each other. Neither has denied that they accepted a financial transaction.But both assert that it was Mohammed VI\u2019s representative, not them, who first made the offer to pay to keep the book under wraps, rejecting accusations that they were attempting to blackmail the king and describing the deal instead as a \u201ctrap\u201d that they fell into.Mr. Laurent, in a phone interview from his lawyer\u2019s office, said that the idea of paying not to publish had first been put forward by the Moroccan representative, a lawyer named Hicham Naciri, whom he first met in Paris on Aug. 11.The meeting, the first of three, was set up after Mr. Laurent called the king\u2019s office in late July for comment on the two journalists\u2019 reporting. Mr. Laurent said he ended up accepting the deal, mainly for personal reasons \u2014 his wife has cancer, he said.\u201cI was tempted,\u201d Mr. Laurent said. \u201cDo I regret it? Yes, probably. But I\u2019ve been doing this job for over 35 years, I don\u2019t have anything to hide, and I work on the assumption that what was offered to us was a private transaction related to my work.\u201d\u201cI took risks to investigate, to discover a certain number of things, to acquire a certain number of documents,\u201d Mr. Laurent added. \u201cAfter that, it\u2019s my right to publish a book or not to publish a book.\u201dMs. Graciet trod a similarly fine line between journalistic integrity and criminal liability in her defense, acknowledging that the deal was ethically wrong but arguing that it was a private transaction consented to by both parties, and that it broke no laws.\u201cI had a moment of weakness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s human, no? Everyone wonders what one could do with their life with 2 million euros. Try to imagine the situation. And it was to forgo publication of a book, not to kill someone.\u201dStill, the news that Ms. Graciet and Mr. Laurent had consented to pull their book project in exchange for money was all the more shocking in France and Morocco because they had established a reputation in both countries as fierce critics of the Moroccan leadership.In 2012 they published a book that depicted Mohammed VI as a \u201cpredator king\u201d who had carved up Morocco\u2019s economy to increase his personal wealth.Without offering specifics, Mr. Laurent did not deny that he and Ms. Graciet were working on information that was compromising for the king, saying that the book had the potential to \u201crattle\u201d the monarchy. He said Mr. Naciri insisted that they reveal the sources of their reporting for the book, which they refused to do.Lilia Blaise contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Costa Rica", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate20 PhotosA MODERN HOME WITH OCEAN VIEWS IN PLAYA HERMOSA$975,000This contemporary four-bedroom four-bath house sits on a hillside overlooking Playa Hermosa, a small cluster of homes and businesses in the Guanacaste province on the northwest coast of Costa Rica. The house is in Monte Paraiso, a gated development with 37 lots, where 27 homes have been built. Most of the homes sell for $1 million to $2 million, according to local agents. (Home prices in Costa Rica are typically listed in American dollars.)This house was constructed in\u00a02006 by Tom Terry, who has built many homes in the area, said Michael Simons, co-owner of Re/Max Prestige Ocean Properties, the listing agent for the house. The two-story design features stark white walls, floor-to-ceiling windows and travertine floors, covering 4,000 square feet of living area. Most rooms have access to wide terraces, offering panoramic views of the Hermosa Bay and, in the distance, Peninsula Papagayo, a lush 1,400-acre master-planned luxury development anchored by a Four Seasons resort.The main entrance to the home is on the U-shaped second floor, which has two master bedroom suites on either side of a wide hallway. The hall leads to tall windows and a terrace with ocean views. Each master bedroom includes a bathroom and an entrance to a terrace; each master bath features a Jacuzzi tub. A staircase with metal railings leads down to the main living area, an open space that includes the living room and dining room. (The furniture is included in the price.) The kitchen features granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, a pantry and the same large windows found elsewhere in the house. The bottom level includes two more bedrooms with full baths, one with a bathtub and one with a shower. The glass doors in the dining room open to a large wooden deck with an infinity pool featuring water jets with lighting. Stairs off the deck lead to a yoga platform. There is no garage, but there is a carport. The current owners often rent the house for $3,000 to $6,000 a week, depending on the season, Mr. Simons said.The house, which has been on the market for about 18 months, is only a few minutes\u2019 drive down the hill to Playa Hermosa, where there is a smattering of small hotels and restaurants and a wide sandy beach bookended by small mountains. Larger markets and restaurants can be found in neighboring Playas del Coco, about a 10-minute drive, where a Hard Rock Cafe recently opened. Guanacaste is a dry region, with only pockets of the deep jungle that characterizes the south of Costa Rica, but it is popular for fishing, scuba diving and golf. The international airport in Liberia is about a 20-minute drive from Playa Hermosa.\u00a0MARKET OVERVIEWThe real estate market in the Guanacaste region took a dramatic turn in 1995, when the Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s International Airport opened in Liberia. The new airport allowed international visitors to the Guanacaste coast to avoid the five-hour drive on narrow, winding roads from the crowded airport in the capital of San Jos\u00e9.The Liberia airport sparked a wave of construction and second-home sales in Playa Hermosa, with North Americans the biggest group of buyers. Peninsula Papagayo was one of several luxury resort developments that opened in the area, and many more were planned. But the market stalled in 2008, when the economy crashed in the United States, and several announced resort projects were halted. \u201cWe just came to a stop,\u201d Mr. Simons said.Prices didn\u2019t drop as far as in some second-home markets around the world, since most of the homes had been purchased for cash and the owners didn\u2019t need to sell, agents say. But there were few transactions, with most of the activity focused on deals with steep discounts.In the last year the market has \u201ccompletely changed,\u201d says Vladimir Spivak, an agent with Palm Real Estate in Guanacaste. \u201cThe last of the fire sales\u201d is over and the number of homes for sale has shrunk, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s almost nothing left.\u201d At the same time, \u201cthe rental market is very tight,\u201d he said.Most of the sales are less expensive homes, agents say. Seventy-five percent of Mr. Simons\u2019s recent deals have been for those priced below $500,000. \u201cThe luxury market is still not that hot right now, but it is better than it has been,\u201d Mr. Simons said.While home prices have stabilized in recent years, land prices remain far below peak levels, Mr. Spivak says. A half-acre plot that might have sold for $400,000 in 2008 now sells for closer to $150,000, he says.People found it \u201chard to build,\u201d because of the time required, construction costs and Costa Rican bureaucracy, Mr. Spivak said. It has been easier to buy a completed house, leaving a ready supply of unsold lots, he said. Today activity has resumed in the construction market. Two resorts opened in the area in the last two years, including a Hyatt-branded hotel on Peninsula Papagayo, and two more are scheduled to be completed within the next year, agents say.WHO BUYS IN COSTA RICAAmericans dominate the Playa Hermosa market, agents say. While Canadians once made up about 30 percent of buyers, sales to that group have fallen off since the Canadian dollar started to decline in value in 2013, they say. There has also been a shift in why people are buying. Speculators and investors were once the most active buying group, but these days most people are purchasing a home for their personal use, agents say. Some may rent their house to tourists in the short term, but their plan is to eventually use it.While retirees have always liked Playa Hermosa\u2019s sunny weather and wide beach, \u201dwe\u2019re seeing a lot of younger people coming into the market now,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cSome are opening a business and moving to Costa Rica.\u201dBUYING BASICSWhile the system for buying property in Costa Rica is straightforward, international buyers will need patience, local experts say. \u201cIn Costa Rica, everything takes longer,\u201d said Hern\u00e1n Cordero, a partner in Cordero & Cordero Abogados, a law firm with offices in Liberia.Typically, after a buyer signs an option to purchase a property, there is a 30-day period of due diligence. Buyers place a refundable deposit, usually from 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price, in an escrow account. \u201cYou have to use a legal escrow service, registered and insured,\u201d Mr. Spivak said, adding that buyers should never send deposit money directly to a lawyer or third party. A central national property registry tracks all property, including information on the owners, liens and other issues that might have an impact on the property. \u201cIt gives a lot of security, in terms of who the owner is,\u201d Mr. Cordero said.A licensed notary is the key person in any property transaction. In Costa Rica, all notaries are attorneys; but not all attorneys are notaries. Prospective buyers \u201creally should get a good lawyer,\u201d Mr. Spivak said. \u201cAlthough it is a pretty good system, you have to check things.\u201dIn addition to confirming the ownership of the property and checking for liens, buyers should make sure the property has all the correct permits for building on the land and for utility services, Mr. Cordero said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take for granted the property has all the permits for services,\u201d he said.It\u2019s also advisable to hire an inspector to make sure the property is not damaged and is compliant with local standards, agents say. \u201cDon\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d Mr. Cordero said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSpanish; col\u00f3n (1 col\u00f3n = $0.0019), with the United States dollar widely accepted.TAXES AND FEESThe notary fee to register the property is usually about 1.25 percent of the purchase price. Additional fees and taxes may add another 2 percent, depending on the price. Buyers and sellers often split the expense of some fees.Property tax is 0.25 percent of either the registered value or the appraised value, whichever is higher, Mr. Cordero said. There is no capital gains tax on private transactions in Costa Rica.North Americans should obtain a good tax lawyer in their home country to ensure they are aware of all the tax implications of buying property, Mr. Cordero said. Buyers may face extra taxes in their homelands, including income or capital gains taxes, depending on how the purchase is structured. Some buyers use Costa Rican corporations or limited liability entities to buy property. CONTACTMore Articles in the SeriesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Labor Day Drivers, Lowest Gasoline Prices in 11 Years", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith oil prices diving by more than 50 percent since last summer, the low prices are no surprise, analysts say. But the numbers can be startling to any driver who habitually glances at the gasoline price billboards along the highway.On Friday, the national average for regular gasoline was $2.42 a gallon, 9 cents lower than only a week ago and $1.01 lower than last year, according to the AAA motor club.\u201cConsumers will feel a lot better at the pump this holiday than they will looking at their 401(k)\u2019s,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.All told, Mr. Kloza estimated that Thursday through Monday, Americans would spend $3.9 billion on fuel, down from $5.5 billion during the holiday weekend in 2014 and 2013. Behind the low gasoline prices are widespread fears that the global economy is slowing, along with a resilient expansion of domestic oil production. The prices represent an astonishing reversal from recent years, when motorists complained bitterly about gas expenses.An estimated 8,250 gas stations in 24 states \u2014 representing more than 5 percent of the nation\u2019s stations \u2014 now have prices below $2 a gallon. Not a single station in the country sold gas at that price last Labor Day weekend, specialists say.\u201cAverage U.S. gas prices are falling at the fastest rates since December,\u201d said Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA, referring to the month after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shocked oil traders by refusing to cut production and allowing crude prices to collapse.Several AAA clubs project that 35.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more over the weekend, the highest volume since 2008 and a 1 percent increase from last year. The AAA clubs say 86 percent of the travelers will drive.Cheap gasoline is encouraging motorists to drive more. The Federal Highway Administration has reported that the mileage driven in the first half of the year was the highest since 2008, before the recession. In July, drivers traveled 266.8 billion miles, a 1.5 percent increase from last year, when prices exceeded $100 a barrel and gasoline prices were roughly a dollar a gallon higher.Today, global oil benchmark prices are hovering around $45 to $50 a barrel, although in recent days they have been on a particularly wild ride, jumping or falling 5 percent or more, sometimes within hours.Last summer, oil and gasoline prices jumped as turmoil rocked the Middle East. But Iraq kept pumping and exporting, as have Saudi Arabia and other gulf states. Meanwhile production in the United States has remained high as producers have become more efficient.And after the recent nuclear deal, the prospect of Iran exporting large amounts of oil again has worried traders and energy executives that a glut could last years.But drivers have not saved as much this summer as they might have expected.Typically, according to AAA, gas prices drop 2.4 cents a gallon for every $1 a barrel drop in crude price. But this summer the savings have been less than 2 cents a gallon largely because of refinery mishaps. An explosion in February at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Torrance, Calif., was so severe the plant is still not operating at full capacity.And last month, BP\u2019s refinery in Whiting, Ind., the largest in the Midwest, was forced to shut down its biggest crude distillation unit for several days because of leaky pipes. That sent gasoline prices soaring across the Great Lakes region, and some energy specialists warned that high prices could last more than a month.But technicians fixed the problem sooner than expected, and the national average for a regular gallon of gasoline has dropped every day for more than two weeks, in time for the holiday weekend.Prices are bound to decline more as the busy summer driving season ends and refineries process cheaper winter blends. \u201cSeptember looks like another month that consumers will save about $60 at the pump versus last year,\u201d Mr. Kloza said. He estimated that the average driver puts 60 gallons a month into his or her gas tank.The Energy Department recently predicted that the average national price for regular gasoline would decline to $2.11 in the fourth quarter, contributing to an annual average of $2.41 for 2015. That is roughly a dollar lower than last year.The one wild card for prices is, as always, the price of crude oil, which can jump in the event of a crisis in the Middle East. But at the moment, commodity traders are more fearful of a decline in global demand mostly because of the slower economic growth in China.\u201cA slowdown in China means more than just a slowdown in Chinese oil demand,\u201d according to a Barclays report on Friday. \u201cChina\u2019s industrial activity and global links, the energy intensity of its commodity imports, and even the oil used to get these goods to the country will all stumble if China does.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Fix,\u2019 a Ribald Musical About Political Showmanship", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBlending Caligula and the Kennedys, \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cThe Fix\u201d introduces Cal Chandler, a troubled innocent who is pushed into the family business of trying to become president of the United States. Rising quickly and falling hard, his journey raises the question of why anyone seeks public office and what it can take to win. In his case, sex, drugs and murder are part of the plan. While the current race for the White House is full of recycled surnames, \u201cThe Fix\u201d is a comeback story in own right. The musical had its debut in London in 1997, when it earned less-than-enthusiastic reviews. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Fix\u2019 lacks wit, imagination and plausibility,\u201d The Times of London wrote. The Telegraph said, \u201cNo amount of fixing is going to fix \u2018The Fix.\u2019\u00a0\u201d With the real world of politics having grown ever more theatrical over the last 18 years, the creators of \u201cThe Fix\u201d felt the musical had become all the more relevant. \u201cPeople are more intrigued about it than ever before,\u201d said Mr. Schaeffer, who is directing the show. \u201cIt\u2019s such a black comedy, and while it\u2019s really funny, it\u2019s also really truthful.\u201dSet in the 1960s, \u201cThe Fix\u201d opens with a tryst between the fictional Senator Reed Chandler and his mistress. His presidential hopes are extinguished when he fatally collapses in the moment, but his widow, Violet, does not mourn for long. She colludes with his crippled brother, Grahame, to turn her son, Cal, a despondent couch-dweller, into presidential timber. Infused with a platform of simple themes \u2014 \u201cthe economy, crime, taxes!\u201d \u2014 and an arranged marriage to the perfect blond political wife, Cal ascends to the City Council and then the governor\u2019s mansion. His poll numbers incongruously rise as he becomes more and more erratic, but his inner demons ultimately prevail, landing him in love with an ex-stripper and hooked on heroin. While the first incarnation of \u201cThe Fix\u201d was staged at the Signature in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton scandal, the latest one comes at a time when dynastic power is prominently on display and policy issues seem to be taking a back seat to showmanship. \u201cWe\u2019re watching entertainment and politics become so entwined through Donald Trump,\u201d said John Dempsey, who wrote the book and the lyrics. (Dana P. Rowe wrote the rock-inflected score.) \u201cHe is pure show business.\u201d Still, Mr. Dempsey said he tinkered with the dialogue to set a slightly less caustic tone. The final scene also got a tweak, giving Violet a chance to quench her thirst for power. Is politics really as ugly as \u201cThe Fix\u201d makes it look? Russ Schriefer, a veteran political strategist who has worked with Republican candidates such as Mitt Romney and Chris Christie, calls \u201cThe Fix\u201d a caricature of politicians at their worst. \u201cI think it takes today\u2019s politics and it puts it under a glass that expands the satire, expands on the craziness,\u201d he said.Mary Hughes Hynes, chairwoman of the Arlington County Board, attended a performance after seeing the yard signs pop up in her neighborhood. She said that she could relate to the taxing nature of political work and that she, too, had needed to simplify her message and polish her image when she first ran for the county board. That\u2019s where the similarities end for her. \u201cThe vast majority of people I know in local office are motivated by wanting to make their community better,\u201d she said. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Replaces China as Next Big Frontier for U.S. Tech Companies", "Date": "2015-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosBANGALORE, India \u2014 American technology companies desperately want to win over people like Rakesh Padachuri and his family.The Padachuri family\u2019s love of technology helps explain why India and its 1.25 billion residents have become the hottest growth opportunity \u2014 the new China \u2014 for American Internet companies. Blocked from China itself or frustrated by the onerous demands of its government, companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as start-ups and investors, see India as the next best thing.\u201cThey are looking at India, and they are thinking, \u2018Five years ago, it was China, and I probably missed the boat there. Now I have a chance to actually do this,\u2019\u201d said Punit Soni, a former Google executive who was lured back to India recently to become the chief product officer of Flipkart, a Bangalore e-commerce start-up similar to Amazon.The increasing appeal of India, now the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, was underscored in recent days.India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the other hand, was on a charm offensive during his own American tour.After a stop in New York City, he headed to Silicon Valley, where he visited Tesla and attended a dinner with tech chieftains like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google.\u201dFor India to keep making progress, it needs to be a leader online,\u201d Mr. Modi said during the Facebook event. He acknowledged that tech companies like Facebook were not connecting people out of pure altruism, but he told Mr. Zuckerberg, \u201cI hope this will not just be something to enhance your company\u2019s bank balance.\u201dTwo years ago, India\u2019s rise as a digital nation was hard to imagine. Internet penetration was modest, mobile phone networks were glacially slow, and smartphones were a blip in a sea of basic phones.Since 2013, however, the number of smartphone users in India has ballooned and will reach 168 million this year, the research firm eMarketer predicts, with 277 million Internet users in India expected over all.India already conducts more mobile searches on Google than any country besides the United States. Yet \u201cwe are barely scratching the surface of availability of Internet to the masses,\u201d said Amit Singhal, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of search, who emigrated from India to the United States 25 years ago.Indians have long loved to connect with one another online, accounting for much of the growth of early social networks like Friendster. So it\u2019s not surprising that Facebook already has 132 million Indian users, trailing only the United States.But Facebook\u2019s presence in India runs even deeper. WhatsApp, the messaging service that Facebook bought last year for nearly $22 billion, has become the most popular app in the country, offering free texting and free phone calls in a place where many people earn just a few dollars a day. Facebook\u2019s Messenger app is No. 2, according to the analytics firm App Annie.And that only touches on Facebook\u2019s ambitions in India. \u201cWe need to focus on the billion people who are not connected,\u201d said Kevin D\u2019Souza, head of growth and mobile partnerships for Facebook India.India still poses many challenges. Internet.org has come under fire from regulators and activists who are concerned that Facebook is favoring its own services. And despite Mr. Modi\u2019s outreach, government agencies are trying to censor content they consider unfavorable or offensive. Last year, Facebook received 10,792 requests from the Indian government to remove information, far more than from any other country.Making money is also difficult in India, where the amount spent on digital advertising is expected to total about $940 million this year, according to eMarketer \u2014 a fraction of the $58 billion that is expected to be spent in the United States.While revenue is tiny so far, Internet companies say they are playing the long game, focusing on getting more people online now and profiting later.Google, for example, wants 500 million Indians online by 2017. Most of these newcomers will be using phones powered by Google\u2019s Android operating system, which accounts for most of the Indian smartphone market. That will let Google expose these users to its other services, like search and YouTube, as well as plenty of ads.\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that what\u2019s good for the Internet is good for Google,\u201d Sandeep Menon, Google\u2019s head of marketing in India, said in an interview at the company\u2019s offices in Gurgaon, outside New Delhi.The effort to get more Indians online, however, has forced tech companies to re-examine some fundamental assumptions.Only one in six Indians knows enough English to surf the web in the language. But there are few web pages in Hindi or India\u2019s 21 other official languages. \u201cThere are more web pages in Estonian than in Hindi,\u201d Mr. Menon said.Google, Facebook and Twitter have all added support for more Indian languages and are prodding developers and users to create more local-language content.To deal with India\u2019s poor mobile data connections, which can run at a hundredth of the speed that Americans expect, Google is compressing web pages on its servers so that they use 80 percent less data and load four times as fast.Similarly, Indians can download YouTube videos while they have a high-speed connection, such as Wi-Fi at school or work, and save them to watch later when they are offline.Of course, none of this matters to those who have never used the Internet. To reach them, Google has formed a partnership with Intel and a local charity to send female tutors, who travel by bicycle, to thousands of villages to teach rural women about the Internet. So far, 200 bikes equipped with solar-powered tablets and smartphones are on the road, and Google hopes to increase that number to 10,000.The immaturity of India\u2019s Internet market allows companies like Twitter, which has just 20 million users in the country, to treat it as a laboratory.\u201cIf you are starting from a clean slate, what should Twitter look like?\u201d asked Valerie Wagoner, Twitter\u2019s senior director for growth, who joined the company after it acquired her India-based start-up, ZipDial.Hundreds of millions of Indians still use basic phones that cannot run apps, but they can receive text messages free. Using technology pioneered by ZipDial, Twitter allows people to view the tweets of cricket stars, politicians or brands by calling a special phone number, then immediately hanging up. The subsequent tweets are delivered as texts. In March, Twitter joined with the government to allow anyone with a cellphone that is capable of receiving texts to get tweets from Mr. Modi and a dozen other officials and ministries this way.Last month, Twitter began testing a new idea in India \u2014 a tab of tweets made up entirely of news stories. The idea is to reposition Twitter as a real-time news service, instead of a collection of random items from random accounts.Twitter hopes such experiments will help it figure out how to educate newcomers globally about the value of its service, said Amiya Pathak, a founder of ZipDial and a director of product management at Twitter.\u201cThis is a market where we can do tests,\u201d Mr. Pathak said. \u201cProve it out in India first, and as you prove it out, take it to other markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twyla Tharp\u2019s Final Rehearsals: Creating a Company", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtist\u2019s JournalThis photo of the company in our last studio showing for an audience is not a gorgeous one. But it is of interest to me because it traces the dancers through 10 seconds of the fanfare that begins our program. Follow the dancer wearing the blue calf support or the girl with the maroon shirt. You will see the path they cover in 10 seconds. And around them you see the entire group traversing the space in this time. Less than a week from now, on Sept. 18, this passage will announce a new company to the world in Dallas.What makes a company? It is, like a good performance, greater than the sum of its parts. It brings together a wealth of experiences and commitments that create a single foundation. Tacitly expressed in the dancing is a guarantee to the audience that whatever goes down, there\u2019s no need for panic because onstage we have your back. It is a group that is solid, with history and a shared mandate. Recently we have heard from viewers invited to the studio to watch run throughs, \u201cIt is beginning to feel like a company.\u201d This is a very good thing and reflects a year and a half of work.Creating a company also takes input from me beyond the usual job profile of choreographer. These last weeks I have delivered no new steps \u2014 no one has time for that now \u2014 and I have shifted over to other company duties. Now, I\u2019m the director, producer, rehearsal assistant and community outreach supervisor, making sure, even, that studio guests are well greeted when they arrive for a showing.As director, I continue giving notes to the performers after run throughs and studio showings, reminding them of the works\u2019 original intention when they stray into mannerisms, but also watching for valuable new options in the dancers\u2019 delivery as they become more familiar with their material. In Dallas, and under lights and in costumes and makeup, the dancers\u2019 energies will have to be adjusted once again to address the distancing effect that putting a dance onstage has on its audience.As producer I follow the preparations in wardrobe, scenics, sound and lighting, all the things that we hope will make a world beyond the studio. As rehearsal assistant, I monitor the dancers\u2019 physical well-being and schedule rehearsal time for our male alternate, Eric Otto. The women are covering all the roles from the inside. Every dancer has made a pledge not to go down during this tour, for injury is one of the biggest challenges we face on the road. The tour is a long one and as our budget requires careful economies, the discipline required of each dancer is great. Every one of us is solely responsible for his or her own well-being. It\u2019s as though LeBron James had to play his games without the support staff and traveling coach.I am also, these days, my own trainer, because I can\u2019t afford the time to go across town to the gym where I have worked with the same trainer, Sean Kelleher, for more than 20 years. I still work myself at least an hour and at best 90 minutes daily, first thing in the morning. I have a small studio space in my house, a postage stamp, I think of it, and here every day I try to speak with my body: crunches, push-ups, tendus, a few battements. Today I have a cranky shoulder left over from yesterday because I have been determined to fold a free-standing handstand into my routine. But a handstand does not really substitute for a half-hour of weight training.And then there is writing this blog, which reflects my continuing concern to help people understand exactly what it is I do and why dance is important, very important \u2014 to them and as an art in our culture. Human movement is the basis of all art. No movement? Then no writing, no music, no painting. So why is dance at the bottom of the heap? Get with the program, I say.Nonetheless, the blog takes its bite out of my day for I struggle with the abstract and the concrete, with what to include and what to delete. But look at it this way \u2014 my dances have absorbed millions of words. And they are silent. So any language I eke out is against my better judgment. Of course much of my thinking is in images and, yes, every picture for me holds thousands of fairly arbitrary adjectives and adverbs. Which brings me to photography, where I find a truth that language must work hard to approach.Richard Avedon was a very good friend for a very long time. He contributed enormous support to my company with over 20 sessions for publicity and posterity that he underwrote. One time I asked him where I could get a camera and he sent me to B & H. Much to his consternation, I came back with a beautiful Hasselblad \u2014 serious overkill, Dick thought, for my level of accomplishment \u2014 and a Polaroid. Nonetheless, I loved pasting together the Polaroids I got into long strings of frozen time, space and movement. Now the cellphone makes it possible for me to create many rooms and time zones in one panorama shot. But while I don\u2019t expect to be challenging Dick\u2019s Rolleiflex images any time soon, it is his eye that guided the creation of our tour\u2019s iconic image.

{"Headline": "With King in Declining Health, Future of Monarchy in Thailand Is Uncertain", "Date": "2015-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile reverence for the king was once the only thing that this fractured country could agree on, today the future of the Thai monarchy is uncertain.The king\u2019s heir apparent, the jet-setting crown prince, has a reputation as a playboy and faces an uphill battle to win the trust and adoration his father has achieved. Many Thais hoped that Princess Sirindhorn, the crown prince\u2019s sister, who has won hearts through her charitable causes and dealings with the poor, might succeed her father, but palace law bars women from the throne.The law is interpreted broadly, and barely a month goes by without someone being convicted under it and sent to jail for up to 15 years.Still, the Internet churns with anonymous social media commentary and videos deriding the monarchy, and a growing underground republican movement is challenging its very premise.Thailand\u2019s strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws make it a crime to insult the monarchy, an offense that includes a surprising number of activities.\u201cThe current anti-monarchy movement is due to the very fact that the monarchy is now made into almighty god,\u201d said Sulak Sivaraksa, a social activist and scholar who has been charged or arrested five times for his outspokenness about the king. \u201cThe more you make the monarchy sacred, the more it becomes unaccountable and something beyond common sense.\u201dThe support for such views is impossible to gauge. How popular is Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, who has divorced or separated from three wives and in recent years spent half of his time in Europe? No one knows, because you cannot have a poll on the subject. Would Thais prefer some other system? Other than anonymous Internet posts and expatriate critics, it is not up for discussion.Even efforts to talk about having such a conversation have been quickly shot down or retracted. In 2010, Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya, speaking at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said that Thais should discuss the \u201ctaboo subject.\u201d\u201cI think we have to talk about the institution of the monarchy,\u201d he said. \u201cHow it would have to reform itself to the modern globalized world. Like what the British or the Dutch or the Danish or the Liechtenstein monarchy has gone through to adjust itself to the modern world.\u201dOne way to assay the strength of the anti-monarchy movement might be by sizing up the military government\u2019s efforts to counter it. The junta, which claims legitimacy from the king\u2019s blessing, has positioned itself as the institution\u2019s ultimate defender.The ruling generals have been aggressive in jailing critics of the monarchy and this year alone are spending $540 million, more than the entire budget for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on a promotional campaign called \u201cWorship, protect and uphold the monarchy.\u201dThe campaign includes television commercials, seminars in schools and prisons, singing contests and competitions to write novels and make short films praising the king. The military also erected giant statues of past kings in the seaside town of Hua Hin, but said they were financed by private donations.\u201cThis is not propaganda,\u201d Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the junta, said several months after seizing power last year. The youth, he said, \u201cmust be educated on what the king has done.\u201dIn recent months the military has also appeared eager to burnish the reputation of the crown prince. Last month, Mr. Prayuth spent hours with the crown prince touring Bangkok by bicycle in a nationally televised event honoring Queen Sirikit, who is also in failing health.Mr. Kasit, the former foreign minister, said the bicycle tour was a \u201cturning point\u201d for the prince.\u201cThere are no more doubts inside the military establishment as to who will be the next monarch of Thailand,\u201d Mr. Kasit said.The military\u2019s backing of the prince, indeed its alliance with the monarchy, is seen as mutually beneficial. The king is the head of the Thai armed forces and must endorse all new governments and major appointments. Critics say the military and Bangkok establishment are leveraging the king\u2019s power to bolster their own.The absolute monarchy was abolished in Thailand in 1932. But King Bhumibol is treated like a demigod, and since he ascended the throne in 1946 the monarchy has grown into a bastion of prestige and wealth.Those who regard it as atavistic need not look far for potent symbols. In rituals that seem to hark from a different era, Thais humbly crawl or kneel before the king, a tradition abolished in the 19th century and resurrected during Bhumibol\u2019s reign. His subjects refer to themselves as \u201cthe dust under your feet.\u201dAlthough rarely seen in public because of his age and illness, he is everywhere. His portraits hang from the facades of government buildings, crown the entrance to airports and are de rigueur in offices and schools.The republican movement was precipitated in part by the rise of Thaksin Shinawatra, a business tycoon turned populist politician whose influence and popularity in rural areas were seen as threats to the royal establishment and Bangkok\u2019s urban elite.The royal succession presents the monarchy with an inflection point, and possibly an opportunity.\u201cThe situation of the Thai monarchy will not remain like this for many more years,\u201d Somsak Jeamteerasakul, one of the leading experts on the monarchy, wrote in a Facebook post last December. \u201cThere are two options for the future. Either transform to a modern monarchy like in Europe or Japan or don\u2019t change and become definitively demolished (a republic). There is no third choice.\u201dSome Thais cite the wisdom of a venerated 19th-century king, Chulalongkorn, who wrote an open letter to his son outlining the requirements for a monarch.Be humble and avoid vengefulness, he advised. \u201cBeing a king means not to be wealthy. It means not bullying others.\u201dFailure to follow this advice, he said, might lead \u201cour clan to disappear.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "VW\u2019s Recall Troubles May Have Little Effect on China, Its Largest Market", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is Volkswagen\u2019s single-largest market, and the company vies with General Motors as the country\u2019s biggest automaker. But Volkswagen\u2019s diesel scandal is unlikely to have many repercussions in China.That is because Volkswagen sells almost no diesel cars in China \u2014 fewer than 1,000 of the three million or so the company sells each year in the country, where gasoline engines reign.It is not for lack of trying on Volkswagen\u2019s part.The company, hoping to replicate its success elsewhere as a diesel leader, lobbied Beijing for the better part of a decade to let it build diesel-powered cars in China. But regulators in China, which imports more than half of its oil, have repeatedly rebuffed those pleas \u2014 partly over environmental concerns and partly because the government has preferred to reserve relatively scarce diesel fuel for trucks and farm tractors.As a result, the only diesel-powered cars Volkswagen sells in China are imported from Europe and are sold mainly to taxi fleets.The environmental concerns have been raised by Chinese regulators who were in frequent contact with American experts, notably at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit research group. The council is the same group that documented the performance shortfalls of Volkswagen diesels in the United States and brought the matter to the Environmental Protection Agency.American researchers have long been more worried than European experts that diesel emissions might be carcinogenic. In addition, diesel exhaust tends to have more particulates than gasoline engine emissions. Particulates are a big health concern in dusty northern China, and they add to the notoriously bad air pollution in Beijing itself.Making matters worse is that, until fairly recently, many Chinese refineries lacked the technology to remove much of the naturally occurring sulfur contaminants when they produced diesel from crude oil. The resulting high pollution when diesel was burned as truck fuel made regulators wary of allowing the nation\u2019s fast-growing car fleet to burn diesel as well.Another predicament in China for Volkswagen involves Chinese consumers. The car-buying public has long been skeptical of diesels, associating them with tractors and viewing them as unsophisticated. Company executives had long expressed confidence, though, that they could change these perceptions with an energetic advertising and public relations effort \u2014 if only they could win permission to mass-produce diesels in China.Diesels have long offered a trade off \u2014 higher air pollution, even with cleanly refined diesel, but also better fuel economy. Europe is a market that highly prizes fuel economy, with some of the world\u2019s most stringent gas mileage standards. China and the United States have somewhat less stringent mileage standards, although they can still be hard for automakers to meet if they produce a lot of big cars and sport utility vehicles. As a European automaker, Volkswagen developed a lot of expertise in building fuel-efficient diesels and started its Chinese diesel lobbying efforts around 2000.Since 2008 or so, though, Volkswagen executives have pushed less hard for Chinese diesels. That may be because they began manufacturing expensive but fuel-efficient models of gasoline engines in China. This enabled the company to meet Chinese fuel-economy standards without needing to resort to diesel engines.And those three million cars a year it sells in China indicate that the company is still finding buyers, even with the more expensive engines.\u201cAfter 2008, they did not have a strong motive to promote diesel,\u201d said Yale Zhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting firm.Advertisement"}

And of immediate concern is the continuous threat posed by hackers based in China.As the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, China\u2019s fast-growing market is very attractive to foreign companies. But doing business in China means agreeing to onerous conditions imposed by Beijing \u2014 like operating through joint ventures with Chinese partners and transferring technology to those local partners.But if the Xi government continues to put up roadblocks to foreign companies, China cannot expect the rest of the world to open its doors to more investment without reciprocity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanctions Debate Emerges From Shadow of Iran Nuclear Accord", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany lawmakers have indicated they would like to go further, and they are considering legislative proposals that include renewing the current sanctions against foreign companies that invest in Iran\u2019s energy industry. Mr. Obama would waive them as long as Iran complied with the nuclear accord, but these sets of actions would be a signal that Iran is not to be trusted and that sanctions could be restored rapidly.The first sanctions are to be lifted after Iran reduces the size of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium and meets other requirements, a process many American experts say could take at least six months \u2014 although the Iranians insist they can do it much sooner.\u201cThere is a tension between ensuring that Iran has an economic incentive to keep the agreement with its nuclear constraints and ensuring companies keep doing business with Iran, while at the same time policing Iran\u2019s support for terrorism with sanctions,\u201d said Richard Nephew, who worked on Iran sanctions issues for the Obama administration and is now a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.At the Treasury Department, much of the promised sanctions relief would be facilitated by withdrawing the threat that foreign companies and banks doing business with Iran would be subject to a range of punishments that would restrict their business in the United States \u2014 what the department calls \u201csecondary sanctions.\u201dWhen it comes to American sanctions relief under the accord, \u201cit almost entirely concerns transactions between non-U.S. companies, non-U.S. banks and Iran,\u201d Adam J. Szubin, the acting Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial crimes, said in an interview. \u201cIt is the U.S. sanctions targeting the conduct of foreign companies that are due to be relieved under the deal.\u201dEven after the nuclear accord takes hold, Iran will be blocked from business with the United States because of a longstanding American trade embargo, as well as terrorism and human rights sanctions \u2014 all of which will remain in force. The exceptions include the export of passenger planes and aircraft parts to Iran, and the import of Iranian carpets, pistachios and caviar.The talk of imposing new sanctions has not gone unnoticed in Tehran. In July, the Iranian government warned in a statement that if the West pushed too hard, then the deal, or least some elements of it, could be off.Still, the agreement would give Iran access to the banking system outside the United States as well as to foreign companies and markets, both to give Iranians an incentive to honor the accord and, proponents of the deal hope, to strengthen the hand of President Hassan Rouhani and other moderates who have promised economic and political change.For example, of the nearly 690 Iranian banks and companies the Treasury Department put on its sanctions list because of links to Iran\u2019s nuclear or missile programs, nearly two-thirds will be removed on \u201cImplementation Day,\u201d when the agreement goes into effect. An additional 43 Iranian individuals and entities would be removed eight years after the accord takes effect.The agreement will allow foreign subsidiaries of American companies to do business with firms that are taken off the sanctions list. But they will require a license from the Treasury Department, which will define the scope of the permitted activity \u2014 and the American parent company cannot in any way support this activity.\u201cIf you are really talking about a small U.S. subsidiary, that last point ends up being prohibitive,\u201d Mr. Szubin, the Treasury official, said. \u201cThe companies that will be able to operate under the provision are likely to be the larger multinational firms that have large subsidiaries in Asia, Africa or the Middle East. That is, subsidiaries that can independently generate and support trade with Iran.\u201dNavigating a path through the remaining sanctions will not be easy, however, and some legal experts said erecting a firewall high enough to separate even a large subsidiary from its parent company may be challenging.Given the hold the Revolutionary Guards have on crucial sectors of Iran\u2019s economy, including construction, banking and energy, some experts say the sanctions relief may strengthen their hold \u2014 unless the Iranian economy is overhauled. Given the complexity of the sanctions, others wonder if Iran will realize all the economic benefits it is counting on. The Revolutionary Guards are likely to keep establishing front companies, prompting a cat-and-mouse game between Iran and the Treasury Department.\u201cForeign companies conducting business in Iran after sanctions relief begins will need to carefully navigate those sanctions that endure, including the reality that dealings with Iranian actors that remain designated could still invoke U.S. secondary sanctions,\u201d said Eytan J. Fisch, a former Treasury Department official who represented the agency in the Iran talks and is now at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Adding to the complexity, the United States and the European Union have maintained separate lists of sanctioned entities. Khatam al-Anbiya, the largest construction firm in Iran and a source of revenue for the Revolutionary Guards, would come off the European Union\u2019s sanctions list after eight years. But it would remain on the American list indefinitely, and any European company that did business with it could be subject to a range of secondary sanctions.Experts wonder how severely a future administration might punish a European company that did business with an Iranian firm that had been removed from the European Union\u2019s list or carried out transactions with a subsidiary that was not specifically sanctioned by the Treasury Department.\u201cAn additional challenge for companies everywhere in the world that have operations in both the United States and Europe will be the divergent sanctions regulations concerning Iran come Implementation Day,\u201d said Adam M. Smith, a former Treasury and White House official who worked on sanctions and is now at the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. \u201cFirms will need to assess how to comply with two different \u2014 and potentially conflicting \u2014 sets of requirements.\u201dEven as the accord moves forward, Mark Dubowitz, an Iran sanctions expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which opposes the nuclear accord, said that lawmakers would most likely push for a tougher stance, including some legislators who support the agreement but want to hedge their bets. One idea is to designate the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization and thus discourage business with the hundreds of companies in which the Guards are believed to have a minority stake or over which they have influence through board membership or through their role as key executives.\u201cIt is not enough to merely target the Quds Force, which is controlled by the Revolutionary Guards, for its terrorist activities. The designations of the Guards would create a whole new dimension of reputational and legal risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would result in a powerful deterrent for international banks and companies contemplating doing business with the most dangerous element of the regime.\u201dSome Obama administration officials view that effort as a thinly disguised move to throw a monkey wrench into the agreement and insist the Treasury Department is prepared to be vigilant about curbing Iran\u2019s nonnuclear muscle flexing without the extra help from Congress.Mr. Szubin said that the administration was determined to crack down on the Quds Force\u2019s financial schemes and was already consulting on new financial targets.\u201cI just got back from Israel, where I talked with their security forces, their intelligence and their military about precisely this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a whole lot we need to be doing jointly to target Hezbollah\u2019s lines of support, the Quds Force\u2019s lines of support \u2014 how they are procuring parts for U.A.V.s, how are they funneling money from their diaspora communities. We have the tools.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Rebuffed by Judge in Ruling on Drivers\u2019 Suit", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal judge granted class-action status on Tuesday to a lawsuit that questions the employment classification of Uber drivers, paving the way for a legal challenge that could strike at the heart of the ride-hailing company\u2019s business model.\u201cThe court concludes that a number of Uber\u2019s class certification arguments are problematic,\u201d Judge Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco wrote in the 68-page ruling. He added that there was \u201csimply no basis\u201d to Uber\u2019s claim \u201cthat some innumerable legion of drivers prefer to remain independent contractors rather than become employees.\u201dThe case, filed in 2013, presents challenges to Uber\u2019s business model. Classifying workers as contractors lets the company keep its labor costs low while recruiting scores of people who use their own cars to ferry passengers around more than 300 cities worldwide. Uber\u2019s rapid growth in just five years has given rise to a new service economy applying a similar contract-worker model across multiple sectors, from house cleaning to grocery delivery.The ruling by Judge Edward M. Chen will allow a jury to decide whether Uber drivers should be considered employees or 1099 contract workers, named after a tax designation, which does not require the company to pay payroll taxes or apply minimum wage and overtime laws to the drivers.While legal experts said the case would not be decided in the near future, a ruling that ultimately goes against Uber could complicate its financial trajectory and have implications for its more than 160,000 drivers. The company, based in San Francisco, has raised upward of $6 billion in private investment and is valued at more than $50 billion by investors, making it the most valuable private venture-backed company since Facebook. Uber\u2019s value has soared as its executives have convinced investors that the company has plenty of room to grow beyond the transportation industry, including food and retail goods delivery.The class-action certification may also set a precedent. Lyft, a competitor to Uber that has also raised venture capital, faces a similar class action.The certification is a prelude to a bigger battle, said Richard J. Reibstein, a partner in the labor and employment practice at the law firm Pepper Hamilton. \u201cThis motion is only a legal skirmish,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real issue is whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees. If they are employees, then Uber will be hard-pressed to deliver profits for its investors.\u201dIn his ruling, the judge certified just a portion of the class that the plaintiffs were seeking, narrowing it to drivers who directly contract with Uber and largely to those who were drivers before June 2014.Uber said that it was pleased the judge certified only a \u201ctiny fraction\u201d of the plaintiffs and that it would probably appeal the ruling. On Tuesday, at least one of Uber\u2019s legal issues pertaining to its drivers and their safety appeared to be resolved when a plaintiff withdrew a lawsuit against the company that asserted that an Uber driver in India raped his passenger.An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the withdrawal of the case. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, who filed as Jane Doe, also declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: The California Lives Up to the Ferrari Name", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenEVEN aristocratic families have a member who, while successful, doesn\u2019t hit the lofty heights the others reach. In Ferrari\u2019s case, it would be the entry-level California. Consider it the college professor of the clan in a dynasty filled with brain surgeons, diplomats and chief executives. Successful in its own right? Sure. But surrounded by overachieving siblings and a legendary lineage including 250 GTOs and F40s, the spotlight eludes it.The 2015 California, now in its third iteration, deserves some illumination. Ferrari kept the aluminum chassis, replaced all of the aluminum body panels (except for the power retractable roof) and bolted in new turbo power. Thus the California T is born. Sounds like an energy drink. Drives like one, too.The T is less of a hard-edge sports car, more of an everyday grand touring machine and Ferrari\u2019s least expensive car, at a base price of just under $200,000. (As tested, mine was $260,000.) Not only is the base car inexpensive for a Ferrari, it\u2019s a practical two plus two. Small children can sit in the rear and experience the top speed of 196. You may regret that teachable moment when they have their licenses. Golfers can order a folding rear seat back to accommodate clubs. And California\u2019s shape is more defined, especially the trimmer-looking rump.T stands for turbo. Each side of the new 3.9-liter V8 engine gets its own twin scroll unit. The 552 horsepower and 557 pound-feet of torque sound orchestral, though bass heavy. The dual-clutch gearbox has seven speeds and a bit of a learning curve. You select drive by pulling the right paddle shifter. Of course. All electronic nannies can be turned off except for the antilock brakes.Ferrari says the California T slays zero to 60 runs in about 3.5 seconds. The T gets an A for bridging comfort and drivability with high performance, courtesy of adaptive Magneride dampers.The engine management system does not allow full torque off the line; it builds as it snaps off taller gears, allowing Ferrari to use higher ratios (and save the rear tires most likely). In top gear, the engine lopes along, screaming to life at the drop of the pedal. The federal government rates fuel economy at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway with premium gasoline.Of the California\u2019s 3,583 pounds, 53 percent rests on the rear drive wheels. Cornering hard in sport mode, the tail kicks out predictably, obediently tucking in with a flick of countersteer. For those worrisome moments, the carbon-ceramic brakes are impressive. And standard.Let\u2019s face it: Exploring the limits of this machine on public roads is unwise, leading some to argue that more affordable cars like the Corvette are a smarter choice. Maybe, but they are not members of the Ferrari dynasty. That means something. The California T now captures the family\u2019s essence much more than it once did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Puerto Rico\u2019s New Plan Means", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plan is likely to open a turbulent new chapter in the island\u2019s efforts to rekindle economic growth and avoid an unprecedented collapse.If I don\u2019t live in Puerto Rico, why should I care about its budget problems?Puerto Rico lies more than 1,000 miles from the coast of Florida, but its fiscal problems could have wide-ranging implications for the United States\u2019 municipal debt market, which cities and states rely on to finance their most basic functions.Puerto Rico\u2019s proposal to restructure much of its $72 billion debt, including its general obligation bonds, is challenging decades of precedent and investor expectations of the municipal bond market. General obligation debt typically carries a government\u2019s highest pledge to repay investors. (In Puerto Rico, the general obligation pledge was considered even more ironclad because the payments are guaranteed by the island\u2019s constitution).With its restructuring proposal, Puerto Rico is demonstrating that when a local government is stretched to the fiscal breaking point, no pledge is sacrosanct.At the moment, the vast majority of cities and states in the United States are in stable fiscal condition and have ready access to the municipal debt market. But if the economy soured and struggling municipalities encountered severe budget problems, investors might reconsider lending them money in light of the way Puerto Rico has treated them.A photographer and writer return to the island to find both resentment and resilience among the middle class.How did Puerto Rico get so deeply in debt? What\u2019s costing so much?For years, the commonwealth borrowed too much money, trying to paper over declining government revenue and prevent deep cuts in services and layoffs of public workers. Puerto Rico easily found lenders willing to extend it more debt.The bonds made for hot investments across the mainland United States because the interest is often \u201ctriple tax-exempt,\u201d meaning the holder does not pay state, federal or city income taxes.But all that debt, which has increased 64 percent since the 2006 fiscal year, couldn\u2019t solve the structural problems in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy: high labor costs and shipping costs, an exodus of educated people to the mainland United States and the expiration of a special federal tax credit meant to attract big corporations to the island and keep them there.Debt payments alone are now threatening to drain the government\u2019s coffers dry. The government projects that by the end of December, the Government Development Bank, which acts as the island\u2019s fiscal agent, will have run out of cash. In the past, the government would simply have borrowed more money to pay off the debt coming due. But in order to borrow in the bond market today, the government would need to pay very high interest rates, which would only exacerbate its cash problems.What are the most significant steps the island is taking to get out of the fix it\u2019s in?Puerto Rico has taken a number of aggressive steps trying to control costs. The government has reduced its work force by 27 percent since 2008, increased taxes on an island population that is already struggling economically, and required government workers to pay significantly more toward their pensions.As part of an economic stimulus, the government has floated some fairly typical ideas like more tax incentives for business. But it is also proposing unusual ideas like a federal exemption from future minimum wage increases for persons 25 or younger in order to entice local businesses to do more hiring. Of course, the most controversial measure among bond investors is a call to restructure $47 billion of the island\u2019s $72 billion of debt. As part of that plan, the government is asking creditors to exchange their existing bonds voluntarily for new debt with more favorable terms to Puerto Rico.How is Puerto Rico like Greece?The two places have little in common when it comes to the way their fiscal problems are likely to play out.Greece\u2019s financial crisis poses a serious threat to Europe. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have lent the country hundreds of billions of euros. And the prospect that Greece may exit the eurozone has persistently threatened to destabilize Europe\u2019s economy and the euro currency, driving down global stock markets and sending world leaders scrambling for a solution.Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal problems, while painful to the island\u2019s 3.5 million residents, do not threaten to spill over as broadly. Even as Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds have lost value after the restructuring was announced , the larger United States municipal debt market has barely flinched, allowing cities and states on the mainland to keep borrowing. That stability may explain why the federal government, despite providing some technical support and advice to officials in Puerto Rico, has largely stayed on the sidelines of the island\u2019s debt crisis.Another big difference is in the comparative safety nets for these economies. Despite some cutbacks, the United States government continues to pump tens of billions of dollars into Puerto Rico to support health care, subsidized housing and policing. Puerto Rico\u2019s banks are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation plays an outsize role in local law-enforcement duties.It\u2019s a United States territory and a commonwealth. Doesn\u2019t that mean the federal government should help in some way? Puerto Rico\u2019s relationship with the United States is complicated. The question of whether the island should become a state, remain a territory or break away into an independent nation has dominated the political discussion for decades. The fiscal crisis has brought that debate into sharp relief.Many investors have called for the federal government essentially to take over Puerto Rico\u2019s financial affairs to prevent a catastrophe (and protect their bond investments). But on the island, there is great reluctance to give the federal government too much power and sway over its affairs. The island \u2019s working group, however, has come up with a list of measures that the federal government can take to ease some of the pressure, including raising Medicaid reimbursements and exempting the island from the Jones Act, a law that increases shipping costs by requiring that all ships transporting goods between United States ports be built, sailed and serviced by American crews.While the Obama administration and a smattering of members of Congress have professed support for a law that would give Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy, the federal government cannot be seen as bailing out the island. For one, this could create moral hazard, with other struggling states and cities expecting that Washington might also backstop their obligations.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Making of Home,\u2019 by Judith Flanders", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.There\u2019s no place like home, as Dorothy told Toto somewhere between Oz and Kansas. Home is where the heart is, and that\u2019s where the trouble starts. \u201cHome\u201d is what we think we know best already, wherever and however we live. It\u2019s the most intimate of subjects, involving privacy, comfort, childhood memories, somewhere clean and protected from the street and modern times, a woman\u2019s own place. (Or so men insisted, thoughtfully providing \u00adlabor-saving devices that made housework even more difficult for middle-class women who took on work once done by servants or other women in other houses.)The history of the home mixes basic and sometimes elusive fact with high emotion and a steely, sexist kind of ideology: It\u2019s the story of indoor privies and marriage patterns, but also of how people were told to behave, what they were told to hope for. A plain \u201chouse\u201d is bricks and a mortgage, the business end of domesticity; the idea of \u201chome\u201d seems much, much more alarming. It can be as bright and artificial and just as controlling as Oz himself.So Judith Flanders\u2019s new book isn\u2019t just smart and diverting but also brave. Her earlier books (\u201cThe Victorian House,\u201d \u201cConsuming Passions\u201d and \u201cThe Victorian City\u201d) make her an ideal guide to 19th-century households, but here she\u2019s moved beyond England and beyond the 19th century. She crosses Europe and America over five centuries, trying to find the details of people\u2019s home lives, even the \u201cinvisible furniture\u201d that doesn\u2019t turn up in books, pictures, wills or inventories. She means to connect all this with the way people thought and felt about it. She then wants to draw conclusions, which is where things get truly risky.The detail is the greatest fun. Once upon a time, you packed the glass from your windows along with the jewels and the silver when you went away; it was that valuable. Furniture was parked around the edges of a room \u2014 except in England, where it had to be in the middle or nobody would talk to anyone else. A lady in South Carolina was surprised by a supper party with so many lights \u201cwe could see everybody.\u201dIt\u2019s good to be reminded that in the 1650s the grandest drawing rooms of London held very large beds, with no hint of impropriety; this was public furniture. Later, beds were designated as private spaces in very private rooms, especially an Englishwoman\u2019s rooms, and a puzzled Frenchman felt entitled to complain that he wasn\u2019t always welcome. Good, too, to remember the deep meaning of curtains and how a few hundred miles could change it entirely. In Germany, they were the mark of an orderly household with not too much light, but in the Netherlands Calvinists were apt to let their goods, the signs of God\u2019s favor, be seen from the street.All these differences raise the questions Flanders wants to answer: What does the word \u201chome\u201d really mean, and why is a \u201chome\u201d different from a simple \u201chouse\u201d? There\u2019s a parallel history of how the word \u201chome\u201d was used and its nostalgic, even reactionary power. It helps explain those brand-new Tudor cottages scattered throughout suburbia. But Flanders settles for a simpler notion. She divides Europe into a southern zone, the \u201chouse\u201d zone, where extended tribes ran houses together from the fields to the kitchens, and a northern zone, where people married later and set up individual \u201chomes,\u201d a single shelter with a single household, the nuclear family on slow burn. She argues that this northern habit of late marriage kick-\u00adstarted our modern kind of economy, made industrialization possible and had something unspecified to do with democracy. It\u2019s the reason things moved faster in the north.Flanders feels obliged to summon some dusty old ghosts to make her case \u2014 the Protestant work ethic makes a cameo appearance \u2014 and that\u2019s a pity. It may take readers\u2019 eyes off her two important points. The first is that late marriage means saving, buying, making your own choices for your own life, even if they\u2019re mostly about sheets and cupboards. What Flanders is writing is a very interesting history of consumerism. She\u2019s also arguing that the shape of families, the choices people make, are what drive history \u2014 it\u2019s how you live that makes Protestantism appealing rather than the Reformation changing how you live. This is history snatched back from the kings and the preachers.The problem is that fresh evidence still might change the whole story. Flanders uses books well and pictures intelligently, searching images for hidden meaning. She knows that paintings aren\u2019t photographs; they invent a scene and don\u2019t document it. She sees the limits. But she gives archaeology short shrift, and what\u2019s dug up from the archive of things has a way of changing the history we find in the archive of words. In places where written records suggest there were no children, you find toys \u2014 long before Flanders thinks childhood was invented. In fishing villages supposed to be poor you find majolica plates and malagueta peppers with dinner. The diet of 19th-century New Yorkers is better recorded in the earth than in novels.So we\u2019ll need other books on the history of \u201chome,\u201d ones that ask questions about why the idea was so firmly promoted, and ones that make use of the new evidence from the earth. But meanwhile, this book has charm and learning. It\u2019s good to think again about such unexpectedly absorbing mysteries as the value of bedding and why the use of candles spread with the advent of sash windows.THE MAKING OF HOMEThe 500-Year Story of How Our Houses Became Our HomesBy Judith FlandersIllustrated. 346 pp. Thomas Dunne Books/ St. Martin\u2019s Press. $26.99.Michael Pye\u2019s most recent book is \u201cThe Edge of the World: A Cultural History of the North Sea and the Transformation of Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Test Rigging Follows a Long Auto Industry Pattern", "Date": "2015-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, car companies found ways to rig mileage and emissions testing data. In Europe, some automakers have taped up test cars\u2019 doors and grilles to bolster their aerodynamics. Others have used \u201csuperlubricants\u201d to reduce friction in the car\u2019s engine to a degree that would be impossible in real-world driving conditions.Automakers have even been known to make test vehicles lighter by removing the back seats.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.No matter the offense, penalties have often been fleeting. Executives are not jailed; fines are manageable.\u201cI don\u2019t see them changing this behavior unless criminal penalties are enacted into law that allow the prosecutor to put the executives in jail,\u201d Ms. Claybrook said.Software gives automakers a new advantage. Modern cars can sense collisions and start braking before drivers do and are even on the verge of driving themselves. So perhaps it is no surprise they can also sense when they are in a laboratory and, knowing that, put their best foot forward.The advent of the computerized car and the use of software to dupe regulators have been years in the making. General Motors paid $45 million in 1995 and recalled nearly half a million Cadillacs that were equipped with a chip that shut off emissions control systems while the air-conditioner was being used, to improve the car\u2019s performance.In 1998, the E.P.A. announced a settlement of nearly $1 billion against long-haul truck engine manufacturers for violations similar to Volkswagen\u2019s \u2014 using software to optimize the performance of diesel engines during laboratory testing.Some believe that using software to cheat on laboratory results goes beyond Volkswagen.While officially stated fuel efficiency and carbon-dioxide emissions figures have steadily improved over the years, real-world tests showed no corresponding improvement, according to the European Federation for Transport and Environment, an advocacy group based in Brussels. In fact, the group\u2019s testing found that the average diesel car was producing emissions five times as high as what was permitted. Some vehicles from BMW and Opel emitted 10 times as much pollution on the road as in the lab.The difference between the lab and real-world results swelled to 40 percent last year, on average, from 8 percent in 2002, the group also found.\u201cWe call it the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Jos Dings, the director of Transport and Environment. \u201cWe don\u2019t think this will be limited to Volkswagen. If you look at the testing numbers for the other manufacturers, they are just as bad.\u201dHe said the group had found gaps in both emissions of pollutants and overall fuel efficiency.Greg Archer, another official at the group and a former director at Britain\u2019s renewable fuels regulator, said, \u201cThere is something very suspicious about the way in which these tests are being passed, and it strongly suggests that companies are using defeat devices in the laboratory.\u201dThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the industry, referred questions to Volkswagen and called the matter \u201ca company-specific issue about their products.\u201dIn a statement on Tuesday, Volkswagen said it did \u201cnot tolerate any kind of violation of laws whatsoever.\u201d\u201cIt is and remains the top priority of the Board of Management,\u201d the company added, \u201cto win back lost trust and to avert damage to our customers.\u201dDan Becker, director of the safe climate campaign at the Center for Auto Safety, said that in 2011 he was among a group of environmental lawyers and engineers who traveled to Germany to hear automakers make a pitch for diesel cars. He said that while BMW and Daimler had taken the group\u2019s concerns seriously, Volkswagen officials had not.\u201cThey talked down to us,\u201d he said of the company. \u201cThey would definitely win an Academy Award for most egregious automaker. And this is one of the companies that tried desperately to get Americans to buy diesel. I think they just sank that ship.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patrick Drahi Positions Himself to Be a Player in U.S. Cable", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 When the French-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi bought a St. Louis cable TV company in May and was mentioned as a potential suitor for Time Warner Cable, it may have been the first time many Americans had heard his name.But Mr. Drahi, 52, is no stranger to American cable.Back in 1990, fresh from his honeymoon and living in a Paris suburb, he surprised his new wife by abruptly resigning his job in a fiber-optics lab at the European electronics giant Philips. He told her he was going to try his hand in the cable industry in the United States.The decision was largely driven by boredom and frustration with corporate bureaucracy, Mr. Drahi has said. But it was also inspired by his observation that the Forbes list of the world\u2019s wealthiest people included, at the time, a significant number of American cable entrepreneurs.\u201cSo that\u2019s where I went, because I figured that would be where I would have the best chance,\u201d Mr. Drahi recalled recently at a Paris gathering of students and alumni at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, a leading French engineering school where he earned his undergraduate degree.Setting off for the United States, the young engineer offered his services as a consultant to American cable investors, advising them on potential European acquisitions. Within three months, Mr. Drahi said, he was earning more than he had been making at Philips.The Time Warner talks, Mr. Drahi said at a news conference in May, were only the most preliminary of discussions. Indeed, shortly after the talks concluded, Time Warner accepted a $56 billion offer from Charter Communications.But the publicly traded company that Mr. Drahi controls, Altice, based in Amsterdam, has a stock market value of 25 billion euros, or nearly $28 billion. And the Suddenlink deal has set off media and analyst speculation that the company, which has never been shy about making debt-driven acquisitions, may next seek to buy cable systems from any number of midsize American players, including AT&T, Cox Communications, Cablevision or Verizon.As Altice plots to expand its American footprint, investors on either side of the Atlantic are taking a closer look at Mr. Drahi and his strategy, which in Europe has focused on the convergence of fixed-line cable, Internet services and wireless communications.\u201cPatrick believes that high-speed communications networks today are the equivalent to what networks for water, electricity and railways were to economic development in the 19th and early 20th centuries,\u201d said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Yomtov, a former investment banker at HSBC who runs Altice\u2019s main French cable and telecommunications business, Numericable-SFR.Mr. Drahi declined to be interviewed for this article. But a series of interviews with a half-dozen friends and colleagues revealed some sense of his early career and his American ambitions.Born in Casablanca and raised in that city\u2019s small, tightly knit community of European Jews, the young Patrick Drahi was the shy and soft-spoken son of math teachers. A self-taught pianist, he was also gifted with numbers, helping his parents grade their students\u2019 exams from the age of 11.At 15, he left Morocco for France with his parents and sister, settling in the southern city of Montpellier. It was a difficult transition for the family, which, like many of the era\u2019s \u201cpieds-noirs\u201d \u2014 North Africans of French descent \u2014 struggled for acceptance in France.Although he continued to excel at school, his outsider status made him ill at ease with any public acknowledgment of his talents.\u201cI discovered that, in the end, if you succeeded at something, it wasn\u2019t necessary to brag about it, and it was better to keep quiet,\u201d Mr. Drahi said in a videotaped interview shown this year at a Paris dinner where he received an award from an association of French donors to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Mr. Drahi was eventually accepted into the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and he subsequently studied fiber optics at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications. When he finished his degree, in 1986, Mr. Drahi looked set to follow a traditional engineering career path, joining Philips. But that was before he became impatient with what he considered the plodding pace of a big corporation.Mr. Drahi\u2019s penchant for quick, high-stakes decisions was evident in his school days, friends and colleagues said.While still a graduate student, for example, Mr. Drahi was introduced at a party to a young medical student \u2014 an Orthodox Christian from Syria \u2014 who happened to be the sister of one of his professors. By the end of the evening, he had proposed. (Mr. Drahi and his wife, Lina \u2014 now married 25 years \u2014 have four grown children.)On his first day back at Philips after his honeymoon, Mr. Drahi resigned before lunchtime and announced the news to his stunned wife. Their trip to the United States quickly followed.Mr. Drahi soon gained enough experience in America that he felt ready to try his hand at running a business and returned to France. Cable, where it existed, was owned by local utility companies with little interest in investing in what was, for them, an ancillary business.Mr. Drahi lacked the cash to pursue his ambitions. When he failed to persuade any of his new American contacts to back his first French investment, Mr. Drahi turned to what quickly became his signature financial tool: debt.But customers weren\u2019t signing up fast enough to cover his costs.To solicit subscriptions, Mr. Drahi went door to door. And to entice the area\u2019s large North African community to sign up, he quietly introduced several Arabic channels \u2014 even though French regulations at the time barred broadcasters from showing foreign-language content.\u201cI didn\u2019t list them in the brochures,\u201d Mr. Drahi said in the awards dinner video. \u201cPeople started saying, \u2018Hey, did you hear? If you get cable, you can have all these channels.\u2019\u201dBy 1998, Mr. Drahi\u2019s dealings caught the eye of executives at UPC, a Dutch subsidiary of Liberty Global, a group based in Colorado owned by one of those rich American cable barons he had read about: John C. Malone. In exchange for Mr. Drahi\u2019s cable assets in France, UPC offered him a 5 percent stake and hired him to run the company\u2019s Western Europe business, based in Geneva.Mr. Drahi sold his UPC shares two years later, becoming a multimillionaire. He quickly put his new fortune to work, founding Altice with the aim of fully consolidating the French cable industry.By 2012, Altice was ready to move more aggressively into mobile communications. With the backing of Cinven and the Carlyle Group, it made an unsolicited offer for SFR, France\u2019s second-largest mobile operator, which was owned by Vivendi, the media group that owns Universal Music. The two sides were unable to agree on a price, but Mr. Drahi walked away undeterred.Even as his profile has risen, Mr. Drahi remains an intensely private man who shuns public appearances and rarely gives media interviews.Despite a personal fortune estimated at close to \u20ac17 billion, Mr. Drahi indulges in few of the trappings of great wealth, friends and colleagues said. Although he keeps several elegant homes \u2014 in Geneva, Paris and Tel Aviv \u2014 his personal tastes and habits hew to the mundane. He wears a plastic Swatch instead of a Rolex and often arrives at business meetings on foot or a bicycle, instead of by chauffeured car.This no-frills style extends to the workplace, where, Altice colleagues said, Mr. Drahi \u2014 like the rest of his top staff \u2014 works without an assistant, making his own travel arrangements and booking his own appointments from his iPhone. He has no business card.\u201cIt is not a face-time organization,\u201d said Bernard Mourad, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who recently joined Altice to run the group\u2019s nascent media business, which includes the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration, the magazines L\u2019Express and L\u2019Expansion, as well as i24, an Israeli television station.Analysts estimate that Altice has the financial firepower to pursue up to \u20ac30 billion in new debt-driven deals, provided that interest rates remain low and the group continues to generate sufficient revenue to service its debts.All that borrowing, though, has made some French leaders nervous about Altice\u2019s \u201cbulimic\u201d acquisition strategy. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, recently worried aloud that Mr. Drahi was building an enterprise that had become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and might one day require a government bailout to preserve jobs.To Mr. Drahi, such concerns are overblown.\u201cWhen you are focused on debt reduction, it\u2019s because you have a growth problem,\u201d Mr. Drahi told a French legislative committee in June.\u201cIf I stop my so-called bulimic development, in five years, I would have no debts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then what? That would be stupid, because I will not have grown for five years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Addressing a United Nations summit meeting on development, Mr. Xi said China would increase its funds to $12 billion over the next 15 years to help the United Nations reach a goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.In making the pledge, China was \u201cputting justice before interests,\u201d he said.\u201cTo solve various global challenges, including the recent refugee crisis in Europe, the fundamental solutions lie in seeking peace and realizing development,\u201d Mr. Xi said.The pledge comes as China has faced increasing criticism for not taking sufficient responsibility for reducing poverty. Western countries have argued that China, as the world\u2019s second largest economy, can afford to do more.\u201cIt reflects an acceptance of China\u2019s increasing global responsibility,\u201d said Douglas H. Paal, vice president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In the past, China has met about 40 percent of its pledged contributions. And the current stress on foreign exchange and growth could mean its fulfillment rate was even less, Mr. Paal said.Mr. Xi said that China would grant relief of debts owed by the least developed countries. He did not give a figure for the debt.China has been criticized for using its development aid, particularly in Africa, for its own strategic objectives and economic needs, such as expanding access to oil and gas.Critics have pointed out that while China spends considerable money on infrastructure in poor African countries, it does not release data on its annual foreign aid. At a briefing for reporters Saturday night, Zhang Jun, director general for economic affairs at China\u2019s foreign ministry, said the pledge was \u201cmore political than practical.\u201d \u201cChina is willing to do as much as possible to help developing countries, but you can\u2019t expect that with limited funds there can be an answer to all questions,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.In his speech, Mr. Xi noted that China had lifted 439 million of its own people out of poverty and had made \u201cremarkable\u201d progress in education and women\u2019s welfare. It was not clear if he was suggesting that China\u2019s own experience in poverty reduction would be used in the United Nations project over the next 15 years.In an effort to show that China had been generous in the past, Mr. Xi said that 600,000 Chinese aid workers had been deployed to 166 countries.The $2 billion pledged by Mr. Xi gave a considerable boost to the United Nations\u2019 new Global Goals for Sustainable Development announced on Friday, but there were few details about how the funds from China or other member countries would be spent. China had not decided whether the $2 billion would be distributed as cash or in loans, Mr. Zhang said.Mr. Xi said China would also start 600 foreign assistance projects to reduce poverty by 2030. Chinese officials said those would be funded separately.In keeping with this new tack of taking a greater interest in poverty reduction outside its own borders, China announced during the summit meeting with President Obama on Friday that it would cooperate with the United States Agency for International Development on the United Nations poverty reduction project. But neither China nor the United States said how much money, if any, would be devoted to that cooperation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Raft Economy: Reporter\u2019s Notebook", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe smuggler met us at a busy kebab restaurant in Izmir, Turkey, and instead of sitting at an inside table where he could discuss his work privately, he chose seats on the sidewalk, clearly visible to pedestrians, the police and anyone else who happened to be passing by.Without lowering his voice, he casually described how he recruited passengers for raft trips to Greece from among the waves of migrants and refugees entering the city.As he sipped his coffee, his phone rang frequently with calls from new arrivals, most asking the same questions:\u201cDo you have boats?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIs the trip safe?\u201d\u201cGod willing.\u201dWe had come with only a few phone numbers and the name of the neighborhood said to be the migrant hub: Basmane.As we walked there from our hotel, it soon became clear that much of the \u201craft economy\u201d would be easy to find.Groups of young men speaking Syrian and Iraqi Arabic and lugging large backpacks all headed in the same direction.On the sidewalk of a large roundabout, we found scores of people, including families with small children, camped out and waiting for news from their smugglers. A nearby commercial boulevard was lined with clothing stores now selling life jackets and sidewalk merchants hawking inner tubes and balloons to keep documents and cellphones dry at sea.Karam and I both speak Arabic, so talking with most migrants was easy. Most had come from Syria, some from deep inside the country. They described harrowing trips to get out that often involved passing checkpoints manned by government soldiers, rebels and jihadists from the Islamic State.A surprising number were Palestinians who had been born in Syria and whose communities have been ravaged by the civil war, now in its fifth year. Others were Syrians who had lived under the Islamic State; men had been required to grow their beards, and many had left so that their children would not grow up near the jihadists\u2019 brutality.We also met many Iraqis who generally had more money and had come by plane from Baghdad or Erbil.The migrants shared their experiences finding human traffickers and with the so-called insurance offices that had sprung up to hold their money until they arrived in Greece.Some travelers had already made many attempts to cross and had ended up back in Izmir after their rafts popped, their motors stalled or they had been caught by the Turkish Coast Guard.Karam, my colleague, met Ahmed Abdul-Hamid, the main smuggler in our article, this year when Mr. Abdul-Hamid was trying to get himself smuggled to Europe. When we caught up with him again, he told us about the change in his fortunes and about how the business works from his perspective. He also introduced us to other smugglers\u2019 \u201cagents\u201d who added further detail.With the help of a Turkish translator, I interviewed a number of Turks, including merchants selling life jackets and the owner of a maritime supply store who sometimes sells goods to smugglers.Most surprising for me during the week we spent in Izmir was how obvious the migration was. We saw chartered tour buses parked near the local government headquarters picking up migrants one night to take them to a launch site. We found a shop selling the same outboard motors used on the rafts; dozens of them were piled up on the sidewalk and in the shop. When we asked what they were for, the manager kicked us out.We were later joined by Tyler Hicks, a New York Times photographer, and Tyler and I paid 20 euros each for a pleasant ferry ride from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos, where we spent another few days reporting. It was roughly the same route that migrants pay $1,200 to cross in treacherous journeys on flimsy rubber rafts.The results of the raft economy were obvious on the Greek side, too, with discarded rafts and inner tubes littering the beaches. Tyler and I woke up before dawn and rushed to the beach to make sure that we caught rafts arriving. Then one afternoon, we noticed that we could easily see them making the crossing from Turkey from the terrace of a hotel restaurant, making it clear how obvious the traffic was.For me, the most exhilarating part of the trip was being on the beach when the rafts landed. As soon as the rafts hit the sand, migrants poured off, some laughing, some crying, others quickly removing their phones from plastic coverings so they could call relatives and let them know they had arrived.\u201cI am in Greece, but I have no idea where,\u201d one Syrian told me, smiling, the joy of arrival temporarily taking his mind off the fact that much of his journey remained.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Migration Juggernaut Is Headed for Europe", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneFortified borders may slow it, somewhat. But the sooner Europe acknowledges it faces several decades of heavy immigration from its neighboring regions, the sooner it will develop the needed policies to help integrate large migrant populations into its economies and societies.That will be no easy task. It has long been a challenge for all rich countries, of course, but in crucial respects Europe does a particularly poor job.Rather than fortifying borders, European countries would do better to improve on this record. The benefits would be substantial, for European citizens and the rest of the world.Gone is the expectation that the world\u2019s population will peak at nine billion in 2050. Now the U.N. predicts it will hit almost 10 billion at midcentury and surpass 11 billion by 2100. And most of the growth will come from the poor, strife-ridden regions of the world that have been sending migrants scrambling to Europe in search of safety and a better life.Over the next several decades, millions of people are likely to leave these regions, forced out by war, lack of opportunity and conflicts over resources set in motion by climate change. Rich Europe is inevitably going to be a prime destination of choice.Europe\u2019s initial reaction to the flow has been mixed, at best. Germany, notably, has committed real resources to help cover the basic needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees it expects to welcome this year. But that is hardly the spirit across the board. And Europe is still mostly focused on steeling its borders, even to the point of closing many of its once free-flowing internal boundaries. Better options exist. The rich history of immigration around the world suggests that new migrant populations could be integrated into the European social fabric to the benefit of Europeans, the new immigrants and even the regions of the world they left behind.For 733 migrants crammed aboard two tiny boats somewhere between Libya and Italy, a leaky hull was neither the beginning nor the end of their troubles.Take Britain, where the government of Prime Minister David Cameron came into office promising to cut net annual immigration from \u201cthe hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.\u201dThey spur business investment to take advantage of the additional labor supply. They prompt domestic workers to switch into occupations that leverage their language skills and other comparative advantages.Despite popular perceptions to the contrary, migrants are often highly educated, and they generally do not burden the public purse. Stefano Scarpetta, director of the department of employment, labor and social affairs at the O.E.C.D., said immigrants often contribute more in taxes than they draw in public benefits.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.What\u2019s more, the countries sending migrants abroad often benefit, too.Of course, the most sensible response to large-scale immigration must include helping unstable, impoverished countries in Africa and beyond overcome the demographic pressure that stunts their development, as Mr. Turner advocates. Investment in human and physical capital simply can\u2019t keep up with population growth. Neither can job creation.Achieving the demographic transition to lower mortality and fertility rates will require not only investing in women\u2019s education and encouraging contraceptive use but also freeing women to make their own reproductive choices.In the meantime, Europe\u2019s challenge is real. Receiving millions of migrants of different races, religions and cultures from far-flung lands will pose political, economic and social challenges to European countries that remain to this day fairly homogeneous.In the end, the choice is clear. Europe\u2019s best shot at prosperity is to build upon the diversity that immigration will bring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Yellen Blinked on Interest Rates", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyIt has been seven years of zero percent interest rates. What\u2019s another two or three months among friends?Ms. Yellen blinked, which is not to say she made a mistake. Sometimes blinking is a very sensible thing to do.It\u2019s clear that the Fed officials think that the economy is well on the path toward healing and that neither a modest interest rate increase nor a volatile stock market will wreck it. Inflation may have been persistently below the central bank\u2019s 2 percent target the last few years, but it is on track to steadily rise in the year ahead.That helps explain why 13 of 17 Fed officials continue to expect that interest rate increases will be warranted in 2015, according to newly released projections. In case you\u2019re counting, that is a year with a mere 104 days left in it, and two Fed policy meetings, which kind of narrows the possibilities of what they have in mind for policy.What comes through in both the written materials the Fed released Thursday and Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments in a news conference is the sense that they want just a little more assurance, from both economic data and financial market prices, that their underlying assumptions are correct.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.After all, inflation data has been undershooting the Fed\u2019s expectations for years. A drop in oil prices and a strengthening of the dollar since July will only hold inflation back further.The unemployment rate is quite low, but there hasn\u2019t been nearly enough time to judge whether the August market volatility, partly rooted in an apparent slowing in the Chinese economy, is going to do any lasting damage to the United States labor market.Ms. Yellen took pains to argue that the Fed was not simply responding to a few rough weeks in the stock market, but rather had its eyes on the United States economy.\u201cThe Fed should not be responding to the ups and downs of markets,\u201d she said in her news conference. \u201cBut when there are significant financial developments, it\u2019s incumbent upon us to ask ourselves, \u2018What is causing them?\u2019 What we can\u2019t know for sure is how much concerns about the global economic outlook are drivers of those developments.\u201dIt\u2019s true that the cost of waiting a bit \u2014 to ensure that the economy continues to perform the way the Fed\u2019s models predict \u2014 appears to be low. (Unless, that is, you count the lost productivity of scores of professional and semi-professional Fed watchers who now get to spend the remainder of the year furiously speculating on when interest rate increases will come).The challenge she and the policy committee will face is that 2015 may end without the open questions that led to the September delay being resolved. It can take many months for financial swings to ripple their way through the economy. For example, a steep drop in oil prices in the second half of 2014 is only now affecting capital investment in energy exploration \u2014 and hence United States economic growth.There is no assurance that these critical questions \u2014 of whether inflation is finally, truly, really poised to rise, and whether economic softness in China and other emerging markets will crimp United States growth \u2014 will be resolved by December or even by the spring of 2016.The United States economy is at an odd moment when unemployment is basically back to healthy levels, at 5.1 percent (though that masks large numbers of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force). Yet inflation continues coming in less than forecast, and the global economy looks perilous.Fed interest rate decisions affect the economy with, as central bankers are fond of saying, \u201clong and variable lags,\u201d meaning it takes many months for them to affect growth and prices. How long is uncertain. As Stanley Fischer, the Fed vice chairman, said in a television interview last month, if the Fed waits until it is absolutely certain it is time to raise rates, it will probably be too late.In other words, Fed officials inevitably have to make a decision based on what their models predict, not on cold hard evidence.The decision to hold off on rate increases this week suggests Ms. Yellen and the Fed want a little more evidence that the economy is on the mend, but they may find themselves back in the same spot before they know it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exuberance and Disappointment at Shell\u2019s About-Face in the Arctic", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is testament to the fact that when people come together they have power to move mountains,\u201d said John Sellers, a local climate activist who organized a \u201cmosquito fleet\u201d of kayakers who trained together and then surged out into Puget Sound over the summer to fight Shell.The economies and cultures of Alaska and Washington have long been intertwined and dependent. Many Alaskan fishing fleets today are based in Seattle and pay their wages here; in decades past, gold miners disembarked from Puget Sound for the gold fields of Alaska and Canada. The result is a kind of mutual orbit with each side circling the other, in mutual benefit or frustration. On Monday, the glaring differences were everywhere.\u201cIt\u2019s tough times,\u201d said Kara Moriarty, the president of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, who said that rumors of layoffs in the next few weeks or months, in both the corporate offices of oil companies in Anchorage and in the drilling fields, were flying everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly sobering day,\u201d she added.Economists in Alaska said that questions of psychology and morale were now crucial: If Shell was bailing out, they said, other companies might get cold feet as well in investing or hiring or exploring. Political pressure would also intensify, they said, particularly in advance of a special session of the Legislature called for next month to consider state investment in a natural gas pipeline.Seattle\u2019s mayor, Ed\u00a0Murray, a Democrat, said the future looked very different \u2014 and hopeful \u2014 to him.\u201cThe people of Seattle stood up to oppose the use of our city as a base for expanded Arctic drilling,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWith today\u2019s announcement, it is time to move forward.\u201dPolitical leaders in Seattle \u2014 including a City Council member, Mike O\u2019Brien \u2014 who joined the so-called kayaktivists in facing down Shell, said that the tactics honed and used here to defeat the company had already become a template for climate activists elsewhere. Tiny-boat flotillas for climate protest are being planned or have already occurred in the Seine River in Paris and waterways in Switzerland and Southern California. The premise of this new approach, they said, is that since the effects of climate change are global, climate-protection battlefields are everywhere as well.\u201cThe world we\u2019re heading into is very different from the world we\u2019re coming out of,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said, \u201cand cities like Seattle are not open to doing business with folks like Shell if their business model is extracting oil from the Arctic.\u201dShell said that a failure to find enough oil in its test well, along with federal regulatory uncertainty, prompted its decision, not protests or attacks on its public image. But leaders of environmental groups said they believed the tactical decision made earlier this year \u2014 to wage the fight against Arctic drilling here in Seattle, where there is little oil but lots of environmental passion \u2014 had made a big impact in focusing the nation\u2019s attention.\u201cThe problem was never directly about Shell coming to Seattle, it was a problem with them leaving and going to the Arctic,\u201d said Emily Johnston, one of the kayak flotilla organizers. She said there was no way of knowing what influence, if any, the protests had on Shell\u2019s decision, but she and other demonstrators said they felt certain that their work had succeeded in keeping pressure on local elected officials and the Obama administration. That pressure, they said, helped foster the regulatory uncertainty that Shell found untenable.A spokesman for Shell, Curtis Smith, said in an email that it was too early to say what presence the company might want to maintain in Seattle\u2019s port, but suggested that there might not be much.\u201cOur staging needs in the Pacific Northwest will be commensurate with the amount of activity we have planned for future Arctic exploration,\u201d he said.\u201cIt will have an impact on companies, no question about it,\u201d said Mr. Walker, a former Republican who was elected last year as an independent.What happens next is also likely to become a battlefield. Climate protesters here said that with Shell now out of the way, the momentum and pressure would continue on the Obama administration to close the door on any further Arctic drilling.\u201cWe want to put him in a moral dilemma for the rest of his presidency,\u201d said Mr. Sellers, the Seattle protester.\u201cWe need to get some oil in the pipeline, and we need to get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protecting the Internet, but Depriving India's Poor", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNew Delhi \u2014 The last time Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States, he stood with Hugh \u201cWolverine\u201d Jackman and declared, for some reason, \u201cMay the force be with you.\u201d This month, when he meets the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, Calif., Indians hope their leader won\u2019t yell, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil.\u201dBut if he does end up shouting Google\u2019s motto in Facebook\u2019s headquarters, some Indians would be pleased. For that is what they wish to tell Facebook.Mr. Modi wants every Indian to get online, and Mr. Zuckerberg has figured out a way to do this. But the Modi government has been under pressure from the minority of Indians who consume most of the nation\u2019s bandwidth to pass legislation that would deny free Internet access to the poor.In February, Facebook and its partners introduced Internet.org in India, a diminished but free Internet for the more than 100 million mobile subscribers of Reliance Communications. More than 75 percent of Indians do not use or have access to the Internet, but almost every Indian has a mobile phone. So, millions of Indians now have access, in seven languages, to dozens of websites and applications, including BBC News, Wikipedia and, of course, Facebook.Internet.org would not have drawn much rage if not for something else that was going on. Weeks after the initiative emerged, an Indian telecom operator tried to introduce a service that would make it free or cheap or faster for people to gain access to some applications that have a commercial agreement with the operator.There is a global movement against strategies that corrupt the open nature of the Internet, and Indians joined the lament. The movement ended up including Internet for the poor among the offending telecom strategies. This was a flawed, principled stand. And it fit well in the history of the Indian elite deploying ideology to the detriment of the poor \u2014 central planning instead of a market economy, a focus on higher education over primary education and rocket science over virology.Mr. Zuckerberg has been at pains to tell Indians that his offer of free Internet to the poor does not violate any ethics. Facebook does not charge for any application that wishes to be on Internet.org, and it does not post ads on the Facebook pages of the users. Also, the company does not pay Reliance to provide the free service. Mr. Zuckerberg has said that any telecom operator would be allowed to carry Internet.org. A Facebook spokesman told me, \u201cWe are actively in discussions with other mobile phone operators in India.\u201dHe said that \u201cmore than 40 percent of those coming online via\u201d Internet.org are so intoxicated by the idea of connectivity that they soon pay the telecom operator for data and enjoy the full expanse of online life. So, the telecom operator has commercial rewards in offering an exceptional social service. It is an idea that can transform India.The elite Indian condemnation of Internet for the poor is cloaked in righteous objections. For instance, that it is \u201crestrictive,\u201d thereby violating the fundamental spirit of the web. But Internet.org is limited because data is expensive, not because it promotes some websites over others. In fact, it is paid Internet that is restrictive because it denies the web to those who cannot pay.Another objection is that the poor would think Facebook is the Internet as many in other nations do. But then in India \u201cxerox\u201d is a verb that means photocopying, and many think the Internet is an American company. If the whole world were surveyed, it would come across as generally ill informed. Many are ignorant because they never had the opportunities, like being connected, to be informed.Also, there is a view that free Internet is just a ploy by Facebook to capture new markets. The history of modern India is proof that corporate self-interest is often more useful to society than altruism.Mr. Modi, instead of banishing Internet.org, may consider uploading government websites on it. Facebook is discussing that possibility with his team.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eric Cantor: The G.O.P., After John Boehner", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFriday was another selfless act. By stepping down amid the tumult in the House conference, he has given my former colleagues in the House, fellow members of the Republican Party and the broader conservative movement a chance to demonstrate to the American people that we are prepared to govern and worthy of their trust.After nearly seven years of President Obama, conservatives are understandably angry about the direction this country is going. We are anxious for a course correction.During President Obama\u2019s first two years in office, his party controlled the House and for a time had a supermajority in the Senate. Almost entirely on their own they enacted a nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill, Obamacare and Dodd-Frank financial regulations. Not for the first or last time, alternative suggestions from Republicans were dismissed out of hand.Following that, the American people elected Republicans to the majority in the House. And Mr. Obama\u2019s liberal platform ground to a halt. Spending actually went down. Republicans, led by Speaker Boehner, provided the check and balance voters had demanded.But somewhere along the road, a number of voices on the right began demanding that the Republican Congress not only block Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda but enact a reversal of his policies. They took to the airwaves and the Internet and pronounced that congressional Republicans could undo the president\u2019s agenda \u2014 with him still in office, mind you \u2014 and enact into law a conservative vision for government, without compromise.Strangely, according to these voices, the only reason that was not occurring had nothing to do with the fact that the president was unlikely to repeal his own laws, or that under the Constitution, absent the assent of the president or two-thirds of both houses of Congress, you cannot make law. The problem was a lack of will on the part of congressional Republican leaders.Now we see that these same voices have turned to the threat of a government shutdown or a default on the debt as the means by which we can force President Obama to agree to their demands. I wonder what they would have said, if during the last two years of President Bush\u2019s term, the Democratic congressional majority had tried something similar.The tragedy here is that these voices have not been honest with our fellow conservatives. They have not been honest about what can be accomplished when your party controls Congress, but not the White House. As a result we missed chances to achieve important policies for the good of the country.The response I often hear to these points is: \u201cWell, Republicans at least need to fight.\u201d On this I agree. It is imperative that we fight for what we believe in. But we should fight smartly. I have never heard of a football team that won by throwing only Hail Mary passes, yet that is what is being demanded of Republican leaders today. Victory on the field is more often a result of three yards and a cloud of dust. In politics this means incremental progress, winning hearts and minds before winning the vote \u2014 the kind of governance Ronald Reagan perfected.During discussions over the debt limit in 2011, John Boehner and I negotiated one of the largest reductions in discretionary spending in history. Earlier this year, John was able to use the need to update Medicare physician payments to enact permanent entitlement reforms. No one ever claimed the deals were perfect, but as on so many other occasions, they advanced the conservative agenda.We are in the midst of a campaign to elect the next president. After two terms of President Obama, an economy that is growing too slowly and a retrenchment of American power abroad, the conservative to-do list for the next Republican president is quite long. That president\u2019s success will require steady, capable hands in Congress to move a conservative vision forward. Now is not the time for more infighting. Now is the time to come together and lay out a positive, honest governing platform to take the country forward.This is what my friend John Boehner fought for, and this is what we must continue to fight for to honor his dedication to Congress and the American people.Eric Cantor is a former Republican House majority leader and vice chairman and managing director at Moelis & Company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Leader Turns British Labour Party to the Left", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnnouncing his policy team two days after winning the party leadership, Mr. Corbyn, 66, handed Labour\u2019s sensitive economic portfolio to John McDonnell, a friend, ally and ideological soul mate, but he also allocated senior positions to more centrist figures.Also on Monday, the office of Prime Minister David Cameron said Mr. Corbyn had accepted an invitation to join the Privy Council, an ancient body that advises the monarch and whose origins date to the court of the Norman kings. The functions of the Privy Council are now limited and largely low key, but the opposition leader is normally a member. Mr. Corbyn, however, has been more outspoken than most of his predecessors about royalty, and once called for the royal family to move from Buckingham Palace to a more modest dwelling. Several privy councilors have described kissing the queen\u2019s hand \u2014 or brushing it with their lips \u2014 during their induction ceremony, which also involves taking an oath of allegiance.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s emphatic election victory, with almost 60 percent support among those entitled to vote, produced one of the biggest recent political upsets in Britain and underlines the volatility of politics in Europe, where voters appear increasingly drawn to the socialist left or the nationalist right.Among the groups that have welcomed his election is the Spanish leftist party Podemos, which has gained support by opposing austerity measures.Mr. Corbyn opposes cuts in welfare spending, wants to inject billions of pounds into the economy, has criticized NATO and opposes British involvement in military strikes in Syria.Despite his popularity among Labour campaigners, Mr. Corbyn has less support among his own lawmakers in Parliament, making the appointment of his political team, known as the shadow cabinet, a delicate process.The most striking appointment was that of Mr. McDonnell, who once faced criticism for saying that he would \u201clike to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher,\u201d a reference to Margaret Thatcher, the former Conservative prime minister who died in 2013.Mr. McDonnell\u2019s appointment dashed the hopes of some on the right of the Labour Party that such a sensitive post would go to a less controversial, and more centrist, figure.The job is seen as crucial by those who believe that Labour lost the general election to the Conservatives, in May this year, mainly because of its failure to convince voters in the center that it could be trusted with the economy. Mr. Corbyn\u2019s agenda, which includes nationalization of some strategic industries, was defended vigorously by Mr. McDonnell before Saturday\u2019s election result.He added that a future Corbyn-led Labour government would reserve the right to bring back any newly privatized assets \u201cinto public ownership with either no compensation or with any undervaluation deducted from any compensation for re-nationalization.\u201dSeveral prominent Labour figures have refused to serve in the shadow cabinet. But Mr. Corbyn did give a senior position, the shadow home secretary, to Andy Burnham, one of his defeated rivals for the party leadership. Among other appointments was Charles Falconer, who was given the justice portfolio and is a friend of the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair.In a statement, Mr. Corbyn described his new team as \u201ca strong combination of change and continuity that will now come together to hold this government to account.\u201d Although the highest-profile jobs went to men, 16 of the 31 posts were given to women.The composition of the policy team underlined the fact that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s internal critics also face difficult decisions. Several have had to decide whether to stand apart from his team, and hope that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s leadership fails, or to stay inside the tent and fight for more moderate left-wing policies.Writing in The Guardian, Roy Hattersley, a Labour right-winger and veteran of internal struggles against the left during the 1980s, called on other lawmakers to try to help shape the party\u2019s direction, adding that policy was not \u201cthe private property of the leader.\u201d\u201cThat is why refusing to serve in the shadow cabinet is self-indulgent nonsense,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Labour Party, Wary of Old Image, Puts Its Focus on Prudence", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIGHTON, England \u2014 When the Labour Party chose Jeremy Corbyn, an outsider from the party\u2019s hard left, as its new leader this month, critics worried that a turn away from centrist policies would relegate the party to Britain\u2019s political sidelines, as it was in the 1980s during the Margaret Thatcher years.On Monday, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s newly appointed shadow chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell, sought to allay such fears, saying in a speech to the Labour Party\u2019s annual conference in this seaside town that the party intended to cut the budget deficit, submit its economic plans to independent scrutiny and solicit advice from leading international economists.But Mr. McDonnell was careful to provide some red meat for the thousands of newly recruited Labour members and supporters who vaulted Mr. Corbyn into the leadership, promising to oppose economic austerity and to force large international companies like Starbucks, Amazon and Google to pay their \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes.Mr. McDonnell said that Labour \u201cwill always ensure that this country lives within its means,\u201d while adding that the party would \u201cnot tackle the deficit on the backs of middle and low earners, and especially by attacking the poorest in our society.\u201dHis comments appeared intended to blunt attacks from the governing Conservative Party of Prime Minister David Cameron, which argues that Labour is a party of \u201cdeficit deniers\u201d who cannot be trusted with the economy. Many experts believe that Labour was badly defeated in the general election in May partly because of voters\u2019 concerns about its economic competence, presenting a clear challenge for Mr. McDonnell.To address that skepticism, Mr. McDonnell said that he would take advice on policy from leading economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty. He also said he wanted the independent Office of Budget Responsibility, which scrutinizes government economic plans, to \u201ctest, test, and test again to demonstrate our plans are workable and affordable.\u201dMr. McDonnell raised the possibility of structural change, calling for a review of the operations of the British Treasury, of the mandate of the Bank of England, and of the resources and operations of Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, the national tax collection agency.An ideological ally of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s, Mr. McDonnell is regarded as an uncompromising figure on Labour\u2019s left, and giving him the job of shadow chancellor, in charge of economic policy, was Mr. Corbyn\u2019s most controversial appointment. Mr. Corbyn won an overwhelming mandate in Labor\u2019s leadership election this month, replacing Ed Miliband, who stepped down after the election in May.On Monday, Mr. McDonnell acknowledged that his reputation might need some polishing, telling the BBC before his speech that he wanted to sound like a \u201cboring local bank manager,\u201d then telling his audience that they would not hear \u201cmy usual rant,\u201d or jokes of the type that have gotten him into trouble.He once apologized for having said that he wished he could return to the past and assassinate Mrs. Thatcher.In his speech, Mr. McDonnell described Labour as Britain\u2019s \u201conly anti-austerity party\u201d \u2014 a swipe at the Scottish National Party, which has portrayed its landslide victory in Scotland in the May election as a triumph for those opposing austerity.Mr. McDonnell\u2019s invective against austerity echoed those of left-wing parties elsewhere in Europe. The reaction to Mr. McDonnell\u2019s speech from the main business lobbying group, the Confederation of British Industry, was equivocal, suggesting that he may not, after all, have sounded quite like a bank manager.\u201cThe shadow chancellor was strong on intent but has not yet provided great detail on how he intends to deliver his plans,\u201d said John Cridland, the confederation\u2019s director general. \u201cThe overall impression of this speech was of rather more intervention in the world of business and the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malcolm Turnbull Takes Helm as Australian Prime Minister", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow that Mr. Turnbull, a wealthy lawyer and former investment banker, has the country\u2019s top job, his main challenge is clear, said Hugh White, an intelligence analyst who from 1985 to 1991 advised Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Defense Minister Kim Beazley.\u201cThe key question is whether he can run an effective government,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened since 2007.\u201dWith Australia\u2019s next election less than a year away, the governing Liberal Party \u2014 which, despite its name, is conservative \u2014 rejected the deeply unpopular Mr. Abbott in favor of Mr. Turnbull, a comparatively centrist figure whose views on climate change and other issues are more in line with Australian public opinion.But Mr. Turnbull will have to lead not only the lawmakers in his own party \u2014 44 of whom did not vote for him on Monday night, against 54 who did \u2014 but also a country where policy in recent years often seems to have been made on the run, and often in response to flagging opinion polls.Australia\u2019s current political turmoil dates from the Labor Party government of Kevin Rudd, who became prime minister in 2007.Mr. Rudd was ousted in an internal party coup in 2010 and replaced by Julia Gillard, Australia\u2019s first female prime minister. As Ms. Gillard\u2019s poll numbers fell, the party reinstalled Mr. Rudd months before the election of 2013, which Mr. Abbott\u2019s conservative coalition won.Already a polarizing figure when he took office, Mr. Abbott saw his popularity decline amid a slowing economy as he made a series of political missteps and alienated many voters with his strongly conservative stances and often abrasive style.His combative manner contributed to his government\u2019s inability to get major budget measures through the lower and upper houses of Parliament.Bob Gregory, a professor of economics at Australian National University, said Mr. Turnbull\u2019s task would be largely one of communication. \u201cWhat Mr. Turnbull has to do is straightforward,\u201d Mr. Gregory said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to explain things. You\u2019ve no idea how powerful that is.\u201dIn his pitch for the job, Mr. Turnbull promised to consult with colleagues and the public more often, saying Australians need advocacy from their leader, and not slogans.That will include managing the Liberals\u2019 governing coalition with the smaller, more conservative National Party, which is unlikely to embrace attempts by Mr. Turnbull to move to the center.Mr. Gregory said he expected few policy changes from Mr. Turnbull in the short term. Indeed, in his first session of Parliament as prime minister on Tuesday, Mr. Turnbull made it clear that on at least two issues over which he has criticized Mr. Abbott in the past \u2014 climate change and same-sex marriage \u2014 his predecessor\u2019s policies would continue.John Hewson, a former Liberal Party leader, said climate change was the party\u2019s biggest moral, social, political and economic challenge. He said that Mr. Turnbull would have to persuade more conservative members of his coalition to move further with him on dealing with the issue, toward which the Abbott government showed its firm attitude this summer by moving to halt government investment in wind farms and domestic-scale solar projects.\u201cThere are not too many growth sectors in the economy,\u201d Mr. Hewson said. \u201cI never understood why they moved to close down renewables. Basically, what Mr. Abbott did resulted in a fall in investment in that sector of 80 to 90 percent and a loss of 15,000 jobs. Why would you do that when you\u2019re looking for growth sectors to replace mining?\u201dMr. Hewson said he hoped Mr. Turnbull would reverse the government\u2019s lack of support for renewable energy projects, even if it could not change emissions targets before an international conference on climate change in Paris later this year.\u201cHe has got great rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Gregory said of Mr. Turnbull. \u201cHe won\u2019t pull out a magical new agenda that isn\u2019t there. But he will be able to fix things with a few words. He will make things happen.\u201dMr. Turnbull became a nationally known lawyer during the 1980s, when he fought the British government\u2019s attempt to stop the publication in Australia of a memoir by a former British intelligence agent. During the 1990s, he was a venture capitalist and head of the Goldman Sachs investment bank in Australia. In 1994, he bought a stake in the Internet service provider Ozemail, which he later sold for millions of dollars. First elected to Parliament in 2004, he is believed to be one of Australia\u2019s richest lawmakers ever.Still, he has often been dismissed as a \u201csilvertail,\u201d as Australians call an extremely rich person. He lives in a harborside mansion in the suburban Sydney district of Wentworth, one of Australia\u2019s wealthiest.

{"Headline": "Pessimism Pervades Mexico as Economic Promises Fall Short", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Jes\u00fas Rasc\u00f3n embodies the sort of success story that was supposed to epitomize \u201cMexico\u2019s moment.\u201dThe plastics company he founded 13 years ago now employs 350 people in two factories. He sells parts to global companies like Volkswagen and Whirlpool. Even the slide in the value of the Mexican peso this year works in his favor because it makes his products cheaper overseas.Then why is he feeling so glum about Mexico\u2019s economy?In a word: poverty. \u201cUnfortunately the problem in Mexico is the wage rate, which is enough only to survive,\u201d said Mr. Rasc\u00f3n, 48. Unless people have money to spend, he added, the companies that sell to them will never be able to expand the way his has.Such economic pessimism is pervasive across much of the country as President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto prepares to reboot his presidency midway through his six-year term.In the days leading up to his state of the nation speech on Wednesday, his administration has blitzed news media outlets with ads extolling the changes, which include rules to rein in powerful private telecommunications companies and an end to state control of the energy industry. The campaign repeats the pledge that investment and jobs are coming.But that story is beginning to look thin.Growth has been slower under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency than the annual 2.3 percent average in the two decades before he took office. In the last couple of weeks, both the central bank and the Finance Ministry have reduced their forecasts, suggesting that growth in 2015 may not reach that figure either.Salaries are stagnant, while recent studies show that inequality and poverty have increased over the past few years.Now, just when Mexico might have begun to see the first concrete benefits of the economic revisions, the economy is being pummeled by forces beyond the government\u2019s control as global financial uncertainty mounts.The timing could not have been worse. The collapse in oil prices all but halted the predicted rush by international oil companies into Mexico and will force the government, which relies on oil revenue to fund at least a third of its spending, to make significant cuts in social and infrastructure programs next year.The first auction for offshore oil exploration blocks in July drew so few bids that only two of the 14 on offer were awarded. Regulators have relaxed the conditions for coming bids, but the billions in investment that the government promised seem even further off.\u201cEnergy reforms are going to kick in some time in the future,\u201d said Gabriel Casillas, chief economist at Banorte Financial Group, a large Mexican bank. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take longer, 15 years, not by 2017 or 2018 as we thought.\u201dIn addition, the peso\u2019s slide over the past year \u2014 along with the fall of currencies in other emerging markets \u2014 has raised the price of imports from the United States about 30 percent. That upends business investment plans and makes consumers nervous about big purchases.There are bright spots. Prudent economic management over the years has kept inflation under control and debt in check. About $20 billion in foreign investment has poured into the Mexican auto industry over the past six years to take advantage of Mexico\u2019s proximity to the United States, its trade agreements and its skilled labor force.The results, though, are pockets of success in the highly efficient export sector that have failed to reach those on lower rungs of the economic ladder.\u201cThese policies have delivered stability, they haven\u2019t delivered growth,\u201d said Joydeep Mukherji, a managing director at Standard & Poor\u2019s who follows Mexico closely.\u201cThere is a general negativeness in the air for many, many reasons,\u201d Mr. Mukherji added. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest thing to turn around because you have to boost the confidence of investors and consumers. It requires political leadership and a different set of skills than passing a law.\u201dThere are other problems that weigh on the economy. Citing measurements from Mexico\u2019s national statistics institute, Alonso Cervera, the chief Latin America economist at Credit Suisse, estimated that crime cuts a full percentage point off Mexican growth.\u201cThe economic reforms were very powerful and very forceful,\u201d Mr. Cervera said. \u201cI would have liked to see the same forcefulness on judicial reform. Crime and corruption have to be punished.\u201dBusiness leaders argue that preaching patience is no longer enough.Along with opening up the energy sector, the economic changes closed tax loopholes, gave new powers to antitrust regulators, set up special rules to weaken telecommunications monopolies, encouraged banks to lend to small businesses, and gave employers new flexibility to hire and fire workers. But businesses argue that the economy now needs incentives for investment and job creation.Analysts argue that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government failed to invest during his first two years in office \u2014 when high oil prices gave finance officials much more room to maneuver than they have now \u2014 and lost a valuable opportunity.\u201cInstead of building a bridge, they put money in accounts,\u201d said Mr. Casillas of Banorte. \u201cThey earmarked money, but it was never used.\u201dOthers say the main diagnosis of Mexico\u2019s ailment was wrong.\u201cThe reforms were oversold,\u201d said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de M\u00e9xico and the author of a recent study for Oxfam that found that the country\u2019s already vast inequality was growing.The government thought \u201cthat the energy issue was the solution to the country\u2019s problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAll sectors need to grow. It won\u2019t drag up the rest of the economy.\u201d\u201cLow salaries are a fundamental part of the economy,\u201d Mr. Esquivel said. \u201cA good part of the economy has no purchasing power.\u201dLuis Foncerrada, the director of the Center for Economic Studies of the Private Sector, a think tank affiliated with Mexico\u2019s main business alliance, argues that overall salaries have been depressed because 21 percent of the work force is either unemployed or working just a few hours a week.\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to sit here with our arms crossed waiting for the reforms to have results,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like telling somebody who is sick to wait five years for the cure to appear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Stock Markets End Higher Though Global Concerns Linger", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks in the United States bounced back on Wednesday, a day after another sell-off on the global markets, even as worries about economic growth persisted.The decline on Tuesday followed a weak Chinese report on manufacturing that heightened broader concerns about global economic growth. Some analysts said it was too early to tell whether Wednesday\u2019s market gains were a sign that stocks were close to bottoming out.\u201cWe are getting a little bit of a letup today, but the headache may continue,\u201d said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at KeyBank.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 1.8 percent to end at 1,948.86. The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 300 points, closing up 1.8 percent, to 16,351.38. Technology shares were particularly higher, with the Nasdaq composite index gaining 2.5 percent.The S.&P. 500 is now 8.54 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The Dow Jones industrial average is 10.71 percent below its peak. After its surge on Wednesday, the Nasdaq is still nearly 9 percent off its high.As welcome as Wednesday\u2019s recovery was to many investors, they are expected to keep watching for signs of weakness in China \u2014 although they will have a two-day break, with markets there closed the rest of the week.The Shanghai composite index closed down 0.2 percent on Wednesday, leaving it almost 40 percent lower than its recent peak. A late rally was driven by huge trading volume, suggesting government intervention in the market.The weakness in Chinese shares was by no means the worst the country has seen over the last month, but coming ahead of closely stage-managed celebrations in China to commemorate the end of World War II, it has raised concerns about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic growth.In particular, international investors and economists worry that heavy-handed state intervention to prop up sagging stocks, and poor communication before a currency devaluation in August, signal uncharacteristic sloppiness from the technocrats who have guided China\u2019s steady rise in gross domestic product over the last three decades.\u201cThere are growing doubts about China\u2019s leadership and the direction of the economy,\u201d Alex Wolf, an emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments, wrote in a note. \u201cIndeed, some have even begun to question whether the Chinese government has \u2018lost control\u2019 of the economy.\u201dIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng closed 1.2 percent lower, while the Nikkei 225 in Japan closed 0.4 percent lower.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved up slightly on Wednesday, to 2.19 percent from 2.16 percent on Tuesday. Yields move in the opposite direction from prices. Investors have often piled into United States government bonds as a safe-haven investment during periods of instability in the markets. But the 10-year note has not rallied sharply during the latest sell-off in the stock market.Some analysts said this could indicate that most investors were not expecting a severe downturn.\u201cBonds would be showing a lot more activity if investors felt this was going to lead to a recession or a bear market,\u201d Mr. McCain of KeyBank said.Major European indexes moved higher. The FTSE 100-stock index in London ended up 0.4 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.3 percent.Despite the worries about China, most analysts say they believe that the country will be able to avoid a sharp economic slowdown. But restoring confidence in its stock markets, they say, will require continued loosening of monetary policy by the Chinese central bank, initiatives like share buybacks from companies and broader market-oriented changes.The Chinese government\u2019s continued direct intervention in the market, on the other hand, will strengthen concerns, according to an analyst\u2019s note from Citibank.\u201cSignificant reduction of administrative intervention into domestic equities is more important to regain global investors\u2019 confidence,\u201d the note said.Even so, China\u2019s largest brokerage firms, under the direction of regulators, have vowed to pour in additional investments to support the equity markets, according to a number of recent filings with the stock exchanges. For example, in a note on Tuesday, Haitong Securities said it would invest an additional 4.5 billion renminbi, or roughly $700 million, on top of the 15 billion renminbi it had pledged to a stock market bailout fund.The move was made \u201cto maintain the long-term stability of the securities market, promote the positive role of a securities company and fulfill its corporate social responsibility,\u201d Haitong said in its filing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.Though analysts say such moves will eventually help support the market, many also worry that the measures indicate that the broader Chinese economy could be in worse shape than official data suggests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fed Gives Growth a Chance", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn one important respect, however, the Fed appears to be doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.Judging from its statement and its economic projections, the Fed believes that the labor market has largely returned to health. That suggests it will be poised to raise rates as soon as the global headwinds abate.But the labor market is not healthy, and until it is, rate increases would be premature. Unemployment, at 5.1 percent in August, is still higher than it was before the recession. The share of part-time workers who need full-time jobs is still elevated, while the share of working-age adults with jobs is still well below its prerecession level. Most telling, broad wage growth \u2014 the clearest sign of labor market health \u2014 has been virtually nil during the six-year-old recovery.The Fed is supposed to conduct policy in a way that fosters full employment, meaning rates should not be raised until jobs and wages are on a robust growth trajectory. But it seems more concerned with its mandate to fight inflation. That focus would be questionable even if there were nascent signs of inflation; in the absence of any signs, it is indefensible. In fact, inflation has been so low for so long now, it could run somewhat above the Fed\u2019s target for an extended period without being disruptive and, in the process, allow wages to grow in line with productivity.And yet, inexplicably, a majority of Fed officials expect to begin raising rates later this year.Congress long ago punted on its responsibility to use fiscal policy to help the economy. That has put an undue burden on the Fed, in effect making the Fed\u2019s near-zero interest rate the only source of steady policy support for a struggling economy.The Fed should not have been put in that position, but that is the position it is in. It should not compound the problem of inadequate congressional action by removing its support before the labor market has truly recovered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Proposed to Give Regulatory Protection to Puerto Rico Mutual Fund Investors ", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bill, if it becomes law, will not replace the money the investors have lost, but it will bar some of the activities that led to their losses \u2014 activities that are already illegal on the mainland.Mutual funds cater to individual investors who want professionally managed investments. The 1940 act protects them by barring those professional investors from engaging in certain kinds of transactions that suggest self-dealing, among other things. But because of the exclusion, such transactions are still legal in Puerto Rico.UBS had difficulty selling the bonds in the tough market conditions of 2008. It ended up packaging about half of the issue in its own family of closed-end mutual funds, which were marketed to wealthy Puerto Ricans as a good, tax-sheltered source of retirement income.The interest on pension obligation bonds is not exempt from federal income taxes, because the Internal Revenue Service considers these securities speculative. But residents of Puerto Rico do not pay federal income taxes, and the Puerto Rican government exempted the bonds from its own estate and gift taxes.\u201cThis practice constitutes a flagrant conflict of interest, and it must stop,\u201d Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez said. Her bill is co-sponsored by Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, who is the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee. Chances of passage are unclear because of widely divergent views on what should be done to address Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis. The Senate Committee on Finance has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday on some of the issues.Puerto Ricans who invested in the affected mutual funds have filed more than 800 arbitration claims against UBS with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, a self-regulatory body. They are seeking more than $1.1 billion, basing their claims on regulations that are not part of the 1940 act\u2019s exclusion for territories.The Securities and Exchange Commission has also penalized UBS under other laws and collected a $26.6 million settlement for distribution to the harmed investors.But Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez said that without an amendment, such things could happen again.\u201cThis archaic exemption is long overdue for repeal,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Automobiles on the Firing Line", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 1,000 or so dealers, collectors, speculators and spectators who arrived on Monday concentrated on finding out whether classic cars were still a high-performance investment, despite a gloomy economy at their doorsteps and internationally, particularly in China.It turned out that, for the most part, the engine of growth has slowed. The 76-lot event raised \u00a316.7 million, about $25.7 million, with most lots selling around the low estimate and 26 percent of the cars unsold.The total was well below the \u00a322 million that RM Auctions of Canada achieved at its equivalent sale in London in September. (On Feb. 18, Sotheby\u2019s paid $30.7 million for a 25 percent stake in RM Auctions, with options to increase its share.) The unsold rate could have been higher, but some sellers lowered their reserve prices before the sale began, or hadn\u2019t demanded a reserve at all. Among 23 lots of the latter was a 1987 AC Cobra Mk IV convertible, which sold to a buyer in the room for just \u00a361,600 with fees, against a low estimate of \u00a3120,000.\u201cPeople are coming down to earth, even though some sellers still have their heads in the clouds,\u201d said Simon Kidston, a dealer in Geneva who founded the classic car index k500.com last December. \u201cBuyers are financially aware and they get spooked if there is bad news elsewhere.\u201dIn recent years, the top level of the classic car market has been dominated by signature Ferraris from the 1950s and \u201960s. A 1958 example of Ferrari\u2019s highly successful 250 GT Berlinetta Competizione \u201cTour de France\u201d coupe, with a modest racing history and restored original 263 b.h.p. engine, duly topped the sale with a price of \u00a34.8 million against a low estimate of \u00a34.5 million.In 2013, the HAGI (Historic Auto Group International) Top Index of auction and dealer sales of exceptional collectable cars gained 46.75 percent; in 2014, it was up 15.8 percent; so far this year (up to the end of August), it has gained 8 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely slowing down,\u201d said Dietrich Hatlapa, the founder of the HAGI Index, who, like many observers of the classic car market, attribute much of its top-end growth in recent years to wealthy Americans and Europeans benefiting from central banks\u2019 quantitative easing and low interest rates. \u201cPeople felt comfortable about having 10 percent of their wealth in classic cars, saw values rise and then increased the capital allocation to 15 or 20 percent. The global liquidity just isn\u2019t there any more.\u201dThis slowdown was also evident in the overall results at the bellwether specialist car auctions in Monterey, Calif., last month. While RM Sotheby\u2019s led the series with $167.2 million of auction sales, including a week-topping $17.6 million for a 1964 Ferrari 250 LM Coupe, the final cumulative total of $396.8 million at auctions by RM Sotheby\u2019s, Gooding & Co., Bonhams, Mecum, Russo & Steele and JR was 7.9 percent lower than the $428.1 million taken at the equivalent public sales in August 2014, according to data provided by Hagerty, a Michigan-based company that values and insures classic cars.Auctions of classic cars have a singular atmosphere. Crowded with middle-aged men, all of whom seem to know the exact history, condition and value of every lot, these events increasingly only have the capacity to surprise when an extreme rarity comes under the hammer.\u201cThe dynamics of the market are changing,\u201d Mr. Kidston said. \u201cIf something is truly exceptional, buyers will pay a good price. If it isn\u2019t, they\u2019ll wait and know another one will come along.\u201dOn Sept. 5, for example, Bonhams achieved a top-estimate 3.3 million euros, about $3.7 million, for a unique surviving prototype of Maserati\u2019s 1972 futuristic Giorgetto Giugiaro-designed Boomerang coupe. It was the stand-out lot at the company\u2019s inaugural auction, which coincided with the Arts & Elegance concours event in Chantilly, France.On the same day, Bonhams also sold a 1929 Bentley 4.5-liter Sports Saloon in its annual sale of collectors\u2019 cars at the Beaulieu National Motor Museum in Hampshire in England. Remarkably, the Bentley, one of 657 made, had been owned by the same English family since 1935 and was in original \u201cbarn find\u201d condition, with its engine seized, having been parked in a garage since 1985. It was bought by a British collector for \u00a3695,900, more than four times the low estimate.\u201cThe value is what this is, not what it could be,\u201d said James Knight, group director of Bonhams\u2019s motoring department, who estimated that the Bentley could cost as much as \u00a3250,000 to restore. He added that the resultant loss of its once-in-a-lifetime originality could result in a lowering of value. \u201cIf it were put back in an auction in restored condition, we\u2019d probably estimate it at \u00a3500,000-\u00a3600,000.\u201dThe auction price exemplified the current vogue for cars in \u201cfirst paint, first trim\u201d condition, that can compete (if the engine works) in concours beauty parades.An even more extreme example is the 1928 4.5-liter Bentley that the dealer William Medcalf discovered 18 months ago scattered in pieces around a house at Kew in West London. The only known survivor of eight such Bentleys made with Victor Broom \u201cDrophead\u201d bodywork, it still had virtually all of its original components, including a working engine with its original Bentley \u201cfive-year warranty\u201d lead seals in place and a speedometer with 39,000 miles.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Bentley with its original seals,\u201d said Mr. Medcalf, whose Sussex business specializes in restoring and selling vintage examples of the brand. The \u201cDrophead\u201d has now been reassembled to concours condition. \u201cIt\u2019s driveable. You can go to Edinburgh in it,\u201d added Mr. Medcalf, who is quoting an asking price of \u00a31.2 million.As growth slows in the classic car market, has Sotheby\u2019s, who last held auto auctions in 1999, rejoined the party a little too late? Is this really a sector where it can make up ground on its bigger-grossing rival, Christie\u2019s, who stopped selling cars in 2006?\u201cWe are actively pursuing cross-selling opportunities between the two organizations,\u201d Tad Smith, president and chief executive of Sotheby\u2019s, said in the company\u2019s first-half earnings conference call on Aug. 7. \u201cWe like the collectible car business.\u201dIn other words, wealthy people buy cars, and being wealthy, they might just want to buy other luxury items that Sotheby\u2019s also happen to sell, like art, jewels and wine.Moreover, classic cars \u2014 unlike art, jewels and wine \u2014 isn\u2019t a luxury investment that has attracted much new money from Asia and Russia, and the volatility of demand that goes with it. It\u2019s a business based on American and European men of a certain age and income level who are passionate about buying and driving old cars, albeit rather fewer when economies stall.\u201cThings can\u2019t keep going up for ever, but I have done well out of my collection,\u201d said Julian Smith, 50, a British businessman based in the Channel Islands who was bidding, but not buying, at RM Sotheby\u2019s auction in Battersea.Mr. Smith owns, among other cars, a 1973 Ferrari Daytona and an Alfa Romeo 1900C Pininfarina, which he raced in the Mille Miglia competition in Italy this year. \u201cI was more inclined to add to the collection, as all previous cars had appreciated. However, this was not my prime motivation,\u201d he said as he set off into the night, past the Sotheby\u2019s protest. \u201cI just like them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are for checking out cake pans (North Haven, Conn.), snowshoes (Biddeford, Me.), telescopes and microscopes (Ann Arbor, Mich.), American Girl dolls (Lewiston, Me.), fishing rods (Grand Rapids, Minn.), Frisbees and Wiffle balls (Mesa, Ariz.) and mobile hot spot devices (New York and Chicago).Libraries, arguably the original sharing economy, have long circulated art prints, music and movies, and more recently have added tools. But services like the Library of Things and the \u201cStuff-brary\u201d in Mesa, outside Phoenix, are part of a broad cultural shift in which libraries increasingly view themselves as hands-on creative hubs, places where people can learn new crafts and experiment with technology like 3-D printers.The Sacramento Public Library is one of a few dozen libraries in the country to embrace the \u201cmaker movement,\u201d in which people use technology, like robotics and 3-D printing, to create handicrafts and other objects. Sacramento has set up what it calls the Design Spot at a library branch in a mixed-income neighborhood, with space designated for 3-D printers, vinyl and laser cutters, and other tools.\u201cIt\u2019s an experimental place to do free cool stuff,\u201d said Jessica Zaker, 34, Sacramento\u2019s central branch manager.The economic downturn forced many public libraries, especially in urban areas, to close branches, curtail hours and cut staff even as demand for their services by job seekers increased. To make up the difference, many libraries turned to foundations, private donors, friend groups and corporations for support. At the same time, \u201cthe crunch pushed libraries to look locally to prove their value,\u201d said R. David Lankes, a professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University.\u201cThey realized that the way you best serve your community is to look like them,\u201d Professor Lankes said. \u201cFor some, that means 3-D printers. For others, it means fishing rods.\u201dLast year, the Free Library of Philadelphia pulled together city, state and private funds to open a teaching kitchen, which is meant to teach math and literacy through recipes and to address childhood obesity. It has a 36-seat classroom and a flat-screen TV for close-ups of chefs preparing healthy dishes.The library in North Haven, in southern Connecticut, encourages bakers by offering 304 types of cake pans and 83 sets of cookie cutters.\u201cLibraries are looking for ways to become more active places,\u201d said Kate McCaffrey of the Northern Onondaga Public Library, outside Syracuse, which lends out its garden plots and offers classes on horticulture. \u201cPeople are looking for places to learn, to do and to be with other people.\u201dMs. McCaffrey considers the garden, which has 58 plotters, \u201ca maker lab that happens to be outdoors.\u201dOnline experiences only go so far, said Josie Parker, Ann Arbor\u2019s library director. \u201cYou can\u2019t download a telescope to take on a family picnic in the country and watch the stars come up,\u201d she said.Public libraries in New York, Chicago and elsewhere offer devices that can connect borrowers\u2019 phones, tablets and laptops to mobile Wi-Fi hot spots.\u201cThis is the most convenient thing that has ever happened to me,\u201d said Aida Rivera of the Bronx, a grandmother of nine who checked out what she called a \u201cvery cute, pocket-sized device\u201d from the New York Public Library. It has allowed her to reconnect with childhood friends via Facebook, explore fitness and health sites, keep up with the news and talk with her grandchildren on Staten Island via Skype.For Shereema Ibrahim, 62, a part-time federal disaster relief worker in Sacramento, the discovery that sewing machines were suddenly available at her branch library meant returning to a favorite hobby. \u201cI held my breath,\u201d she said of her first snip of fabric in decades: a $4-a-yard cherry-fruit pattern for an apron.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the dollar amount,\u201d she said of the borrowed sewing machine. \u201cIt\u2019s about the value of opportunity.\u201dAs libraries add nontraditional items for checkout, they are confronting unusual curatorial challenges. In Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, for example, where fishing rods and tackle can be borrowed and used at the library\u2019s own fishing dock on the Mississippi River, emergency assistance is provided during the summer months by a Rotary Club volunteer adept at untangling wind knots.In Rochester, workers at the Lincoln Branch Toy Library, a pioneer among the roughly 300 toy libraries across the country, keep tabs on thousands of board game parts, a particularly challenging task when summer day camps descend.\u201cIt takes vigilance,\u201d said Sarah Fitts-Romig, a librarian in Rochester who keeps a cache of spare game parts at the ready, including a large collection of shoe pieces from Monopoly. \u201cThe minute you start slipping, mass chaos reigns.\u201dIn Sacramento, each item in the Library of Things bears a bar code, since the Dewey Decimal System was not intended for sewing machines or ukuleles. Users were invited to vote on which items should be included in the collection, to \u201cgive people a sense of ownership of the library,\u201d said Rivkah K.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Says 11 Million Cars Worldwide Are Affected in Diesel Deception", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company also said it would set aside 6.5 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion \u2014 the equivalent of half a year\u2019s profits \u2014 to cover the cost of making the cars comply with pollution standards.In the United States, pressure was ramped up on Volkswagen, with attorneys general for New York and other states saying that they were forming a group to investigate the deceit, and Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, asking the Federal Trade Commission to begin an inquiry and look into remedies for owners.The automaker\u2019s 68-year-old chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, faced mounting pressure to take responsibility for the scandal and resign.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The German government said on Tuesday that it had begun an investigation of the company\u2019s conduct. So did the French government, joining Italy and South Korea among the countries looking into the matter.Mr. Winterkorn, with a reputation for delving deeply into the minutiae of automobile design and construction, became chief executive in 2007, two years before the deceptive software was evidently introduced with the 2009 model year. He continues to retain control over research and development.Volkswagen declined to say where the 11 million affected vehicles \u2014 more cars than Volkswagen produces in a year \u2014 were. But analysts said that as many as 10 million were probably in Europe, where Volkswagen is the dominant manufacturer, with more than double the market share of any competitor, and where diesels account for more than half of all vehicles sold.\u201cThere really aren\u2019t many diesel cars outside of Europe and North America,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London.The United States, as the second-largest car market after China, is crucial to Volkswagen\u2019s long-term strategy. But it accounts for only 6 percent of unit sales, compared with 40 percent in Europe and Russia. Problems in Europe are potentially a far greater threat to Volkswagen\u2019s financial strength and its ability to invest in new technologies that are expected to transform the industry in years to come.Revelations that Volkswagen cars may not be as environmentally responsible as its \u201cclean diesel\u201d advertising had promised are potentially even more damaging to the company\u2019s image in Europe than in the United States. Diesel vehicles account for more than half of all vehicles sold in Europe largely because of government policies that have made diesel fuels cheaper than gasoline, and because of less stringent emissions standards for diesels than in the United States.Volkswagen\u2019s majority shareholder, Porsche Holding, was silent on Mr. Winterkorn on Tuesday, but he faces questions by a subcommittee of the company\u2019s supervisory board on Wednesday.Earlier this year, Mr. Winterkorn had the support of most of the Porsche family in a power struggle with Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, the company\u2019s chairman at the time. Mr. Winterkorn prevailed and Mr. Pi\u00ebch resigned. But the family derives much of its wealth from Volkswagen and is said to be watching the diesel scandal with concern.German politicians also exert influence at the company because the state of Lower Saxony owns 20 percent.Volkswagen said on Tuesday that the scandal would cut deeply into this year\u2019s profit. And the company\u2019s shares plunged again, ending the day 35 percent below the closing price on Friday, before news of the diesel deception broke. As a result, the company\u2019s stock market value has declined about \u20ac25 billion in two days of trading.Volkswagen said on Tuesday there was a \u201cnoticeable deviation\u201d in the emissions that diesels equipped with so-called Type EA 189 engines produced during road driving, as opposed to a controlled setting. There are 11 million vehicles with that engine on the road, Volkswagen said. The cars are known to include Volkswagen Passat, Jetta, Golf and Beetle cars, as well as the Audi A3.Volkswagen officials admitted to officials in the United States that diesel cars sold there were programmed to sense when emissions were being tested and to turn on equipment that reduced them. At other times, the cars had better fuel economy and performance, but produced as much as 40 times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that can contribute to respiratory problems including asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.So far Volkswagen has not been accused of deliberately programming its cars to fool European regulators. And that may not have been necessary, because standards for diesels in Europe are not as strict, and testing and enforcement not as rigorous, as in the United States.Volkswagen said that its new VW and Audi diesels comply with the latest European standards. In the United States, the company said it would no longer sell the affected 2015 models and would not introduce its 2016 diesels. But Volkswagen intends to keep selling 2015 and 2016 diesels in Europe \u2014 for now, at least.The European Union has recognized, however, that cars that test well in the laboratory may pollute much more on the road, and it is tightening its standards.\u201cWe need to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Lucia Caudet, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said in a statement. \u201cFor the sake of our consumers and the environment, we need certainty that industry scrupulously respects emissions limits.\u201dIn his video on Tuesday, Mr. Winterkorn said, \u201cto be clear, manipulation and Volkswagen \u2014 this must never happen again.\u201dOn the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Nelson called for more scrutiny from federal regulators.\u201cIt is an outrage that VW would take advantage of its consumers by purposely deceiving them on their mileage on diesel vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cHas the corporate culture in what is an automobile society shrunk so low that we can\u2019t be upfront when our products are defective or when we are trying to gain competitive advantage?\u201dAaron M. Kessler contributed reporting from Washington, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement"}

He also cited the efforts of Ahmed Seddiqi & Sons, a 65-year-old family-owned retail operation with 65 outlets throughout the United Arab Emirates. He described the company as \u201cthe greatest, most important retailer in the Middle East,\u201d owing to its wide selection of watches from both well-known brands and independent makers.Created through a partnership of the Dubai Culture & Arts Authority, Ahmed Seddiqi & Sons and the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve, an annual watchmaking competition, Dubai Watch Week is to hold events in several venues in the Dubai International Financial Center and nearby Dubai Mall. Admission will be free, and sessions generally are to be public; some will require advance registration online, while others are reserved for the week\u2019s V.I.P. program members.\u201cPublic demand to know more about the watch industry is now at its peak,\u201d said Hind Seddiqi, chief marketing officer for Seddiqi Holdings, the retail operation\u2019s parent company. \u201cNow is the right time for us to launch a platform such as Dubai Watch Week.\u201dThe event joins the watch world\u2019s busy fall calendar, from Watches & Wonders, opening Sept. 30 in Hong Kong, to the seventh edition of SalonQP, to be held in mid-November in the Saatchi Gallery in London. The roster of international trade events has been growing in step with the market. In 2014, Switzerland exported a record $24.3 billion in timepieces, 4.6 percent of which went to the United Arab Emirates, an increase of 8.9 percent over 2013. The tally for the first seven months of 2015, however, reflects a more difficult environment: Exports to the United Arab Emirates are down 11.8 percent compared with the same period in 2014. In Hong Kong, the luxury watch industry\u2019s largest market, they have declined 20.8 percent.As the global economy grows more challenging, many people contend that such face-to-face events become even more critical to driving interest among buyers.\u201cOrganic growth is in new markets with nouveau millionaires and a growing middle class with a taste for luxury,\u201d said William Rohr, managing director of the online watch forum TimeZone.com and a Dubai Watch Week speaker. \u201cEvents create an environment for these potential clients where they can play with the watches and learn about them, asking directly the questions to the experts and watchmakers.\u201dAt the Dubai event, about 30 speakers are scheduled for what is called the Art of Horology Forum, including Aurel Bacs, president of the watch consultancy Bacs & Russo, which recently forged an association with Phillips auction house\u2019s new watch department (story, page S10). He is to lead a panel on the opening day, Oct. 19, on how to buy watches at auction. And on the closing day, Oct. 22, Mr. B\u00fcsser is to moderate a session with the renowned watchmaker Philippe Dufour on watchmaking\u2019s future. Organizers said they are expecting 400 visitors to the forum each day.They also say Dubai\u2019s readiness for a high-profile watch event of its own became clear in 2013, when the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve\u2019s annual traveling exhibition made its inaugural stop in the city. A number of excited collectors \u201cshowed up with their collections in their pockets,\u201d said Melika Yazdjeri, head of corporate communications for Ahmed Seddiqi & Sons. She also noted that more than 200 people attended the opening reception, surpassing expectations. The Grand Prix director, Carine Maillard, said she felt the enthusiasm, too. \u201cTwo years ago, we saw there was a real hunger to understand better the culture and passion around watchmaking,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it was so successful, we wanted to do a bigger event.\u201dOne of the Dubai exhibitions will feature the 72 timepieces vying for the Grand Prix\u2019s 16 annual prizes, to be presented in Geneva on Oct. 29. And the Seddiqi retail operation plans to showcase timepieces by independent makers it calls \u201cthe rebels of horology\u201d \u2014 including Stephen Forsey, co-founder of Greubel Forsey, and Felix Baumgartner, co-founder of Urwerk \u2014 part of its effort to define independence in an industry dominated by global luxury groups.\u201cAnybody can have Rolex,\u201d said Elizabeth Doerr, editor in chief of the watch website Quill & Pad, another speaker. \u201cBut to have that refined taste to carry independents, and to understand and sell them \u2014 that\u2019s spectacular.\u201dIt\u2019s also risky, considering their brand-oriented clientele. But the Seddiqis\u2019 commitment to independent makers is, to borrow a term beloved by luxury product marketers, part of the company\u2019s DNA. \u201cThe Seddiqi family trusted us and invested in our brand well before our present success,\u201d Mr. Baumgartner said. Mohammed Seddiqi, the retail company\u2019s senior vice president of sales and retail, is, by all accounts, the family\u2019s resident watch guru. \u201cYou sit down with him and you realize it\u2019s a love affair with timepieces,\u201d said Ms. Yazdjeri, the company\u2019s communications chief.Framing the Seddiqis as evangelists of fine watchmaking helps explain why the company is ready to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in Dubai Watch Week, even as they take pains to describe the event as a noncommercial endeavor intended to promote a market once overlooked by people serious about the business. \u201cPrior to the big recession in 2007-8, the tendency to purchase here was very different,\u201d Ms. Yazdjeri acknowledged. \u201cWe had clients saying, \u2018Show me the most expensive watch, or with more diamonds.\u2019 Over the past seven, eight years, we\u2019ve taken time to educate.\u201d Now, she continued, \u201cwe have 40 to 70 events per year organized by Seddiqi. Craftsmanship is something people need to understand and learn, and only then do they have a real appreciation for timepieces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Stanford Took On the Giants of Economics", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe center of gravity for economic thought in the United States has long been found along the two miles in Cambridge, Mass., that run between Harvard University and M.I.T. But there is new competition for that title, and it is quite a bit farther west.Stanford University has lured an all-star lineup of economists to Palo Alto, Calif., in the last few years \u2014 and fended off Harvard\u2019s and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s attempts to woo Stanford economists.And it is a reflection of a broader shift in the study of economics, in which the most cutting-edge work increasingly relies less on a big-brained individual scholar developing mathematical theories, and more on the ability to crunch extensive sets of data to glean insights about topics as varied as how incomes differ across society and how industries organize themselves.\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to be where the future of the world is being made?\u201d said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University (and regular contributor to The New York Times) who often blogs about trends in academic economics. Stanford\u2019s economics department, he said, \u201chas an excitement about it which Boston and Cambridge can\u2019t touch.\u201dIn economics, Stanford has frequently been ranked just behind Harvard, M.I.T., Princeton and the University of Chicago, including in the most recent U.S. News & World Report survey of graduate school rankings, conducted in 2013, and in calculations of which department\u2019s scholars are most frequently cited in academic literature. That might change. In the last four years, Stanford has increased the number of senior faculty by 25 percent, and 11 scholars with millions in cumulative salary have either been recruited from other top programs or resisted poaching attempts by those programs.That said, Stanford\u2019s reputation in the future may depend less on a few big-name recruits than on its ability to train the Ph.D.s whose scholarship is widely cited and reshapes important economic debates, or who become influential policy makers who advise presidents and lead central banks. The last 10 people to serve as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers have all had a Ph.D. from either Harvard or M.I.T. (the last without one was Janet L. Yellen, who left the job in 1999, and received hers from Yale). Among the Ph.D. economists who have exerted great influence on global economic policy in recent years, the former Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke; the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi; the retiring International Monetary Fund chief economist, Olivier Blanchard; and the Fed vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, all studied at M.I.T.Unsurprisingly, many of those with top East Coast programs view Cambridge\u2019s intellectual leadership role as safe. \u201cStanford\u2019s keen interest in recruiting Harvard faculty is testimony to our strength,\u201d said David Laibson, chairman of the Harvard economics department. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big target on our back because many of the world\u2019s most exciting, creative, and innovative scholars are on our faculty, and Stanford is rightly going for some of them.\u201d He notes that his department has lots of collaboration with other schools at Harvard, and that nearby M.I.T. and the National Bureau of Economic Research create a deep concentration of economic thinking, and said the department is on a recruiting push of its own.But the recent recruiting success of Stanford shows something broader about how the economics profession is changing. The specialties of the new recruits vary, but they are all examples of how the momentum in economics has shifted away from theoretical modeling and toward \u201cempirical microeconomics,\u201d the analysis of how things work in the real world, often arranging complex experiments or exploiting large sets of data. That kind of work requires lots of research assistants, work across disciplines including fields like sociology and computer science, and the use of advanced computational techniques unavailable a generation ago.6 PhotosThat trend is evident across leading economics departments \u2014 the traditional powerhouses have plenty of scholars doing work in the same vein, including work by Esther Duflo at M.I.T. on how to test ways to fight global poverty and by Roland G. Fryer Jr. at Harvard on the roots of racial inequality. But the scholars who have newly signed on with Stanford described a university particularly well suited to research in that vein, with a combination of lab space, strong budgets for research support and proximity to engineering talent.\u201cI was very happy where I was in Chicago, but it felt like there is a sense of excitement and really building something at Stanford,\u201d Mr. Gentzkow said. \u201cStanford as a university is in a really strong position right now, and has a lot of resources, and seems very committed to using those resources to build on the frontier of economics.\u201dRecent hires said that their compensation packages were about the same as their previous employers offered, though in some cases with more generous research budgets. Provost John W. Etchemendy argued that the university\u2019s recruiting had benefited from cross-departmental work as economists share ideas and resources with, for example, computer science and statistics departments.Mr. Roth, who joined Stanford from Harvard in 2012, cited his own work on kidney transplants as an example. He has led efforts to build a \u201cpaired exchange\u201d system through which people who cannot donate a kidney to a loved one because of a mismatch in blood type, antigens or antibodies can instead donate a kidney to a recipient who is a match and who has a donor willing and able to donate to the other recipient. He collaborates with colleagues from the medical and engineering schools. \u201cThis gets very computationally complex,\u201d he said.Mr. Chetty, meanwhile, saw benefits in the concentration of research that uses Big Data, large sets of research that are hard to compile and analyze. His work has examined, for example, whether the quality of a kindergarten teacher has long-lasting effects on a person\u2019s life and earnings.\u201cSome of the attraction of the Bay Area is simply the fact that there are exciting opportunities with data and methods and machine learning,\u201d he said. And that type of work requires lab space that more closely resembles that needed in the hard sciences \u2014 a fact Stanford has exploited.Less clear is whether the agglomeration of economic stars at Stanford will ever amount to the kind of coherent school of thought that has been achieved at some other great universities.The Chicago School, under the intellectual imprint of Milton Friedman, was a leader in neoclassical thought that emphasizes the efficiency of markets and the risks of government intervention. M.I.T.\u2019s economics department has a long record of economic thought in the Keynesian tradition, and it produced several of the top policy makers who have guided the world economy through the tumultuous last several years.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a Stanford school of thought,\u201d said B. Douglas Bernheim, chairman of the university\u2019s economics department. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a doctrinaire place. Generally doctrine involves simplification, and increasingly we recognize that these social issues we\u2019re trying to figure out are phenomenally complicated. The consensus at Stanford has focused around the idea that you have to be open to a lot of approaches and ways of thinking about things, and to be rigorous, thorough and careful in bringing the highest standard of craft to bear on your research.\u201dIn other words, it is less about the specific conclusion a scholar reaches, and more about how they get there.\u201cMy sense is this is a good development for economics,\u201d Mr. Chetty said. \u201cI think Stanford is going to be another great department at the level of Harvard and M.I.T. doing this type of work, which is an example of economics becoming a deeper field. It\u2019s a great thing for all the universities \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a zero-sum game.\u201dAnd in its recent recruiting, Stanford may have had a secret weapon, coming from the skies. \u201cEven the weather cooperated with us this year,\u201d Mr. Bernheim said. \u201cNine feet of snow in Boston this past winter couldn\u2019t have hurt.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Problems at Volkswagen Start in the Boardroom", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThat such a thing could happen at Volkswagen, Germany\u2019s largest company and the world\u2019s largest automaker by sales \u2014 202.5 billion euros last year \u2014 has mystified consumers and regulators around the world. But given Volkswagen\u2019s history, culture and corporate structure, the real mystery may be why something like this didn\u2019t happen sooner.\u201cThe governance of Volkswagen was a breeding ground for scandal,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, professor of finance and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cIt was an accident waiting to happen.\u201dOne measure of Mr. Pi\u00ebch\u2019s influence: In 2012, shareholders elected his fourth wife, Ursula, a former kindergarten teacher who had been the Pi\u00ebch family\u2019s governess before her marriage to Ferdinand, to the company\u2019s supervisory board.Although many shareholders protested her lack of qualifications and independence, they have little or no influence. Porsche and Pi\u00ebch family members own over half the voting shares and vote them as a bloc under a family agreement. Labor representatives hold three of the five seats on the powerful executive committee, and half the board seats are held by union officials and labor. Outside views rarely penetrate. \u201cIt\u2019s an echo chamber,\u201d Professor Elson said.I spoke this week to a longtime former senior Volkswagen executive, who agreed that a scandal, especially one involving emissions, was all but inevitable at Volkswagen. He cited the company\u2019s isolation, its clannish board and a deep-rooted hostility to environmental regulations among its engineers.The former executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he now works at a competing global automaker, said that Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen is based in Lower Saxony and the city with the highest per capita income in Germany, is even more remote and isolated than Detroit was in its heyday. \u201cThe entire economy is automotive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have a completely uncritical view of cars and their impact on the environment because they all make a living from the industry.\u201dMoreover, \u201cthere\u2019s no other company where the owners and the unions are working so closely together as Volkswagen,\u201d he said. Volkswagen \u201cguarantees jobs for over half the supervisory board. What management, the government and the unions all want is full employment, and the more jobs, the better. Volkswagen is seen as having a national mission to provide employment to the German people. That\u2019s behind the push to be No. 1 in the world. They\u2019ll look the other way about anything.\u201dFrom an employment standpoint, the company has succeeded. Volkswagen said it employed nearly 600,000 people last year to produce about 10 million vehicles. By comparison, No. 2 Toyota employed 340,000 to produce just under nine million vehicles.The problem, Professor Elson emphasized, is that maximizing employment shouldn\u2019t be a primary goal of a board, whose purpose is to monitor management for a company\u2019s investors and ensure the long-term health and profitability of a company.\u201cManagement\u2019s goal is to keep their jobs, and the unions\u2019 is to save jobs and benefits and create more,\u201d Professor Elson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental conflict.\u201dIn this regard, Volkswagen is similar to other large companies in Germany, which, under a policy known as co-determination, or Mitbestimmung, requires company boards to be equally divided between workers and members elected by shareholders. The model has come under sharp criticism from other eurozone members and pension funds outside Germany that invest in German companies.The Volkswagen scandal seems sure to intensify pressure for change, but Professor Roth was skeptical. \u201cThe unions won\u2019t give up co-determination without a fight,\u201d he said, \u201cand the German public is used to it.\u201dThe Volkswagen board has been especially slow to move on environmental issues, investing less in electric and hybrid engine technology than industry leaders.The former Volkswagen executive said Volkswagen\u2019s engineer-driven culture takes the notion even further. He said the engineers felt that the politicians were guilty of rank hypocrisy, especially in the United States, also grumbling that electric cars make no sense as long as power plants are burning fossil fuels.\u201cThere\u2019s an attitude of moral superiority there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe engineers think they know best.\u201dThat Volkswagen is nonetheless obliged to obey applicable environmental laws, he said, is a notion likely to fall on deaf ears in Wolfsburg, especially compared to demands to be No. 1 in sales. (The motive for the software evasion is widely believed to have been to increase sales of diesel-powered cars in the United States.)Such attitudes are hardly confined to Volkswagen, and a willingness to circumvent environmental regulations may emerge at other automakers. But Volkswagen\u2019s board may be especially insulated from outside opinion, given its paucity of independent directors.Considering the damage to Volkswagen from the still-unfolding scandal, its attitudes and approach to governance may have to change. Volkswagen faces a staggering number of investigations and lawsuits. Volkswagen said it set aside $7.3 billion, which doesn\u2019t seem nearly enough; legal fees are likely to run into the billions, and the Environmental Protection Agency alone could fine the company up to $18 billion. It also has to figure out how to recall the 11 million affected cars, since it still isn\u2019t clear how the company can remove the software and meet emissions standards without compromising automotive performance.Volkswagen shares were trading at about \u20ac160, or $180, last Friday before the Environmental Protection Agency announced its investigation. They have dropped about 30 percent in the days after the news broke, wiping out over $26 billion in shareholder value.A spokeswoman at Volkswagen declined to comment on the company\u2019s governance.Whether the company\u2019s insular corporate structure gives it the flexibility to manage successfully through the scandal remains to be seen. Given the serious financial and reputational damage, the long-term survival of Volkswagen is a real question. Professor Elson says he believes the company won\u2019t disappear.\u201cA board like this doesn\u2019t give investors a lot of confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through this eventually, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the German government ends up having to bail them out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It could be argued that without their plastic cladding and all-wheel drive, they are simply hatchbacks. That\u2019s O.K. Hatchbacks are far more useful than sedans. Fighting for your paycheck in this growing segment are the Fiat 500X, Mini Cooper Countryman, Buick Encore, Honda HR-V, Nissan Juke, Jeep Renegade, Kia Soul, Chevy Trax and Mitsubishi Outlander Sport.The CX-3, vaguely reminiscent of the discontinued Toyota Matrix in size and design, is for those who enjoy driving. The CX-3 isn\u2019t as sharp as the Miata; it rides higher with a softer suspension, but it\u2019s still the sport car of the category.Front-drive CX-3s begin at $20,840. All-wheel-drive Grand Touring models cost $27,120 and include an attractive interior trimmed with brushed aluminum and suede door panels. It\u2019s what an owner stares at the most, so why not make it stylish? Not that the flowing lines of the exterior lack appeal.Motivation comes from a 2-liter, 146-horsepower 4-cylinder engine with 146 pound-feet of torque low in the power band. The only gearbox is a 6-speed automatic with a manual mode for when you\u2019re in the mood. A sport setting remaps the gearbox and throttle response for cut and thrust city maneuvers.The Juke beats it off the line, but the CX-3 has decent power. It takes a hair over eight seconds to get from 0 to 60 miles an hour. Pushed hard, the engine makes itself heard, but over all it\u2019s nicely behaved.Based on the economy-minded Mazda 2 architecture, the CX-3 has more of a hefty premium feel to it. Don\u2019t expect Audi Q3 or BMW X1 sophistication, but the Mazda is quiet and comfortable for the price.The CX-3 and Honda HR-V pretty much tie when it comes to fuel economy with all-wheel-drive CX-3s scoring a government rating of 27 miles per gallon in the city, 32 highway. Front-drive models get 29/35.Unique touches on the Grand Touring include a head-up display that rises from the dashboard above the gauge hood. The chairs are sculpted for hard driving skirmishes. An extra $1,900 buys an option package that includes radar-assisted cruise control and automatic braking. That\u2019s stuff that was found only on luxury cars just a few years ago.Complaints? The folding armrest makes access to the interface knob (and more important, my coffee cup) awkward, even with the armrest up out of the way. The start button is also quite close to the wiper stalk.There\u2019s marginal room for average-size adults in back, but they may find the seat backs a bit upright.

{"Headline": "An Obama-Putin Meeting Makes Sense", "Date": "2015-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHowever distasteful he may find it, President Obama has no choice but to try to work with President Vladimir Putin if there is to be an end to the Syria debacle, just as Mr. Obama had no choice but to work with the Russian on the Iran deal. Thus a meeting of the two presidents on the relatively neutral ground of the United Nations General Assembly is the right thing to do. It thus seemed puerile for the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, to portray Mr. Putin as a beggar \u201cdesperate\u201d for a meeting and to belittle his personal appearance. That is not the way to prepare for a critical meeting.Still, it is easy to sympathize with Mr. Obama. Mr. Putin has openly defied international law and Western sanctions by his annexation of Ukraine and support of rebels in eastern Ukraine. His backing of Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad is one reason the Syrian civil war has dragged on so long and has created so appalling a humanitarian crisis. He routinely blames the United States for his troubles. For these and other reasons it is not easy for Mr. Obama to acknowledge that he needs Mr. Putin\u2019s cooperation.The hard truth, however, is that neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Putin is on particularly solid ground. The American effort to train moderate Syrians who could roll back both the Islamic State and the Assad forces has been a dismal failure; indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that ISIS cannot be confronted effectively without a political settlement in Syria between Mr. Assad\u2019s regime and the opposition, which may mean keeping Mr. Putin\u2019s client temporarily in power.The Russian president has his own problems. His economy has been battered by dropping oil prices and Western sanctions and he is smarting from Western ostracism over Ukraine. Syria gives him a chance to push Ukraine into the background and mount the global stage as an indispensable player. This, of course, is the role Mr. Earnest was seeking to deny him by depicting him as a thuggish supplicant.Mr. Putin may indeed be looking only for a spotlight. But the surest way to find out is for Mr. Obama to sit down with him and see whether there is anything Russia and America can do together in Syria. There is nothing demeaning in that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Prospect of Peace in Colombia", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverIf a final accord is signed within six months, as the negotiators have pledged, Colombia would offer an example of hard-won peacemaking at a time when so many other conflicts, which are spawning the largest wave of refugees since World War II, seem intractable.And yet, the mood in Colombia is far from celebratory.Some Colombians are outraged that militants who have committed war crimes could escape harsh punishment. Many doubt that a signed agreement, and even the formal disbandment of the FARC, will in fact stop the fighting. Others, including me, are guardedly optimistic about the opportunity this turning point represents.I was born in Colombia in 1981. The war against the FARC, which began as the armed wing of the country\u2019s Communist Party, had already lasted more than a decade. Initially, the FARC\u2019s mission was to change Colombia\u2019s rigid socioeconomic hierarchy, which had long kept power and wealth in the hands of a relatively small elite. In the early 1980s, fighting was largely confined to remote parts of the countryside and had not yet been turbocharged by the drug trade. Over the years, fueled by widespread poverty, entrenched inequality and the lucrative cocaine market, the war spread like a cancer, reaching the cities, poisoning politics, indelibly altering our national psyche.Washington\u2019s forceful intervention in the war, an intervention that began in the late 1990s, enabled the Colombian government to weaken the FARC and ultimately set the stage for peace negotiations.The talks have forced Colombians to take stock of a painful past and face uncomfortable truths. Dozens of victims traveled to Havana to speak about abuses they endured at the hands of guerrilla leaders. Some implicated government forces in brutal acts. When I met some young FARC members in Havana last year during a reporting trip, I came to see them in a new light as they described taking up arms as a desperate choice they were forced to make to survive.The special war tribunals the government intends to establish to start adjudicating crimes will be dismissed as kangaroo courts by those who would have favored a military defeat of the FARC. I would argue, though, that this path will give Colombians an opportunity to start building a fairer society, one in which merit and talent matter more than last name and pedigree.Addressing the root causes of the conflict will take generations. But doing so will become easier if the long process of reconciliation starts, if fighters see a viable path out of militancy, and if those who were forced to flee their homes feel it is possible to return and rebuild. Only then, will it be possible to make the broad institutional reforms that can improve the quality of education across the board, create new jobs, attract foreign investment, expand access to health care and bolster the economies of rural regions scarred by decades of war.Envisioning this future has always required a leap of faith. Wednesday\u2019s handshake doesn\u2019t fundamentally change that. But it gives me more faith than I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s well worth holding on to.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Expected to Name C.E.O. as Pressure Mounts on Company", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA leading candidate is Matthias M\u00fcller, who is in charge of the division of Volkswagen that makes Porsche sports cars, according to people close to the company\u2019s supervisory board, which meets on Friday. But those people said it was too early to confirm that a decision had been made.Mr. M\u00fcller, 62, leads a division that is untouched by revelations that VW used software in diesel cars to fool emissions tests in the United States. Porsche, along with the Audi division, accounts for most of the parent company\u2019s profit.The board that oversees the management of Volkswagen, the world\u2019s largest automaker, is also expected to announce further management changes as the company tries to quell the growing outcry over the deception.Still, pressure continued to mount on the company. On Thursday, Germany\u2019s transportation minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said that software might have been used to fool official emissions tests on millions of cars in Europe, not just in the United States.Mr. Dobrindt indicated that the 10 million cars in Europe with the diesel engines could be affected by the manipulation. If so, the Volkswagen software used to deceive emissions tests would have been more widely used than the company had disclosed.Volkswagen said on Tuesday that 11 million cars worldwide were equipped with the same software that the Environmental Protection Agency said was used to evade emissions tests in the United States. About half a million of those cars are in the United States, and analysts say about 10 million are in Europe.But it had been unclear whether the software was dormant in cars sold in Europe or actively used to evade pollution standards, as Volkswagen admitted was the case in the United States.As an indication that other European officials are growing wary, the European Commission on Thursday urged the 28 member nations of the European Union to test vehicles on their roads and report the findings. France indicated its intentions to begin random testing.Investors, too, have become nervous that the scandal could spread beyond Volkswagen. Shares of the rival German carmaker BMW fell on Thursday after a German auto magazine reported that one of BMW\u2019s models produced suspicious test results. BMW denied the accusation.The testing group cited in the article, which is the same group that raised early alarms about Volkswagen\u2019s deception, also questioned the validity of the magazine\u2019s report.Mr. Dobrindt said on Thursday that Volkswagens in Europe were also \u201caffected by the manipulations,\u201d although he added that officials were still investigating. He did not elaborate, and officials in his office did not answer their phones on Thursday. Volkswagen declined to comment.Mr. Dobrindt spoke in Berlin after German officials met with Volkswagen representatives in Wolfsburg, where the company is based. He said that cars with 1.6-liter engines were affected, not just those with two-liter engines.Volkswagen has been in crisis since revealing last week that cars with two-liter engines sold in the United States were equipped with software to detect when emissions testing was taking place and turn on features that lowered pollution levels.When the controls were off, levels of nitrogen oxide, a component of smog linked to respiratory ailments, could rise to 40 times the allowed amount, the E.P.A. said last week.Environmental groups have long complained that diesel vehicles often produce much more pollution under road conditions than when undergoing official tests, even if other companies were not cheating as blatantly as Volkswagen in the United States.In a statement, the European Commission said that it called on national authorities \u201cto look into the implications for vehicles sold in Europe and ensure that E.U. pollutant emission standards are scrupulously respected.\u201dS\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the French environment minister, said on Thursday that French authorities would conduct random tests on about 100 cars around the country to ensure that they met pollution standards and that they did not have software installed to cheat on emissions tests.\u201cManufacturers have assured me that in France, with French automakers, there is no fraud,\u201d she told the French broadcaster BFMTV after a meeting with carmakers. \u201cAnd what we have all agreed on is that today there had to be proof of what is being said.\u201dMr. Dobrindt, the German official, said that members of a governmental investigatory committee were continuing to question Volkswagen representatives and comb through documents at the company\u2019s headquarters.In addition, the Transportation Ministry had asked the emissions authorities to carry out lab and road tests on Volkswagen vehicles, as well as on cars made by other German automakers.\u201cWe will continue to intensively work together with Volkswagen to determine which cars are affected so that we can inform the public,\u201d Mr. Dobrindt said in Berlin.If the chief\u2019s job falls to Mr. M\u00fcller, Volkswagen would acquire a leader widely regarded as more approachable than Mr. Winterkorn, who was known for his autocratic style. Mr. M\u00fcller, however, might be seen as a transitional leader because of his age. And many commentators have said Volkswagen should bring in an outsider better able to fix flaws in the company that allowed the scandal to arise.After eventually overseeing all Audi and Lamborghini product lines, Mr. M\u00fcller was put in charge of all vehicle projects and brands for the parent company, the Volkswagen Group, before taking the top job at Porsche in October 2010.Nicola Clark, Aurelien Breeden and David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Watchmakers Have One Eye on Apple", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 There are lots of reasons why the Swiss watch industry has, in theory, at least, nothing to fear from the Apple Watch. After all, a $20,000 mechanical watch from Geneva is more than a way to tell the time. It is, as advertisements say, an heirloom that derives its value from aesthetics and craftsmanship, not an electronic device vulnerable to obsolescence in a few years or even a few months.Still, there is no doubt that Swiss watchmakers are keeping a very close eye on the smartwatch that Apple began selling in April. They are mindful of Apple\u2019s history of upending markets it has decided to focus on. And even as they reassure themselves that Apple will address a different kind of consumer, some Swiss watchmakers are readying products designed to compete.\u201cI have been sufficiently worried to make a connected watch,\u201d said Jean-Claude Biver, president of the watch division at LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and chief executive of its TAG Heuer brand, which plans to unveil a smartwatch in October in partnership with Google and the chip maker Intel. \u201cWe reacted very aggressively.\u201dBut while he takes the threat seriously, Mr. Biver insisted that the Apple Watch is more likely to help traditional timepiece makers than hurt them. Apple could help reverse a decline in watch sales among young people, he said.\u201cApple has such power, it will teach the younger generation to wear something on their wrists that is called a watch,\u201d Mr. Biver said by phone. \u201cWhen you teach someone to wear shoes, he will not go barefoot again.\u201dMr. Biver, one of the most outspoken executives in the watch industry, warned his peers not to be complacent about the Silicon Valley challenge. Apple\u2019s smartwatch has arrived as Swiss watchmakers face an array of other challenges and are particularly vulnerable. The strong Swiss franc makes products from Switzerland more expensive for customers paying in United States dollars or other major currencies. Sales in key Asian markets like Hong Kong have fallen this year.\u201cMany brands are reacting very softly,\u201d Mr. Biver said.Swiss watch exports rose 3.3 percent in June, compared with a year earlier, to 1.9 billion francs, or $2 billion, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. But the pace of sales growth has been slowing since last year and is likely to be flat for all of 2015, the federation said. In May, sales fell 8.9 percent from a year earlier, a drop some attributed to the introduction of the Apple Watch a few weeks earlier.\u201cWe do not fear smartwatches,\u201d said Jean-Daniel Pasche, the federation\u2019s president. \u201cBut,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cwe are aware of the fact that they can also be successful.\u201dMr. Pasche said many people have different watches for different occasions \u2014 a functional watch for sports or an elegant one for evening events \u2014 so they just as easily might own both a smartwatch and a traditional watch. And Mr. Pasche echoed Mr. Biver\u2019s comment that rather than stealing buyers from traditional watchmakers, Apple could help get young people interested in watches.Mr. Pasche added, \u201cOf course, we follow the development of this kind of product.\u201dIn terms of sheer volume, Apple could soon produce more watches than all of Switzerland. Analysts estimate that Apple sold anywhere from 1.5 million to five million watches from April through June, a number that is expected to grow. In contrast, the Swiss watch industry produced an average of 2.25 million timepieces a month during the first half of this year.In Europe, business managers are acutely aware of what happened to Nokia, the Finnish company that was long a showpiece of European technical savvy and business acumen. Once the dominant maker of mobile phones in the world and a pioneer in turning handsets into mobile computers, Nokia was caught unprepared by the Apple iPhone and pushed to the margins of the market. Last year Nokia sold its handset unit to Microsoft, which has struggled to gain market share and has cut thousands of jobs in Finland.Like Finland, whose economy suffered from its dependence on Nokia, Switzerland is susceptible to the ups and downs of the watch industry. Watches are Switzerland\u2019s third-largest export product, after chemicals and machinery, and the industry employs about 60,000 people.\u201cApple has this notoriety of completely disrupting industries,\u201d including the music and personal computer markets, said Tamar Koifman, lead strategist at Digital Luxury Group, a Geneva firm that does market research as well as digital advertising. Ms. Koifman said that lower-priced watch brands like Swatch (a Swiss company), Timex and Casio were the most threatened by the Apple Watch. But she also said that higher-end brands needed to be alert.Versions of the Apple Watch start at $349, but the company also has taken aim at the market\u2019s upper end. The Edition line includes two $17,000 watches, one with an 18-karat yellow gold case and the other in 18-karat rose gold, which contains some copper and silver to give it a pinkish hue.A few other luxury watchmakers have begun to respond to Apple by incorporating smartwatch functions in traditional products. Bulgari, another LVMH brand, has been displaying at trade fairs a concept watch implanted with a chip that could be used as a digital key for electronic locks or to authenticate credit card purchases.Montblanc, based in Hamburg, Germany, has a watch with a digital display embedded in the strap. It offers some smartwatch functions, like flight information; the watch itself is a traditional model.\u201cIf you think of the wrist as a piece of real estate, there is limited real estate,\u201d Ms. Koifman said. \u201cApple Watch could grab that real estate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s a possibility, but I propose a different interpretation. Coalition governments, rather than simply indicating domestic fragmentation, are also a sign that voters want different views to be represented in government. Pragmatic leadership seeks to build broad-based consensus for policy that bolsters the longer-term credibility of the reforms.India provides a useful case in point. The far-reaching economic reforms of 1991 that transformed India\u2019s economy were passed by a left-leaning minority government. Coalition governments passed the contentious India-U.S. civil nuclear agreement and reforms allowing foreign investment in the retail sector. In contrast, the current right-wing majority government, which came to power over a year ago to great fanfare from the business press, has been unable to live up to expectations and just had to back down on a signature land acquisition bill.

Cars are actually the best example of the public health approach that we should apply to guns.\u201d He goes on to mention seat belts and airbags, but excludes the fact that, to be allowed to drive an automobile, in most countries you must take a driver education course; pass a written test; and take an actual driving test with a qualified tester. If you buy a car, you must also buy insurance, have a yearly safety check, and be responsible for its use or any other person\u2019s use of that car. I propose the same regulations for gun ownership.

But, as most organizations do over time, the P.K.K. has evolved and no longer advocates separation from Turkey or an independent Kurdistan. It is fighting for what it calls \u201cdemocratic self-rule\u201d \u2014 a decentralization of power known in the West as federalism. In both Syria and Iraq, the P.K.K. is a de facto ally of the United States in the fight against the Islamic State. There is no real reason why the P.K.K. and American officials cannot cooperate to effect much-needed democratic changes in Turkey through peaceful means of dialogue and tripartite talks.Advertisement"}

Advanced Placement classes got $51 million. Every eighth grader can take algebra thanks to $19 million. And $15 million was proposed to provide more than 16,000 students with dedicated counselors from sixth through 12th grade.The cost of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s programs is high, and the political risks are great. Republicans in the State Legislature are already skeptical of the mayor\u2019s approach to education, and the results of his new programs will not be known for years. In June, the Legislature extended the mayor\u2019s control of schools by only one year, meaning that he has to go back to Albany next year to request an extension. (The Legislature had given former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg control for seven years, then a renewal for six.)In his speech, Mr. de Blasio argued that this investment in the city\u2019s struggling schools was a moral imperative.\u201cThere is a tale of two cities in our schools, and we simply don\u2019t accept it,\u201d he said, reprising the theme of his campaign. \u201cEach and every child, in each and every classroom, deserves a future that isn\u2019t limited by their ZIP code.\u201dBut many questions remain about how these programs will work and what the impact will be on the school system.But if the economy slowed down, the city would have to choose between backing off these programs or making cuts elsewhere. Mr. de Blasio could risk turning off voters if parents saw class sizes grow or extracurricular activities shrink further.\u201cWhere is the research that shows that these initiatives would narrow the achievement gap, as class size reduction has been proven to do?\u201d she said. \u201cDe Blasio made many promises during his campaign to parents and other voters to lower class size that he now appears to have forgotten completely.\u201dDavid C. Bloomfield, a professor of education leadership at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center, called Mr. de Blasio\u2019s speech \u201ca feel-good parade of accomplishments and helpful initiatives\u201d that was meant to bolster his chances for renewal of mayoral control of schools and re-election.He said it was striking that, in a speech titled \u201cEquity and Excellence,\u201d there was no mention of the high degree of racial segregation in New York City schools and ways to combat it.Mr. de Blasio did try to inoculate himself against critics who adhere to Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s education approach. In contrast with the Bloomberg administration, the current mayor opposes closing schools that perform poorly, except as a last resort. While Mr. Bloomberg was on a constant, and largely unsuccessful, mission to fire teachers he considered subpar, Mr. de Blasio has had a more amicable relationship with the city teachers\u2019 union.But he said on Wednesday that his administration had \u201chelped 660 educators find their way out of the New York City school system,\u201d from April 2014 to April 2015. Asked to elaborate, the Department of Education said that the number included teachers who had been fired or denied tenure, and who resigned while facing disciplinary action.\u201cThis shows we are willing and able to make the change that\u2019s necessary,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cWhere it\u2019s needed, we will replace school leadership or staff to transform a school if they cannot improve with our tailored and targeted support.\u201d\u201cAt the current rate, all New York City students won\u2019t be able to read at grade level until 2051,\u201d the group\u2019s chief executive, Jeremiah Kittredge, said in a statement. \u201cThe incremental change proposed today won\u2019t fix New York City\u2019s education inequality.\u201dMr. de Blasio set a number of long-term goals during the speech, including increasing the four-year high school graduation rate to 80 percent from 68 percent by 2026 (by which point he will have been out of office for at least four years).Some of the goals he set on Wednesday may be even more ambitious.\u201cExcellence and achievement cannot, should not and will not discriminate in New York City,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe have to make sure success is as common in East New York as it is on the Upper East Side.\u201dAn article on Thursday about Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s plans to help poor schools included an outdated figure for the amount of money in existing education funding that New York City is redirecting toward an effort to add social services and improve results at the city\u2019s 94 lowest-performing schools.

{"Headline": "Jobs Report Gives Ammunition to Both Sides of Fed Rate Debate", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriday\u2019s report from the Labor Department \u2014 which found that employers added a weaker-than-expected 173,000 jobs in August while the official jobless rate dipped to 5.1 percent \u2014 provided fodder for both camps to make their cases.The slowdown in job growth and the absence of any significant wage pressure could strengthen the arguments of those who see little risk in keeping borrowing costs exceptionally low and waiting not just for more encouraging data but also for unruly markets to settle down. On the other side, there were enough positive indicators to keep a September tightening in play, even as Wall Street looks more seriously at the possibility of a Fed move in October or at the central bank\u2019s last meeting of the year, in December.\u201cI don\u2019t think it changes anyone\u2019s views,\u201d said Michael Gapen, head of United States economic research at Barclays. \u201cIt\u2019s strong enough to keep the September-ists stuck on September and weak enough for everyone else who is looking for a later takeoff.\u201dThe report was hotly anticipated, mainly because it represents the last major piece of economic evidence the central bank will have on hand before its long-awaited meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.The August payroll increase was well below the 220,000 jump economists had predicted. But the unemployment rate\u2019s fall to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent in July bolstered the case that the job market was returning to a healthier state, similar to conditions before the recession.At that level, joblessness is nearing the threshold that economists and the Fed consider close to full employment; inflation foes worry that allowing the unemployment rate to fall significantly below 5 percent runs the risk of leading to an overheated economy.While millions of Americans are still struggling to find work that pays adequately, there are nascent signs that wages are finally beginning to rise. Average hourly earnings rose by a better-than-expected 0.3 percentage point in August.Most Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they think this year is the appropriate time to raise interest rates from near zero, where they have been since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008.But the exact timing of the decision has become an obsession on Wall Street, which has enjoyed a long period of ultracheap money that helped, until the last few weeks, feed a long bull market.For investors around the world, that sense of anxious waiting is only going to build after Friday\u2019s report, increasing the odds of more stock market swings. At the close of trading in New York, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down just over 1.5 percent, to 1,921.22. Bonds were little changed.Whenever the Fed decides to act, the initial rate increase will be small \u2014 a quarter of a percentage point \u2014 but it looms large psychologically because it will be the first increase in short-term rates by the Fed since June 2006.All this has contributed to a knife-edge quandary for Federal Reserve policy makers: Raise rates too soon and markets could plunge, economic momentum could fade and long-sought hopes for better-paying jobs could wither. Wait too long, however, and the Fed risks rekindling inflation and fostering speculative excesses on Wall Street.Not only did the jobs report do little to clarify the situation, the sharp sell-off in global markets recently further complicated matters.\u201cA month ago, this report and the other data on the economy would have created a strong rationale for raising rates at the September meeting,\u201d said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy. \u201cBut the world has changed and our expectation is now for a rate increase in December.\u201dIndeed, some Fed officials are warning that the recent market turmoil hints that the economic picture might turn darker.\u201cIn my view, these developments might suggest a downward revision in the forecast that is large enough to raise concerns about whether further tightening of labor markets is likely,\u201d Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said on Tuesday.The longer-term trend for job creation in 2015 has been fairly robust, even if wage gains have been disappointing. Since the start of the year, the average monthly payroll gain stands at 212,000. In addition, payroll gains for June and July were revised upward by 44,000.As has been the case all summer, hiring in blue-collar industries like manufacturing, construction and mining was weak last month, while white-collar sectors like financial activities and professional and business services were relatively strong.In fact, some employers in these fields are picking up the pace of hiring and offering higher salaries.Hyland Software, a Westlake, Ohio, company that helps businesses manage and retrieve documents digitally, is on track to hire 450 new workers this year and an additional 450 to 475 in 2016. That\u2019s well above the 250 to 350 employees it added annually between 2010 and 2014.With average starting salaries of $55,000 to $65,000 for software development and technical roles, these positions pay well, said Debbie Connelly, vice president for human resources at Hyland. But the company needs candidates with specific skills in software development and information management or credentials like an engineering or information systems degree.\u201cOver the last five years, starting salaries have increased as we compete for talent,\u201d said Ms. Connelly, noting that it is not always easy for a company in the Cleveland suburbs to lure workers who might be able to find similar jobs on the coasts.\u201cWe hire many of our candidates at the entry level from Ohio colleges and universities,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you grew up in Ohio, you\u2019re far more likely to accept a job and stay in Ohio after school.\u201dThere is yet another twist for the Fed to consider. The initial employment reports for August \u2014 for largely seasonal rather than fundamental factors \u2014 have a long history of coming in below the underlying trend, only to be revised upward later by the Labor Department.In addition, this year\u2019s monthly figures could also be in for a sizable revision because fewer businesses than normal responded to the government\u2019s survey.Only 69.9 percent of businesses reported their payroll change last month, the lowest rate in nearly four years, and well below the 79.4 percent average over the last 12 months.\u201cThat\u2019s a big difference,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. As those missing reports for August come in, she said, \u201cit could lift the revision for private sector hires.\u201dIn other words, while a monthly gain of fewer than 200,000 jobs the rest of the year might be considered weak, this month is different, said Robin Anderson, senior economist with Principal Global Investors in Des Moines. \u201cThe trend is so strong that one number alone won\u2019t derail the Fed,\u201d Ms. Anderson added. \u201cThese numbers are prone to revision, and you have to take the first estimate with a grain of salt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those wishing to come to the United States must apply through the United Nations, which has a presence in many refugee camps, and Mr. Earnest discouraged migrants from taking risky journeys and paying traffickers.\u201cRefugees go through the most robust security process of anybody who\u2019s contemplating travel to the United States,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cRefugees have to be screened by the National Counter Terrorism Center, by the F.B.I. Terrorist Screening Center. They go through databases that are maintained by D.H.S., the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. There is biographical and biometric information that is collected about these individuals.\u201dBut after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the number of refugees allowed into the United States slowed sharply, dropping to 27,131 in 2002. The numbers have risen steadily since then and last year amounted to 69,987 \u2014 just below a cap of 70,000. Most refugees need at least a year and sometimes two to navigate the system.Germany has talked about taking more than 800,000 Syrian refugees, thousands of whom have already flooded train and bus stations throughout Europe. Even Venezuela has promised to take 20,000 refugees.Mr. Earnest praised the German government and people as \u201cdemonstrating tremendous generosity and hospitality to these fellow human beings who are in a desperate situation.\u201d When asked whether he would use the same adjectives to describe the United States response, Mr. Earnest said that \u201cthe challenge that is facing Germany right now is different than the challenge that we\u2019re facing.\u201dOn Capitol Hill, the divisions about how to respond to the crisis were almost as stark as those around the Iran nuclear agreement, on which senators voted Thursday.Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, said the United States needed to help refugees return to their homes as quickly as possible. \u201cI do not favor every war zone turning into hundreds of thousands, even millions of refugees that flee the country to go to other countries that otherwise they wouldn\u2019t meet the immigration standards,\u201d he said.Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said Mr. Obama needed to ask for more money from Congress to deal with the crisis. \u201cAnd maybe it would be nice if he would admit that it\u2019s his fault that it happened,\u201d said Mr. McCain, who has advocated a far more robust military response to the Syrian crisis. \u201cThose people\u2019s lives are on his hands.\u201d\u201cI think the number has to be higher, but as I mentioned, we have a process, we have to be careful that each one of them is vetted so there\u2019s no threat,\u201d Mr. Durbin said.Senator Chris S. Murphy of Connecticut said there were risks in doing nothing, too. \u201cDo we think we make this country more or less safe from terrorism by showing a cold-heartedness to this refugee crisis?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think the answer is no.\u201dOn Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill that the total number of refugees taken in by the United States could rise to more than 100,000, from the current figure of 70,000. State Department officials said that not all of the additional 30,000 would be Syrians, but many would be. But Mr. Earnest said that members of Congress \u201cmisunderstood\u201d Mr. Kerry, and that the number of refugees would not rise to 100,000 next year but might in later years.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s remarks at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill.

{"Headline": "What Britain Wants From European Union Is Not Clear, France Says", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With a referendum on the horizon on whether to remain in the European Union, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has toured the Continent, wooing his counterparts to try to win changes to Britain\u2019s conditions for membership in the 28-nation bloc.But on Thursday, a senior figure in the French government said it still did not know what Britain wanted, despite discussions with Mr. Cameron and with George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer.Speaking to reporters at the French Embassy in London, Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, said he wanted to help the British government secure a fair agreement that would persuade Britons to vote to remain in the union.But when asked what he thought of Britain\u2019s current proposals, Mr. Macron replied, \u201cWhich proposals?\u201d\u201cThe first step is for the British government to clarify its requirements,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cI can understand some requirements for competitiveness, for red tape cuts and so on, and I think we are very much in line with that. After that, the question is all the details.\u201dMr. Cameron has outlined broad objectives, including a safeguard to prevent countries that use the euro currency from discriminating economically against Britain, which does not use the euro; a stronger role for national parliaments in European Union decision making; and stronger European competitiveness.But French officials said Britain had not explained how it would accomplish some of these specific goals without contravening the fundamental principles of the European Union, which, for example, require all Europeans to be treated equally. Britain may be keeping silent to keep maximum flexibility in the negotiations. But that strategy appears to have frustrated France, and probably others, and to have left the negotiations in flux.In response to the comments, Mr. Cameron\u2019s office issued a statement saying, \u201cFrom the outset, we have engaged closely with the French during this negotiation,\u201d and adding that Britain had outlined the main areas where it wants revisions.Mr. Cameron met with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France this week at Chequers, the prime minister\u2019s country retreat, to update Mr. Hollande on the talks and \u201cfurther discuss how we can work together to secure these reforms,\u201d the statement said.European Union leaders are supposed to discuss Britain\u2019s demands at a meeting in December, and Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, gave an upbeat assessment this week.\u201cDiscussions with our partners in European capitals are progressing well, as are the ongoing technical talks in Brussels,\u201d said Mr. Hammond, who has visited 26 European Union capitals to discuss union revisions. \u201cWe are confident that we will be able to negotiate a package that addresses the concerns of the British people.\u201dMr. Macron of France said the crisis over refugees showed that an \u201c\u00e0 la carte Europe is not feasible because it just means that, progressively, you kill the European idea.\u201dHe called on the 19 countries that use the euro to contemplate new steps in integration, including the creation of a eurozone budget and an investment fund, adding that a failure to do so could result in the \u201cdismantling\u201d of the single-currency project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frantic Evacuation in California Left Animals to Face Wildfire Alone", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in a drought-parched state, that luck was bad. The blaze, 30 percent contained after consuming 67,200 acres, has killed one person and injured four others, with 585 homes destroyed and the state of hundreds more uncertain, according to state fire officials. More than 7,600 structures remained threatened. Financial and personal losses, still uncounted, will be unquestionably staggering.Vineyard owners, many of them in midharvest when the fire struck, have begun adding up the effects of heat and smoke, which can damage grape quality even if vines survive. Farm equipment and hundreds of outbuildings and barns lay in ruins, with smoking embers mixing in places with the harshersmells of oil and melted machinery. Many vineyard and farmworkers were also displaced by the damage to housing, raising questions about whether they will stay around through what could be a long economic recovery. The effect on fruit trees that often burn more readily than water-saturated grape vines \u2014 Lake County is at the heart of California\u2019s pear-growing region \u2014 remains uncertain as well. Prevailing winds have so far mostly spared grape harvests south of the fires, in Napa County, though growers there say they are not out of danger.Three large fires are raging in California and have consumed more than 270,000 acres.But the rural nature of this part of California added another pain to the equation for thousands of evacuated residents: the animals that people had to leave behind. Those animals included pets but also hundreds of horses for breeding or show, goats and sheep that are financially important in a farming economy.Crews of volunteers and veterinarians, aided by animal control officers on loan from nearby counties \u2014 and besieged by evacuated residents who have bombarded animal shelters with anguished questions and pleas \u2014 have begun an arduous task of triage and organization. Even as the fire continues to rage and evacuees try to find out if they still have homes, volunteers are rescuing and healing animals, dispatching crews with food and water to aid stranded animals and then reconnecting them with their owners.Bob Young, who lives near Hidden Valley Lake, had time, and a trailer big enough, to take all of his horses but two. \u201cThat was very hard,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, he was back and felt lucky, he said, that both horses had survived, though with injuries. Horses have been found wandering down the highway, dazed disaster survivors with cuts and scrapes from the fences they broke through or jumped. Cats, perhaps more prone to panic, were seen dashing into burning homes, and certain death. A dog apparently sheltered her two 8-week-old pups, and all three survived, though the mother had smoke inhalation injuries. Pets from bearded dragons to cockatoos have been brought in.Some of the survivor stories that animal rescue workers are telling hint at luck or fate, or maybe some animal intelligence.On Monday, for example, volunteers stumbled on a kind of sanctuary: Five horses, two donkeys and seven goats had found shelter in a tiny depression of earth about 20 feet wide by 50 feet long as fire burned everything around them. Corrals were melted. A school bus was gutted nearby. But the animals, hunkered down in the middle of the inferno in the one place that did not burn, were barely scathed.\u201cThey\u2019re herd animals; they followed each other in there,\u201d said Milt Fletcher, a volunteer from nearby Yolo County, shaking his head as he told the story.Others were less fortunate.One wandering horse was struck by a vehicle and killed, and at least three died of smoke or fire in a pasture they could not escape. A badly burned goat was euthanized at the animal hospital, as was at least one cow. Burned kittens were evacuated to a bigger hospital at the University of California, Davis, where students were volunteering to help with treatment.\u201cThere\u2019s a cow right in there we found yesterday,\u201d said John Madigan, a professor of epidemiology at the university\u2019s veterinary school who was volunteering here. He slowed his pickup truck in front of a gutted, charred barn. Animals that were confined there died, he said, while those that were not confined survived.Professor Madigan, who trains students in emergency animal rescue, said some places prepared better than others for the nonhuman implications of disaster. Texas A & M University, for example, has an extensive animal rescue training program, he said, because of hurricane threats. Southern California has also faced far more fire than these northern woods, and residents there know that evacuation plans should include animals. But the roaring pace of the blaze here set a clock, he said, that no one could keep up with.\u201cWhen you have something that explodes in the middle of the night and people don\u2019t have a chance to respond, this is what you\u2019re ended up with: The owners have left, and the animals are left behind,\u201d Professor Madigan said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably 400 unburned houses here that could have animals in them, and there\u2019s no one to care for them.\u201dAt Middletown Animal Hospital, workers are preparing identification sheets for each animal found. Facebook pages will be set up, Teresa Axthelm, the hospital\u2019s practice manager, said, \u201cwhen the chaos has lifted a bit.\u201dWater is an urgent need, said Jeffrey J. Smith, the hospital\u2019s owner. Many homes and farms depend on wells, and the power failures that are widespread because of downed electrical lines have crippled the ability to pump water. As a result, volunteers have been hauling out buckets from swimming pools, the water still hot from the flames. Ashley Southall contributed reporting from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At WeWork, an Idealistic Start-Up Clashes With Its Cleaners", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver in the communal area, entrepreneurs mingled. Here was the shared kitchen, with cold-brew coffee and organic snacks. How cool is that? Over there was the quiet room, with mood lighting and hammocks. Wasn\u2019t it awesome? Mr. Neumann pulled out his iPhone and checked WeWork\u2019s app, where members \u2014 as WeWork calls its customers \u2014 can find jobs and team up with one another on new socially responsible ventures. Talk about disrupting business as usual.In just five years, Mr. Neumann and WeWork\u2019s other co-founder, Miguel McKelvey, have built their start-up into an office-space rental empire, with 52 locations in 16 cities around the globe. An office utopia designed for millennials \u2014 at first mostly freelancers trying to escape their apartments, but now also small businesses and corporations trying to lure the creative class \u2014 WeWork was, until recently, valued at $5 billion. Then in June, it sought another round of financing, getting huge investments from Fidelity Management and others. Its new valuation: $10 billion.Mr. Neumann grew up on a kibbutz in Israel; Mr. McKelvey grew up in a collective in Oregon. They frequently cite their origin stories in explaining their belief that office space should emphasize community and serendipitous connection \u2014 and that the company is a force for good. They call their customers the We Generation.\u201cIf you understand that being part of something greater than yourself is meaningful,\u201d Mr. Neumann said, \u201cand if you\u2019re not driven just by material goods, then you\u2019re part of the We Generation.\u201dSo Mr. Neumann seems more than a little perplexed to find himself defending WeWork against charges that it is a callous, anti-labor corporation, less concerned with people than profits.WeWork\u2019s headaches stem from a complicated dispute with a group of men and women who once cleaned WeWork locations. With its aspirations to be an office-rental paradise, it couldn\u2019t have sticky floors by the free craft beer keg, or trash collecting under the Ping-Pong tables.But that routine decision came back to haunt WeWork. When the New York City cleaners \u2014 who made about $10 an hour and received no benefits or paid time off \u2014 tried to unionize in June, CBM terminated its contract with WeWork and eliminated the jobs. WeWork decided to hire its own in-house cleaning staff but will not hire all the former CBM workers, leaving about 100 people jobless.The result has been a showdown between new economy and old. All summer, the cleaners protested outside WeWork offices around New York, blowing whistles and chanting: \u201cWeWork, shame on you! WeWork, shame on you!\u201dOn a humid night in late August, a few days before Mr. Neumann gave his office tour, the protesters were outside company headquarters on West 18th Street. After months of avoiding direct confrontation, Mr. Neumann decided to try to convince his antagonists that he was a good guy who had done nothing wrong.At first he cited the letter of the law. \u201cWeWork was not hiring any of you. It was all done through CBM,\u201d Mr. Neumann pleaded. \u201cThey were your employers, not me.\u201dThat didn\u2019t work. The cleaners said they had worn WeWork T-shirts, gotten to know the company\u2019s staff and customers, and believed WeWork had a responsibility to them.Next, Mr. Neumann tried empathy. \u201cWhen I was a little kid, me and all my family lived in a house the size of my daughter\u2019s room,\u201d he said.The cleaners were not impressed.Finally, Mr. Neumann explained that WeWork was now hiring its own cleaners, paying them $15 to $18 an hour, and offering health care along with equity in the company. \u201cThis company is going very far,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stock, God willing, is very valuable.\u201dMr. Neumann seemed to believe his logic and magnanimity would make the problem go away: If only the cleaners had all the facts, they wouldn\u2019t be so upset. But to the now unemployed janitors who had toiled for low wages and with no benefits, all while wearing WeWork uniforms, the company\u2019s wonderful new terms felt like a slap in the face.When one protester reminded Mr. Neumann that his company was worth $10 billion, he waved the thought away, his hand swatting the air. \u201cThat has nothing to do with this,\u201d he said, turning to the next question.Perhaps they are separate issues for Mr. Neumann. But to many onlookers, it\u2019s hard to understand why a company with so much money won\u2019t help the unemployed men and women who once cleaned its floors.WeWork may be a fast-growing darling of the so-called sharing economy, but it is also one that leases lots of conventional real estate \u2014 about two million square feet. And by simply doing business as usual and hiring a contractor to provide cleaning services, it inadvertently stumbled into a fight that exposes the paradoxes of today\u2019s lopsided labor market.In recent decades, outsourcing cheap labor for tasks like security, mail sorting and food services has become routine for American corporations.\u201cMany parts of what used to be integrated businesses are now handled through subcontracting,\u201d said Jennifer Gordon, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law specializing in immigration and employment.Subcontracting makes plenty of economic sense. Companies can keep the head count down and avoid health care and benefit obligations. Contractors can do what they do best \u2014 provide specialized services at competitive rates. But by striving to win assignments, contractors often pay employees as little as possible.For workers, this dynamic can be maddening. Ivan Castelan began cleaning WeWork spaces three years ago. He started out tidying kitchen areas and keeping the coffee fresh; over time his responsibilities expanded to include managing inventory and placing orders for supplies. Yet when he wanted to negotiate a raise, Mr. Castelan was stymied at every turn.\u201cWhen I asked WeWork for more money, they told me to talk to CBM,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I asked CBM for more money, CBM said WeWork had to approve the raise. It was frustrating.\u201dSuch situations are typical in subcontracting situations. WeWork may not have been Mr. Castelan\u2019s direct employer, but it was the one with the ability to improve conditions for him \u2014 and other cleaners. It could have paid CBM more and then insisted CBM pay its workers higher wages, or it could have hired a new contractor that paid better. CBM, meanwhile, had little incentive to push WeWork, a powerful client, to raise salaries.\u201cThe law says CBM is the employer, but if you look at the reality of how wages are set, it\u2019s the firms higher up the chain that really control what the wages will be,\u201d Ms. Gordon said. \u201cWeWork has all the power. It has the money, and it has the control.\u201dBut for now, a company like WeWork has no obligations to look out for the employees of a contractor like CBM. \u201cMorally, I would argue that they absolutely have a responsibility,\u201d Ms. Gordon said. \u201cBut legally it\u2019s much more complicated.\u201dMr. Neumann is a tall, exuberant 36-year-old Israeli who wears his dark hair to his shoulders. He came to the United States in 2001, \u201cchasing the American dream,\u201d he told the protesters during their showdown in the street last month. \u201cI came wanting to change the world.\u201dHe founded a baby clothing company but walked away from it after his wife observed that he wasn\u2019t passionate about apparel. Next, he started an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn with his friend Mr. McKelvey and other investors. Wanting more control of the product, he sold his stake in that company and founded WeWork with Mr. McKelvey, a former store designer for American Apparel.The official mission of WeWork is \u201cto create a world where people work to make a life, not just a living.\u201d And as a spokesman for the altruistic We Generation, Mr. Neumann is dismayed that the union is demonizing him. \u201cWe care about this topic so much,\u201d he said.The cleaners, however, say that Mr. Neumann passed up a critical opportunity to demonstrate his concern. When they began organizing this summer, CBM asked WeWork to change its contract in order to pay the cleaners higher wages and allow them to join a union \u2014 though a union of CBM\u2019s choosing. But WeWork declined to renegotiate, saying the CBM proposal was \u201csketchy.\u201d CBM terminated its contract with WeWork.CBM did not respond to numerous emails and phone calls.Mr. Neumann said CBM\u2019s action only accelerated the inevitable: Even before the protests began, WeWork had been planning to make the cleaning jobs in-house.CBM was hired years ago as WeWork was quickly growing throughout New York, its home base. \u201cIt was one of a thousand decisions we were making at the time,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cIt was about who can supply us a service and what can we afford.\u201dBut this year, Arthur Minson, who had been the chief financial officer of Time Warner Cable, joined WeWork as chief operating officer. Mr. Minson quickly soured on CBM and determined that WeWork should hire its own staff. \u201cWe were a five-star brand with one-star cleaning,\u201d he said.Though hiring in-house cleaners would fly in the face of decades of conventional business wisdom, Mr. Minson said it was a necessary move for WeWork. Janitors interact with WeWork members constantly and need to be steeped in its corporate culture. Mr. Minson also wanted to give cleaners expanded responsibilities, like preparing offices for new tenants and delivering food to conference rooms.\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in in-sourcing member-facing functions,\u201d Mr. Minson said. \u201cIf you want to build a powerful brand in the services industry, you have to.\u201dAfter CBM terminated its contract, WeWork began hiring about 100 so-called community service associates to clean its New York offices. It offers $15 to $18 an hour, as well as benefits, sick days and a small amount of stock. Over all, the cost per employee is about twice as much as what WeWork was paying CBM. Mr. Minson said WeWork would expand the model to other cities. (WeWork still uses CBM in Boston and Washington.)As the new positions were filled, WeWork refrained from hiring CBM workers because of a no-hire clause in its contract. WeWork said that it asked CBM to waive that restriction, but that CBM initially declined. When CBM finally did waive it, WeWork had already hired many new cleaners, leaving few open jobs.The local Service Employees International Union chapter, which has been working with the former WeWork cleaners, contends that WeWork intentionally avoided hiring former CBM workers so it could prevent pro-union cleaners from joining the company and trying to organize. The S.E.I.U. filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging as much, but the board has not yet taken any action. WeWork denies the claim.In recent weeks, after CBM waived the no-hire clause, WeWork hired about 20 of the laid off cleaners. But it appears unlikely that all, or even the majority, will ever be part of the WeWork family.Nathalie Torralba, who had cleaned in WeWork\u2019s offices for 18 months, said she had interviewed for one of the new positions weeks ago but had not heard back. Mr. Castelan has also applied, but has not been hired.\u201cThey decided to hire new employees and give them what we were asking for,\u201d Mr. Castelan said. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201dThe very attributes that have made WeWork so successful have also exposed it to this bruising labor brawl. As Mr. Neumann is finding out, the We Generation cares about janitors, too.Jane Barratt, who runs an investment platform called GoldBean and has worked out of a WeWork space in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood for 18 months, canceled her membership after mounting frustrations with the company, including over what she said was poor customer service and the labor dispute. \u201cThe treatment of the cleaners was the last straw,\u201d she said.More than 500 WeWork members signed a petition demanding that the company hire the former CBM cleaners as community service associates. Julie Sygiel, the founder of an underwear company called Dear Kate that is operated from a WeWork space in New York, recently delivered the petition to Mr. Minson, accompanied by two former cleaners.\u201cI believe WeWork has a responsibility to commit to rehire all qualified former cleaners who have applied for a new position,\u201d Ms. Sygiel said after the meeting.By any conventional measure, those figures do not support a $10 billion valuation. Like other start-ups, including Uber and Airbnb, WeWork is part of what many critics are describing as a new technology bubble. Yet WeWork is anticipating huge growth as it expands rapidly and gains corporate clients renting hundreds of desks each. It forecasts nearly $1 billion in profit on sales of $3 billion by 2018, according to the documents.The number that matters most to the cleaners who were fired, however, is not revenue or profit. It\u2019s that $10 billion valuation. That number made WeWork\u2019s behavior that much harder to understand. If any company can afford to pay janitors a living wage, they figured, it is WeWork.\u201cIt was clear to everyone including the workers that this is a company that is doing very well,\u201d said Rachel Cohen, an S.E.I.U. organizer. \u201cWhy would they be using a cleaning contractor that is paying substandard wages?\u201dFacebook recently faced its own version of WeWork\u2019s conundrum when the bus drivers who ferried its workers from San Francisco to Silicon Valley, and worked for a subcontractor, demanded better pay. Facebook responded by announcing that all employees of its major contractors would receive at least $15 an hour, paid vacation and sick time, and parental benefits.Whether WeWork brings all cleaning jobs in house or continues to use contractors, its growing footprint means it will have to be more attuned to the people who clean and maintain those spaces.Cristian Diaz, 25, moved to Queens from Colombia in 2012 and quickly began cleaning at WeWork spaces around the city. But despite long hours and no vacations, Mr. Diaz said his $10 hourly wage left him with almost nothing to send home to his parents in Medell\u00edn. \u201cWe were just getting by,\u201d he said. He supported joining the union, hoping it would mean better pay and benefits.Mr. Diaz, who has been out of work for a month, applied for a new job with WeWork, but has not been offered one.On the sweltering night in August when Mr. Neumann squared off with the cleaners on West 18th Street, he called for calm after some heated exchanges, and delivered a soliloquy that would be the final word for the evening.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying, \u2018God truly helps those who help themselves,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI understand your heart. I know everybody here is trying to help. You keep pursuing a job at WeWork. If you\u2019re the right fit, you will get a job, because we\u2019re interested in the right people. We\u2019re going to keep growing. But we\u2019re very comfortable with our position. We will definitely not be blackmailed, pushed or aggressively moved into anything. That will not happen. Not in this country, because this is a great country where freedom comes first.\u201d\u201cI feel you, I understand,\u201d Mr. Neumann continued. \u201cI do not think you have all the facts. I don\u2019t think you know everything that happened, but I know life is tough that way. So I will keep doing my best to make the most difference I can \u2014 first in your lives and my employees\u2019 lives, and in the world.\u201dWith that, Mr. Neumann turned and walked into the office of his $10 billion start-up. It was as if he had been speaking in a foreign tongue. The front door had not shut when the chanting resumed: \u201cWeWork, shame on you! WeWork, shame on you!\u201dAdvertisement"}

People smuggling, chiefly from Syria and the Horn of Africa, is now a multibillion-dollar business that is as profitable, if not more so, than the trade in illegal narcotics.This is not the trafficking of migrant labor or women for sexual purposes. These criminal gangs are effectively offering travel-agent services to desperate people fleeing conflict. Their services can include false documentation, bribes to border guards and transport, in dangerous, often deadly, circumstances.Sadly, the measures countries are taking to counteract the flood of refugees serve only to make organized crime stronger. As long as European countries fail to implement a plan to take in refugees across member states, the business of people smuggling will continue to grow.It has been almost a decade since I first argued that organized crime should be seen as a priority for resources above the more emotive issue of combating terrorism. The crisis in Europe demonstrates just how devastating the impact of organized crime can be, through both the exploitation of defenseless refugees and the undermining of legitimate governments at a time when countries on Europe\u2019s periphery are facing daunting economic challenges.Every day smugglers are extracting huge sums for risky journeys. A recent BBC investigation exposed a group in Turkey charging $1,200 for a place in a rubber dinghy filled with 40 or more people crossing the Aegean from Bodrum to the island of Kos in Greece. Let\u2019s do the math: One entirely dispensable rubber dinghy traveling the 15 miles to Greece nets the gang $48,000. If the boat goes down, they don\u2019t care \u2014 they\u2019ve already been paid.Richer refugees can afford a bespoke package that offers transit all the way from Turkey or Lebanon to a named European Union country. But most have to part with large amounts of cash every stage of the way. Merchants take advantage of the migrants\u2019 desperate situation by charging exorbitant prices for essentials. One researcher from Amnesty International spotted a bottle of water being sold in Presevo, southern Serbia, for $10.The crisis has breathed new life into well-established criminal groups. Their geographical bases remain the same as they were in the 1990s: Albanians in Kosovo, northern Macedonia and southern Serbia; Greeks in Thessaloniki; Serbs in Belgrade; Bulgarians along their borders with Serbia, Macedonia and Turkey. All maintain close links with Turkish syndicates where refugees often start their journey to the European Union.The Balkan Peninsula is a mountainous region on the key route between Europe and the Middle East that for centuries was on the fault line where the Austrian, Russian and Ottoman empires met. Local groups there are used to smuggling whatever is in demand \u2014 weapons, drugs, women or refugees \u2014 and they can adapt with alacrity.At the moment, the trade has shifted to refugees. This is a labor-intensive operation, and so the syndicates have been furiously recruiting. Europol, the law enforcement body based in The Hague that facilitates cooperation among Europe\u2019s police forces, has registered an astonishing 29,000 individuals in this year alone whom it suspects of involvement in people smuggling inside Europe. There are many more thousands based in Syria itself, Lebanon and across North Africa.In the past 15 years, Balkan governments have expended huge efforts to reduce the levels of crime and corruption.Much of this good work now threatens to be undone as the syndicates exploit the chaos on Europe\u2019s periphery to refill their coffers, expand their recruitment and further exert their corrupting influence on governments. In times of instability, criminal structures grow deep roots quickly, which are very tough to remove, especially in struggling economies.Organized criminal syndicates have changed rapidly since the fall of Communism. They were among the first institutions to exploit globalization to the full. With the expansion of new markets around the world and the emergence of a vast lawless zone for the best part of a decade from Yugoslavia in the west to Russia\u2019s border with China in the east, the 1990s saw a remarkable upturn in the provision of illicit goods and services around the world.Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, told me that this has affected \u201ca move away from the traditional family structures of organized crime towards one that is much more multinational.\u201d Add to this the exceptional value of mobile technology and social media networks to criminals, and this renders policing the refugees all but impossible.This refugee crisis will not go away until a solution to the war in Syria is found, and there is no prospect of that in the near future. So it is imperative in the short term that barriers are brought down. In the last week, borders have been closed, walls built and armed forces deployed. In response, the smuggling groups in the Balkans are simply raising their prices to guide people across the ever more treacherous borders. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation for all those refugees, whether in Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia or Hungary, reaches crisis levels.The European Union must agree on and implement a policy for taking refugees across its member states as soon as possible. There are 500 million people in the European Union, and it is perfectly capable of absorbing a further two million, especially since the aging population is already placing immense strains on the Continent\u2019s long-term economic prospects. Many of the refugees from Syria are highly educated and a significant potential asset to the union. Allowing them to stagnate in makeshift camps where despair and criminality are spreading will benefit nobody in the host countries except for those running the underground economy on which the refugees increasingly depend.The Balkans have come a long way since the wars of the 1990s, but there are still major unresolved political and economic challenges, especially in Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, Albania and Macedonia. The longer Europe dithers over its refugee policy, the greater the strain on these countries, not the least being the growing influence of corrupt and criminal structures.Misha Glenny is the author of \u201cMcMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Response to Stock Plunge Rattles Traders", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Communist Party\u2019s response to China\u2019s monthslong stock market crisis has been swift and forceful. In addition to spending as much as $235 billion to buy shares and bolster prices, the authorities have imposed a range of extraordinary restrictions on the sale of stocks \u2014 and backed them with the full weight of a security apparatus usually more focused on political dissent than equity trades.After decades of watching China make slow but steady progress in building Western-style financial markets, many are now asking whether the party is reversing course \u2014 and whether Chinese officials are willing to tolerate the sometimes turbulent waves of selling that are inherent to such markets.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in China is definitively spooking people,\u201d said Dawn Fitzpatrick, the chief investment officer of O\u2019Connor, a $5.6 billion hedge fund owned by UBS. \u201cThey\u2019ve set themselves back a couple of years\u201d in terms of attracting investment, she added.Anxiety in the industry surged last week after Li Yifei, the prominent China chief of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded hedge fund, disappeared and Bloomberg News reported that she had been taken into custody to assist a police inquiry into market volatility. Her employer, the London-based Man Group, did little to dispel fears, declining to comment on her whereabouts.Ms. Li resurfaced on Sunday and denied that she had been detained, saying that she had been in \u201can industry meeting\u201d and \u201cmeditating\u201d at a Taoist retreat. But many in the finance sector are unconvinced.\u201cThere is, generally, a very nervous atmosphere, as people wait to see the outcome of some of these investigations and how deep the rabbit hole goes,\u201d said Effie Vasilopoulos, a partner at the Hong Kong office of the Sidley Austin law firm who works with hedge funds that invest in mainland China. \u201cHow wide a net is the government going to cast in terms of looking at foreign firms and their operations \u2014 not just onshore, but also offshore as well?\u201dThe authorities are canvassing industry players in several cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Police officers under the Chinese Ministry of Public Security specializing in economic crimes have joined agents from the nation\u2019s securities regulator on inspections of investment funds and brokerage firms. The authorities are combing records and questioning transactions that appear to profit from or contribute to a falling market, according to employees of investment firms who, like others who spoke anonymously, said they feared reprisals.Police officers have downloaded extensive trading data and asked fund managers why they sold shares when the market was going down, prompting discussions about basic investment strategy. Officers have bluntly told some fund managers to just stop selling.While regulators and law enforcement elsewhere in the world routinely meet with investment companies to monitor trading for potential abuse and illegal activity, they seldom do so with the aim of steering the direction of the markets.The government has offered few details about the various investigations, contributing to the atmosphere of uncertainty. In late August, it announced the arrests of eight executives at state-owned Citic Securities, the country\u2019s largest brokerage firm and investment bank, including four members of its senior management, on suspicion of insider trading.At least four other brokerage firms said last month that they were being investigated by regulators for failing to properly identify their clients.While insider trading is common in China\u2019s relatively opaque markets, the investigations also serve the government\u2019s short-term goal of discouraging sales and stabilizing prices, said Chris Powers, a senior consultant at Z-Ben Advisors, a financial consulting firm in Shanghai. \u201cIs this more about limiting supposed market manipulation, or is it about sending a message to the market as a whole and using these cases as examples?\u201d he asked.Starting in the middle of last year, China\u2019s markets enjoyed a breathtaking rally driven by record levels of margin financing, or borrowing to invest in stocks, and strong signals of government support, including cheery reports on the bull market in official news outlets like People\u2019s Daily. But the Shanghai composite index has fallen 37 percent since the sell-off began in June, and the government has intervened directly and repeatedly in an attempt to support prices.The measures include restrictions on short-selling, or betting that stocks will fall. Regulators in the United States took similar action for a month at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, but the Chinese authorities have been vague about what kinds of transactions have been prohibited and for how long. The police have said they are investigating \u201cmalicious\u201d short-selling but have not said what that entails.The crackdown on short-selling and other trading strategies has been particularly disruptive for hedge funds, which depend on such trades to balance risks and limit losses.\u201cThey seem to be harassing anybody that they thought was selling or was short,\u201d said one hedge fund manager in Hong Kong who does not have investments on the mainland. \u201cHello, it\u2019s a hedge fund \u2014 they are long and short \u2014 but China is only looking at the short side.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The government has also suspended initial public offerings and prohibited investors who own more than 5 percent of a company from selling shares.While central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan have used unconventional monetary policy in recent years to stimulate growth and lift markets, China\u2019s intervention has been more direct, with the government ordering brokerage firms to contribute to a bailout fund. In a report this week, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that entities directed by the Chinese government have spent about 1.5 trillion renminbi, or $235 billion, buying shares to support the market.Censors have ordered the Chinese news media to avoid any reporting that might result in a market sell-off. With the economy growing at its slowest pace in a quarter-century and the party leadership worried about social unrest, discussion of the markets can draw official scrutiny almost as quickly as political speech.One hedge-fund manager based in Hong Kong said that he was cashing out most of the nearly $500 million he has invested in the mainland because of fears that his money could get tied up by new rules, with no legal recourse. \u201cI\u2019m worried about more systemic risks\u201d and \u201cthe witch hunt that is going on,\u201d he said.Another fund manager, in Singapore, said his colleagues in China were finding ways to take vacations outside of China because of a perception in the industry that the environment was becoming increasingly hostile.Though foreign investors are being singled out, only about 1 percent of China\u2019s $6.4 trillion domestic market value is owned by such investors, according to estimates by UBS, the investment bank.In recent years, some financial officials and regulators have started developing more sophisticated investment tools for the Chinese stock market, like futures and derivatives. But regulators are unlikely in the current environment to continue with such experiments, analysts said. On Sept. 2, China\u2019s futures exchange, an important platform for hedging, announced new restrictions that quickly led to a severe drop in trading volume.\u201cFor investors, if you can\u2019t hedge, it makes it hard to mitigate any sort of risk,\u201d he added, arguing that would \u201cultimately limit the wealth of the equities market\u201d in China.Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, which analyzes the Chinese economy for investors, said the restrictions on selling had turned the Chinese stock market into \u201ca roach motel for capital.\u201d\u201cYou can enter,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if you want to leave, you have to be really fleet about it because you\u2019re mostly not going to get out.\u201dEdward Wong reported from Beijing, Neil Gough from Hong Kong and Alexandra Stevenson from New York.

{"Headline": "Which Fed Leaders Fear Inflation? Look at When They Grew Up", "Date": "2015-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFormative InfluencesIf you are an 18-year-old college freshman in the United States, inflation in your lifetime has averaged less than 2 percent. If you are a 30-year-old millennial, you experienced inflation above 5 percent for only one year \u2014 when you were in kindergarten, perhaps in the form of the coins in a piggy bank buying fewer pieces of candy the longer they sat unspent.The Fed, which this week will weigh whether it is time to raise interest rates after seven years of keeping them near zero, is motivated by a desire to keep inflation around 2 percent. But any decision it makes will follow decades in which inflation has been quiescent and, in the last few years, consistently below that 2 percent target.Might that accident of the calendar have something to do with it? Could the fact that Fed policy makers are of a generation with firsthand experience with high inflation make them more antsy about a risk that might seem to younger Americans distant or utterly improbable? I did some analysis of the relationship between the inflation level when Fed officials were at a formative age and the degree of concern about price inflation they have shown as policy makers, and while it is far from definitive, it suggests there just might be something there.I started by collecting the years of birth for the five current governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks, who collectively participate in the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (I used the recently retired presidents of the Dallas and Philadelphia Fed banks, Richard Fisher and Charles Plosser, because their successors have not yet made their views on monetary policy known).I then calculated the average annual inflation rate during each one\u2019s formative years. I chose to consider the years from ages 18 to 35 \u2014 a time span in which they would have first made financial decisions, first studied economics and in most cases obtained a Ph.D. and begun publishing research.There is no doubt that these officials experienced a different level of inflation in their early adult years than today\u2019s young people. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, experienced 3.4 percent annual inflation during his prime years, the lowest of his colleagues. The highest was Mr. Fisher, 66, the recently retired Dallas Fed chief, who witnessed average annual inflation above 6 percent as a young adult.The median inflation experienced by the Fed officials as young adults is 5.4 percent, much more than the 1.9 percent of someone who turned 35 this year.Close followers of the Fed may notice a pattern there. Mr. Kocherlakota, 51, is arguably the most \u201cdovish\u201d of current Fed officials, which is to say he is less concerned about inflation and more concerned about growth and employment. Mr. Fisher and Mr. Plosser were two of the most \u201chawkish\u201d on inflation.At first glance, this fits the theory. Does it hold up more broadly? I took a ranking of Fed officials on a hawkish-dovish scale created by economists at Barclays Capital and converted it to a numerical scale of hawkishness to see if there is a correlation.The answer: Yes, but a weak one.Knowing the inflation level in officials\u2019 early adulthood explains only 8 percent of the variance in their later hawkishness (that is, the regression analysis had an r-squared of 0.08). That is not high, and the sample is far too small to draw any firm conclusions, but it at least suggests that the theory that what people experience as young adults affects their instincts when they become middle-aged central bankers is not totally outlandish.It is, of course, impossible to get into people\u2019s heads and know what truly motivates them to advocate the policy choices they do. And central banks the world over have a strong culture of inflation aversion that exists regardless of individual experience.Which means as Fed officials gather around their big mahogany table this week to decide their next move, they might do well to remember that while the past might repeat itself from time to time, what ailed the world in their youth is not necessarily the same thing that ails it today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paid Leave for Moms and Dads: Reporter\u2019s Notebook", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs companies add and extend paid leave, they face two big challenges.The first is to keep their leaves sufficiently gender neutral so as to pass muster with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which allows companies to offer different lengths of leave to men and women, provided the difference is linked to the medical disability associated with pregnancy. Beyond the time period it takes to recover physically \u2014 which courts have often put at six weeks for the typical woman \u2014 companies are supposed to offer equal amounts of leave to men and women.The second, related challenge, is to get men to actually take the leaves they\u2019re offered.The Supreme Court of the United States has held that \u201cit takes no special training to discern sex stereotyping in a description of an aggressive female employee.\u201d But as the Willamette University law professor Keith Cunningham-Parmeter has observed, \u201cspecial training is required to identify instances when men transgress masculine norms.\u201dTake the first point. It is now common among elite law firms to offer non-partners who are mothers 18 weeks of paid parental leave, and non-partners who are fathers four weeks. But, because offering women 14 weeks longer than men could never pass legal muster, law firms resort to a slightly convoluted gender-neutral formulation: Mothers often get six weeks of disability leave tied to their pregnancy. Then the firm offers eight weeks of paid leave to the primary caregiver, and four weeks of paid caregiving leave to every new parent.Voil\u00e0! The primary caregiver, if she\u2019s a biological mother, gets 18 weeks, while the biological father gets four, and the H.R. department sleeps well at night.But this introduces a problem: What if the biological father wants to be the primary caregiver?Given the norms at high-powered workplaces, where supervisors seem constantly on alert for signs of anything less than total commitment, men need to have a near heroic level of self-assurance in order to come forward and claim the full 12 weeks.Ernst & Young, the American arm of the professional services firm EY, offers six weeks to fathers who will be primary caregivers while on leave and encourages them to use it by, for example, highlighting the stories of fathers in internal publications. But the company acknowledges that, on average, fathers take only 2.6 weeks. \u201cWe would love for them to take the six,\u201d said Karyn Twaronite, of the company\u2019s global diversity and inclusiveness office. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how much time they feel comfortable with.\u201d(Interestingly, a highly-regarded senior associate at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher recently took the full 10 weeks to which male primary caregivers are entitled at the firm.)So what\u2019s a well-intentioned company to do?The most interesting solution I encountered was an idea that originated with behavioral economists, then bloomed into full flower in university H.R. departments and took root in corporate America: Default men in and force them to opt out.For years, many academics were allowed to pause their tenure clocks when they had a newborn, but universities found that there was very little uptake, presumably because neither men nor women wanted the stigma of an implicit concession that parenthood might slow them down. When universities began automatically pausing new parents\u2019 tenure clocks, uptake rose substantially.Long story short: A little paternalism may be just the thing we need to topple the patriarchy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump and the Art of the Public Sector Deal", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic View\u201cI wrote \u2018The Art of the Deal,\u2019 \u201d said Donald Trump, introducing himself at the beginning of Wednesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, before moving on to his next qualification for the nation\u2019s highest elected office. \u201cI say, not in a braggadocious way, I\u2019ve made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world.\u201dI read the book this week, with an eye toward what it says about the government, since the next deal Mr. Trump wants to do involves running it. What shone through is a view of government that is more critical on waste and incompetence than you would typically see from the left, but that lacks the leave-us-alone edge of the right.\u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d is not a free-market book.This isn\u2019t surprising given the exact nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s business background. It\u2019s hard to make a living constructing large buildings in New York if you can\u2019t stomach public involvement in private enterprise. The government was often a valued partner in the deals of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d \u2014 providing zoning variances, offering generous tax abatements and in one case buying a piece of land in which Mr. Trump had an interest in order to build a convention center. And in the book, Mr. Trump repeatedly showed off his superior skill in government relations \u2014 as when he obtained an Atlantic City casino license that even Hilton Hotels couldn\u2019t get.\u201cThere is no real estate without government,\u201d says Julia Vitullo-Martin, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, an urban planning research organization in New York. \u201cDonald Trump and his dad built their fortunes on government.\u201dFred Trump, Donald\u2019s father, made his money building modest apartments for lower- and middle-income people in Brooklyn and Queens with subsidized loans from the Federal Housing Administration. But, as the younger Mr. Trump wrote in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d nobody was doing that by the 1980s because \u201cit\u2019s not profitable and government subsidies have been eliminated.\u201d So the younger Mr. Trump shifted toward higher-profile projects in Manhattan, which also depended on government assistance in the form of tax abatements.His earliest major construction deal in Manhattan was the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal, now the glass-covered Grand Hyatt. Mr. Trump sought and won a 40-year property tax abatement (one so long it is still in place today) over the objections of other hotel operators. Before that, he helped persuade the city to build the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on a former Penn Central rail yard on the Far West Side; Trump earned an $833,000 fee when the city bought the land, on which he held a purchase option.A lot of conservatives have criticized public spending on convention centers as a subsidy to the hotel industry, but Mr. Trump called the publicly funded convention center project \u201ccritical to reviving the city\u2019s image and, ultimately, to putting its economy back on track.\u201dWhen seeking tax abatements and zoning variances for his private projects, Mr. Trump emphasized how great his developments would be for the city. The tax breaks for the Grand Hyatt, he said, were the only way to stop the existing building from becoming a closed, blighted eyesore. His planned Television City development (a now scrapped proposal to bring NBC to a site on the Hudson River in the West 60s) would bring \u201cbusiness worth at least $500 million a year from new residents.\u201dSometimes public officials bought these arguments and sometimes they didn\u2019t. But nowhere in the book is there a contention that he shouldn\u2019t have to make them. Never does he say that it\u2019s none of the government\u2019s business how he does business.This is more evidence for what some conservatives have been shouting with increasing alarm: Donald Trump is not one of us, does not share a gut-level suspicion of government, is not a true believer in free enterprise. Mr. Trump is an enthusiast of business, but as conservative critics of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d emphasize, being pro-business is not the same as being pro-market.Twenty-nine years is a long time, and \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d which he wrote with Tony Schwartz, who is now a contributor to The New York Times, will not necessarily be Mr. Trump\u2019s blueprint for governing. But in his campaign speeches, Mr. Trump has often echoed the meddlesome approach to business he learned from New York City officials. As president, Mr. Trump likes to say, he\u2019d call up the chief of Ford with a threat: Move your factories back from Mexico or I\u2019ll slap a huge tax on your imports.This is antithetical to the conservative approach that says markets, not the government, should determine the allocation of business capital. But it is fully in line with the ideas in \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Is Right on Economics", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstead, Mr. Bush has chosen to attack Mr. Trump as a false conservative, a proposition that is supposedly demonstrated by his deviations from current Republican economic orthodoxy: his willingness to raise taxes on the rich, his positive words about universal health care. And that tells you a lot about the dire state of the G.O.P. For the issues the Bush campaign is using to attack its unexpected nemesis are precisely the issues on which Mr. Trump happens to be right, and the Republican establishment has been proved utterly wrong.To see what I mean, consider what was at stake in the last presidential election, and how things turned out after Mitt Romney lost.Conservatives were very clear about what would happen as a result. Raising taxes on \u201cjob creators,\u201d they insisted, would destroy incentives. And they were absolutely certain that the Affordable Care Act would be a \u201cjob killer.\u201dI\u2019m not saying that everything is great in the U.S. economy, because it isn\u2019t. There\u2019s good reason to believe that we\u2019re still a substantial distance from full employment, and while the number of jobs has grown a lot, wages haven\u2019t. But the economy has nonetheless done far better than should have been possible if conservative orthodoxy had any truth to it. And now Mr. Trump is being accused of heresy for not accepting that failed orthodoxy?So am I saying that Mr. Trump is better and more serious than he\u2019s given credit for being? Not at all \u2014 he is exactly the ignorant blowhard he seems to be. It\u2019s when it comes to his rivals that appearances can be deceiving. Some of them may come across as reasonable and thoughtful, but in reality they are anything but.Mr. Bush, in particular, may pose as a reasonable, thoughtful type \u2014 credulous reporters even describe him as a policy wonk \u2014 but his actual economic platform, which relies on the magic of tax cuts to deliver a doubling of America\u2019s growth rate, is pure supply-side voodoo.And here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting: all indications are that Mr. Bush\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump are falling flat, because the Republican base doesn\u2019t actually share the Republican establishment\u2019s economic delusions.The thing is, we didn\u2019t really know that until Mr. Trump came along. The influence of big-money donors meant that nobody could make a serious play for the G.O.P. nomination without pledging allegiance to supply-side doctrine, and this allowed the establishment to imagine that ordinary voters shared its antipopulist creed. Indeed, Mr. Bush\u2019s hapless attempt at a takedown suggests that his political team still doesn\u2019t get it, and thinks that pointing out The Donald\u2019s heresies will be enough to doom his campaign.But Mr. Trump, who is self-financing, didn\u2019t need to genuflect to the big money, and it turns out that the base doesn\u2019t mind his heresies. This is a real revelation, which may have a lasting impact on our politics.Again, I\u2019m not making a case for Mr. Trump. There are lots of other politicians out there who also refuse to buy into right-wing economic nonsense, but who do so without proposing to scour the countryside in search of immigrants to deport, or to rip up our international economic agreements and start a trade war. The point, however, is that none of these reasonable politicians is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.Advertisement"}

Such accusations helped doom her 2010 Senate campaign in California. Democrats called her \u201cCarly Fail-orina,\u201d and the incumbent, Senator Barbara Boxer, depicted her as the face of corporate greed.Mrs. Fiorina drew effusive praise for her performance in the debate, and she is attracting enthusiastic crowds on the trail. But the growing attention will bring more scrutiny to her record amid a resurgence of economic populism and uneasiness over income inequality in both parties.Still adamant that she was a successful chief executive, Mrs. Fiorina is acutely aware of the vulnerabilities her past presents in this race. But she also risks becoming bogged down in a defense of her record at the expense of her message as a political outsider who would bring conservative change to Washington \u2014 a message that has resonated with voters in recent weeks.In 2012, Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president, was attacked by Democrats blaming him for layoffs at companies controlled by Bain Capital, the firm at which he made his fortune. The barrage helped convince voters that Mr. Romney lacked an understanding of ordinary people\u2019s problems.And unlike Mrs. Fiorina, whose entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has come from the private sector, Mr. Romney spent four years as governor of Massachusetts.Martin Wilson, who managed Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s 2010 race, acknowledged in an interview that the campaign had failed to adequately address voters\u2019 concerns about her corporate record. \u201cBut if you spend the whole campaign trying to defend choices she made,\u201d he added, \u201cthen you\u2019re not talking about your issues or an agenda.\u201dAt every step of her career, Mrs. Fiorina has thrived on being an outsider. As a young executive at AT&T, she discovered a talent for sales in an often coarse and sexist culture. In 1999, after helping to take Lucent Technologies public, Mrs. Fiorina was named chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, making her the first woman to lead a Fortune 20 company.But her knack for self-elevation brought grumbling within the Palo Alto, Calif., pioneer\u2019s corporate ranks.\u201cCarly is not an engineer,\u201d Mr. Perkins said in an interview. \u201cThe older people at HP never endorsed her and were unhelpful. Marketing and sales loved her \u2014 she\u2019d go anywhere, she\u2019d close deals.\u201dThe centerpiece of those deals was the company\u2019s $24.2 billion merger with Compaq Computer, which divided the HP board and greatly increased the company\u2019s work force, size and breadth of products.The deal was so personal to Mrs. Fiorina that she referred to HP as \u201cH\u00e9lo\u00efse\u201d and Compaq as \u201cAb\u00e9lard,\u201d a pair whose romantic letters became treasures of medieval French literature, which she studied at Stanford. (Ab\u00e9lard was eventually castrated after fights with H\u00e9lo\u00efse\u2019s family, a detail Compaq executives were unaware of at the time.)But the merger, which was announced just before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and amid the dot-com downturn, also led to painful consolidation, cost cutting and layoffs that later haunted Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s Senate race.In November, HP will shed 10 percent of its work force and split into two companies, one devoted to corporate information technology, including cloud computing, the other focused on printers and personal computers.While some analysts say that the Compaq merger saved the company and that HP\u2019s planned split has to do with years of bad decisions involving a series of chief executives, others say the latest saga began with Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s grand acquisitions, which never yielded the profits or economies of scale she and her successors anticipated.\u201cShe had a very mixed tenure,\u201d said George Colony, the chief executive of Forrester, a technology research firm. \u201cThe culture she tried to change spit her out, eventually. I\u2019d put her at the top of the bottom third of C.E.O.s.\u201dMrs. Fiorina defends her tenure, armed with statistics that sound like a PowerPoint presentation. The support of Mr. Perkins, a former HP board member and founder of one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest venture capital firms, could prove critical in making her argument stick.\u201cWe doubled the size of the company,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said in last week\u2019s debate. \u201cWe quadrupled its top-line growth rate. We quadrupled its cash flow. We tripled its rate of innovation.\u201dBut much of that growth resulted from the Compaq acquisition. Profits as a percentage of revenue in the six years Mrs. Fiorina served as chief executive declined about 40 percent. The stock price fell sharply. Mrs. Fiorina blames the burst of the dot-com bubble for the drop, but HP shares fell by more than the stocks of competitors like Dell, IBM, Intel and Microsoft.Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s political rivals have also highlighted that she ushered in a period of corporate scandal, including public clashes with members of the Hewlett family. Fired in 2005, she left with more than $42 million in severance, stock options and pension.Mrs. Fiorina seemed poised to offer Ms. Boxer a vigorous challenge in 2010. Democrats were under siege in the midterm elections, and Mrs. Fiorina was an engaging outsider who spoke eloquently about her rise from secretary to C.E.O. and about surviving breast cancer.\u201cWe were very concerned about Carly Fiorina when she first got into this race,\u201d said Rose Kapolczynski, a veteran Democratic operative and the longtime campaign manager for Ms. Boxer. \u201cShe is a very compelling personality. She\u2019s a terrific performer on the political stage.\u201dBut after Mrs. Fiorina emerged from a relatively smooth primary (with the exception of a bizarre ad that portrayed her opponent as a demonic sheep), the Boxer campaign unleashed attacks on her HP record. The barrage came against the backdrop of the state\u2019s more than 12 percent unemployment rate.In one ad, called \u201cOutsourced,\u201d footage showed Mrs. Fiorina defending sending jobs overseas. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about massive layoffs, which we did, perhaps the work needs to be done somewhere else,\u201d she said. In another, called \u201cWorkers,\u201d former HP employees spoke solemnly into the camera. \u201cI had to pack my bags, and I was out the door that night,\u201d said Larry, who worked at HP for 10 years. Another victim of the layoffs, Teri, said, \u201cWe even had to train our replacements.\u201d (Mrs. Fiorina has said she saved 80,000 positions.)Jim Margolis, the ad maker for the Boxer campaign, is now a senior media adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201cPeople don\u2019t know her yet,\u201d Ms. Boxer said in an interview before last week\u2019s debate. \u201cWhat they\u2019ll understand pretty quickly is that she is the face of income inequality and Wall Street greed.\u201dIn an interview last month, Mrs. Fiorina said she had made enemies at HP by challenging the status quo, and she pointed to other ousted chief executives, including Steve Jobs. \u201cOf course there\u2019s going to be scrutiny on my business record, and there should be,\u201d Mrs. Fiorina said.She encouraged a reporter to examine HP\u2019s quarterly results. \u201cThe data about my time at HP is crystal clear,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine if politicians were held to the same standard of accountability.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yanis Varoufakis: How Europe Crushed Greece", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNor can I support the adoption of a troika program that everyone knows is destined to fail. There was a clear consensus, shared not only by myself and Mr. Tsipras, but also by Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and officials at the International Monetary Fund, that the new bailout deal was not viable.The cause of this continuing trouble for Greece lies in the eurozone\u2019s existential crisis. The pioneers of the single currency, of whom Mr. Sch\u00e4uble is the last active member, were undecided whether the euro should be modeled on the international gold standard of the interwar period or on a sovereign currency, like the dollar.The gold standard relied on strict rules that were unenforceable during a crisis. In a severe downturn, these imposed the greatest burden on the worst-hit economies and thus made exit the only alternative to a humanitarian crisis. This is the reason that President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard in 1933, expanded the money supply and helped pull America out of the Depression.It was in the context of this standoff that Mr. Sch\u00e4uble felt that accepting an alternative plan for Greece\u2019s recovery, in place of the troika\u2019s program, would weaken Germany\u2019s hand vis-\u00e0-vis the French. Thus little Greece was crushed while the elephants tussled.Our proposals began with a strategy for debt swaps to reduce the public debt\u2019s burden on state finances. This measure would allow for sustainable budget surpluses (net of debt and interest repayments) from 2018 onward. We set a target for those surpluses of no more than 2 percent of national income (the troika program\u2019s target is 3.5 percent). With less pressure on the government to depress demand in the economy by cutting public spending, the Greek economy would attract investors of productive capital.As well as making this possible, the debt swaps would also render Greek sovereign debt eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing program. This in turn would speed up Greece\u2019s return to the money markets, reducing its reliance on loans from European institutions.The document was ready on May 11. Although I presented it to key European finance ministers, including Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, as the Greek Finance Ministry\u2019s official plan, it never received the endorsement of our own prime minister. The reason? Because the troika made it abundantly clear to Mr. Tsipras that any such document would be seen as a hostile attempt to backtrack from the conditions of the troika\u2019s existing program. That program, of course, had made no provision for debt restructuring and therefore demanded cripplingly high budget surpluses.The fact that few people ever got to hear about the Greek plan is a testament to the eurozone\u2019s deep failures of governance. If the \u201cAthens Spring\u201d \u2014 when the Greek people courageously rejected the catastrophic austerity conditions of the previous bailouts \u2014 has one lesson to teach, it is that Greece will recover only when the European Union makes the transition from \u201cWe the states\u201d to \u201cWe the European people.\u201dAcross the Continent, people are fed up with a monetary union that is inefficient because it is so profoundly undemocratic. This is why the battle for rescuing Greece has now turned into a battle for Europe\u2019s integrity, soul, rationality and democracy. I plan to concentrate on helping set up a Pan-European political movement, inspired by the Athens Spring, that will work toward Europe\u2019s democratization.Naturally, this will take years to bear fruit \u2014 years that Greece cannot afford. In the meantime, I shall continue to promote our plan for Greece\u2019s recovery as a true, viable alternative to the troika\u2019s impossible program.Yanis Varoufakis, a former finance minister of Greece, is an outgoing member of Parliament for Syriza and a professor of economics at the University of Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vote Fails to Settle Dispute on Secession by Catalonia", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut neither did it do much to defang an issue that has become one of the most vexing for Spain\u2019s conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, threatening to destabilize Spain just as its economy has come out of a lengthy recession and banking crisis.Catalonia\u2019s future will now become a more critical factor in year-end national elections in Spain, even as the issue continues to generate deep wariness in Brussels and across Europe, where the prospect of an independent Catalonia lends energy to separatist claims in other regions.\u201cThe independence movement has come out reinforced, but if this election is to be treated as the kind of referendum that separatists wanted to get real legitimacy, they didn\u2019t quite succeed,\u201d said Javier Cercas, a Catalan writer.\u201cCatalonia is also a European problem,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause if it spins out of control, it could set off a chain reaction and trigger more of the divisions that the European Union was in fact created to prevent.\u201dStill, the prospect of a breakaway Catalonia remains far from certain. Sunday\u2019s election left the two figures at the center of the drama \u2014 Mr. Rajoy and the Catalan regional leader, Artur Mas \u2014 bruised rather than able to claim a victory.By now, their feud has become at once intensely personal and central to both their political futures.Catalonia\u2019s importance to Spain is hard to overstate. The region, which has a distinct language and cultural identity, spearheaded Spain\u2019s industrial revolution and has since attracted investments from more than 5,000 multinational companies, mostly European.Mr. Mas then turned his frustrated demand for fiscal concessions into a full-fledged drive for independence.\u201cThe separatists have managed to turn Catalonia into the main issue for Spain, but that isn\u2019t enough for Mas to launch a unilateral process of secession,\u201d said Josep Ramoneda, a Catalan philosopher and political columnist.On the other hand, \u201cRajoy went from trying to ignore completely Catalonia to launching a campaign of fear about the consequences of secessionism \u2014 but all these strategies have proved disastrous for him,\u201d Mr. Ramoneda said.On Monday, Mr. Rajoy told a news conference that he was \u201cready to listen and talk,\u201d but only as long as any discussion about Catalonia\u2019s future did not challenge the principles of Spanish law and sovereignty. He put the onus on Catalan politicians instead to mend the divisions that they have created within their own society.But the Catalan vote was a special rebuff to the prime minister and his Popular Party. It lost its place at the helm of the anti-secessionist movement in Catalonia to a party called Citizens, which hopes to oust Mr. Rajoy from office in national elections in two months.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservative Popular Party is hoping to use the national election to win another mandate and follow the lead of the Conservatives of Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain, who won re-election in May on the back of an economic recovery.Similar to Mr. Cameron, \u201cMr. Rajoy will also be helped by Spain\u2019s economy\u201d in the national elections, Mr. Cercas predicted, \u201cbut his terrible management of Catalonia is now going to be a serious problem.\u201dWhatever the outcome, the next Spanish government is likely to have to make concessions to Catalonia, probably as part of a broader Spanish constitutional overhaul that could ease the territorial conflict.\u201cThe Catalan conflict has become a lot more intense and radical, but it remains a stalemate that is problematic for everybody,\u201d said Jordi Alberich, the director general of the Cercle d\u2019Econom\u00eda, a Catalan business association.\u201cNo solution can be found if the two sides continue to rely on threats, of unilateral independence on the one hand and Rajoy responding by warning of terrible consequences for Catalonia,\u201d he added.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government recently unveiled a law that would make it easier for Spain\u2019s constitutional court to suspend from office Mr. Mas and other Catalan secessionist politicians deemed to have violated Spain\u2019s Constitution.Mr. Mas and other separatists hailed Sunday\u2019s returns as sufficient to allow them to form a new Catalan government that can lead Catalonia to statehood within 18 months.But the returns \u2014 which did not produce a popular majority \u2014 failed to give the secessionist project the kind of legitimacy needed to overcome Spanish legal hurdles and skepticism in the rest of the European Union.While Mr. Mas may yet be able to form a majority coalition in Parliament, he will first face a struggle to convince like-minded separatist parties that he should remain as head of the next Catalan government.On Monday, Mr. Mas played down the tensions over his leadership, telling a news conference that his own political future was \u201cnot a transcendental topic\u201d as long as the new separatist lawmakers managed to forge ahead with their secessionist project.Mr. Ramoneda, the political columnist, said, \u201cI think the solution to the Catalan problem is going to require new political leadership on both sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If anything, he said, the thousands of refugees arriving daily at the borders of European countries may be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201dIn the city of Lahti, about 60 miles northeast of the capital, Helsinki, demonstrators chanted, pelted rocks and shot fireworks at a bus of asylum seekers at a processing center. In the nearby town of Kouvola, a gasoline bomb was thrown at a reception center. To the north, in the border town of Tornio, 200 people formed a human chain to protest the arrival of Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan migrants from Sweden. No one was injured in any of the episodes.The Austro-Hungarian border has come into focus as one of the main nodes of the human exodus.Up to 10,000 migrants have been entering Austria daily, mostly from Hungary; 134,000 made the crossing from Sept. 5 to 23, Austrian officials said Friday. While many of the migrants have continued on, to destinations like Germany and Sweden, 500 to 700 people each day have filed papers to stay in Austria, officials said.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.After Hungary fenced off its border with Serbia last week, migrants turned to Croatia, entering Hungary through a different route \u2014 with the grudging acceptance of the Hungarian authorities \u2014 and then heading to Austria. Hungary on Friday continued to seal its border with Croatia, which like Serbia is not part of the passport-free Schengen travel zone that has been a cornerstone of European unity.Austria\u2019s left-leaning chancellor, Werner Faymann, and Hungary\u2019s conservative prime minister, Viktor Orban, met in Vienna on Friday to discuss the situation. While they have divergent political stances, they agreed on the need for cooperation to manage the westward flow of immigrants.The Austrians emphasized the European Union\u2019s procedures for accommodating and processing asylum seekers and described Hungary\u2019s fence construction along its borders with Serbia and Croatia as a matter for Hungarians to decide.(Hungary has also placed a razor-wire barrier along parts of its border with Slovenia \u2014 which like Hungary is part of the Schengen zone \u2014 but on Friday, news reports from Slovenia said at least part of the wire fence had been taken down. Karl Erjavec, Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister, told state television that the Hungarian government had assured him that it would not extend the barrier along the entire 60-mile border between the two countries.)Mr. Orban has considered tougher measures to seal the border with Croatia, but he pledged on Friday to consult Hungary\u2019s neighbors first. Criticized by humanitarian groups for his harsh language toward refugees, Mr. Orban on Friday described his objections as more pragmatic than ideological.\u201cWelcome parties \u2014 which certainly are proof of decency, and of which participating civic organizations can be proud \u2014 will give way to hardship and pragmatic concerns after a while,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation will be hard politically and will not be easy humanly either.\u201dIn one positive sign, Croatia lifted a blockade of Serbian-registered vehicles along joint borders on Friday, ending a week of bickering, countermeasures and disintegrating relations, although resentment remained on both sides.The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.\u201cOur measures at the border may have been hard, but it was in defense of national interests and to control the flow of migrants who pass through Serbia without any control,\u201d said Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, comparing government leaders to the notorious Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic.The diversity of the migrants \u2014 some have made their way to Europe from as far away as Afghanistan and Eritrea \u2014 has caught European leaders by surprise. While the four-year-old civil war in Syria has been one of the most obvious causes, United Nations officials are also pointing to the deteriorating situation in Iraq.About 500,000 Iraqis could be displaced if the government, as expected, begins an offensive to retake the city of Mosul, which Islamic State forces captured last year, officials said in Geneva.\u201cThe humanitarian situation is worsening dramatically,\u201d said Dominik Bartsch, the refugee agency\u2019s deputy coordinator in Iraq, citing a recent cholera outbreak and estimating that 10 million people, or one-quarter of the population, will need humanitarian aid by the end of the year.Peter Webinger, deputy director of the department for migration and asylum affairs at Austria\u2019s Interior Ministry, said the new physical barriers would be a futile exercise.\u201cPeople on the move are like water,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put a barrier to stop it, and it will find a way to flow around it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva; Palko Karasz from Budapest; Mari-Leena Kuosa from Helsinki, Finland; Matthew Brunwasser from Belgrade, Serbia; Joseph Orovic from Zadar, Croatia; and Barbara Surk from Vienna.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Once in a Great City\u2019 Chronicles Detroit\u2019s Glory Days", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesOn a trip to the University of Michigan to deliver his \u201cGreat Society\u201d speech in 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson would stop in Detroit and call the big labor city \u201cthe herald of hope in America\u201d: \u201cProsperity in America must begin here in Detroit,\u201d he intoned in his famous drawl. \u201dYou folks in Detroit put American citizens on wheels, you have the American economy on the move. Unemployment in Detroit is down, profits are up, wages are good, and there is no problem too tough or too challenging for us to solve.\u201dIn his elegiac and richly detailed new book, \u201cOnce in a Great City,\u201d David Maraniss \u2014 the author of biographies of Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Roberto Clemente \u2014 conjures those boom years of his former hometown with novelistic ardor. Using overlapping portraits of Detroiters (from politicians to musicians to auto execs), he creates a mosaiclike picture of the city that has the sort of intimacy and tactile emotion that Larry McMurtry brought to his depictions of the Old West, and the gritty sweep of David Simon\u2019s HBO series \u201cThe Wire.\u201dPeople\u2019s experiences intersect or collide or resonate with one another, and Mr. Maraniss uses them as windows on the larger cultural and political changes convulsing the nation in the \u201860s: the struggle for civil rights; L.B.J.\u2019s faith in the government\u2019s ability to address the country\u2019s biggest challenges, like poverty; and the tumult wrought by rapid social change and the rise of the boomer generation.In fact, Mr. Maraniss writes in an author\u2019s note, he regards this volume as part of a \u201860s trilogy, sandwiched between his earlier books \u201cRome 1960\u201d about the Summer Olympics; and \u201cThey Marched Into Sunlight,\u201d dealing with Vietnam and the antiwar movement in 1967.Except for an epilogue, \u201cOnce in a Great City\u201d remains deliberately focused on the 18 months between the autumn of 1962 and the spring of 1964 \u2014 a period that emerges as one of the high points in Detroit\u2019s history as well as a pivotal moment containing the seeds of its coming disintegration. The book would have benefited from a little more context, like the causes and consequences of its devastating 1967 riot and an analysis of the role that the city\u2019s reliance on a single industry would play in hastening its fall. And Mr. Maraniss retraces considerable ground that will be familiar to readers of books like Paul Ingrassia\u2019s \u201cCrash Course: The American Automobile Industry\u2019s Road from Glory to Disaster\u201d and Nelson George\u2019s \u201cWhere Did Our Love Go?: The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound.\u201dBut Mr. Maraniss does not aim to break a lot of new ground here or to delve too deeply into any one aspect of early-\u201860s Detroit; his goal is something more impressionistic and zeitgeist-y. And at this, he succeeds with authoritative, adrenaline-laced flair. He gives us \u201cthe musical luminescence of Detroit,\u201d explaining its \u201cunmatched creative melody\u201d by pointing not only to its gospel and blues heritage (thanks to its many migrants from the South, who brought with them \u201can oral, life-singing tradition\u201d) and the vitality of a local black-owned radio station, WCHB, but also to the public school system\u2019s inspiring music programs and the availability of pianos for working-class families (a result of \u201csteady auto jobs, disposable income, single-family housing\u201d and the reach of a remarkable music store and piano maker called Grinnell\u2019s).Mr. Maraniss cuts among story lines about the auto industry, the civil rights movement and City Hall, and among subplots involving Ford\u2019s development of its top-secret new car (the singular Mustang), the police commissioner\u2019s efforts to get the goods on the mobster Tony Giacalone and Berry Gordy\u2019s construction of a hit factory with Motown. The result is a buoyant Frederick Lewis Allen-like social history that\u2019s animated by an infectious soundtrack and lots of tactile details, and injected with a keen understanding of larger historical forces at work \u2013 both in Detroit and America at large.Along the way, Mr. Maraniss gives us some clear-eyed portraits of influential Detroiters like the Rev. C. L. Franklin, the civil rights activist and father of Aretha; the city\u2019s mayor Jerome Cavanagh, who could \u201ccharm birds out of trees\u201d; Martha Reeves, whose rise reflected \u201cthe soul of Detroit and the magic of its music;\u201d Henry Ford II, who set about reshaping the image of his family\u2019s car business; Lee Iacocca, who reportedly pitched the Mustang as a \u201clittle pony car\u201d that \u201cwould give an orgasm to anyone under 30\u201d; and the visionary Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, who presciently spoke in 1963 of the impact that technology and automation would have on labor and the country in the years to come.By the close of Mr. Maraniss\u2019s book, dreams of hosting the Olympics have been scuttled; urban renewal has uprooted many traditional, predominantly black neighborhoods; police reforms that might lead to greater racial harmony have stalled; and efforts to transform the city through the Model Cities and War on Poverty programs have run aground, fueling tensions that would explode in the 1967 riot.That riot would accelerate white and middle-class flight to the suburbs and bring a radical contraction in the city\u2019s population. The United States Census in 1960 had put Detroit\u2019s population at 1,670,144; by 2010, the city\u2019s population had fallen, shockingly, to 713,777. This shrinking tax base, along with auto industry woes, growing deficits and startlingly inept leadership would force the city to declare bankruptcy in 2013 and turn Detroit from Johnson\u2019s \u201cherald of hope in America\u201d into a symbol of vulnerability and decay.Mr. Maraniss\u2019s evocative book provides a wistful look back at an era when those cracks were only just beginning to show, and the city still seemed a place of \u201cuncommon possibility\u201d and was creating \u201cwondrous and lasting things.\u201dONCE IN A GREAT CITYA Detroit StoryBy David MaranissIllustrated. 441 pages.

{"Headline": "California\u2019s Upward-Mobility Machine", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEducational OpportunityThe University of California is struggling with budget woes that have deeply affected campus life. Yet the system\u2019s nine colleges still lead the nation in providing top-flight college education to the masses.At many other colleges, poor and truly middle-class students remain a distinct minority. Affluent students predominate at liberal-arts colleges like Oberlin and Bates, private universities like Cornell and Texas Christian and even many public universities, including Wisconsin, Penn State and Georgia Tech. The University of California, by contrast, enrolls a large number of high-performing students of all economic backgrounds.To measure top colleges\u2019 efforts on economic diversity, The Upshot created the College Access Index.Officials at other top colleges, for their part, often say that they want to enroll more of these talented low- and middle-income students. But only some colleges have followed up these words with actions.Tellingly, the colleges enrolling more diverse student bodies \u2013 not just in terms of race, religion and geography, but social class as well \u2013 don\u2019t fit any one model. Some are small, and some large. Some are rural, and some urban. Some are extremely selective, with enormous endowments, and some are less so.You can see the contrast between otherwise similar colleges. Amherst and Wesleyan are more diverse than Williams and Colby; Holy Cross more so than Notre Dame. The flagship state universities in Texas and North Carolina are more diverse than those in Michigan, Virginia and Wisconsin.This variety suggests that economic diversity is within the power of any top university. The question is whether the university\u2019s leaders decide it\u2019s a priority.Among the most notable patterns from this year\u2019s College Access Index:This stagnation means that many elite colleges remain overwhelmingly well-off. For every student from the entire bottom half of the nation\u2019s income distribution at Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton, Yale and more than a few other colleges, there appear to be roughly two students from just the top 5 percent (which means they come from families making at least $200,000).College administrators wouldn\u2019t phrase it this way, yet they are essentially deciding that economic diversity matters less than other priorities \u2013 like sports teams, new buildings and some low-enrollment academic programs.Stonehill, in Massachusetts, had the biggest jump in Pell students, by focusing on candidates within 50 miles of campus and increasing financial aid. \u201cIt enhances the education of all students to meet people who are different than they are,\u201d Eileen O\u2019Leary, a Stonehill administrator, said.Of course, the overall stagnation in the numbers means that for almost every college that\u2019s becoming more diverse, another college is becoming less so. The share of Pell recipients at Duke, Harvard, Rice, Williams and even most University of California campuses has fallen somewhat since 2011.But the evidence suggests that they can and do.The median six-year graduation rate for Pell students at the colleges in our index is 84 percent, only slightly lower than the overall rate of 85 percent. College certainly involves challenges for many low-income students, but they largely meet them when they attend a top college. That\u2019s a big reason these colleges matter: They don\u2019t leave many students saddled with the toxic combination of debt and no degree.On some campuses, the Pell graduation rate even exceeds the overall rate. One of them is the University of California at Irvine.Irvine\u2019s story is fascinating. It owes its existence to California\u2019s population explosion after World War II, which created a quandary for the state\u2019s public universities. Either they had to step back from their historic mission \u2013 and educate a much smaller share of California teenagers \u2013 or they had to grow enormously.\u201cFor a lot of first-generation students, it\u2019s very hard for parents to understand how to help their child prepare for college expenses,\u201d said Basti Lopez, who emigrated with her parents from Mexico as a child and graduated from Irvine in May.She had started at Santa Ana College, a two-year college, before applying to four-year colleges as a junior transfer. She was admitted to Berkeley, Irvine and Santa Cruz and chose Irvine, both because of the financial-aid package and because it was closer to home. She is now back working at Santa Ana, helping students with the transfer process, and she\u2019s studying for the law-school admission exam, hoping to become an immigration lawyer.Students like Ms. Lopez are one reason that Irvine\u2019s student body includes more students with Pell grants than all eight colleges of the Ivy League combined.\u201cIt takes a lot of systematic effort,\u201d Mr. Gillman, the Irvine chancellor, said.And yet American society seems to be making less of this broad effort than it once did.College obviously can\u2019t solve all of the economy\u2019s problems, but there is a reason that nearly all families that can comfortably send their children to college do so. For families that aren\u2019t as comfortable, some colleges are doing much more to help than others.An earlier version of this article misstated one of the colleges to which Basti Lopez was accepted as a transfer student. It was Santa Cruz, not Santa Clara.Coming soon: A more detailed look at the least economically diverse colleges on our list.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ambitious Development Agenda From the U.N.", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNow, the U.N. is doubling down and setting even more ambitious development goals for the next 15 years. But this time it faces a very big obstacle: a slowing global economy, which will require the leaders of developing countries, especially those in Africa and Asia, where most of the world\u2019s poorest people live, to make big policy changes.The Millennium Development Goals coincided with a period of very rapid growth in developing economies, especially in places like Brazil, China and India, making it easier for those countries to generate jobs and invest in health, education and other public services. All of those countries are growing at slower paces now, and their leaders do not seem to have credible strategies for dealing with their problems. Each country has a unique set of problems, but they all need to make their economies more productive and inclusive.So far, they are rather vaguely stated. The U.N. has not yet established statistical indicators against which to measure progress. It promises these numbers in the coming months. That won\u2019t be easy in some cases: Goal No. 16, for example, calls on countries to \u201cPromote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.\u201dSeveral goals, including those on sustainable consumption and production (No. 12), climate change (No. 13), conserving oceans (No. 14) and sustainable use of land (No. 15) cover a lot of the same ground and might easily have been consolidated. The U.N. should have picked fewer and more targeted goals.Realistically, some nations may be beyond help at this point because they are so deeply mired in war and other conflicts. Without peace and better political leadership, it is hard to anticipate big gains in development in places like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Fifteen years ago, the Millennium Development Goals showed that setting ambitious targets helps rally government officials, individuals and businesses toward a common cause. This time around, leaders everywhere will need to adopt creative and aggressive policies to boost a world economy that now seems stuck in neutral.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beijing Puts Ball Back in Washington\u2019s Court on Climate Change", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince then, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have repeatedly cited China\u2019s lack of action on climate change as the chief reason that the United States should not take stronger action.On Friday in the Rose Garden, the story of how Washington and Beijing will fight climate change took a stunning turn as President Xi Jinping of China stood with Mr. Obama and announced that China would put in place its own national cap-and-trade system in 2017. Environmentalists hailed the announcement as historic and said that China\u2019s move should effectively end Republicans\u2019 main objection to enacting a domestic climate change policy.\u201cThe ironies are rich,\u201d said David Sandalow, a fellow at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy and a former senior official in the Obama administration. \u201cCarbon emissions trading is an American idea. Now it\u2019s an American export. The Europeans have moved forward in implementing it. Now the Chinese are embracing it on a large scale.\u201dBut news of China\u2019s cap-and-trade policy did not seem to change the views of a number of Republican presidential candidates.Asked about climate change policy during a CNN interview this week, Mr. Trump said that he did not believe in climate change and that climate change policies \u201cimperil our country.\u201d He also said, \u201cBy the way, China\u2019s doing nothing.\u201dIn 2012, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter, \u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.\u201dOther Republican candidates have expressed similar views. At the Sept. 16 Republican debate, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said: \u201cWe are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely. But America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is. And they\u2019re drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of.\u201dAsked on Friday for Mr. Rubio\u2019s response to the Chinese president\u2019s announcement, a spokeswoman for his campaign, Brooke Sammon, wrote in an email, \u201cMarco is opposed to cap-and-trade and other forms of a national energy tax.\u201d She added, \u201cHe has outlined concrete proposals that will help us seize our energy potential without increasing the reach of the E.P.A.\u201dJeb Bush, a former Florida governor, has vowed to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations if he is elected president. Asked about his reaction to China\u2019s announcement, a campaign spokeswoman, Allie Brandenburger, wrote in an email, \u201cThe U.S. is one of the world\u2019s leaders in reducing greenhouse gasses. We\u2019ve reduced our emissions by 10 percent since 2005. That\u2019s not because of a big government program but largely due to American innovation. That is the right way forward for our economy, families and the nation.\u201dIn Congress, Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who leads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has called the science of human-caused climate change a hoax, was sharply critical of the agreement.\u201cThese public pledges sound good, but come with serious economic consequences for the United States,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Obama administration will use regulatory overreach to claim our nation\u2019s commitment, while China\u2019s pledge has no guarantee of enforcement. This is a great deal for the Chinese, who are slated to continue increasing emissions with the potential of capping them years from now.\u201dExperts in Chinese climate change policy say there is reason to trust that the Chinese government will move forward with its plans to enact a cap-and-trade system on its economy \u2014 but also cause to be skeptical about whether the plans will be enforced.They point out that the Chinese government moved to curb pollution from coal plants and factories not because of pressure from the United States, but after citizen protests against dirty air threatened to disrupt political stability.China has been moving toward developing a national cap-and-trade system for at least three years. In preparation, it has launched seven pilot programs in different provinces. \u201cWe are learning from our carbon emissions trading pilots,\u201d said Su Wei, China\u2019s chief climate change negotiator. \u201cFirst and foremost is the political commitment to carbon markets.\u201dOther experts cautioned that it might be difficult for China to fully carry out the technology and transparent accounting necessary to create a new financial commodity market. When the European Union implemented a cap-and-trade market, the program suffered in its first years as the price of pollution permits collapsed.\u201cWe have seen difficulties in various pilot provinces in compliance and accuracy measures about emissions,\u201d said Wang Tao, a resident scholar in the Energy and Climate Program based at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.In his second term, Mr. Obama has taken on climate change without Congress. Using his executive authority, he worked with the E.P.A. on a series of regulations, which the E.P.A. finalized last month, requiring electric utilities to sharply limit carbon pollution. Ultimately, the regulations could lead to the shutdown of hundreds of coal-fired power plants.Republicans assailed the rules as an abuse of executive authority, a top-down fiat \u2014 not unlike what might be seen in China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Calls for European Unity to Address Migrant Influx", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Faced with a humanitarian crisis that shows no signs of letting up, Chancellor Angela Merkel gave her fellow Germans and other Europeans a pep talk on Monday, praising those assisting the thousands seeking asylum here but warning that the Continent\u2019s open-border policy was at risk unless all European countries showed an equal willingness to help.The chancellor, whose summer was interrupted by an urgent effort to secure a third financial aid package for Greece, has found herself under fire for what political opponents and even some members of her coalition government have called foot-dragging in dealing with the migration crisis.About 800,000 people are expected to seek asylum in Germany this year, but overcrowded reception centers, a lack of personnel and outbreaks of far-right hatred against some of the new arrivals have left Germany, and some of its European partners, struggling in recent months to cope with the influx.The discovery last week of the bodies of 71 people who were believed to have been bound for the German border in a truck abandoned alongside a highway in Austria has pushed the issue to the fore of the European agenda.At a regular summer news conference in Berlin on Monday, Ms. Merkel encouraged Germans and other Europeans to recall the principles of justice and human rights that were at the heart of the response to the crisis.\u201cIf Europe fails on the question of refugees, if this close link with universal civil rights is broken, then it won\u2019t be the Europe we wished for,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, urging the 27 other countries in the bloc to take more responsibility in offering asylum to refugees.\u201cEurope as a whole must move,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, warning that failing to do so would weaken the agreements that had led to the elimination of border controls and an increase in freedom of movement through much of the Continent over the past 20 years, under what is known as the Schengen agreement.\u201cIf we don\u2019t succeed in fairly distributing refugees then of course the Schengen question will be on the agenda for many,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.With increasing numbers hoping to come to Germany, lured by the stability and job prospects offered by Europe\u2019s largest economy, Ms. Merkel urged Germans to look at the situation in the context of the country\u2019s history.European Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.\u201cThe world sees Germany as a country of hope and opportunity, that was not always the case,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, reminding Germans that they could be proud of a postwar country based on the principles of dignity, human rights and the right to political asylum.Ms. Merkel said her government was planning measures in the coming months aimed at coordinating efforts between communities, states and the federal government, which each carry different responsibilities in welcoming, processing and integrating those who are granted the right to remain in the country as refugees.Ms. Merkel praised the thousands of Germans who had opened their homes and pocketbooks to the newcomers and who had donated their time. \u201cThere is no tolerance for those who question the dignity of other people,\u201d she said, echoing comments she made last week at a reception center for asylum seekers in the eastern German city of Heidenau that had been the site of violent protests.Germany needs to be able to process applications more swiftly, and language and elementary-school teachers are needed to help families adapt \u2014 in Berlin alone, 400 new classes of students will be starting the new school year, the chancellor said.Germany must also overcome logistical hurdles like the cumbersome bureaucracy needed to construct shelters at a rapid enough pace, she said, pointing out the country lacks a fire safety ordinance for tents. Ms. Merkel said her government would address issues like those in a law that she hoped would be passed before the end of the year.\u201cGerman thoroughness is super, but right now what we need is German flexibility,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, recalling the government\u2019s swift reaction to the global banking crisis of 2008, the ability to respond to natural disasters and, 25 years ago, the reunification of East and West Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Odd Man Out in Illinois Budget Battle: Republican Governor", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 For the last 12 years, the annual Governor\u2019s Day festivities at the Illinois State Fair have honored one kind of person: a Democrat.Until this year, when the guest of honor was Bruce Rauner, the multimillionaire turned first-term Illinois governor \u2014 and a Republican. On a recent sunny afternoon, Mr. Rauner roared into the fairgrounds on his Harley-Davidson, wearing a checked shirt, black leather vest and pristine blue Wranglers.Hopping off the motorcycle, Mr. Rauner turned his back on the dozens of protesters who were there to confront him over proposed budget cuts and waded into the crowd of cheering Republicans, pumping hands, guffawing at jokes and flashing a thumbs-up sign to the party faithful.\u201cYou know what? You are great, strong, proud Republicans,\u201d he said, standing on a stage in front of an American flag the size of a movie screen. \u201cOur Republican values are the values that make America the greatest nation in the history of the world.\u201dRepublicans have been in the political wilderness in Springfield, the state capital, for so long that many of them are still awe-struck that they have had one of their own in the governor\u2019s office since January. Last fall, Mr. Rauner, portraying himself as a no-nonsense businessman who would stand up to labor unions, restore fiscal health to Illinois and lure new companies to the state, won 50 percent of the vote in a year when Republicans snapped up power across the country. His opponent, the incumbent Democrat Pat Quinn, received 46 percent of the vote.Unable to push his agenda through the legislature, Mr. Rauner has tried other tactics, using executive orders to restrict lobbying activities for former state employees and to ban unions from requiring members to pay dues. But in the intervening stalemate, the fiscal crisis is, by most estimates, even more perilous than when Mr. Rauner entered office.Now, even some Illinois Republicans say that while they are thrilled that Mr. Rauner has ascended to the governorship, they are unsure whether he has begun to fulfill his oft-repeated campaign promise to \u201cshake up Springfield.\u201dPatricia Smith, a Republican precinct committeewoman from Sugar Grove, 50 miles west of Chicago, said, \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to do very well,\u201d as she waited for Mr. Rauner to arrive at the fair. \u201cBut he\u2019s had some stumbling blocks. No one, the Democrats or the Republicans, wants to talk to each other. I\u2019m not happy with either side right now.\u201dMr. Rauner\u2019s legislative successes so far have been sporadic: This month, he triumphed over Democrats when Michael J. Madigan, the powerful speaker of the Illinois House, failed to round up enough votes to override the governor\u2019s veto of an important labor bill. In March, he negotiated with Democrats to pass a measure that resolved the state\u2019s short-term budget problems, but it was only a temporary fix.He campaigned on promises to make government more efficient, to lower income taxes, to give local municipalities more autonomy and to trim regulation of business.Democrats say that it is Mr. Rauner who has been unwilling to compromise, demanding changes to collective bargaining rights, workers\u2019 compensation and a freeze on local property taxes as part of a budget deal.\u201cThe requests that he\u2019s making are very bad public policy, but they\u2019re also not within the realm of possibility of getting enough votes,\u201d John J. Cullerton, the president of the Senate, said in an interview. \u201cThe nature of what he\u2019s asking for is so dramatic, and inconsistent with the basic principles of the supermajority party.\u201dMr. Cullerton said last week that Democratic leaders had not met with Mr. Rauner to discuss the budget since earlier this summer, before the governor took the unusual step of running television ads attacking Mr. Madigan. The ads, which blasted the speaker of the House and \u201cthe politicians he controls\u201d for favoring a tax increase and resisting change, enraged Democrats. They claimed that Mr. Rauner was provoking them rather than trying to negotiate a deal.Despite lacking a budget, nearly $7 billion in spending on public education has been approved, the state work force is being paid, and pension contributions for teachers and other employees are being made, according to state law. But many social service providers expect that the state will stop paying them in the next few weeks if no budget deal is reached.Mr. Rauner, who was educated at Dartmouth and Harvard Business School and made millions at a private equity firm in Chicago before running for office, has tried to come across as a down-to-earth Midwesterner, dressing in flannel shirts and barn coats. In public, he drops his g\u2019s, prompting eye rolls from Democrats. \u201cWith your help, I\u2019m going to keep fightin\u2019 to grow our economy and fix our broken state government,\u201d he said in one television ad.Some legislators said that when Mr. Rauner first came into office, he appeared unfamiliar with the workings of state government. But they said he struck a warm chord initially, inviting groups of lawmakers to the governor\u2019s mansion in Springfield for social gatherings and sitting down individually with legislators at the Capitol.\u201cI remember him asking me, \u2018What can I do to be a good governor?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Lou Lang, a state representative from Skokie, a Chicago suburb. \u201cI told him to make the Assembly a good partner. We\u2019re professionals, and we don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Republican.\u201dInstead, Mr. Lang said, Mr. Rauner has insulted legislators with a domineering style. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s the C.E.O. of Illinois, and he treats us like middle managers,\u201d he said.Kwame Raoul, a state senator from Chicago, said that while he had met with the governor to talk about legislative issues, Mr. Rauner had sometimes seemed disengaged. \u201cIt\u2019s been extremely frustrating,\u201d Mr. Raoul said, recalling a meeting with the governor about workers\u2019 compensation. \u201cAs I was talking to him about the details, I could feel him drifting off.\u201dOne senator said that Mr. Rauner seemed frustrated with the collaborative process of governing. Earlier this year, the governor was overheard grumbling, \u201cIs there anything I can do without going through the legislature?\u201d the senator said.Mr. Rauner declined an interview request.Some Republicans have chalked up the friction to the Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to relinquish power.\u201cDemocrats had total control for 12 years, and human nature is going to make it difficult to give that up,\u201d said Matt Murphy, a Republican state senator. \u201cYou have a governor who\u2019s from completely outside the process like Governor Rauner is, and he brings that outsider perspective.\u201dSome Republicans, uncomfortable with the discord, said they hoped the governor would resolve the budget stalemate before long.Paul Serwatka, a Republican who is running for state representative, milled around the Governor\u2019s Day gathering at the state fair and said that Mr. Rauner had been a decisive figure, unwilling to back away from his conservative agenda. But he said he believed the governor was on the right path.\u201cYou sit with one crowd, and he\u2019s an evil billionaire,\u201d Mr. Serwatka said. \u201cYou sit with Republicans, and they say they\u2019ve finally got a guy who\u2019s going to get things done. It\u2019s going to have to get uglier before it gets better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or he might simply be trying to restore legitimacy to moribund institutions by replacing longtime cronies with fresh, younger faces.The political class in Ramallah is rife with conflicting interpretations of Mr. Abbas\u2019s latest moves, which center on his call for a meeting this month of the Palestinian National Council, a body of 700-plus members that has not had a regular session since 1996.\u201cHe\u2019s been resigning at a minimum since 2009, but it might be as far back as 2006; it\u2019s hard to take it seriously,\u201d said Diana Buttu, a Ramallah-based lawyer who once worked for Mr. Abbas and now is a consistent critic. \u201cHe just said he\u2019s not going to nominate himself, but he didn\u2019t say he won\u2019t accept a nomination. He always leaves a door open.\u201dQaddura Fares, a Fatah leader, insisted on Tuesday that \u201cthis is not a ploy.\u201d\u201cHe is reaching the end of his career,\u201d Mr. Fares told Israel Radio. \u201cThis is serious. These are not threats.\u201d Using the president\u2019s nickname, he added: \u201cIt seems that Abu Mazen is fed up.\u201dMr. Abbas has not responded for months to requests for an interview. Several people who have met with him recently said he is indeed frustrated and exhausted, but also determined and focused on the P.N.C. session scheduled for Sept. 14 and 15, the annual United Nations General Assembly later this month and a Nov. 29 Fatah conclave.With the United States, Europe and the Arab world consumed with the Iranian nuclear deal and the battle against the Islamic State, a state of Palestine has plummeted from the world\u2019s priority list. A French proposal for a new United Nations Security Council resolution to end Israel\u2019s occupation of Palestinian territory has disappeared from the agenda.So Mr. Abbas has turned inward. His aides say he intends to remove ancient members of the P.L.O. executive committee and Fatah\u2019s top ranks; critics see it as a purge of anyone who might support alternate contenders to the throne like Muhammad Dahlan and Marwan Barghouti.A banner recently appeared in Ramallah\u2019s central Manara Square that featured head-to-toe portraits of the president and his more beloved predecessor, Yasir Arafat, with the slogan, \u201cWe will remain with legitimacy against all internal and external conspiracies.\u201d\u201cThe Palestinians need to review their strategies and reshuffle their cards, and that requires renewal in the leadership and strengthening of our institutions,\u201d said Ziad Abu Amr, the Palestinian deputy prime minister, who meets Mr. Abbas frequently. \u201cWhat we are doing with the P.L.O. is part of getting ourselves better prepared to continue this quote-unquote historic struggle.\u201dMohammad Shtayyeh, a Fatah leader who is also close to Mr. Abbas, said, \u201cThe message to the Palestinians is that we are bringing in new blood,\u201d though he and several other senior officials declined to name any names. Mr. Shtayyeh said the president would speak to the public at or before the P.N.C. conference.\u201cWe need a new strategy, that\u2019s what he will say,\u201d he predicted. Asked what the new strategy was, he answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201dBut some are worried that the new strategy basically amounts to rearranging the deck chairs. Tawfiq Tirawi, a member of Fatah\u2019s central committee for the past three decades, invoked an Arab villagers\u2019 saying: \u201cWhat is happening now is the grinding of the sesame seeds,\u201d with no clarity about the oil it might yield.\u201cChanging people in order to implement different political plans and strategies, this is perfect,\u201d said Mr. Tirawi, an Arafat acolyte who has long complained about Mr. Abbas\u2019s focus on negotiations alone. \u201cIf it\u2019s just to change the people without changing the plans and strategies, this is not good.\u201dEven changing who sits at the table may not be as simple as it sounds.Mr. Abbas earlier this summer summarily dismissed Yasser Abed Rabbo from his post as the P.L.O.\u2019s secretary general, replacing him with Saeb Erekat, the longtime chief negotiator. But Mr. Abed Rabbo may refuse to submit his resignation from the executive committee, and Mr. Erekat, who is among 10 of the 18 members who are resigning, may not be nominated for another term.Nimer Hamad, Mr. Abbas\u2019s political adviser, said a main goal of the upcoming leadership conventions is to finally tap a vice president. Mr. Erekat is one possibility; another is Majid Farraj, the Palestinian intelligence chief.Mr. Shikaki said Mr. Abbas has no answers to the public\u2019s pressing questions: \u201cWhy is he failing to unify the West Bank and Gaza? Why is he failing to confront the Israelis and the Americans? Why is he failing to deal with corruption at home? Why is he picking fights with people inside Fatah and outside?\u201dSo instead of confronting all these issues, he said, Mr. Abbas \u201cis convening the P.N.C. to try and consolidate power.\u201dThe question remains: If that is the goal, to what end? Consolidate power to remain in office or to create an orderly succession to a handpicked prot\u00e9g\u00e9? To press forward with a new political program or stifle dissent about the lack of one?\u201cAnyone who can tell you anything about his state of mind is misleading you,\u201d Ali Jarbawi, a former Palestinian minister who is now a professor at Birzeit University outside Ramallah, said of Mr. Abbas.\u201cThis is not about ideas, this is about personalities. Basically, it\u2019s just a struggle over power,\u201d Mr. Jarbawi added. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody who is in power, if it is left to him, would leave basically on his own.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of time that Mr. Abbas has been in office.

{"Headline": "Why a \u2018Brexit\u2019 Looms Large", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Before the end of 2017, Britain is due to vote in a referendum on continuing its membership in the European Union. Until now, the conventional wisdom has been that the country will opt to stay in. But the landscape is changing. The prospect of a \u201cBrexit,\u201d as a possible British exit is known, looks more likely now than it has for more than a generation.The British never fell in love with the European project. As their neighbors moved toward closer union, Britain became known for its instinctive \u201ceuroskepticism.\u201d It was the awkward partner that had only reluctantly joined, neither fully embracing the broader vision that united Berlin, Paris and Rome, nor adopting the single currency that followed.When it came to Europe, the average voter acted like an unhappy spouse: dreaming of alternatives but reluctant to end the relationship. That picture is now changing.Those in favor of Britain\u2019s membership long assumed that the merits of the single market and economic integration would suffice, that appeals to the head over the heart would win any vote. This no longer seems true. Seen through the eyes of most voters, the stagnation and instability of the eurozone contrasts with Britain\u2019s economic recovery.This comparison, alongside claims of economic competence and a turnaround, helped the Conservative Party win its first majority government in more than 20 years. Convincing voters that it is in their financial interest to cling to the eurozone is not as easy as it once was.Then came the refugee crisis. Combined with angst over migrant camps near Calais, France, where hundreds are trying to enter Britain, recent headlines have pushed public anxiety about immigration to the highest level ever recorded. It is now voters\u2019 top priority, with nearly twice as many voicing concern over immigration as the economy.Such trends have dealt the euroskeptics \u2014 who earlier this year were writing off their chances of winning the referendum \u2014 a strong hand. Some now believe they can turn the vote on European Union membership into a plebiscite on immigration and securing national borders.Europe\u2019s leaders are distracted from efforts to prevent a Brexit, and given Britain\u2019s stance on the refugee crisis, they are unlikely to feel sympathy for Mr. Cameron\u2019s requests to curb welfare benefits for migrant workers from the European Union. Unless he extracts something from the renegotiation that addresses public concern over the free movement of labor \u2014 long seen by other states as a pillar of the European project \u2014 a Brexit will start to look probable, rather than merely possible.So, gone are the days of New Labour\u2019s unequivocal support for the European Union. And the only other vigorously pro-union party, the Liberal Democrats, was all but obliterated in the last election. True, support for the union remains the dominant view in Westminster, but for the first time in decades, there is a split on both the left and the right.With Mr. Cameron expected to announce a date soon for the referendum, the skeptics remain the underdogs. But the prospect of a Brexit feels far less remote than it once did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Silver Lining to Brazil\u2019s Troubles", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all the BRICS, Brazil would seem, on the face of it, to be in the worst shape.BRICS, of course, stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, a catchphrase that was meant to connect their rapidly growing economies. But that was then. Today, their economies are sluggish at best, and their prospects no longer seem so bright.Everybody knows about China\u2019s troubles: its falling stock market, its slowing economy and the amateurish attempts by the government to revive them, as if they should somehow snap to when the Communist Party gives an order.And then, sigh, there\u2019s Brazil. Inflation? It is closing in on 10 percent. Its currency? The real\u2019s value has dropped nearly in half against the American dollar. Recession? It\u2019s arrived. The consensus view is that the Brazilian economy will shrink by some 2 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, \u201cbetween 100,000 and 120,000 people are losing their jobs every month,\u201d says L\u00facia Guim\u00e3raes, a well-known Brazilian journalist.Compounding the economic problems, many a result simply of poor economic stewardship, a huge corruption scandal has swept up both Brazilian politicians and a number of prominent businesspeople. The scandal centers on the country\u2019s biggest company, Petrobras, whose success had been an object of real pride during the go-go years.Politicians and members of the business elite alike have been arrested. The country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, who was the chairwoman of Petrobras while much of the scheme was taking place, hasn\u2019t been accused of anything, but her approval rating is in the single digits. People have taken to the streets to call for her impeachment, though there are really no grounds yet to impeach her.Political corruption has long been a fact of life in Brazil, but rarely has it been on such vivid, and nauseating, display.The double whammy of scandal and recession has created a mood that combines outrage, anguish and resignation. But there is something else, too. \u201cPeople feel betrayed,\u201d says Guim\u00e3raes. Rousseff\u2019s party, the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) \u2014 or Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 came to office in 2003 promising, idealistically, to create social programs that would help the poor join the middle class. Between 2003 and 2011, according to one estimate, some 40 million people have climbed from abject poverty to the lowest rung on the middle class.\u201cThe worst thing,\u201d a Brazilian friend of mine wrote in an email recently, \u201cis this feeling of disappointment with the \u2026 PT, which brought so much hope to the middle class. I\u2019d call this feeling a kind of political depression.\u201dAnd yet, as I look over the BRICS, I think there is more hope for Brazil than some of its fellow members. Admittedly, I am a lover of Brazil, and want to see it succeed, and so was pleased when, as I made phone calls and emails for this column, a surprising silver lining emerged.It is this: For all the pain Brazilians are going through right now, its democracy and its judicial institutions are working.\u201cWhat I see, more than I\u2019ve ever seen before, is that the country is weathering this storm,\u201d says Cliff Korman, an American musician who has lived and taught in Brazil for decades. It has a free press, which has stayed relentlessly focused on the Petrobras scandal. It has prosecutors who are actually putting politicians and businessmen in prison, and bringing cases against companies. The judiciary is not backing down.\u201cCorruption is such a part of public life,\u201d says Riordan Roett, the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cBut now people are being held accountable. There is a sense that things could actually change.\u201dAnd unlike a half-century ago, when a military dictatorship overthrew a president whose left-wing programs it didn\u2019t like \u2014 and held power for the next 21 years \u2014 there is no hint that such a thing could happen today. No matter how the economy goes, Brazilians are going to be able to choose their own leaders, and in so doing chart their own course.\u201cIt is the beginning of a new Brazil,\u201d Roett says optimistically. It couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer country.Advertisement"}

New Democracy would support Mr. Tsipras on austerity and reforms, giving him an insurmountable majority in Parliament.Mr. Tsipras himself declared that his mandate was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d to get rid of the \u201cwickedness and the regime of corruption and intertwined interests\u201d embedded in Greek politics.

{"Headline": "On the Nordic Trail in Scotland", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "As Scotland looked for traces of Nordic culture in its bid for independence, a trip to find what it means to be Nordic, with a drive into Scotland\u2019s formerly Viking lands.Supported by\u201cSving til venstre.\u201d Jurgen issued instructions in his pleasingly Nordic voice, firm but encouraging. From behind the wheel, David nodded his head, and turned the car to the left. We were only a mile outside Edinburgh, but thanks to David, my Norwegian-American boyfriend, and Jurgen, the Norwegian speaker on David\u2019s GPS, I already felt deep into Viking territory.Scotland is perhaps not the most obvious place to look for traces of Nordic culture. But in the months leading up to the nation\u2019s vote on independence from England last September, there was talk of it everywhere. Although it had been six centuries since any part of Scotland was in Norse hands, many nationalists were suggesting that Viking heritage formed part of the separate identity that lay behind an independence bid, which, although it failed at the polls, has grown stronger since the referendum.And it wasn\u2019t all historic either: The Scottish Nationalist Party assured voters that Scotland\u2019s similarities to its Scandinavian neighbors \u2014 its small size, its environmental awareness and its Norwegian-style oil reserves \u2014 would guarantee prosperity. And perhaps even justify membership in the Nordic Council, an intergovernmental body that fosters political, economic and cultural cooperation among the five Nordic nations and three autonomous regions.As a recent transplant to Denmark, I was still trying to figure out Scandinavian identity myself, so this claim intrigued me. What did it take, besides a penchant for bicycles, brooding television series and salted licorice, to become Nordic? To find out, David and I would start in the capital, then drive as far into Scotland\u2019s formerly Viking lands as we could.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be influenced by it,\u201d Ben Radford, the chef, said of the northerly elements in what he calls his \u201cmodern Scottish\u201d cuisine. \u201cCulturally, we\u2019re very similar. And we\u2019re working with the same ingredients, letting them shine through, so that each flavor is apparent, crisp and clean.\u201dIn Glasgow, two recent graduates take the affinity even further. Through their consulting firm Lateral North, Graham Hogg and Alex Hobday help towns in the upper reaches of Scotland develop their Nordic potential as transportation and green energy hubs. \u201cWe have the same climate, the same landscape, even the same dark sense of humor, so we can take the Nordic countries as a model for economic development,\u201d Mr. Hogg said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get people to think of Scotland not as the end of Europe, but as the gateway to the North.\u201dIt was time to head toward that gate. There are a number of Viking-related spots in the Western Highlands. But Mr. Hogg had said we would find the most striking examples of Scandinavian-style Scotland in Orkney and Shetland, so we fired up the GPS and headed north. \u201cRett frem,\u201d Jurgen said, directing us straight ahead with what I interpreted as approval.Several hours later, Norway appeared on the horizon. In truth, it wasn\u2019t really Norway, just a series of Nordic-style houses \u2014 pointy, clean-lined and painted in bright, saturated colors that stood out against the churning North Sea \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in Bergen. We had reached John O\u2019Groats, the purportedly northernmost (there is some contention) point of mainland Scotland. It consists of little more than a few souvenir shops and a parking lot big enough for all those tour buses to turn around in.But neither Scandi chic, nor the newer, kinder version of the Vikings had made it to the nearby town of Wick, which gets its name from the Old Norse word for bay. Asked why the hotel where she worked was called the Norseman, the receptionist admitted that she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cBecause they came here raping and rampaging through the hills?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou know, doing Viking things.\u201dDid people in this part of Scotland feel Viking? As we stood on the ferry to the Orkney Islands, watching mainland Britain disappear, we pondered the question. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t tell,\u201d David said, \u201cis whether they actually identify with their Nordic past, or if it\u2019s just a marketing ploy.\u201d We had our first answer of a sort after landing at St. Margaret\u2019s Hope, a pretty, stone-clad town that was a welcoming entry to Orkney\u2019s main island. Rebooting Jurgen after his stay in the ship\u2019s hold, we drove to Highland Park distillery in the market town of Kirkwall, the Orcadian capital. The northernmost whiskey distillery in Britain (there would be many claims to the northernmost on this trip), Highland Park makes a line of high-end Scotch whiskies named after Vikings real and imagined: Eibar, Thor, Loki.\u201cWe\u2019re steeped in Viking history, with all its fantastic stories, and if you have a story you can sell more,\u201d said Patricia Retson, Highland Park\u2019s brand heritage manager, after we had toured the distillery\u2019s dankly atmospheric cellar and sleek tasting room. \u201cBut we\u2019re also trying to make a real connection, and if it\u2019s going to work, it has to be authentic.\u201d To that end, the distillery\u2019s Loki gets its mischievousness from an aroma that is all sweet apples, but turns to smoke and wood on the palate. Its Leif Erikssonis aged in 100 percent American oak barrels.Yet in downtown Kirkwall, where the Romanesque cathedral, built of sandstone, houses the relics of St. Magnus Erlendsson, the Norse-descended Earl of Orkney who was martyred after an unsuccessful battle with a rival chieftain in the early 12th century, and where miniature Viking ships still cap the post office lintel, Donna Heddle had no doubt the connection went considerably deeper than mere marketing.As the director of the Center for Nordic Studies, Dr. Heddle sees evidence of Norseness almost everywhere: in the Orkney dialect that puts its prepositions at the end of sentences; in a concept of social justice that emphasizes egalitarianism and spurns status or rank; in the fact, she said, that 66 percent of Orcadians\u2019 DNA is Norwegian. And just as the Nordic presence helps explain the separate sense of identity that Scots feel from the English, so too does it explain the separate identity that Orcadians feel from mainland Scots. \u201cVikings are very sexy now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for us it\u2019s more than that. You can see it in our knitting patterns and our sailing skills and in the can-do attitude. This is a living legacy.\u201dThere would be more culinary connections on the Shetland Islands. We landed early in the morning on the main island after an overnight ferry. Waiting for a cafe to open, we prowled the industrial-looking buildings and still-closed sweater shops in Lerwick, the capital and Shetland\u2019s only real town. Once suitably caffeinated, we returned to Jurgen and headed south. Shetland is almost entirely treeless, with a terrain that veers mainly between the barren and the bleak, but is adorably dotted with the tiny ponies that take their name from the place. Rocky soil and near constant wind explain why the local diet is almost entirely lacking in fresh fruit and vegetables. But even that lack can only partly explain the peculiar dish known as reestit mutton.\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t expect to find this in a restaurant,\u201d said Marian Armitage, the author of \u201cShetland Food and Cooking,\u201d as she sawed off a few rocklike chunks of a fossilized slab of meat in her kitchen, where we had come to learn about the local cuisine. \u201cUnless they were trying to do something quirky.\u201d Through the windows of her enclosed porch, I could just make out the ruined walls of Jarlshof, another Norse settlement, in the distance. Ms. Armitage fried a bit of the mutton in a pan, and explained the process for making it: Raw meat was salted in brine, then hung from the rafters of the house, preferably over a peat fire, so that the smoke seasoned the meat. I put a bite in my mouth: Quirky was definitely one word for it. The mutton was fatty, salty and tasted, well, rotten. \u201cJust what you want,\u201d David said, \u201cafter a long day at sea.\u201dStill, I was thrilled to eat it. A couple of years earlier, I had tried something similar in the Faroe Islands, an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between Norway and Iceland, where they make raest, which is raw mutton hung to air-dry in open huts for months, without the benefit of smoke or salt. Surely, I asked Armitage, raest and reestit were versions of the same dish, and evidence of a Nordic connection? \u201cAh no,\u201d she said. \u201cFor that you\u2019d be wanting vivda.\u201d It turns out that Shetlanders once ate the exact same preparation \u2014 and called it by the Norse word for leg meat\u2014 until salt became more widespread in the islands.Unst has a higher density of rural Viking sites than any place else in the world, including Scandinavia, with 60 longhouses on a 46-square-mile island. For our first stop, at Hamar, we skirted some curious sheep and a watchful bull to walk among the low, grass-carpeted walls of one (David was saved from another re-enacted vanquishing only because the preponderance of dung at our feet made things especially messy.) From what would have been the front door, I gazed down the length of the shimmering fjord, before I looked down to find the fragments of a broken beer bottle. The idea that local teenagers might use this ancient home as a hangout for drinking, flirting and communing with their Viking past pleased me.We were back to the same question, with little of Scottish territory left. Luckily, just as we neared Shetland\u2019s northern edge, we spied Valhalla. It looked more like a warehouse than the Norse god Odin\u2019s grand hall for fallen warriors, but that may have been because on Unst at least, Valhalla is a craft brewery. The name wasn\u2019t the founder Sonny Priest\u2019s idea. \u201cThe Viking thing has been done to death, so I was dead against it,\u201d he said, but more prescient minds on the regional council prevailed. These days, Mr. Priest sells his Old Scatness (named after a Shetland Viking settlement) and Simmer Din (from the Shetland phrase for summer\u2019s long twilight) ales as far as Glasgow and Oslo.He wasn\u2019t sure what to make of his ancestors\u2019 past. \u201cWhen I was a kid, the ties to the Norse felt stronger,\u201d he said as he stopped to stick his nose in a bag of hops. \u201cThere were all these words we used, and the whalers would take our men because they knew our seafaring skills went back to them. Now sometimes I think it\u2019s just for the tourists. But everybody in Shetland is still proud of their Viking heritage.\u201dIn the end, neither its Viking past nor its imagined Nordic future would be strong enough to sever Scotland from England. But at our final stop, David and I could see why it came close. After hiking through the heather at Saxa Vord, we arrived at the northernmost cliff on Shetland\u2019s most northerly inhabited island. To the east, some 200 miles in the distance, was Norway; to the north, past the rocky outcrop of Muckle Flugga, was the Arctic. We watched the sun set, then got back in the car. \u201cReisen slutt,\u201d Jurgen said. It was, as he said, journey\u2019s end.Lisa Abend is a journalist who lives in Copenhagen and writes frequently for the Travel section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Volkswagen Revelation, Auto Emissions Tests Come Under Global Scrutiny", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the United States, automakers conduct their own emissions tests and submit the results to the government. In Europe, automakers pick who conducts the tests and where they are done. And these two regulatory systems are considered the world\u2019s gold standards.Regulators in several European countries have opened investigations, attorneys general in the United States have joined federal inquiries, and there has been broader criticism of Volkswagen, and diesels, in markets from South Korea to Brazil.While United States automakers are allowed to test their own cars, the Environmental Protection Agency does its own random checking, and the vast majority of enforcement actions are undertaken by American regulators.In the European Union, by contrast, automakers can get new car models tested in any member state and can hire private companies, which regard them as clients, to conduct the testing. Member states have regulatory jurisdiction, and enforcement is scant.One of the testing firms used by automakers in Europe is Applus Idiada of Spain, which has counted the major automakers, including Volkswagen, among its clients, though no company beyond Volkswagen has been implicated in the current scandal.What does that mean for automaker clients?\u201cThey will find ways to artificially lower the test results using flexibilities in the testing methods,\u201d Greg Archer, a former director at Britain\u2019s renewable-fuels regulator who now works at Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based advocacy group that has done its own testing, said in an interview.The way the system is set up creates inherent problems, Mr. Archer added.\u201cCarmakers \u2018shop\u2019 for the best deal from agencies across Europe and directly pay for their services,\u201d he said in a recent statement on the Volkswagen scandal. \u201cThe job of the engineer overseeing the test is ultimately dependent on the next contract from the carmaker.\u201dThe company did not have an immediate comment.Automakers have the same incentive to shop around for lenient testing companies that bond issuers have long had to shop around for the credit rating agency that would give them the highest credit rating. Overgenerous ratings of complex financial instruments based on mortgage prices were widely blamed as helping to set off the global financial crisis.Volkswagen\u2019s rivals have had a clear response to the emissions cheating scandal: not us. \u201cThere is no evidence that this is an industrywide issue,\u201d the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association said in a statement on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWe cannot comment on an issue affecting one individual company.\u201dLawmakers in the European Parliament on Wednesday debated the implications of the scandal at length, with members in several parties advocating a greater regulatory and oversight role for the European government, instead of the member states.\u201cOf course that will be a big fight with the member states,\u201d said Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green Party member who sits on the Parliament\u2019s committee on Environmental, Public Health and Food Safety.He said he wanted the European Commission, the government\u2019s executive branch, to move quickly on plans to put new emissions testing into effect that will take place at independent laboratories. And he wanted commission officials to quickly determine if the Volkswagen software was used to evade European tests, something that has still not been disclosed by Volkswagen.He said some lawmakers also lamented that Europe lagged on enforcement, leaving American regulators to take on such cases.\u201cWe are better in talking. The U.S. is better in acting,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s a bit of a painful conclusion.\u201dIn the United States, as attorneys general across the country opened investigations, Dan Becker, director of the safe climate campaign at the Center for Auto Safety, said the country also needed to rethink how emissions were tested. Independent testing has shown a widening gap between results in laboratories and the real world, raising suspicion.\u201cThe automakers have proven that they\u2019re not trustworthy,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cThe government has to overhaul the testing to make sure that independent parties ensure that the cars that are put on the road pollute less and are safe.\u201dThere are differing priorities among regulators around the world. Europe\u2019s regulations have tended to emphasize global warming emissions, while American regulation has put more focus on smog-forming pollutants, making it more difficult for diesel to comply. But those differences have been narrowing.Many other countries follow regulatory developments in the United States and in Europe. India and China rely on old European emissions standards known as Euro 4 that were phased out by Europe in 2009, replaced by Euro 5 and then Euro 6 rules that have stricter limits on smog-forming pollutants.S. Velmurugan, head of the traffic and engineering division at the Central Road Research Institute, an Indian government research body based in Delhi, said there had been an influx of Volkswagen cars in the past three or four years in India, some of them diesels. Volkswagen diesels still represented only about 1 percent of overall car sales in India last year.But the Indian regulatory system to measure the quantity and quality of emissions produced by cars is widely regarded as flawed.\u201cIf the software is coming as part of the engine, it is easy to pass the test,\u201d Dr. Velmurugan said. American testing methods were \u201cmore rigorous,\u201d he added. \u201cOurs are not very good.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In Brazil, which has also used European emissions standards as a model, Marcio Veloso, coordinator of emissions control at the country\u2019s Environment Ministry, said the government would make an official request to Volkswagen to determine if the software was used on Volkswagen\u2019s only diesel model in Brazil, a pickup truck.\u201cIf they say the technology was used here, we\u2019ll take appropriate legal measures,\u201d Mr. Veloso said. \u201cIf they say it wasn\u2019t, we\u2019ll do some tests just in case. And in the future we may pay a little closer attention to Volkswagen.\u201dThe new scandal could also crush the efforts of German automakers to open more export markets to diesel. Volkswagen had struggled for many years to win governments\u2019 permission to sell diesel cars outside Europe, and that goal now seems especially challenged.South Korea has said it will investigate emissions levels of four Volkswagen models: Golf, Jetta, Beetle and Audi A3. About 6,000 cars of those models have been sold in South Korea.\u201cWe can order a recall and a halt to sales, as well as a financial penalty, if we find the same problem in any of the models,\u201d said Kwon Sang-il, an environment ministry official. Volkswagen could face a fine of up to $3.4 million if wrongdoing is found in all four models.The inquiry will continue through October, the ministry said, and could expand to include other Volkswagen models.But there was much chatter online in China, with little positive for the company\u2019s image.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the coordinator of emissions control at the Brazilian Environment Ministry. He is Marcio Veloso, not Velloso.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article rendered incorrectly the name of site of the Center for Alternative Fuel Engines and Emissions. It is West Virginia University, not the University of West Virginia.Dan Horch, Swati Gupta and Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting. Kiki Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Pivots Again as He Seeks a $15 Minimum Wage", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at his side, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York presented himself as a champion of the working class on Thursday, pledging to campaign for a statewide minimum wage of $15 an hour.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal, which would require legislative approval in Albany, was another pivot by the governor on the issue of mandating how much employers can pay their workers. Just six months ago, he said $15 an hour, the minimum that fast-food workers demanded, was \u201ctoo high,\u201d and proposed $10.50 as an alternative.But on Thursday, surrounded by hundreds of supportive union members in a convention hall in Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo said he would carry the banner for a $15 minimum wage, which would be more than double the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. Several cities, including Los Angeles and Seattle, have laid plans to raise their minimum wages to $15, but no state has gone that far.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said that New York, which he called the \u201cprogressive capital of this nation,\u201d should lead the way in setting a minimum wage that would provide workers with a decent standard of living. As a rhetorical flourish, he evoked the memory of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and a speech he delivered at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. Quoting his father\u2019s allusion to the despair of the working poor and unemployed, Mr. Cuomo said that raising the minimum wage broadly would restore dignity to workers who could not support their families without public subsidies. \u201cIt will herald a new economic contract with America and it\u2019s about time,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo announced that the state\u2019s acting labor commissioner, Mario J. Musolino, had signed an order that would raise the minimum wage for many fast-food workers in the state to $15 an hour over a few years. Having engineered that increase, the governor vowed to shoulder the bigger task of persuading lawmakers to extend the increases to all workers in the state.Mr. Biden said that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s embrace of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign would have \u201ca profound impact\u201d and would cause other governors to consider following suit. But the vice president stopped short of saying the Obama administration would join in. He affirmed that President Obama was pressing Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, an initiative that Republicans in Washington have strongly opposed.Restaurant industry groups and other business associations argue that raising the minimum wage hurts workers by forcing employers to cut payrolls. They say many of the businesses that pay wages at or near the minimum are small, family-owned establishments that cannot absorb big increases in labor costs.But Mr. Biden said the administration believed that raising the wages of the lowest-paid workers would add to economic growth because those workers would spend their additional income and that spending would \u201cripple\u201d through the economy. \u201cGuess what happens?\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cYou raise everybody up.\u201dProgressive leaders celebrated Mr. Cuomo\u2019s announcement. Bill Lipton, New York state director of the Working Families Party, said, \u201cIf Gov. Cuomo wins $15 statewide, it will be one for the history books, no exaggeration.\u201dBut Republicans in Albany do not see a $15 minimum wage as inevitable. They agreed to phase in an increase in the state\u2019s minimum wage to $9 next year, from $8.75 now. They rejected Mr. Cuomo\u2019s earlier push for $10.50. State Senator Jack M. Martins, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, held a hearing in Albany on Thursday about the panel appointed by Mr. Cuomo that recommended raising the minimum for fast-food workers to $15. He said many owners of fast-food franchises were \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cconcerned as to their ability to stay open.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t know what happened between $10.50 six months ago and $15 now,\u201d Mr. Martins said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the significance of $15? In my mind, it\u2019s a political number. The governor has not established $15 as a fair number.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018War of Princes\u2019 Sows Turmoil at South Korean Conglomerate", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The plot sounds like something out of a Korean television drama.An executive is kicked out of the management of his family\u2019s $79 billion business empire and suspects his younger brother is behind the move. The elder brother enlists the help of the chairman \u2014 their father \u2014 in regaining power. But the younger brother dethrones their father, too, and consolidates control of the conglomerate, at least for now.Yet this isn\u2019t fiction. It\u2019s the saga of the Lotte Group, a household name in South Korea that includes a nationwide chain of hotels, shopping malls, movie theaters, apartment buildings, coffee shops and burger joints.Sibling disputes \u2014 like the feud this summer between the two sons of Shin Kyuk-ho, the 92-year-old founder of Lotte \u2014 are a recurring phenomenon at South Korean chaebol, or family-owned conglomerates. And as small as these squabbles may appear, they have direct implications for the country\u2019s economy. Every major industry in South Korea is dominated by such groups, which include Samsung, Hyundai and LG.The country\u2019s lawmakers were concerned enough that they called a parliamentary hearing on Lotte\u2019s troubles last week, in which the younger brother personally apologized for the turmoil.\u201cThere is hardly any major chaebol group that has not been rocked by a \u2018war of princes\u2019; it\u2019s such a volatile issue that it\u2019s a great blessing for Samsung and Hyundai that their current chairmen only had one son,\u201d said Lee Ji-soo, the director of the Law and Business Research Center in Seoul, which monitors chaebol. \u201cWhen investors demand better corporate governance at chaebol, they include transparency in succession plans.\u201dSuch governance issues can be alarming to global investors. They fear that the combination of complex business structures and chains of succession tied only to which founder\u2019s child is in favor exposes multibillion-dollar companies to upheaval.The families that run the top 10 chaebol own only 2.7 percent of their empires on average, according to government data. But typical chairmen wield what critics call kinglike control over their groups by keeping their companies interlocked through cross-shareholding. Units are supervised by executives whose careers rise and fall at the whims of the chairman.Lotte, South Korea\u2019s fifth-largest chaebol, is a classic example.Its subsidiaries\u2019 ownerships and futures are entangled in 416 rings of circular shareholding, which would make a diagram explaining it all look like a bowl of spaghetti. The structure is designed in part to prevent hostile takeovers by ensuring that no large stakes will be vulnerable. But it also means financial troubles at one company can easily spill over into the rest of the conglomerate.Chaebol chairmen delay selecting heirs until late in life. With multibillion-dollar fortunes at stake, their offspring commonly file lawsuits, install surveillance cameras and accuse each other of forging their father\u2019s wills in winner-takes-all struggles.Family feuds have often broken up chaebol. In 2000, Hyundai was split into four groups by such a spat. In other cases, they have led to prolonged management disarray, as in the episodes at the Doosan and Kumho groups.Lotte is one of South Korea\u2019s biggest employers, with 310,000 people on its payroll at home and abroad. In 2014, its 80 subsidiaries posted 93 trillion won, or $79 billion, in revenue. But it had humble roots.Mr. Shin stowed away on a ship to Japan in 1941, when Korea was still a Japanese colony. There, he attended college and started a chewing gum company, later expanding his business to his home country. His Korean wife died young, leaving him with a daughter. He later had two sons with his Japanese wife: Dong-joo, 61, put in charge of Lotte\u2019s operation in Japan; and Dong-bin, 60, the leader of Lotte in South Korea.While Lotte\u2019s growth stalled in Japan, the younger son, Dong-bin, helped build it into South Korea\u2019s No. 1 retail giant through mergers and acquisitions. Under his leadership, Lotte expanded its petrochemical business, opened a chain of shopping malls in China and Vietnam and bought hotels abroad, including the New York Palace Hotel. It is building the 1,821-foot Lotte World Tower, South Korea\u2019s tallest building, in Seoul.Then, over several months starting at the end of 2014, Dong-joo was stripped of responsibility.\u201cIt\u2019s father, who is doing this,\u201d Dong-bin told reporters in January, referring to his elder brother\u2019s being edged out.In mid-July, Dong-bin was named chief executive of Lotte Holdings of Japan, the de facto holding company of the entire group. But Dong-joo fought back, appealing to his father and rallying support from uncles and his half sister, who local media said \u201cholds the ears\u201d of the wheelchair-bound patriarch. In late July, Dong-joo said the father had ordered the removal of Dong-bin and his allies from the board of Lotte Holdings.The next day, however, Dong-bin convened a board meeting, where Mr. Shin\u2019s order was nullified and the father was stripped of his chairman\u2019s title.In early August, the battle reached a crescendo. Dong-joo called his younger brother an ingrate mutinous son who had gone \u201cagainst father\u2019s will\u201d in his greed to run the whole empire. Dong-joo also released documents anointing him as heir, which he said had been signed by his father.\u201cShin Dong-bin has no authority, no justification,\u201d a frail Mr. Shin said, reading haltingly from a prepared statement, in video footage released by Dong-joo. \u201cI can never understand or tolerate him for trying to exclude me, his father, from Lotte Group, which I have built for 70 years.\u201dSupporters of Dong-bin called his older brother an incompetent manager and accused him and his cronies of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d Mr. Shin\u2019s \u201caddled mind\u201d and plotting to split the group. To chaebol watchers, such comments crossed a line: It is taboo for chaebol managers to speak in public about the condition of a chairman.\u201cLotte is what it is today due to the great leadership of the general chairman,\u201d said Hwang Kag-gyu, a Lotte executive and an ally of Dong-bin, referring to the founder. \u201cIf you compare the performances of the two brothers, it\u2019s clear who is the proven leader, who is better for the group and for its stakeholders and employees.\u201dBy mid-August, the dust had settled, with Dong-bin emerging as the victor. Shareholders of Lotte Holdings approved his leadership and his management plans, but the sibling dispute is not completely over. Dong-joo still is a major shareholder in key Lotte companies, and each brother has threatened to take the other to court.\u201cThe management of the group remains in a medieval era,\u201d Chosun Ilbo, a South Korean daily, said in an editorial.Dong-bin said the company would spend 7 trillion won, or about $5.9 billion, to remove many of the interlocking shareholder rings. That would make the conglomerate more resilient to losses at any of its component companies.\u201cThis happened because while Lotte has been growing, it didn\u2019t do enough to improve its ownership structure and management transparency,\u201d he said, bowing in apology at a news conference in Seoul last month.He said that he still respected his father. But, he added, \u201cmanagement is separate from the family.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the interest of everybody, it is convenient to stabilize the oil market.\u201dMr. Correa did not predict when oil prices might rise to that level, which would be well above the record of nearly $150 a barrel in 2008 and more than four times as high as prices are now. But the logic of his remark follows the historical ups and downs of oil prices. Whenever prices fell, as in the 1980s and 1990s, oil producers cut investments in exploration and production fell. Low prices at the pump encouraged consumers to drive more.That squeeze inevitably led to a new cycle of high prices, although predictions on market direction are often off by years.\u201cAny forecasts about oil prices are wrong,\u201d Mr. Correa said, smiling. \u201cIn 2008, all the experts said higher prices will be forever, and the next year they fell a lot. In 2009, people said they will stay low forever, and then they increased.\u201dUntil recently, Ecuador had one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, but this year Mr. Correa forecast a growth rate of 0.4 percent.\u201cI have lots of problems,\u201d Mr. Correa conceded. Expecting another year of low oil prices, he said, \u201cWe are preparing important adjustments.\u201dHe said much of the developing world was facing mounting economic challenges because of the end of the commodity boom of recent years that funneled so much money to the poorest nations for their oil, copper and agricultural production, much of it destined for China.\u201cWith some exceptions, everybody is worried,\u201d he said of his fellow leaders of the developing world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyprus Hopes Reunification Talks Will Revive a Resort, Population 0", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFamagusta JournalFAMAGUSTA, Cyprus \u2014 Beyond a wilderness of parched weeds, crumbling buildings and roads amputated by tangles of razor wire, a long line of multistory hotels basks in the east Mediterranean sun.Behind it, the turquoise sea glistens, rolling softly onto a five-mile stretch of golden sand.In July, places like this around the Mediterranean are normally crowded with thousands of tourists. Yet a nearby beach, once visited by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren and Paul Newman, is different.At the height of the tourist season, and every other season for the last 41 years, this beach is deserted.The invasion set off fighting between Turkish Cypriots living here in Famagusta\u2019s medieval center and Greek Cypriots living just outside in the resort suburb of Varosha.As Turkish invasion forces neared, the 45,000 mainly Greek Cypriot inhabitants of Varosha fled south. None have returned.\u201cWe thought we\u2019d be back after a few days,\u201d Despina Tsikkini, a former resident, said. \u201cBut now, it\u2019s 41 years.\u201dFinding Varosha empty, Turkish troops sealed it off with a wall of barbed wire, turning it into a so-called military forbidden zone. It has remained that way since, a symbol of an intractable problem in a region that is riddled with them.Now, though, hopes are at their highest in years that this ghost resort may soon come back to life.Successful talks would end four decades of division \u2014 and Varosha\u2019s former inhabitants could return home.This would have major implications for Cyprus, as Varosha brings into focus both the tragedy of Cyprus\u2019s division and the potential benefits of its reunification.\u201cWith the best beach in the Mediterranean, Varosha is like Copacabana,\u201d said Costas Apostolides, a Harvard-trained economist and a former officer at the Cypriot Planning Bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s huge. Opening it up again could by itself rejuvenate the entire island\u2019s economy.\u201dToday, the island is split between the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus in the south and, in the north, the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey. Famagusta and Varosha lie in the Turkish area.Since 1974, United Nations-backed negotiations between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots have failed to reunite the island.Yet with a settlement, Mr. Anastasiades told a joint meeting of the Cyprus and Turkish Cyprus Chambers of Commerce in July, \u201cthere is the potential that the all-island G.D.P. could double in 20 years time.\u201dIn the north of the island, economic conditions are also far from healthy.\u201cWe have youth unemployment of around 40 percent,\u201d said Serdar Atai of the Famagusta Initiative, a Turkish Cypriot organization that wants to reopen Varosha and reunite the two communities. \u201cMany young people go abroad to find work, and often they don\u2019t come back.\u201dPavlos Iacovou of Famagusta, Our City, another organization committed to reunification, said: \u201cVarosha was once home to some 60 percent of the island\u2019s entire stock of hotel rooms, while the neighboring port of Famagusta handled some 65 percent of the island\u2019s trade. All that went in 1974.\u201dWith a port in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is subject to an international trade embargo, Famagusta has withered as a trade hub and tourism has never recovered.The barbed wire, buffer zones and Turkish military bases around Varosha have also taken their toll on nearby towns. Deryneia, a Greek Cypriot town to the south, lost about 75 percent of its land and its beach to the Turkish military.\u201cWith all this gone, there\u2019s little work and we\u2019re losing population, as people move away to find jobs and a future,\u201d said Andros Karayiannis, mayor of Deryneia.A report by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, a nonprofit independent research institute, found last year that if the island were reunited, there would be a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d of around 20 billion euros, or about $22 billion \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to the existing gross domestic product of the Republic of Cyprus.\u201cThe value of the land in the closed area of Varosha alone, I would say, is conservatively worth around \u20ac5 billion \u2014 very conservatively,\u201d said Mr. Apostolides, the economist.Reuniting the island would have other economic benefits.Because of the embargo there is no direct foreign trade with the Turkish north, said Fiona Mullen of Sapienta Economics, a private economic consultancy based in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. \u201cTo fly there, you have to go via Turkey,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, while the whole island is technically part of the European Union, in the north, all E.U. rules are suspended, so you don\u2019t have E.U. regulations in place to attract investors.\u201dAt the same time, the Republic of Cyprus is stymied by a counterembargo by Turkey on its ships and planes, denying them access to the giant and lucrative Turkish market, its closest neighbor.\u201cThe conflict also means they can\u2019t properly look for oil and gas around the island,\u201d Ms. Mullen added.Yet putting Cyprus back together again may also have its costs.\u201cThe big problem,\u201d Mr. Apostolides said, is compensating people who were forced to leave their homes. \u201cJust this could cost \u20ac30 billion.\u201dIn 1974, about 165,000 Greek Cypriots fled south, while 45,000 Turkish Cypriots became refugees in the north. Many of their homes are now inhabited by others or have been demolished.At the same time, a settlement would probably mean new population movements, as Greek and Turkish Cypriot territory within the new, unified state would most likely be readjusted.Compensating people for these losses would be a critical, and costly, part of any settlement.\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen recently, there\u2019s a distinct lack of appetite for throwing money around among international lenders,\u201d Ms. Mullen said. \u201cPlus, you don\u2019t want reunification to be financed by more debt or more bail-ins.\u201dAnother problem would be trying to bring incomes in the north into line with incomes in the south, which are generally much higher.But Mertkan Hamit of the Famagusta Initiative said, \u201cThe last time we thought there might be a settlement, back in 2004, per capita income in the north nearly doubled on the back of a boom in construction, as people thought our isolation was about to be over.\u201dReopening Varosha would most likely involve rebuilding most of the abandoned area, also a major expense.\u201cYou\u2019d see the biggest investment growth in an area that currently has the highest unemployment on the island,\u201d Mr. Hamit said. \u201cRebuilding the place is not a cost, but gives long-term added value to the economy.\u201dOver the decades, Varosha\u2019s once-glittering avenues have decayed, and the windmills that once pumped water to irrigate acres of orange groves around the city now stand locked and frozen.\u201cBy day, you look over and see a whole city,\u201d Mr. Hamit said. \u201cThen, at night, you see nothing. Not a single light. It\u2019s like we\u2019re sleeping with the dead. It\u2019s time to turn the lights back on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big Bet That China\u2019s Currency Will Devalue Further", "Date": "2015-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Mark L. Hart III, a hedge fund investor based in Texas, makes an investment bet, he does it in the style of his home state: big time.Since 2007, his winners have included high-risk, high-return wagers that the United States housing market would collapse and that Greece would go bankrupt.But Mr. Hart\u2019s most audacious gamble to date may well be the one he is making on China. He is betting that the mini-devaluation of China\u2019s currency last month was a mere appetizer to a 50 percent currency implosion that he predicts will come when foreign investors pull their money out of China.Such an extreme drop in China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, would propel a broader rout in emerging-market currencies \u2014 from South Korea to Turkey to Brazil \u2014 and result in a sustained global slump as China\u2019s borrowing binge grinds to a halt.A growing number of investors like Mr. Hart have concluded that a dollar that strengthens with the United States economy will have a devastating effect not only on China but on emerging markets in general. Their view is that the trillions of dollars that chased risky investment opportunities in China, Brazil, Turkey and other countries are swiftly exiting and that the pace will pick up when the Federal Reserve eventually raises interest rates.The result, they say, will be plunging currencies, corporate defaults and a sustained growth slowdown over the next few years. This week, emerging-market currencies continued their decline, led by Brazil, Turkey, Mexico and South Africa.John H. Burbank III, a veteran emerging-market investor at Passport Capital, a $4 billion hedge fund in San Francisco, has earned stellar returns this year by betting on weak commodities and imploding emerging-market stock markets and currencies.In a report by HSBC on top-performing hedge fund managers, a special opportunities fund managed by Mr. Burbank increased 29 percent through July of this year. Through August, his Global Strategy Fund was up 14.5 percent.At the root of this investment thesis is the belief that China\u2019s 3 percent currency devaluation last month was not a one-time event, as many analysts have suggested.Instead, these investors think that after a borrowing and investing frenzy \u2014 much of which was financed by dollar-based lenders \u2014 China is experiencing a run on the bank similar to what happened to Asian countries in 1997 when their semi-pegged currencies collapsed.In the first quarter of this year, $109 billion left Chinese banks for overseas institutions, according to the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for global central banks.And the investors further think that the country\u2019s $3.5 trillion in foreign exchange reserves \u2014 down from $4 trillion a year ago \u2014 will not be enough to prevent a large-scale currency rout.According to Tim Lee of Pi Economics, a research firm based in Greenwich, Conn., emerging-market borrowers have accumulated $3 trillion in cheap dollar-based loans in the last decade of extra-loose central bank policies.As long as interest rates in the United States remain low and emerging-market currencies remain strong, these trades have been highly profitable. But as rates in the United States increase and the values of local currencies plunge, these profits evaporate, causing investors to flee \u2014 as they have in countries like Turkey, Brazil and South Africa.Tim Lee of Pi Economics says that emerging market borrowers have accumulated $3 trillion in cheap dollar-based loans in the last decade of extra loose central bank policies.Mr. Hart calculates that the size of the Chinese carry trade is around $2 trillion, by far the highest figure for any emerging-market borrower. And his view from the beginning has been that the dollars that have flowed into China \u2014 financing an investment rate of 50 percent of the overall economy \u2014 must eventually flow out again.\u201cIt is the greatest carry trade in modern history,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cThere is nothing that is even close.\u201dTo calculate China\u2019s ability to prevent a run on the renminbi, Mr. Hart has focused on an obscure financial measure that is attracting increased attention as analysts scramble to gauge how vulnerable emerging-market currencies have become.The ratio examines a country\u2019s stash of dollar reserves \u2014 its primary asset pile \u2014 relative to all the short-term money it must pay back on demand, such as deposits socked away in banks.In the event of a currency crisis, these funds would flee. So economies with a large proportion of cash reserves compared to these broad liabilities would be in the best position to defend their currencies.\u201cIf there is a run on the currency, everyone will want to turn their yuan into dollars,\u201d said Jurgen Odenius, the chief economist of Prudential Fixed Income. Yuan is a shorthand reference to China\u2019s currency. \u201cAnd on that basis, China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves do not rank among the stronger countries. There is a lot of leverage in the system.\u201dSince the dollar began its relentless move upward about a year ago, the Turkish lira has lost 35 percent, the Brazilian real has dropped 65 percent and the South African dollar has declined 20 percent.But many analysts point to the weakness in currencies that are trade competitors with China as being a more telling sign that China\u2019s currency will devalue further. The Japanese yen has fallen 60 percent against the dollar since 2012, and over the last year, the Korean won and the Taiwan dollar have lost more than 10 percent.As such, China\u2019s 3 percent currency adjustment does absolutely nothing to improve its export competitiveness, said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colo.Of course, having a bright idea does not guarantee it will make money. Mr. Hart, who reaped 500 percent and 200 percent returns on his mortgage and European trades, has yet to hit the jackpot on his China play even though he first put it on in 2010.It could also be that the Federal Reserve\u2019s reluctance to increase interest rates will weaken the dollar and take the pressure off China and other emerging-market currencies.Mr. Hart, who is 43, has a different approach compared with most hedge fund managers. There is his Texas domicile, which he credits with keeping him and his team at Corriente Advisors at a safe distance from the groupthink traps found in traditional hedge fund centers in New York, London and Greenwich. (The name of his firm is taken from Corriente cattle, a longhorn breed.)A classic macro investor, he will identify a theme, raise money from wealthy individuals and institutions and then return the cash, regardless if his bet has paid off or not.So he gets paid not for sitting on a pile of assets but when the gamble pays off, at which point he takes a slice of the profit. Mr. Hart\u2019s China bets consist mostly of buying currency derivatives that pay off if the renminbi loses value against the dollar.This June, he closed his China fund, just months before the devaluation. But he has kept his China bet on for himself and several private investors. Mr. Hart would not comment on whether he had plans to start a new China fund.In his Real Vision interview, Mr. Hart explained that since 2006, he had been putting on a series of disaster trades in the belief that the world economy would be entering a sustained phase of deflation and low growth.The United States mortgage and European bets represented the first two legs of this thesis; China was the third.\u201cMy fund would have benefited quite a bit, but my timing was off,\u201d Mr. Hart said in an email exchange. \u201cI believe that there is still much more downside in the yuan.\u201d videoAdvertisement"}

Soldiers, armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, were stationed around the national radio and television stations and at the airport, which was closed.The government ordered residents to stay away from the neighborhood around the palace, known as Ouaga 2000.On Tuesday night, General Diend\u00e9r\u00e9 told Agence France-Presse in a telephone interview that he feared \u201cmany deaths and injuries\u201d in the operation, but there was no official confirmation of any casualties. General Diend\u00e9r\u00e9 said he had left the base, but he would not disclose his whereabouts.The transitional government announced the end of the coup in a statement.\u201cThe coup elements of the former R.S.P. remained unbending in their will to define the Burkinabe people,\u201d the transitional government said, using the French initials of the Presidential Security Regiment. \u201cUsing delaying tactics in the expectation of foreign reinforcements and in the hope of an eventually rallying of internal support, these coup elements, surrounded by a group of die-hards, have held the daily lives of millions of Burkinabe people. Faced with a situation that had become intolerable for our people, and determined to turn this dark page in our common history, our patriotic Defense and Security Forces carried out their responsibilities successfully.\u201dThe R.S.P. was created in 1995 by President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who was toppled by a mass uprising last October after 27 years in power. Mr. Compaor\u00e9 has been living in exile in Morocco \u2014 he was scheduled to travel to Ivory Coast for medical treatment on Tuesday \u2014 but many of his associates and supporters remain active in political life.The coup began on the night of Sept. 16 when officers of the regiment stormed the presidential palace and held the interim president, Michel Kafando, and the prime minister, Lt. Col. Isaac Zida, hostage, along with several cabinet members. The regiment announced that General Diend\u00e9r\u00e9, a former chief of staff to Mr. Compaor\u00e9, had taken charge of the country.But the revolt quickly began to fall apart. Protests erupted in the country\u2019s major cities: Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou and Ouahigouya. Unions went on strike, shutting down the economy. The United Nations condemned the takeover, and the African Union suspended Burkina Faso\u2019s membership.Under the agreement brokered by the leaders, the R.S.P. was supposed to return to its barracks and disarm. General Diend\u00e9r\u00e9 publicly apologized for the coup and urged his followers to comply, but many in the 1,300-member regiment refused.On Monday, the government declared the situation to be at an impasse and accused the regiment of soliciting help from \u201cjihadists.\u201dWestern governments worry that Islamist extremist groups, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, may infiltrate Burkina Faso from its northern neighbors, Mali and Niger.In a radio interview on Tuesday, General Diend\u00e9r\u00e9 said, \u201cI categorically deny this accusation.\u201d He said that he accepted the decision to disband the R.S.P. and that he had tried to defuse the standoff, which he attributed to \u201crogue elements.\u201d He noted that prominent officers in the regiment \u2014 including Commandant Abdoul Aziz Korogo, the unit\u2019s interim commanding officer, and Capt. Abdoulaye Dao, its spokesman \u2014 had agreed to withdraw from the camp, along with scores of other members.Thibault Bluy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen to Stop Sales of Diesel Cars Involved in Recall", "Date": "2015-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Schilling, a Volkswagen spokesman, said that the company would stop selling 2015 and 2016 Volkswagen and Audi models equipped with 4-cylinder turbo diesel engines, which the company has marketed as \u201cclean diesel.\u201d The company will also stop selling used cars that have the engines, Mr. Schilling said.He said he did not know how many models would be stuck on dealer lots as a result of the decision. Earlier this month, Volkswagen had said that 23 percent of new cars sold in August in the United States were diesels, or 7,400 vehicles.The confirmation of the halt in sales came on the same day that Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, apologized for conduct that prompted the Environmental Protection Agency to order Volkswagen to recall nearly half a million vehicles.Volkswagen could face billions of dollars in fines for what the E.P.A. said was a deliberate attempt to evade rules on emissions. The decision to stop sales was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\u201cI personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,\u201d Mr. Winterkorn said in a statement.He said the company would \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with the authorities and order its own independent investigation into the accusations.In his statement, Mr. Winterkorn did not contest assertions by the E.P.A. that Volkswagen sold cars equipped with software that could detect when periodic state government emissions testing was taking place.Diesel-driven cars have enjoyed something of a renaissance in recent years, shedding much of their old stigma for being dirty, clanky and sluggish to drive, said Karl Brauer, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. And in the United States, he said, Volkswagen has clearly led the pack \u2014 offering diesel vehicles that performed just like their gasoline counterparts.\u201cNow, we have to wonder if the technology really advanced as far as we thought at VW,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cThey must have had a problem making it work in a way that delivered truly clean diesel. At least clean enough to meet the regulations.\u201dMr. Brauer said the higher nitrogen oxide emissions probably allowed better drivability. Fuel economy also improves with more NOx emissions, and engines can run cooler, and thus wear out more slowly.\u201cThey must have had a mix of performance, economy and durability that they liked, but realized they couldn\u2019t achieve that and still get the emissions,\u201d he said.Diesels in particular are known \u2014 and marketed \u2014 these days as having tremendous torque, or low-end thrust from a stop. If achieving the required emissions affected the torque, making it anemic, then \u201cdrivers are going to scratch their heads, thinking, isn\u2019t this why I got a diesel?\u201d Mr. Brauer said.Following Mr. Pi\u00ebch\u2019s departure, some analysts have raised questions about whether Mr. Winterkorn would be strong enough to hold together the sprawling Volkswagen empire, which also includes Audi and Bentley luxury cars, Porsche and Lamborghini sports cars, Scania and MAN heavy trucks, and Ducati motorcycles.Although Volkswagen recently surpassed Toyota as the world\u2019s biggest automaker measured by the number of cars sold, it is significantly less profitable than its Japanese rival and far weaker in the United States market.A push by Volkswagen to increase sales in the United States, which included building a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., to produce Passat sedans, has fallen short.\u201cFor Volkswagen, it\u2019s a huge scandal,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen, who follows the automobile industry. \u201cThe timing is extremely unfortunate.\u201dProfessor Dudenh\u00f6ffer said the case could damage all German automakers, which have tried to build acceptance in the United States for diesel engines, a sector in which they believe they have a technological lead.Until recently, Professor Dudenh\u00f6ffer said, the United States applied stricter standards to diesel engines than those applied by European regulators. But the European authorities, concerned about the health effects of diesel pollution, have tightened standards, prompting complaints from the auto industry.Professor Dudenh\u00f6ffer said that as a result of the E.P.A. action, Mr. Winterkorn could come under pressure to resign.\u201cWinterkorn was already damaged,\u201d Professor Dudenh\u00f6ffer said. \u201cNow there is an accusation of illegal behavior. This story is not over.\u201dE.P.A. officials issued the car company a notice of violation and said it had admitted to the use of a so-called defeat device.The recall involves 4-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi vehicles from the model years 2009 to 2015.The software was designed to conceal the cars\u2019 emission of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that contributes to the creation of ozone and smog, which are linked to a range of health problems, including asthma attacks, other respiratory diseases and premature death.Disengaging the pollution controls on a diesel-fueled car can yield better performance, including increased torque and acceleration.California has issued a separate notice of violation to the company. California, the E.P.A. and the Justice Department are working together on an investigation of the allegations.Over the next year, E.P.A. officials said, owners of the affected vehicles should expect to receive recall notices from Volkswagen, including information about how to get their cars repaired at no cost to them. The recall covers roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the United States since 2009.The American investigation could ultimately result in fines or penalties for the company. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, the Justice Department could impose fines of as much as $37,500 for each recalled vehicle, for a possible total penalty of as much as $18 billion.Mr. Winterkorn said in his statement on Sunday that Volkswagen would \u201cdo everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused.\u201d\u201cThis matter has first priority for me, personally,\u201d he said, \u201cand for our entire board of management.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the model years of affected cars that Volkswagen would stop selling. The company will stop selling both 2015 and 2016 Volkswagen and Audi models, not just 2015 models.An article on Monday about Volkswagen\u2019s decision to stop selling models of diesel vehicles equipped with software to disable their emissions control systems misstated the name of an emission that, while an air pollutant, also acts to enhance performance and fuel economy. It is nitrogen oxide, not nitrous oxide.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Coral Davenport from Washington. Aaron Kessler contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pope\u2019s Priorities in America", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAnyone who wants to understand the message Pope Francis will bring to the United States should visit the Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Detroit. In one classroom is a photograph of the pope sending a dove aloft; in the art room, a picture of a smiling Francis with a lamb draped across his shoulders; in the Spanish-language room, an image of him sporting a sombrero. Alongside these informal snaps is one formal portrait.The photographs weren\u2019t collected by the staff or students. They were sent by the pope himself, in apology for not being able to include the school in his recent \u201cvirtual audience\u201d with people in three American cities ahead of his arrival in Washington on Tuesday. The images offer a clue to his priorities in his approaching visit to the United States.His selection of photographs \u2014 intimate and humorous, direct and personal \u2014 suggests his prime emphasis will be upon engaging ordinary people more than the political elite. But that formal portrait is a reminder that behind the avuncular warmth of the smiling pope something more steely lies. He takes a highly critical line on the consumerist society and free-market capitalism that underpins the American economy. And the U.S. political elite can expect to see a glint of that steel.In one papal document, \u201cEvangelii Gaudium\u201d (\u201cThe Joy of the Gospel\u201d), Francis declared that the \u201cworship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money.\u201d Trickle-down economics, he says, simply does not work. The rich are \u201cstealing\u201d if they do not share their wealth with the poor. In his encyclical, \u201cLaudato Si\u201d\u2019 (\u201cPraise Be to You\u201d), he wrote that the West\u2019s throwaway society with its profit-before-all-else economics is destroying the planet.The pope is getting more vehement, not less. In his most ferocious denunciation of global capitalism before a gathering of community activists in Bolivia in July, Francis condemned the \u201cunfettered pursuit of money.\u201d He concluded: \u201cLet us not be afraid to say it \u2014 we want change, real change, structural change. This system is now intolerable.\u201d The hourlong speech, written by Francis himself, called for change no fewer than 30 times \u2014 and said it must come from community activists, not great powers or elites.Afterwards, when asked by a reporter why he appeared to have so little to say to middle class folk who work hard and pay taxes, the pope replied that it was \u201can error of mine not to think about this.\u201d He acknowledged that he was aware of \u201ccriticism from the United States,\u201d adding that \u201cevery criticism must be received, studied and dialogue must follow.\u201dBut don\u2019t expect that dialogue to be placatory when he meets with President Obama at the White House, addresses both Houses of Congress, and speaks to the United Nations General Assembly. A top adviser says that Francis\u2019 tone in America will be \u201cfriendly but frank.\u201d Though he is committed to what he calls \u201cthe culture of encounter,\u201d this first pope from the global South is unswerving in his commitment to \u201ca poor church for the poor.\u201dAs archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis saw half the population of Argentina plunged below the poverty line under an austerity program imposed at the behest of Washington economists to resolve a massive debt crisis. Like many Latin Americans, says one Vatican insider, the pope \u201ccombines both a sense of respect and a feeling of resentment at the economic and cultural dominance of [Argentina\u2019s] bigger neighbor.\u201dAmerica\u2019s political leaders should expect some discomforting talk when the pope addresses Congress. He will likely praise the founding ideals of the United States \u2014 but point out the ways in which its leaders fall short. He\u2019ll be equally blunt when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly in New York on issues ranging from climate change to poverty to war and refugees.Though it\u2019s hard to predict what the pope will say to American bishops, Francis often reserves his harshest words for the church elite, as he did when he lambasted top church bureaucrats last Christmas, listing 15 \u201cspiritual diseases\u201d from which they suffer, including self-importance, lust for power, and lack of empathy for others. Like their counterparts in Brazil last year, the bishops will at the very least be told to recruit priests who can warm people\u2019s hearts, empower lay people, especially women, and emphasize mercy and forgiveness rather than judgment and condemnation. But the pope who has previously criticized the church for being \u201cobsessed\u201d with abortion, gay marriage and contraception may upbraid American bishops for putting too much effort into fighting the culture wars and not enough into issues of social justice.It was notable that during his recent \u201cvirtual audience\u201d where he spoke with students in Chicago, homeless people in Los Angeles, and immigrants in McAllen, Texas, near the Mexican border, he called a nun out of the audience and showered her and her fellow nuns with unconditional praise for their work among the poor. Bishops who have in the past criticized American sisters \u2014 accusing them of \u201cserious doctrinal problems,\u201d radical feminism and spending more time working against poverty and social injustice than abortion and same sex marriage \u2014 will have winced at that.All this suggests that those in positions of authority in politics and the church should expect a robust challenge from the pope. They will be told they should be putting the interests of the poor and vulnerable above all else. But to those at the bottom Francis will offer a message of comfort, solidarity and hope.Asked recently if he had a message for Americans, the pope replied that he wanted \u201cto draw close to\u201d the people and their virtues, joys, sadness and problems. It was a message particularly for the poor and disenfranchised. The most memorable moments of his visit, I suspect, will not come from Francis meeting the great and the good but from his encounters with the young, the homeless and the mentally ill, with immigrants, prisoners and perhaps even victims of sex abuse. \u201cAll it takes is one good person to restore hope!\u201d the pope wrote in \u201cLaudato Si\u2019.\u201d Perhaps for the United States that one person will be Francis himself.Paul Vallely is the author of \u201cPope Francis: The Struggle for the Soul of Catholicism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fires in West Have Residents Gasping on the Soot Left Behind", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 The air in the San Joaquin Valley hangs thick with gray-brown dust, a result of the state\u2019s largest fire, which has burned through more than 160 square miles in the nearby hills.The fire has so far spared lives and homes. But it has exposed one of the obscured effects that four years of record drought has unleashed here: dangerous drops in air quality that exacerbate public health problems in this region and threaten to choke the quality of life. \u201cWith the fire, even with my inhaler, I\u2019m still wheezing,\u201d Antoinette Wyer, 48, an asthmatic who has lived her whole life here, said at a health clinic on Wednesday. She has kept her 3-year-old grandson inside this week, while a 4-year-old grandson has stayed home from school. In Fresno County, elementary schoolchildren have been kept inside during recess this week because of the soot in the air that blots out the sun, and the Clovis school district may cancel a football tournament this Saturday for the same reason. Public health officials are warning people with heart and lung problems to stay inside. And asthma clinics around Fresno are overflowing with new patients. Normally, particulate matter levels in the air spike in the winter but drop during the summer, said Seyed Sadredin, the executive director of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. But since the drought began, the volume of particles in the air has been spiking year-round, for a variety of reasons: Rain does not clear the air; dust from dry, fallow fields and from farmers digging wells kicks up more easily; and the longer wildfire season means more smoke in the air more often. The San Joaquin Valley lies at the center of the state, surrounded by mountain ranges on the east and the west, receiving little coastal air. The air and soot are effectively trapped in a geographic bowl for much of the summer, and the lack of wind and rain has made it impossible for things to clear out. Mr. Sadredin said that if the drought continued much longer, it would threaten much of the progress the region has made to lower air pollution levels. \u201cWe have the toughest air regulations in the nation, but we have no control over the geography and the climate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Valley is basically a bowl with a lid on top for most of the year.\u201dDr. Vipul Jain, a pulmonologist who runs a chronic lung disease program in Fresno, said the effect of the drought and fires was likely to get worse this week, with temperatures expected to soar to 106 degrees. He said that hospitals could have as many as double the number of patients for acute lung problems in the coming days and weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a worst-nightmare situation,\u201d said Dr. Jain, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cAnd the worst is still yet to come. We can see it, but anyone with a lung problem, they feel it, and there is no way to prevent an exacerbation of their problems. People have to go outside and work, and they will suffer.\u201dMany counties throughout the state and the San Joaquin Valley have successfully reduced the amount of ozone in the air. But levels of soot, or particle pollution known as PM-2.5, have started to increase after years of decline, according to state figures. Officials are blaming the drought. At local asthma clinics, doctors have had an explosion in business since the drought began. Dr. Malik N. Baz said his asthma and allergy practice had grown at least 20 percent each of the past three years, and he has opened five new clinics around the Valley in the past two years \u2014 all of them overflowing with patients. \u201cOur only limitation right now is that there aren\u2019t enough parking spots because there are so many people coming in,\u201d Dr. Baz said, adding that he could open more clinics if he could find more doctors willing to move here. \u201cRight now, pollution is so high, I even started coughing when I went to Starbucks to get coffee \u2014 and I don\u2019t have asthma.\u201dHow dry conditions, dead trees and a lengthy drought set the stage for one of the worst fire seasons on record.Increasingly this summer, even healthy adults have grown wary of spending time outside. On Wednesday, with soot from what has been called the Rough Fire still blowing into town, some traded morbid jokes, comparing living here to smoking and wondering how many years they were taking off their lives.\u201cIt started last week, with eyes burning, congestion, can\u2019t sleep at night,\u201d said Randall Cooper, 62, a retiree who moved here from the Bay Area 10 years ago. Those who could have tried to flee, often to the coast for the weekend. But this remains one of the few affordable places to live in California, which keeps many people here, even as the local economy continues to suffer under the drought\u2019s weight. Mr. Cooper said his nose had cleared up when he went to the Bay Area for his son\u2019s wedding, but grew clogged again as soon as he came back.\u201cI think about leaving, but from here to the Bay Area, every mile is $1,000 more in housing,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t raised here. There are a lot of people who have had to deal with this their whole lives.\u201d Air and health officials have traded red-coded warnings that indicate \u201cunhealthful\u201d air for purple, calling them \u201cvery unhealthful.\u201d But everyone has to go outside sometimes. Juliet Johnson, 52, has lived in the San Joaquin Valley for nearly four decades and has severe allergies and asthma. She went for a walk with her dog on Monday, despite the \u201ccampfire smell\u201d in the air, and woke up Tuesday with no voice.\u201cIt was so nice out, so I opened up all the windows in my house over the weekend,\u201d she said. Dr. Jain warned the situation was likely to grow worse. Medical studies have shown that asthma hospitalizations reach their peak in September, and the fire season will not be over by then. \u201cWhat we have now makes the good-air days bad and bad-air days worse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt jacks up the air to a whole \u2019nother level. What the fire and particles do is like sunburn in their lungs, putting the smoke right down in their lungs. We see a whole bunch of people get exacerbated and getting hospitalized, no matter what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Orders Federal Contractors to Provide Workers Paid Sick Leave", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAddressing a union audience gathered here for Labor Day, Mr. Obama said he was glad not to be on the ballot but then sounded like a candidate himself as he went after the Republicans who hope to succeed him in the White House. He mocked them individually and as a group for portraying themselves as champions of the middle class while opposing labor unions.\u201cYou can\u2019t just talk the talk,\u201d Mr. Obama said to cheers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to walk the walk. You can\u2019t talk middle class and then do things that hurt the middle class.\u201dHe also chastised abortion opponents in Congress for threatening to shut down the federal government in an effort to cut off taxpayer financing for Planned Parenthood, saying such a move could damage the economy at a time of global volatility.\u201cA shutdown would be completely irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt would be an unforced error, a fumble on the goal line.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s executive order on paid leave was his latest use of executive power to change the rules of the American workplace and was designed to appeal to his union base. A fight over trade this year ruptured the usual alliance between the Democratic president and the organized labor movement.The executive order will have no real effect until after Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. Because it must first go through a public comment period, it will apply only to new federal contracts starting in 2017. But the White House hopes it will set a standard that will prod lawmakers, private employers, and state and local governments to expand their leave policies.Speaking in shirt sleeves to more than 700 people at a Boston hotel, a relaxed Mr. Obama appeared almost gleeful as he went after the Republican presidential candidates as a group. He also singled out a few of them, including Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, by ridiculing recent statements they have made, although he did not mention their names.At a campaign stop later in the day at the Pink Cadillac Diner in Rochester, N.H., during a motorcycle tour of the first primary state, Mr. Walker defended his battle with unions and portrayed Mr. Obama as a tool of entrenched interests.\u201cIt\u2019s clear the president stands with the big-government union bosses,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cWe stand with the hard-working people.\u201d He said his actions were \u201cpro-taxpayer\u201d and \u201cpro-worker,\u201d adding: \u201cI think the president and his allies fear us more than anybody else in this race because they know we don\u2019t just talk about it; we get it done. We fight, we win, we actually get results.\u201dDuring his speech here, Mr. Obama made no mention of his support for new free trade agreements with Asia and Europe, which has deeply angered many of the union leaders and Democratic political leaders he was addressing. Among those on the dais was Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat with whom he quarreled bitterly in the spring over legislation authorizing him to negotiate trade pacts like one with 11 other Pacific Rim nations.Led by Ms. Warren and egged on by labor union leaders, most of Mr. Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats voted against him in Congress on the trade negotiation measure, which passed only with the active leadership of Republicans. As he sought to repair the rift on Monday, Mr. Obama emphasized his working-class message after the speech with a stop at Union Oyster House, where he ordered clam chowder to go. He also gave Ms. Warren a ride back to Washington on Air Force One.The paid leave order is the latest move by Mr. Obama to use his power over federal contracts to institute changes on a small slice of the labor market when he cannot persuade Congress to enact those measures for the whole country. Among other things, he has signed orders requiring contractors to pay higher minimum wages, banning retaliation against workers who discuss their compensation, providing employees more information about their pay and protecting gay and transgender workers from discrimination.Mr. Obama\u2019s assertive exercise of his authority over federal contactors has generated objections from business groups that argue he is going too far and from lawmakers who complain that he is circumventing the legislative process. Critics say he is piling expensive directives onto companies doing business with the federal government as a sop to his political base without accounting for additional costs.The National Federation of Independent Business, while acknowledging that Mr. Obama has the authority to place conditions on federal contractors, said his latest action was another burdensome government mandate on private firms.\u201cNo business in America would require its suppliers and contractors to increase costs that will naturally boomerang back in the form of higher prices,\u201d said Jack Mozloom, the federation\u2019s media director. He said any call by the president to follow suit would ignore the fact that most employers are small businesses that cannot afford the benefit.The president\u2019s order will guarantee both full- and part-time federal contract workers an hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, for a total of up to seven days a year. The workers could use the leave to care for themselves, a member of their family, a domestic partner or another loved one, or they could take the leave to recover from domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking.Officials said the order would affect about 300,000 workers who otherwise would not have paid sick leave and grant other workers more days than they would otherwise have. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the president\u2019s domestic policy adviser, said the rule should not cost taxpayers more because the benefits of a more efficient work force should outweigh any additional expenditures.Advertisement"}

He understands something about the Greek electorate.\u201dIn a news conference before beginning the formal steps to form a government, Mr. Tsipras said his re-election would give him the time he needed to deliver on his promises to distribute the pain of austerity measures more fairly, to root out corruption and special interests, and to get Greece back on its feet.After initially taking office as prime minister in January promising to end the austerity policies imposed on Greece by its international creditors, Mr. Tsipras agreed over the summer to a new bailout package. It allowed the country to avert default and the collapse of its banking system, but at the cost of imposing a new round of budget cuts, tax increases and regulatory changes that challenge many entrenched interests.\u201cNow we have the chance with steady steps in the next four years to stop our people from bleeding,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said.He will need to move quickly, however, to keep the country\u2019s creditors happy and aid flowing. In the next few months, Parliament will have to pass a mountain of legislation, in many cases measures that previous governments found too politically difficult to tackle, including higher taxes on farmers, further cuts to pensions and a stepped-up program to sell government assets.A comparison of the Greek and American bailouts and their economic impact.There is also the need to recapitalize the banks and oversee the unwinding of capital controls.And if Greece\u2019s financial troubles were not enough, thousands of migrants and refugees are landing here on their way to other parts of Europe.Greek voters gave Mr. Tsipras a solid victory, handing him 35.5 percent of the vote and 145 seats in the 300-member Parliament. He quickly announced that he would again form a partnership with the right-wing Independent Greeks party, which won 10 seats.Some experts, including Mr. Bastian, said they worried about the sustainability of Syriza\u2019s very slim majority. Past governments watched their majorities shrink over time as unpopular measures came up for votes. In the previous government, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s coalition with the Independent Greeks controlled 162 seats, though more than two dozen of those were rebellious Syriza members on the far left who broke with Mr. Tsipras over the new bailout package.\u201cThere are still a lot of factions in his party,\u201d Mr. Bastian said, \u201cand it will be hard to keep them all in line.\u201dPerhaps the biggest losers in the election were the breakaway Syriza leftists, who formed their own party, Popular Unity, and campaigned urging a return to the drachma rather than an acceptance of new austerity measures.The party got so few votes that it will not even get into Parliament, leaving the former speaker of Parliament, Zoi Konstantopoulou, who is one of the country\u2019s most ardent corruption fighters, on the sidelines.Mr. Tsipras did not make any official announcements about who would replace her. Nor did he name any others to ministerial posts. But it was widely reported in the Greek press that he was considering a new ministry to manage the bailout requirements, modeled on a system in place in Portugal.Because both Syriza and the main opposition party, New Democracy, supported enactment of the bailout package, the outcome of the election was taken in stride in European capitals, where many leaders had clashed with Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government earlier in the year. Some European leaders publicly congratulated him, though most also took the opportunity to urge him to stick to the terms of the bailout.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads the Eurogroup of finance ministers and had openly warred with Mr. Tsipras\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, posted his congratulations on Twitter Monday evening. He added that he was ready to \u201cwork closely with the Greek authorities and to continue accompanying Greece in its ambitious reform efforts.\u201dMartin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said on a French radio station that he could not understand Mr. Tsipras\u2019s decision to again form a government with the right-wing Independent Greeks.Although Syriza and the Independent Greeks have deep ideological differences, they stuck together on the biggest issue faced by the previous government, with the Independent Greeks voting for every bailout measure needed this summer even as members of Syriza turned against Mr. Tsipras.Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "17,000 Migrants Stranded in Croatia by Border Crackdown", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As key nations tighten their borders, thousands of migrants and asylum seekers hoping to enter Western Europe are now bottled up in the Balkans, placing precarious new burdens on a region of lingering sectarian divisions that is exceptionally ill prepared to handle the crisis that has been shunted to it.Along the roads of eastern Croatia on Friday, the migrants\u2019 detritus \u2014 abandoned blankets, torn clothing, empty cans of tuna \u2014 littered the highways. On the side of a road outside the border town of Tovarnik, Croatia, three young Iraqi men said they had been stranded for two excruciating days.\u201cIt was crowded, there was no food, no transport and nowhere to go,\u201d said one of them, Ibrahim Yusuf, 25, a construction worker from Baghdad. He said he was considering returning to Iraq and asked a reporter for directions back to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.Even while the surge of migrants was merely transiting the region, starting several weeks ago, it overwhelmed tiny Macedonia, which declared a state of emergency. Now, however, it has become clearer that the migrants face fast-rising barriers to passing through the Balkans en route to preferred destinations like Germany or Sweden.The shifting of the crisis to the Balkans has added a whole new dynamic to the crisis, threatening to reopen old wounds and distrust. The masses of migrants and refugees are struggling through the clutch of countries that once formed Yugoslavia, until the wars of the 1990s bloodily broke the former Communist state apart.As hundreds of refugees continued to stream into Croatia on Friday, the government announced that it would close its borders with Serbia. Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said his country was overwhelmed, and Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic had a message for the migrants: \u201cDon\u2019t come here anymore. This is not the road to Europe.\u201dThe remarks were revealing of the tensions the migrants are now sowing among nations with weak economies, uncertain futures in Europe, creaking welfare states and deep wounds from the past. Those factors are hobbling the region\u2019s ability to respond to a crisis that even richer nations in Europe have struggled to address.On the surface, the countries of the former Yugoslavia, whose bloody disintegration shocked the world, would seem naturally sympathetic to the plight of refugees, and indeed the outpouring of sympathy and aid in recent days has been notable.The exodus resulting from war and suffering in the former Yugoslavia presented Europe with what was then its biggest refugee crisis since World War II. By 1992, some 2.3 million people had fled, making the sight of refugees fleeing a daily and visceral occurrence.But after gaining independence, countries in the region have struggled to bounce back \u2014 the average gross monthly wage in Serbia is 518 euros, about $585, while unemployment hovers at about 18 percent, according to the government statistics office.Such realities have left the people of the Balkans the \u201chave-nots\u201d of Europe, and now reluctant to accommodate the thousands of refugees who have even less than them.\u201cWe have much empathy in the region for migrants but countries across the region are poor, their institutions are not yet developed, and most states can barely deal with the daily problems of government, nevermind a migration crisis,\u201d said Sead Numanovic, a former editor in chief of Avaz, a leading Bosnian newspaper. \u201cThese countries just don\u2019t have the capacity.\u201dIn the spring, the German government began a campaign to discourage the tens of thousands Kosovars from coming. Nearly 34,000 Kosovars applied for asylum between January and August.The response in the Balkans has also been complicated by the fact that several countries such as Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Bosnia, buffeted by economic hardship, corruption and weak institutions, have not yet been accepted into the European Union.In Bosnia, which is bracing for as many as 10,000 migrants, the country is so hobbled by strong residual nationalism among its disparate ethnic groups that it can barely govern itself.\u201cThe Balkans is an area that has not recovered fully from the wars in the 1990s and the countries of the region remain in limbo in terms of European integration,\u201d said Danilo Turk, former president of Slovenia and a former United Nations assistant secretary general for political affairs.Countries are also loath to be lectured about showing solidarity with refugees by the European Union, where Hungary, a member, has built a 109-mile razor wire fence to keep migrants out.President Tomislav Nikolic of Serbia on Friday railed at members of the bloc for their hypocrisy, selfishness and lack of leadership in the face of the migration crisis. He said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that Serbia respected European standards more than those who are members and who are now \u201calmost out of control \u2014 without receiving any criticism, advice, or order from Brussels.\u201dIn a region long plagued by bloody conflicts over land, it is hard enough to police borders where regional rivalries still remain. Slovenia, the first former Yugoslav nation to join the European Union in 2004, and Croatia, which joined in 2013, cannot agree where Croatia ends and Slovenia begins \u2014 a dispute that dates to Yugoslavia\u2019s collapse.Slovenia is part of the Schengen accord that allows freedom of movement among member states; Croatia is not. Macedonia and Greece have battled over who has claims to the name Macedonia.Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is struggling to maintain stability and neighborly relations with Serbia, which it views as its former oppressor. Montenegro has made some progress but the European Union has made it clear there might not be new members admitted in the next five years.\u201cAll of these issues make the status of this region somehow provisional in its relation to the E.U. and that is not in the interest of stability, but quite the opposite,\u201d Mr. Turk said.Even without all of those challenges, there is also a risk of an anti-Muslim backlash or resentment in a region that has known ethnic violence perpetrated against Muslims and where reconciliation has sometimes proved elusive. In Bosnia, for example, the Serbian republic that is part of the country has denied that the massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys during the war in 1995 constitutes genocide.Slovenia still lacks a mosque although there has been a Muslim minority there for decades.As refugees from Syria and other countries in the Middle East seem poised to approach Slovenia over the summer, Damir Crncec, a former director of Slovenia\u2019s Intelligence and Security Agency, warned of \u201ca grand strategy of a slow destruction of Christian-Jewish values and roots. A new, more sophisticated version of Turkish invasions.\u201dAgainst such a backdrop, the influx left Croatia scrambling to create more migrant processing centers, including using a military barracks in the town of Beli Manastir, which is near the borders with Hungary and Serbia. The barracks, intended to house 200, was flooded by 8,000, said the town\u2019s mayor, Ivan Dobos. They had arrived suddenly by bus and train, from the border towns of Tovarnik and Batina, he said.The roads leading to Beli Manastir were strewn with the remnants of the migrants\u2019 overnight stay. Beds provided by the Croatian military were propped against fences. In the town, migrants were lining up at banks, apparently looking to exchange money and possibly to pay their way to Slovenia.A Syrian man who gave his name as Anas, 38, said he hoped to reach the Netherlands, where he planned to send for his family in Damascus \u2014 his two young children and his wife, who was due to give birth in 10 days.He did not want to squander his money on a smuggler, he said, and was waiting for a bus to Zagreb, the Croatian capital.\u201cIf the Slovenian police want to catch me, it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Anas said, sounding resigned and weary. \u201cI have nothing to lose.\u201d He added that he had found the lack of hospitality puzzling, given that the migrants just wanted to pass through: \u201cHungary, Slovenia, Austria \u2014 they know we don\u2019t want to stay there.\u201dReporting was contributed by Joseph Orovic from Beli Manastir, Croatia; Matthew Brunwasser from Sid, Serbia; Kristina Bozic and Barbara Surk from Ljubljana, Slovenia; Palko Karasz from Budapest; Aleksandar Dimishkovski from Skopje, Macedonia; Boryana Dzhambazova from Edirne, Turkey; and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement"}

Also on Thursday, the central bank cut its previous growth forecasts for the eurozone economies because of the global turbulence.\u201cThe Governing Council wanted to emphasize its willingness to act, its readiness to act and its ability to act,\u201d Mr. Draghi said after a meeting of the council, the bank\u2019s policy board.For now, the central bank still needs to assess whether what is happening in the rest of the world is \u201cworsening our medium-term outlook or is just a transitory thing,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll decide whether to do more or not.\u201dStaff economists at the European Central Bank, in a report issued Thursday, scaled back their eurozone growth projections for this year and through 2017, citing lower demand from emerging markets \u2014 a clear reference to the repercussions of the economic slowdown in China.Growth in the 19 countries of the eurozone will be 1.4 percent this year, central bank economists said, compared with a forecast of 1.5 percent that they made in June. Inflation is now projected at 0.1 percent for the year, compared with an earlier forecast of 0.2 percent.Analysts had not expected such a robust indication of stronger stimulus, and some took it as a sign that the Governing Council had grown comfortable deploying measures that were extremely controversial only a few months ago. A long debate had preceded the central bank\u2019s decision in January to begin buying government bonds and other assets to pump money into the eurozone economy. Opponents on the council had argued that the government bond purchases violated a provision in the central bank\u2019s charter that prohibits it from financing governments.\u201cI don\u2019t think resistance within the E.C.B. council is a major argument\u201d against additional action, Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.European stocks, which had already been up for the day, were further buoyed by Mr. Draghi\u2019s remarks. The euro also fell against the dollar, which bolsters the eurozone economy because it makes European exports cheaper abroad.The only concrete change in monetary policy by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday was to raise self-imposed limits on how much it can buy of any single government\u2019s or private lender\u2019s bond issue. The change gives the central bank more leeway to increase the asset purchases that it began in March as a way of pumping money into the eurozone economy and forcing down interest rates.\u201cOnce again the E.C.B. has managed to provoke a desired market reaction (particularly a weakening of the euro) without any actual change in policy,\u201d Karen Ward, senior global economist at HSBC Bank, wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was prepared to adjust the \u201csize, composition and duration\u201d of that program if necessary. Many economists now expect it to act before the end of the year, by raising the volume of assets it buys or by extending the program beyond September 2016, or both.Mr. Draghi declined to comment on what effect Fed policy would have on the eurozone, except to say that if a rate increase is necessary to achieve \u201cthe objectives of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, this is a plus for the world.\u201dThough the central bank displayed a willingness to increase its stimulus measures, it remains reluctant to apply the stimulus to Greece.Mr. Draghi said it was too soon to make that move, however. As Greece reaches various milestones in its bailout program in the coming months, he said, the European Central Bank would assess whether to begin buying Greek bonds.Advertisement"}

Now Rio\u2019s mayor is planning to issue a decision on whether he will sign or veto one of the bills no later than Tuesday, with the mayor here expected to decide early next month.Uber\u2019s prospects are not looking good.\u201cOur path is signing it, unless there is some irregularity or unconstitutionality,\u201d Eduardo Paes, Rio\u2019s mayor, said this month.

Brazil\u2019s unemployment rate is 7.6 percent and rising, compared with 4.3 percent at the end of 2014.\u201cThe economy has only gotten worse,\u201d Mr. Moura said. \u201cThe promise of jobs could influence the mayor and some of my colleagues to change their minds.\u201d\u201cWe want to expand to every city in Brazil which has transport problems, which is pretty much every city here,\u201d said Guilherme Telles, Uber\u2019s general manager for Brazil. \u201cThe country has over 200 million people and a huge penetration of smartphones and credit cards.\u201dIt also has relatively few taxis.

In Rio, more than 20,000 people are on a list in case City Hall decides to issue more taxi licenses. The last issuance was in 2014, when the city issued 148.Both cities have a lively black market in taxi licenses, with asking prices often more than $50,000. The average annual salary in Brazil\u2019s major cities is less than $7,000.Taxi drivers said Uber would not create new jobs but would take their jobs through unfair competition because Uber drivers do not face the same taxes and regulations.Uber declined to say what it would do if it were banned, but in other countries it sometimes continued operating despite legal roadblocks and seizures of vehicles. Mr. Telles said the company\u2019s lawyers believed that any ban would violate Brazil\u2019s constitution.Mark Scott contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Stock Falls as Automaker Tries to Contain Fallout", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chief executive certainly knew what was coming days later: allegations that Volkswagen had cheated to pass emissions tests in the United States, touching off a scandal that has called his leadership into question and seriously damaged the automaker\u2019s reputation.Since the news broke on Friday, Volkswagen has scrambled to control the damage.Mr. Winterkorn issued an apology on Sunday, saying the company had \u201cbroken the trust of our customers and the public.\u201d Volkswagen said it would stop selling the remainder of its 2015 model Volkswagen and Audi diesels and not offer its 2016 diesel cars, which were just arriving in showrooms in the United States.These measures did not stop Volkswagen shares from plummeting more than 20 percent when trading opened in Europe on Monday. Analysts say that Mr. Winterkorn will have to answer tough questions \u2014 including when he and other top executives at Volkswagen, which is known for being a tightly controlled, autocratic organization, first learned of the deception.Questions like this will most likely be the focus of a meeting scheduled for Friday of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board, which Mr. Winterkorn reports to.The software used to manipulate emissions tests in the United States, and the extensive attempts by Volkswagen to deflect official scrutiny before admitting misconduct this month, suggest that the cheating was not just the work of a few rogue engineers.\u201cEither he knew, or he didn\u2019t know, which is even worse,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who is a longtime Volkswagen critic. \u201cAny politician in his situation would have to resign.\u201dGerman authorities said on Monday that they would conduct their own tests to make sure that Volkswagen diesels were complying with European laws.Volkswagen did not respond to a request for comment.Volkswagen \u2014 whose brands besides Audi include Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini \u2014 recently edged Toyota to become the world\u2019s top seller of automobiles. But it has struggled to build a following in the United States.It has made huge investments in the U.S. market in recent years, including building a major assembly plant in Tennessee. The company is also building a plant in Mexico to make Audi sport utility vehicles primarily for American consumers.Yet the company has not gained much traction. Its share of the U.S. market has been stuck at about 2 percent, and the new revelations will probably undercut its effort to lure American consumers, in part by promoting \u201cclean\u201d diesel engines that were supposed to be more fuel-efficient than gasoline engines, yet also peppy and environmentally responsible.\u201cThis is proactive deception,\u201d Mr. German said by phone. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame the low person on the totem pole for this.\u201dFitch Ratings said the E.P.A. action, and the prospect of billions of dollars in penalties, could affect Volkswagen\u2019s debt rating, even though the automaker has ample financial resources. The accusations \u201ccould seriously undermine the group\u2019s brand image, particularly in the U.S., where Volkswagen is already struggling to increase its market share,\u201d Fitch said in a statement Monday.Several United States law firms announced plans to sue on behalf of consumers who said Volkswagen deceived them into believing they were buying environmentally friendly vehicles. Volkswagen owners could also claim the resale values of their vehicles have been damaged by the affair.It is possible to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide \u2014 a gas that is a major contributor to smog and is linked to respiratory ailments including asthma, emphysema and bronchitis \u2014 emitted by diesel engines. But the technology used by Volkswagen also reduced fuel economy and performance.The software installed by Volkswagen on vehicles sold in the United States sidestepped this trade-off by giving a misleadingly low nitrogen-oxide reading during tests.The software measured factors like the position of the steering wheel, the vehicle\u2019s speed and even barometric pressure to sense when the car was being tested, the E.P.A. said. The car\u2019s engine then configured itself to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide.Volkswagen will be required to recall nearly half a million vehicles in the United States to fix the illegal software, the E.P.A. says.More than half of all vehicles sold in Europe are diesels. They are popular because they typically offer better fuel economy than gasoline. For years, the E.U. put a priority on fuel economy rather than emissions and set standards for the engines that were much more lax than in the United States.Pollution rules in Europe have been progressively tightened. The most recent standard, known as Euro 6, took effect on Sept. 1 for all new cars sold; United States standards are still considered more stringent.E.U. officials have recognized that laboratory testing of diesel-vehicle emissions is flawed. A new procedure that\u2019s intended to better replicate road conditions is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1.If there is any consolation for Volkswagen, it might be that diesel-powered cars account for only a tiny fraction of sales in its largest market, China.And while Volkswagen\u2019s reputation has probably been damaged, its most profitable vehicles in the United States are Porsche sports cars \u2014 none of which are affected by the E.P.A. action \u2014 and Audi cars, only one model of which is affected.The Volkswagen cars affected are Golf, Jetta, Beetle and Passat models from 2009 through 2015 that are equipped with two-liter diesel engines.The plunge in Volkswagen shares, which closed down more than 17 percent on Monday, was a clear indication that investors thought that its profit and sales could suffer because of the E.P.A. accusations.Stephan Weil, the prime minister of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen has its headquarters, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cManipulation of an emissions test is completely unacceptable and without any justification.\u201dBut Mr. Weil, who is also a member of the Volkswagen supervisory board, said consequences could be discussed only after a thorough investigation.An earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, the likely effects of repairs to affected vehicles. As the article noted elsewhere, the repairs are likely to increase fuel consumption, not reduce it.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

Some had traveled for as many as eight hours to get here, guarding slips of paper from doctors who had sent their patients across the country to the best specialty hospital Guatemala\u2019s public health system can offer.\u201cWe were a people that never complained,\u201d said Dr. Arnoldo L\u00f3pez, a pediatric surgeon at the hospital, as he described the doctors\u2019 battles to get the budgets they needed. \u201cThe patients think the attention they receive is normal.\u201dBut in a few stunning months, Guatemalans shook off that resignation.The real test now is whether that new boldness and optimism will result in a tangible difference in Guatemalans\u2019 lives. Will it give doctors at Roosevelt Hospital the resources to do the simple things they cannot do now \u2014 like sending a patient downstairs for an X-ray or giving out medicine?\u201cIt would be a good time to ask for a better budget,\u201d Dr. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThere should be greater social pressure to demand better health care.\u201dUnderlying the political upheaval is Guatemala\u2019s vast gulf between rich and poor, a legacy born of the Spanish conquest that has evolved into a thicket of favors and corruption among politicians, the military and the privileged business class.That system has drained public resources \u2014 Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina has been accused of being a ringleader in a plan to siphon off millions of dollars in customs revenue \u2014 and fostered powerful monopolies, from television to medicine distribution.The question, as citizens push for more changes, is how much the business and political elite will yield.\u201cWe want to create hope,\u201d said Andr\u00e9s Quezada, 23, one of the organizers of the first protest march in April. \u201cThe future is uncertain.\u201dGuatemala has the biggest economy in Central America, according to the World Bank, but a raft of statistics illustrates its stubborn inequalities. One is particularly shocking: Almost 50 percent of Guatemalan children suffer from chronic malnutrition, one of the highest rates in the world.\u201cYou can only explain that when you have a state that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Frank La Rue, a longtime human rights activist in Guatemala and a former United Nations official. \u201cYou have 60 percent of the population in poverty, and it affects an entire nation.\u201d\u201cFive or 6 percent of the population leads this country in every aspect,\u201d said Valerie Julliand, the representative for the United Nations Development Program in Guatemala, referring to the mostly white urban elite.

He was half-serious when he joked that Tigo\u2019s drive to switch Guatemalans to smartphones made the street movement possible, and he seemed to think that the new push toward greater accountability would continue.\u201cFrom now on, the political leaders and their teams will face permanent social scrutiny over their actions,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez said.Social media is \u201cthe new actor in the country\u2019s political life,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it, but in a certain way the populace is in debt to us.\u201dOver at the Foundation for the Development of Guatemala, or Fundesa, a research group affiliated with the business chamber Cacif that unites many of the old monopolies, the distaste for politicians is shared.\u201cGuatemala\u2019s biggest problem is corruption; there is no problem of resources,\u201d said Fundesa\u2019s executive director, Juan Carlos Zapata. \u201cWe believe that 30 percent of the budget is lost to corruption.\u201dMr. P\u00e9rez Molina was an ally of businesses, and the scheme in which he has been implicated involved taking bribes from importers in exchange for lowering their customs duties.But as the bribery scandal turned Guatemala\u2019s electoral politics upside down and other candidates were tarred by corruption allegations, business owners swung behind Mr. Morales, the television comedian. He started his campaign with the backing of right-wing military veterans of the country\u2019s long-running civil war.Mr. Morales rode his outsider status to win the first round and will face Sandra Torres, a leftist former first lady known for her social programs, in an Oct. 25 runoff.Reformers are eager to further the momentum for change. The interim president, Alejandro Maldonado, a conservative judge, has promised overhauls. Civic groups suggest that the place to start is the 2016 budget \u2014 particularly its spending on health.But the results seem far-off in the scuffed passages of Roosevelt Hospital, where people doze as they wait to see a specialist or wonder how they will pay for the medicine and X-ray the doctor might order.Juan Pu Us, a farmer from the northwestern state of Quich\u00e9, has borrowed more than $1,300 since his 18-year-old daughter, Mar\u00eda Elena, collapsed in December from a brain hemorrhage and he paid for an ambulance to drive her eight hours to the capital.The story ended happily. The doctors at the hospital operated on her, and she returned last week with her parents for a checkup. Maybe that was why Mr. Pu Us was feeling hopeful about the future after the past few months\u2019 turmoil \u2014 for both his family and the country.\u201cGod willing, Guatemala will improve,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to protest. The leaders have to sort themselves out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poised for Rate Increase, Investors Hope for Small Ripples ", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe moment that Wall Street has long been dreading could happen this week.History, however, shows that booms financed with cheap money often leave the financial system weaker, not stronger. And the fault lines start to become obvious only when the Fed starts to tighten monetary policy.This time around, most analysts aren\u2019t expecting 2008-style instability, unless, say, China\u2019s economic problems worsen sharply. The Obama administration\u2019s overhaul of Wall Street appears to have made the largest banks more resilient to the sort of stress that can follow an increase in interest rates.\u201cI believe that Wall Street is better prepared for a market event than it was in 2008, partially as a result of regulation but, more importantly, as a result of experience,\u201d said Arthur Levitt Jr., a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A liftoff in rates may not happen this week. After a violent downturn in global stock markets last month, prompted by concerns about China, traders are now betting that the big day is more likely to happen at the Fed\u2019s December meeting.But an increase in rates, whenever it comes, could still roil markets, make it harder for many firms to raise money and expose new frailties in the system that postcrisis regulations have not properly addressedIn theory, a small increase in interest rates \u2014 the Fed is expected to raise them by only a quarter of a percentage point this year \u2014 should not be enough to wreak havoc. If the real economy is reasonably healthy and corporate earnings continue to grow steadily, which seems possible, then stock and bond prices should not be vulnerable.Still, some analysts have a darker view of the links between the Fed\u2019s $3.5 trillion stimulus, Wall Street and the wider economy. They say that financial markets have played a central role in funneling trillions of dollars into investments that will prove unsustainable when interest rates go up.\u201cThe Fed is supposed to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going,\u201d said Albert Edwards, a strategist with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, in an email exchange. \u201cIt is already well past midnight, but the guests will keep partying until they drop if you ply them with even more alcohol.\u201dAnd signs of excess abound.Technology companies have been able to raise large sums even before they tap the public markets. This is a sign that investors are so hungry for a stake in the latest boom in Silicon Valley that they are willing to tolerate long waits before they can sell out and are willing to forgo more detailed financial statements.The debt markets have long appeared overly eager to lend. Around the world, companies with a credit rating that is B or lower \u2014 the less creditworthy of the junk bond issuers \u2014 have sold debt worth $1.24 trillion since the start of 2009, when the Fed\u2019s stimulus began in earnest, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That sum is nearly three times the total for the 10 years before 2009.At the same time, low interest rates have made investors more willing to buy stocks at historically high valuations. The low rates have also made it cheaper for companies to borrow money they can use to buy back their own shares. Repurchases of stock can bolster a company\u2019s earnings per share \u2014 an important measure of a corporation\u2019s profitability \u2014 because they reduce the number of shares outstanding.But stock buybacks do not improve the underlying performance of companies. Since 2012, quarterly earnings per share at companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index have on average grown by 6.7 percent a year. A fifth of that growth rate has come from buybacks, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank.Because these sorts of financial activities have been going on for so long, the doomsayers say they are vulnerable to a slight increase in interest rates. Companies may find it much harder to raise money, leading them to curtail buybacks and, much more important, shelve investments.Such a reversal is already causing stress in large developing countries like China and Brazil. Fears that weakness in emerging markets might end up damping growth in developed economies were behind the steep sell-off in stock markets in August.But many of the gloomier analysts have been predicting a great reckoning for years \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t happened. The excesses in the system, for instance, may not be as widespread as in past booms. The new restraints on Wall Street and the housing market have so far prevented a resurgence of the toxic real estate lending that occurred when interest rates were low a decade ago.It is also not clear that the Fed\u2019s easy money policies have been that easy. After accounting for inflation, corporations are not borrowing more cheaply than they did in the past. Since the end of 2008, the average, inflation-adjusted yield on corporate bonds of moderate credit risk has been 4.1 percent, compared with 3.94 percent for most of the postwar period.At the same time, the Fed\u2019s policies appear to have prompted a surge in a type of lending that might prove more stable than the securities markets under higher interest rates. In the last five years, banks of all sizes, often operating far away from Wall Street, have increased loans to corporations by over $700 billion, or 61 percent.In any case, a rise in interest rates may not prompt companies to slash the size of their stock buyback programs. An analysis by Deutsche Bank suggests that companies\u2019 cash holdings and cash flows generated by their operations could cover their buybacks. The analysis also shows that companies\u2019 debt loads, when measured against their market value, are at historical lows.And if buybacks do become less attractive to corporations, there could be a silver lining. It might prompt executives to instead invest spare capital in their operations as they seek higher productivity.\u201cIt would mark a shift toward the old-fashioned growth model,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm.The performance of exchange-traded funds in the recent sell-offs may be a foretaste of what might happen. For a short period on Aug. 24, shares in some funds fell to prices that were well below the value that they would have commanded had they stayed in line with the worth of the fund\u2019s underlying holdings. An investor selling at that discount might take an unnecessary loss.\u201cThe implication of E.T.F.s and their disconnect from their underlying securities is very worrying,\u201d Mr. Levitt, the former regulator, said. \u201cThat has a tendency to create great uncertainty in the markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An official in a bright yellow jacket turned away migrants seeking to enter Hungary.\u201cEurope has not done enough,\u201d the aunt, Tima Kurdi, a resident of Canada, said during a visit on Monday to Brussels for talks with officials. \u201cGermany took the biggest number, and now it has too many. Every country has to take responsibility. Aylan\u2019s death was, I believe, a message from God to the world to wake up and do something about these refugees. Everybody is closing the door in their face.\u201dAll the same, ministers from several East and Central European countries remained steadfast in their opposition to the compulsory distribution of migrants proposed last week by Mr. Juncker.\u201cThis proposal is not solving the problem,\u201d said Robert Kalinak, the Slovak interior minister. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and the Baltic States have all voiced deep reservations about taking in refugees, arguing that they have no tradition of offering refuge to people of different cultures; that their economies cannot sustain the influx; and that most of the migrants want to live in richer and more welcoming places like Germany and Scandinavia.In a dig at former Communist countries in the East that have said they will take only Christian refugees, Mr. Asselborn, the Luxembourg minister who ran Monday\u2019s meeting, said that even his own country, the European Union\u2019s smallest, \u201ccould take in a few hundred people who are not necessarily Christians, who have a different skin color, and that should be able to work in big countries like Poland or the Czech Republic or in Slovakia.\u201dIn an effort to win over opponents of the plan, Germany, France and other nations embraced some of the Eastern Europeans\u2019 tough language, calling for tighter controls of Europe\u2019s external borders and firmer measures against migrants who fail to qualify as refugees, including their swift return to countries deemed safe.The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, stressed that economic migrants needed to be separated from genuine refugees fleeing war or oppression. \u201cThere cannot be humanity without firmness and responsibility,\u201d he told reporters.Ministers endorsed plans to increase cooperation against smuggling and border violations with Turkey, which has become one of the major transit countries for migrants making their way to Europe.In a speech on Wednesday to the European Parliament, Mr. Juncker presented the migrant crisis as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to take common action and asked that interior ministers move swiftly to endorse his relocation plan at their Monday meeting. Voicing doubts that a voluntary program would work, he said, \u201cThis has to be done in a compulsory way.\u201dThe European Commission did not include the remark in an official transcript of the speech, in what could be a sign of the strength of opposition to this initiative.Luis Morago, campaign director for Avaaz, a refugee advocacy group, said that Europe\u2019s reluctance to adopt mandatory quotas did not necessarily emasculate the relocation effort, but that \u201cin practice the only way of getting many European governments to do anything is if it is compulsory.\u201d Europe\u2019s halting response to the migrant crisis, he said, had so far been \u201cdisappointing and contradictory.\u201dElizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe, a research group in Brussels, said Europe\u2019s difficulties in finding a common approach reflected the flaws in a shaky European system whose rules and institutions were \u201conly half built\u201d and whose ultimate goal \u2014 a fully integrated European state or simply a collaborative jumble of distinct nation states \u2014 \u201chas never been decided.\u201dOn migration, she added, \u201cthere is simply no consensus.\u201d\u201cSome countries accept the idea that Europe is a place for asylum seekers,\u201d she added, \u201cbut others don\u2019t think this is their responsibility.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s mixed signals have exasperated nations that share a border with the bloc and that have become transit routes for ever growing numbers of Syrians, Afghans and others seeking entry into Europe.The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.While Berlin said the controls along the German-Austrian border were only a temporary emergency measure, the restrictions, a response to the strain on local communities, signaled that Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming stance toward the migrants was encountering domestic resistance.\u201cThere is no order, there is no system, and in a country governed by the rule of law, that is a cause for concern,\u201d Horst Seehofer, the governor of Bavaria, a deeply conservative state in the south, said Sunday.Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian interior minister, told a local television station, \u201cWe need better controls in general because we have determined that in recent days many of those on the move are really not refugees.\u201dOfficials in Eastern and Central Europe, including Hungary, have made similar arguments as they battled to scuttle Mr. Juncker\u2019s plans for the swift distribution of 160,000 migrants.\u201cA mandatory quota for the E.U.-wide relocation of migrants is unlikely to be achieved quickly, if at all,\u201d said Carsten Nickel, a senior vice president at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy.Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Union commissioner for migration, insisted that action to relocate migrants was still possible.\u201cThe majority of member states are ready to move forward \u2014 but not all,\u201d Mr. Avramopoulos told a news conference. \u201cThe world is watching us.

{"Headline": "Silent on Priorities, Yellen Makes Fed Choice a Cliffhanger", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiberal activists, economists and some policy makers are pressing hard for Ms. Yellen to continue the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign of near-zero rates because the economic recovery remains far from complete, leaving most Americans still struggling to pay their bills on stagnant incomes.At the same time, Ms. Yellen faces growing internal pressure to start raising rates from Fed officials who are concerned about froth in financial markets and about maintaining control of inflation.Analysts say the decision will further sharpen Ms. Yellen\u2019s priorities as perhaps the most powerful economic official in the world.\u201cThey are paying a lot more attention to the labor market than in the past,\u201d said William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cI know it\u2019s in the Fed\u2019s thinking. I know it concerns them. I just hope that it\u2019s deep enough a part of their equation that they wait to see real progress happen.\u201dFor much of the summer, the Fed seemed on track to announce after this meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that it would raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis. The last time the Fed raised rates was more than nine years ago, and it has kept rates near zero since the end of 2008.Then China swooned and markets skittered downward, and Fed officials started wondering aloud whether it might make sense to wait at least a few more weeks, if not longer.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.That has turned the outcome of the September meeting into something of a cliffhanger.\u201cThe F.O.M.C.\u2019s near-term strategy has become so opaque that even the most seasoned analysts can only guess what policy decisions may be forthcoming at its upcoming meetings,\u201d wrote Andrew Levin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College who worked at the Fed as an adviser to Ms. Yellen.She will speak for the first time since July at a news conference Thursday afternoon, at the conclusion of the Fed\u2019s two-day meeting, which convened on Wednesday.Those calling for the Fed to extend its campaign argue there is still room for more progress on jobs, which could help lead to higher wages as well.Liberal activists plan to rally outside the office building where Ms. Yellen will speak on Thursday. Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, will address the gathering.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Mr. Spriggs, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. economist, said keeping rates low is particularly important for minorities, because a tight labor market makes discrimination more expensive. The unemployment rate for blacks with college degrees is higher than for whites with high school degrees.\u201cI think the data are rather clear that it takes a while for employers to expand outside their natural networks and reach black workers and bring their unemployment rates down,\u201d Mr. Spriggs said. \u201cIf we stay the course, we will get to a point at which firms are willing to do more to find workers.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m living in poverty even though I have a full-time job,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hope the people at the Fed, I hope they realize people at the bottom of the totem pole are barely making it.\u201dWage growth also remains slow. Mr. Spriggs said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had surveyed member unions about recent contracts and found little progress in winning wage increases. He said workers were generally expected to get nothing more than 1 percent increases over the next three to four years.Ms. Yellen, in 2014, her first year as chairwoman, similarly highlighted low wages as evidence employers were finding workers so easily they had no need to compete on pay. But recently, she and other officials said that may be the result of slow productivity growth.The Fed\u2019s vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, who has spoken several times during Ms. Yellen\u2019s quiet period, suggested in late August that labor markets were strong enough for liftoff.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote last week, \u201cThere should be little doubt that the Fed has achieved, or is very close to achieving, its employment objective.\u201d He said the Fed would be wise to raise rates in September, rather than waiting until later in the year, because \u201cadding up trivial delays can put policy nontrivially behind the curve.\u201dThe policy committee still has meetings scheduled in October and December.Yet there is reason to think the Fed will wait a little longer. Notably, Fed officials have emphasized that they do not want the first rate increase to surprise investors \u2014 and measures of market expectations suggest that many investors would be caught off guard if the Fed raised rates on Thursday.Moreover, the Fed has a good reason to wait: Inflation remains sluggish, just 0.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and a global slowdown may suppress any short-term rebound.\u201cIf they move in September, it would tell us that they are not weighting the global developments very strongly, they are not weighting the inflation disappointments very strongly,\u201d Julia Coronado, chief economist at Graham Capital Management, said recently at the Brookings Institution.The Fed has maintained a united front in recent months. Ms. Yellen has won unanimous votes to continue the stimulus campaign at each of the committee\u2019s five meetings so far this year. But as liftoff approaches, there are growing signs of fragmentation over the precise timing.If Ms. Yellen does persuade the committee to announce another delay on Thursday, the vote is unlikely to be unanimous. At least one member, Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has indicated that he expects to vote in dissent if the committee does not raise rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carbon Cuts So Sharp Even California Democrats Are Divided", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legislation faces an onslaught by the Western States Petroleum Association and other oil industry advocates that, in ads and mailings, assert that a 50 percent cut in petroleum use could result in gas rationing and a ban on minivans.A defeat would be a setback for Mr. Brown, who has made a battle against global warming a centerpiece of his final years in public life, and for environmentalists who have looked to California to lead the emissions fight at a time of strong skepticism about global warming in Washington. Mr. Obama urged California lawmakers to enact the bill in a recent speech in Las Vegas, signaling the importance he is attaching to the issue in his final years in office.\u201cThe rest of the world is watching very closely what is happening in California, and I think so far they see a success story,\u201d Mr. de Le\u00f3n said. \u201cOur economy has grown \u2014 we are adding jobs, and we are reducing our carbon emissions. Therefore it is absolutely crucial that this measure passes, because it will be a big blow to the rest of the states and the whole world if it doesn\u2019t.\u201dCalifornia has mandated an 80 percent cut in emissions by 2050, using 1990 emissions levels as a baseline. The goal has been championed by Democrats like Mr. Brown and Republicans like former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. This bill on petroleum, one of several the Legislature is voting on to put these limits in place, is intended to ensure that California meets its target.\u201cI can\u2019t figure out any other way to reach a 50 percent reduction in that frame without doing some pretty dramatic measures,\u201d said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t gas rationing, what is it? I keep hearing what it isn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Brown said in an interview in his office here that the oil industry was using fear tactics to try to derail the effort before the Legislature adjourns on Friday, but that he was confident of eventual success.\u201cYou\u2019ve got the oil companies fighting Pope Francis,\u201d he said. \u201cFighting the scientists of the world.

There is no rationing in the bill. Read it. None.\u201dThe concerns have come not only from Republicans, but also from moderate Democrats who represent communities in central California. Many of these communities are struggling with high unemployment and slow economic growth.\u201cSo much of our economy is driven by the use of petroleum,\u201d said Assemblyman Henry T. Perea, a Democrat from the Central Valley and a leader of moderates in his house. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what impacts S.B. 350 will have on it. We don\u2019t know because we don\u2019t know what the plan is. What does that look like? We haven\u2019t heard that answer to that. And in the absence of information, you create your own.\u201dKristin Olsen, the Assembly Republican leader, said her party was eager to find ways to curb harmful emissions. \u201cMy son has asthma \u2014 of course I want clean air,\u201d she said.But she questioned why California had to be a leader in an effort that she argued had such significant economic costs.\u201cWe want to be leaders,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not when there are no followers. And at some point we have to look at the fact that no one is following California\u2019s lead. We are less than 1 percent of the world. At some point we should work on reasonable, cost-effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to improve our air quality. But not at the cost of jobs.\u201dMs. Boyd of the petroleum association said the bill\u2019s sponsors had erred in trying to push the measure through without explaining how it might work. \u201cWe think there should be a lot more detail,\u201d she said, \u201cand it should be articulated pretty clearly about how one thinks they are going to be about this super-aggressive mandate.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice \u2014 we have to make these changes,\u201d said Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager and environmental advocate who has been championing the bill. \u201cIn listening to these people talk about how there is going to be rationing, I\u2019m like, \u2018Stop making up stories, and start telling us what will happen under your scenario.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cWe are in the process of changing how we use energy in the United States of America,\u201d Mr. Steyer added. \u201cThe way this happens is, the private sector comes up with new ideas, and people either like them or not.\u201dMr. de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the State Senate Democrats, said he was preparing amendments to his bill to try to ease concerns.

{"Headline": "How to Save the Thai Economy", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBANGKOK \u2014 The return of autocracy to Thailand is putting a hole in the people\u2019s pockets. Sixteen months after the coup that brought down the democratically elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra, incomes in rural areas, where more than 34 million Thais live, have collapsed. Exports fell by 4.9 percent during the first half of 2015, according to the Thai government.Some reasons for this decline are structural. Thailand\u2019s export-dependent, open economy has been roiled by the rise of the Chinese economy and then by its deceleration. After China became a formidable competitor in low-tech industries and electronics, the falling yuan further undermined the competitiveness of Thai exports in the Chinese market.But the junta led by Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha has also compounded these difficulties. When it should have been encouraging domestic spending, it suspended the massive agricultural subsidies put in place by the Yingluck government. It has announced that it will speed up spending on some 17 so-called mega-road and -railway projects worth $47 billion. But an infrastructure-centered stimulus will not have an impact on domestic demand for years.The generals\u2019 economic policy is hampered by concern for their core constituents, the Bangkok-based establishment: a patronage network among the bureaucracy, the judiciary, the army, business elites and the palace. That network has created staggering inequality: Just 0.1 percent of Thais hold nearly half of the country\u2019s total wealth, according to a 2012 study by the National Economics and Social Development Board, the state economic planning agency.Real G.D.P. growth slowed to 2.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2015, down from 3.0 percent in the first quarter \u2014 and that includes the effects of a surge in tourism; discounting that, G.D.P. actually shrank. (The recent bombing of the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok will dampen foreign visits for a time.) Imports in capital goods have been falling for years, despite the state\u2019s ever more generous incentives for foreign investors.Thais are pouring idle cash into luxury condominiums and high-end shopping malls. Some $1.5 billion have been earmarked for the construction near Bangkok\u2019s historic center of IconSiam, a shopping mall with retail space the size of 75 soccer fields. Touted as a symbol of \u201ceternal prosperity,\u201d this grand palace of commerce is also a monument to the junta\u2019s misguided economic vision: the promise of consumption with too few consumers who have the income to fulfill it.Gen. Prayuth seems finally to have realized these mistakes, and that the economy is his government\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. He sacked his economic team last month, replacing its head, Pridiyathorn Devakula, a former central bank governor from the conservative policy establishment, with Somkid Jatusripitak, the architect of many progressive social and economic policies when he was finance minister under Thaksin Shinawatra, the populist former prime minister and brother of Ms. Yingluck. Gen. Prayuth\u2019s government also recently set up a national savings fund long in the making, which aims to help up to 30 million Thais without pensions.These are welcome moves, and signs that the junta is breaking away from a style of economic management that until now one might charitably have called controlled inertia. But this is not enough. The only way to jolt Thailand out of its economic stagnation is to implement two measures that are sure to upset the Bangkok-based traditional elites: dramatically raise rural incomes (to spur domestic consumption) and aggressively devalue the baht (to boost exports).The Thai state spent more than 72 percent of public funds in greater Bangkok, where only 17 percent of Thais lived, according to 2012 figures from the World Bank, the most recent data available. Mr. Somkid has already announced a $4 billion stimulus package for the rural economy, such as interest-free loans through the state-directed microfinance scheme. But these are essentially unconditional, short-term handouts that will at best cause a small and brief burst in consumption.To stimulate sustainable domestic spending, especially among the poor, the Thai government should increase public expenditures in the provinces to at least one half of the total by 2025, up from nearly 28 percent in 2012. Support should be determined based on the recipients\u2019 income rather than their localities or the crops they cultivate, as has traditionally been the case.The transfers should also be made conditional on the beneficiaries\u2019 compliance with, for example, vaccination requirements and the enrollment of children in school. Promoting socially responsible behavior in exchange for funds would not only serve the public good; it would also go some way toward appeasing the Bangkok elites who resent redistribution policies as a form of state charity.Devaluing the baht \u2014 by, say, 20 percent \u2014 also is necessary, to stimulate exports of goods such as rice, rubber, electronics and cars. The standard risks of devaluation would be minimal: Thailand has a tiny stock of foreign-denominated debt, and prices for consumer goods are falling. Yet the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, has been reluctant to significantly weaken the baht. The power elites, facing a sluggish economy at home, have been investing overseas, incurring liabilities in foreign currency; they want to buy their dollars for cheap.The Bangkok-based establishment also fears the political implications of a devaluation. When the baht collapsed in 1997, many fortunes were wiped out. Then the whole economy collapsed, discrediting the traditional elites\u2019 stewardship. That in turn led to the adoption of a liberal constitution that restrained their political power and paved the way for the rise of Mr. Thaksin, whose progressive policies weakened their grip even more.The junta, if it wants to stay in power, must embrace tough measures that run against the vested interests of its core constituents. It has no other choice, and neither do they \u2014 at least not if they hope to maintain the system of soft economic dictatorship that has served them so well.Tom Felix Joehnk is a Bangkok-based journalist.

He retired in April last year, after he was laid off.Before starting with TaskRabbit, Mr. Daub passed a background check and a training course. This summer, he began assembling Ikea furniture, a skill he learned as a homeowner. His published rate is $49 an hour, which includes a client services fee paid to the company. During July and August, working five or six hours a week, he estimated he earned about $2,000. \u201cI\u2019m making good money and making my own hours,\u201d he said.As the stock market seesaws and many retirees struggle to supplement inadequate savings and investments, more older Americans are turning to a variety of methods to earn extra money, keep in touch socially and find ways to enjoy experiences that might not be affordable otherwise.A report released by PricewaterhouseCoopers in April estimated that 7 percent of Americans consider themselves providers in the so-called sharing economy. Of those over age 55, 25 percent do.A separate PricewaterhouseCoopers report estimated that the sharing economy, which totaled about $15 billion in 2014, could grow to $335 billion by 2025.\u201cTo participate in the sharing economy, one must have something to share,\u201d Linda Barrington, executive director of the Institute for Compensation Studies in the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University, wrote in an email. \u201cThe assets that older people accumulated and used intensively when first purchased (a large home because they had children) come to have excess capacity over time (the children move out and the car is not needed for so many errands).\u201dHe ruled out positions like Walmart greeter and supermarket packer, which involves bagging and loading groceries. \u201cIt\u2019s tough work,\u201d he said. He considered representing roofing and painting contractors to help them pitch their services to condominium managers.Instead he decided to rent his 2005 Mustang convertible through RelayRides, a peer-to-peer car rental service based in San Francisco. (The only state it is not available in is New York, where it stopped operating. State authorities said it was in violation of insurance laws.)He charges $39 a day, which includes 200 free miles, and ferries those who rent his car to local airports, charging an additional $25 to $35 depending on distance. \u201cI do enjoy driving back and forth to the airport and we part on friendly terms,\u201d he said.In the last year and a half, he said, he has rented out the car more than 50 times. At the airport, a convertible rental can run three times the price or more. An older Mercury Marquis that he owns for his everyday use is also available. In 2014, he estimates the car rentals netted about $6,000. This year, he is up $4,100. RelayRides takes 25 percent of the service provider\u2019s revenue.There\u2019s also savings on vacation. In early September, he and his wife flew to Las Vegas for a tour of Utah\u2019s national parks. Credits on his account allowed him to rent a 2009 Chrysler Sebring four-door sedan from a RelayRides provider at a modest price.Mr. Blunier says running a car rental service has its drawbacks. \u201cRelayRides does tie me down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the car is out, I can\u2019t leave.\u201dBy his choice, the service keeps him from spending more time at a vacation home in Murphy, N.C., that he bought in 2008. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be using it a lot more, \u201c he said. He rents that out, too, and estimates he has earned about $2,000 this year.Lisa D\u2019Ambrosio, a research scientist at the M.I.T.

And while she followed DogVacay\u2019s guidelines, which require contacting owners daily, at times she exceeded that. One couple touring Machu Picchu returned to their hotel to see photos of their pet.\u201cIt\u2019s a great comfort\u201d to the owners, she said. She and several pet owners became friends on Facebook.She estimated that she earned $12,000 from November 2012 to August 2015. The pet sitting ended last week. She and her husband are relocating to Florida, and Ms. Williams expects to take a year off from running the business.Despite the advantages that many participants see, experts say providers face a number of risks. \u201cThis work is not part of the formal employment sector where labor laws protect workers,\u201d Ms. Barrington of Cornell University noted.Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington, goes further. \u201cThere\u2019s unfairness in the competitive business model,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Daub, who also plans to start an information technology consulting practice, said the opportunity had worked out better than he expected.\u201cAt this point in my life,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a perfect job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Panel Seeks More Details About Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt and Long-Term Needs", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Puerto Rican officials seeking a way out of more than $72 billion of debt were told by a Senate panel on Tuesday that the numbers they were using to make their case were too sketchy to persuade lawmakers that help was warranted \u2014 or that the money would be well spent.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that while he sympathized with the island\u2019s plight, Congress needed to know more detail about the causes and structure of its debt, and whether help from Washington would benefit it in the long run.\u201cWe\u2019d better get the right information, or nothing\u2019s going to be done,\u201d Senator Hatch warned.The Puerto Ricans who appeared included the head of the powerful Government Development Bank, which oversees the island\u2019s borrowing and cash needs. They came before the Senate panel to argue for changes in various federal laws, which they said currently discriminate against Puerto Rico. It was the first such appearance before Congress since Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla laid out a five-year plan earlier this month for a debt moratorium and structural reforms of the island\u2019s economy.Puerto Rico has large debt payments due in November and December, and has warned it will not have enough cash to pay them while still providing an acceptable level of government services. None of the officials asked for a bailout, but they said the United States had a moral duty to help Puerto Rico, and identified a number of federal laws and programs that they said were discriminatory and ought to be changed.\u201cI want to help you,\u201d Mr. Hatch told them. \u201cI don\u2019t think Puerto Rico is treated fairly. But we have to get really good information in order to help you.\u201dMelba Acosta Febo, the head of the Government Development Bank, told Senator Hatch that the lack of financial data reflected Puerto Rico\u2019s antiquated computer systems, which the government wanted to replace. She promised to gather as much information for the senators as possible.UBS Puerto Rico was also the underwriter of the bonds, having been hired to bring them to market in 2008 in a gambit to raise money for the pension system. After struggling to sell them on the open markets in 2008, UBS packaged them in its mutual funds, which it marketed on the island as a good source of retirement income. Such a transaction would be prohibited on the United States mainland, but the federal law that governs mutual funds has an exception for mutual funds in Puerto Rico.In settling the charges, UBS did not admit any wrongdoing. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have resolved these matters,\u201d a bank spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe remain dedicated to serving our customers during this difficult economic time for the commonwealth.\u201dAs part of its settlement with the S.E.C., UBS has agreed to pay $15 million into a fund for harmed investors. Finra required UBS to pay a $7.5 million fine and $11 million in restitution to investors.Ms. Acosta said she believed that amending the relevant laws would be worth an additional $1.5 billion for Puerto Rico.Sergio M. Marxuach, policy director for the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research institute in San Juan, said that the most powerful way Washington could reduce poverty and promote growth in Puerto Rico was to extend a version of the federal earned-income tax credit program to the island. The credit is for low- and moderate-income working individuals and couples \u2014 particularly those with children.He said this could be done even though residents of Puerto Rico do not now pay federal income tax \u2014 but he also said that at some point Puerto Rico\u2019s legal status as a territory would have to be changed.Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress, expressed the same idea. \u201cWe should treat Puerto Rico equally,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are fellow American citizens. You shouldn\u2019t be looking the other way. You shouldn\u2019t be ignoring us. If you do so, you do so at your peril.\u201dThe only witness who was not from Puerto Rico, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said he was skeptical that giving Puerto Rico more federal health care money would bring about the structural economic changes the island needed.\u201cYou don\u2019t generate long-term economic growth by increasing health care spending in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office, and now president of the American Action Forum. \u201cYou might relieve some budget pressure, but so would a check for anything else.\u201d\u201cThe primary emphasis should be on economic growth,\u201d rather than simply finding new sources of money, he said.Senator Hatch also asked the witnesses about other types of debt that Puerto Rico owes, such as its pension obligations to retired government workers. He wanted to know which had priority in the hierarchy of creditors \u2014 Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation bondholders, or Puerto Rico\u2019s pensioners.Ms. Acosta said general obligation bonds had an explicit constitutional guarantee and pensions did not.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big problem,\u201d she added. The pension system will probably run out of cash in 2018, she said, and at that point Puerto Rico would have to pay retirees directly from its general fund, straining the government\u2019s budget to the breaking point.\u201cThis is one of the reasons that we\u2019re saying that we have to restructure the debt,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is to use some of that money to put into the pension plans, because they badly need it.\u201dMary Williams Walsh reported from Washington and Michael Corkery from New York.

They don\u2019t export, but we do. And if we aren\u2019t exporting, they aren\u2019t selling to us.\u201d He added, \u201cI find it staggering that we would put highly paid export-oriented jobs at risk.\u201dWhat Oberhelman finds \u201cstaggering,\u201d Immelt finds \u201chard to believe\u201d and McNerney finds ironic is the refusal of Republican extremists \u2014 led by the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s chairman, Jeb Hensarling \u2014 to allow a vote on the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a vote that would pass in a landslide. The Ex-Im Bank, which insures and sometimes finances export sales, had to stop making deals at the end of June, when its reauthorization deadline came and went.As a result, McNerney told me, \u201clayoffs in the hundreds\u201d have taken place in Boeing\u2019s satellite division.When I spoke to Immelt, McNerney and Oberhelman, whose company also uses the agency, they all sounded astonished that this important tool, which they need to compete with companies abroad, was being taken away for purely ideological reasons.\u201cIf no other country had export financing, that would be one thing,\u201d said Immelt. \u201cBut that\u2019s not where the world is. What you are really doing is helping Siemens and China Rail\u201d \u2014 companies that rely heavily on their countries\u2019 export financing.Immelt told me that G.E. currently has $11 billion in potential deals that require export credit agency financing. That\u2019s real money, even for General Electric.McNerney pointed out that many big deals require export financing for the bid to even be considered. He also noted, ominously, that 10 to 15 percent of Boeing\u2019s aircraft exports are dependent on Ex-Im support. Losing that business would be devastating for the company, and its employees.When asked about the accusation from the right that the Ex-Im Bank is a classic case of government picking winners and losers, Oberhelman said that \u201cif this doesn\u2019t change, we\u2019re all going to be losers.\u201dThat heartless quote reminded me of an anecdote in \u201cConfidence Men,\u201d Ron Suskind\u2019s book about the Obama administration\u2019s financial team during the president\u2019s first term. Some of Obama\u2019s top advisers wanted to let Chrysler fail. But in a critical meeting, Ron Bloom, a former adviser to the United Steelworkers who was a member of Obama\u2019s Auto Task Force, said, \u201cMr. President, these are the reasons we can\u2019t kill this company. The damage to these communities and people will never be undone.\u201dChrysler was ultimately saved because the president\u2019s advisers suddenly understood that it was their role to save jobs, not to sacrifice them on the altar of economic purity.

{"Headline": "Looking for Conventions, Cities Add Hotel Rooms ", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare Feet\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great renaissance downtown,\u201d said Mr. Burke, who is part of the team developing the Hyatt. \u201cMeeting planners come here and they love it. They say: \u2018Things are so much for the better. But where do my people stay?\u2019\u201dKansas City is not the only place meeting planners are asking that question. From Seattle to Miami Beach, cities are chasing convention hotel development, typically of 600 to 1,200 rooms. The goal is to attract groups whose members will put money into the pockets of waitresses, bartenders, shopkeepers and cabdrivers \u2014 as well as the public till.Locales weighing plans to build convention hotels include Miami Beach, Broward County, Fla., and Pittsburgh.Similarly, average revenue per available room, a measure of profitability, reached $93.61 in July, a year-over-year increase of 8.3 percent, according to STR.According to the Center for Exhibition Industry Research in Dallas, an organization that has tracked trade shows nationally since 2000, 68.9 million people attended exhibition events in 2014. That was up 12.8 percent from the bottom in 2009 and slightly above the previous peak attendance in 2006.The need to stay competitive is behind the buildup, too. That means not only boasting about ample room supply, but also simplifying the lives of meeting planners by giving them two or three lodging contracts instead of seven or eight.\u201cMeeting planners are under pressure to get high attendance, so they want to make sure that attendees will be accommodated in big, new, nice hotels,\u201d said Lauro Ferroni, senior vice president and global head of research for the hotel and hospitality group at JLL, a real estate services firm in Chicago. \u201cLuckily, we\u2019re in a growth cycle.\u201dWith a few exceptions, public money is flowing into the convention hotels. Either local government authorities own the properties, for example, or private developers are tapping citywide occupancy or tourism-related tax revenue, future property and sales taxes generated by the hotels\u2019 operations, and other sources.Such subsidies typically set off debate over whether public financing of hotels is a good policy. But cities that have invested heavily in convention centers and supporting amenities \u2014 often to foster urban renewal \u2014 have few alternatives if they want to stay on the radar of a group that selects its locations years in advance, says Tom Baker, corporate managing director for the hospitality group at Savills Studley, a real estate services firm in McLean, Va.\u201cIt becomes almost a dog chasing his tail: How do you keep up with the demands of the clients to ensure your spot in the rotation?\u201d he said. \u201cThere need to be incentives that goose the returns for these projects, or they won\u2019t pencil out financially.\u201dHeywood T. Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas at San Antonio, challenges the notion that convention centers contribute to urban economic development and criticizes a consulting industry that he considers far too optimistic when projecting the financial payoffs of convention centers and hotels.Among other questions, he wonders whether the demand exists to justify the amount of convention space in the country, which by his count increased to 71.2 million square feet in 2013 from 52.1 million square feet in 2000.Largely gleaning publicly available data and excluding local events like consumer shows, meetings and banquets, Mr. Sanders has tabulated attendance at individual convention centers over several years and generally has found demand to be flat or flagging. The nation\u2019s largest convention center, McCormick Place in Chicago, drew more than 1.5 million attendees in 2003, for example, and bottomed in 2011 at 769,000. In 2014, only about 882,000 attended events there, he said.Thomas A. Hazinski, a managing director for the convention consulting firm HVS in Chicago, argues that Mr. Sanders fails to consider nonconvention hotel demand, which varies from market to market. He added that Mr. Sanders\u2019s critique of the Hilton\u2019s performance in Baltimore versus projections, which were based on HVS\u2019s feasibility study, was skewed.Local resistance to using tax dollars to fund convention hotels without a public vote has cropped up in some markets.In Kansas City, a political action committee, Citizens for Responsible Government, is trying to force the Hyatt project onto the ballot. A hotel owner in Portland unsuccessfully tried to put the planned $213 million Hyatt convention hotel before voters over its $78 million in subsidies.For their part, Mr. Burke and a spokesman for Kansas City\u2019s mayor, Sly James, maintain that aside from a complex 15-year, $62 million catering contract tied to the project, Kansas City is not on the hook if the convention hotel does not live up to financial performance expectations. It\u2019s a lesson the city learned after guaranteeing bonds for the Power & Light District entertainment area downtown. Kansas City has had to make debt payments to cover the district\u2019s revenue shortfalls.\u201cAll of the public dollars funding this hotel are gained by people either staying or using our hotel, staying at other hotels, or using the convention center,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cThey are funds that are exclusively used for conventions and convention-related facilities, not funds that can be used for police, firemen, potholes or pensions.\u201dAn article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about cities adding convention hotels misstated, in some copies, the job title of Lauro Ferroni of the real estate services firm JLL, who commented on the trend. Mr. Ferroni is the senior vice president and global head of research for the hotel and hospitality group, not the senior vice president and global head of the group over all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Weighs Autonomy for Parts of East, Already in Russia\u2019s Thrall", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that, paradoxically, could be a positive development, some analysts say, and a necessary first step to ending the fighting, which has cost more than 6,500 lives and has driven Ukraine\u2019s economy close to collapse.And there are signs that the issue of autonomy could destabilize the government in Kiev. By Wednesday, three police officers had died from wounds sustained during the protest, and the governing coalition in Parliament had started to splinter, with one party leaving.Yet the rebel areas have already slipped under Moscow\u2019s control, not only militarily and politically, but also economically, as trade has swiveled to the eastern border with Russia and Russian rubles have become the region\u2019s principal currency.Ensconced in their enclaves, the separatists are showing little willingness to rejoin Ukraine in any way. They have formed their own ministries and armies, and they have begun levying taxes and paying the pensions and public wages that Kiev stopped paying last year.\u201cWe are shifting to the Russian Federation,\u201d said the most senior rebel financial official, Evgenia V. Samokhina, the economic development minister of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic.The approximately 3.5 million people living within the so-called people\u2019s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk have become de facto entrants into the ruble currency zone. Donetsk is officially a multicurrency area, where businesses are allowed to accept any form of payment. But the leadership last winter fixed an exchange rate that favors the ruble, and since then the Ukrainian hryvnia has all but vanished.While the ruble is extending Moscow\u2019s financial dominion, trade is also shifting to the east. European security observers stationed on the border with Russia to keep an eye on military transfers noticed telltale signs of Russia\u2019s footprint in the region, known as the Donbas: Starting in May, hundreds of trucks per week hauling coal, the region\u2019s main export, began crossing into Russia.That could reflect a broader bargain that serves Mr. Putin\u2019s interests, analysts say. Obtaining an autonomy measure that meets his demands in the cease-fire agreement will simply cement the \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d and provide him with a politically defensible way to extricate himself from a costly conflict that he can no longer afford.The latest updates to the current visual survey of the continuing dispute, with maps and satellite imagery showing rebel and military movement.\u201cThere is a strain on Russia\u2019s budget with oil and gas prices where they are today, and the lowering of military activity is part of Putin\u2019s plan to get out of this situation,\u201d Ivan Lozowy, director of the Institute of Statehood and Democracy, a Kiev research group, said in a telephone interview.\u201cPutin has abandoned plans for serious military action,\u201d he said. But to accomplish his goals, Mr. Lozowy said, Mr. Putin needs the acquiescence of the Kiev government and its president, Petro O. Poroshenko, in the fig leaf of an autonomy agreement that keeps the separatists nominally a part of Ukraine.\u201cPutin is looking to reintegrate the occupied territories, but to have the leaders, or some representatives, enter into Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, or at a minimum hold positions in local government,\u201d Mr. Lozowy said. That way the Russian leader can make a case to Western governments to lift their damaging economic sanctions, he added.That possibility has incensed members of the volunteer battalions that bore the brunt of the fighting. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense among those who fought at the front of: \u2018What were we fighting for? The separatists will be allowed in,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lozowy said.That bitter outcome, analysts say, is not just the result of Russia\u2019s military and economic power. In its decision to end subsidies to the east, Kiev has itself to blame, as well as Moscow.Before the war, the separatist regions were subsidized by Ukraine, with about $2.6 billion a year going to pensions and an additional $3.2 billion to coal subsidies. Now, rubles from Russia\u2019s own strained budget are filling that subsidy gap, buying influence along the way.\u201cWhen we speak of soft power, Ukraine is just shooting itself in the foot\u201d by losing economic sway over the rebel zones, said Oleksiy Melnyk, a researcher at the Razumkov Center in Kiev. It remains unclear whether the autonomy measure will pass, a feat that will require a supermajority of 300 of Parliament\u2019s 450 members, and at what political cost among a people whose hatred of Mr. Putin and Russia is often palpable.\u201cWhat do we have in Donetsk and Luhansk? We have the Russian Army, Russian gangsters and Ukrainian terrorists,\u201d Oksana Syroyid, deputy speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, and an opponent of the constitutional change, said in an interview on Wednesday.Speaking of the rebel leadership, she added: \u201cIf we enact this law, what will we have? These people will be amnestied, they will be elected and we will have to pay them.\u201dWith the change, Ms. Syroyid said, the Kremlin would be positioned to regain a role in Ukrainian national politics by using sham elections to fill 14 vacant parliamentary mandates in rebel-held areas and sending these officials to Kiev.Mr. Putin, she said, has repeatedly escalated the conflict to achieve political goals, and she doubted he would stop with just the autonomy law. \u201cWe all know that Putin\u2019s behavior does not depend on any documents,\u201d Ms. Syroyid said. \u201cWhat does he want? Maybe after getting the constitutional change, he will escalate again to achieve something else.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.M.F. Cautions on Concentrated Positions in U.S. Mutual Funds", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe warning comes at a time of increased nervousness about China and other emerging markets like Brazil. And it highlights a growing concern on the part of regulators and economists that mutual funds, in their hunger to load up on high-risk, high-yield securities in an environment of low interest rates, will be hard pressed to sell them during a market reversal.Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates fund companies, proposed a series of rules and regulations intended to bolster the practices of mutual and exchange-traded funds when it comes to returning cash to investors.The reports were part of a broader research overview that the I.M.F. was presenting ahead of its fall meetings, which are to be held in Lima, Peru, starting next week.In particular, the I.M.F. said that the bountiful amounts of cash that have moved around the marketplace in this era of extraordinary central bank activism had given many investors a false sense of security in terms of their ability to sell assets on demand.\u201cEven seemingly plentiful market liquidity can suddenly evaporate and lead to systemic financial disruptions,\u201d the authors of the report concluded.Most large investment banks no longer actively trade these securities, increasing the danger that a contagious bout of selling could spread through the financial marketplace, the fund\u2019s economists noted.Although the language of the fund\u2019s experts was muted, their words of caution highlight increased investor unease about the slowdown in China and other large emerging markets.Underpinning the I.M.F.\u2019s worries has been the tremendous increase in bonds issued by a range of large emerging market corporations, including energy firms in Latin America and steel companies in Southeast Asia.Two countries that have been at the center of investor concerns \u2014 China and Turkey \u2014 were highlighted in the fund\u2019s study on emerging-market debts. These two economies experienced the largest increases in corporate debt since 2007, with China company debt up 27 percent and Turkey up around 24 percent.Corporate debt in emerging markets has soared to $18 trillion in 2014 from $4 trillion in 2004. Bonds issued in dollars have been the fastest-growing subsection of this category, increasing to $855 billion last year from $163 billion in 2003, the I.M.F. calculates.Mutual funds in the United States have been the most aggressive buyers of these securities, and the fear is that, as these economies slow and their currencies tumble, the companies will default and it will be the American mutual fund investor who will be left with the bill.Although the I.M.F. and other international watchdogs such as the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for global central banks, have been highlighting this concern for some time, there has been little evidence to date of mutual funds being unable to sell their bonds when asked to do so by investors.And mutual fund companies have vigorously defended their policies in terms of providing liquidity to investors. Many fund companies have taken extra precautions such as arranging for credit lines from banks and increasing levels of cash or securities that are easy to sell.But analysts who keep a close eye on how easy \u2014 or hard \u2014 it is to sell bonds in the market these days say that these steps may not be enough, especially if, as is often the case in a market panic, investors head for the exits in unison.\u201cThere have been a lot of people going into these types of illiquid investments,\u201d said Stephen Tu, an expert on market liquidity at the credit rating firm Moody\u2019s. \u201cIf we have a real liquidation event, solutions such as credit lines are going to be inadequate.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about an International Monetary Fund report on risks in mutual fund holdings of high-yielding bonds described incorrectly the outflow from mutual funds this year. Investors in the United States and worldwide have pulled close to $75 billion, not $100 billion, from global bond and equity funds that invest in emerging markets, not funds more broadly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Help for the Way We Work Now", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWITH the presidential race well underway, Labor Day is a good time to consider how our political leaders are grappling with the many challenges facing American workers. While the next president will confront a host of important labor and economic issues, one is poised to be a particularly significant factor in 2016 and beyond: the freelance economy.For better or worse, freelancing is becoming the new normal in America. There are now 53 million freelance workers nationwide, according to a 2014 study that the Freelancers Union helped commission. These workers include 38 percent of millennials and they contribute $715 billion annually to the United States economy. As jobs that long sustained the middle class grow scarce, the freelance economy is revolutionizing the way that we live and work.Some argue that freelancing has become more common as a result of America\u2019s economic struggles. For many freelancers, that is undoubtedly true. But an increasing number of workers are voluntarily opting out of conventional employment to pursue freelance opportunities.More than half of freelancers surveyed began freelancing by choice, as opposed to financial need, and nearly nine in 10 say they would not take a traditional full-time job if they were offered one.That\u2019s because the freelance or gig economy offers American workers the kind of flexibility and independence that was all but impossible to achieve in the past. Instead of watching the clock from a cubicle, freelancers generally set their own hours and are paid for their time. They can pick their kids up from school or go to the doctor without asking their bosses for permission. They don\u2019t have to fight rush hour traffic every morning, and they get to decide for themselves whether to work late nights.We are in the midst of a historic shift that rivals the transition from farms to factories. And yet, despite making up more than one-third of the American work force, freelancers don\u2019t have access to the essential benefits and protections that come with traditional employment. This is the central challenge that our political leaders have failed to address.But the freelance economy is more than a new frontier in old partisan battles over workers\u2019 rights and government regulation. Freelancers, a rapidly expanding share of the electorate, have become a legitimate political constituency, and nobody is effectively speaking up for their needs.Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic Party as a whole certainly have a much better track record on labor rights than their Republican opponents. Yet, while it\u2019s clear that misclassified work is a serious problem that warrants punishment for bad actors, treating freelancers as employees will not solve all of our problems.In the freelance economy, workers inevitably face periods without pay. But unemployment benefits are not available to most freelancers, so they have virtually no safety net. Even when they are working, freelancers don\u2019t enjoy the essential health care and retirement benefits associated with salaried employment. While the Affordable Care Act is helping freelancers with lower incomes gain access to insurance, some who do not qualify for subsidies are struggling to cope with rising health care costs. And it\u2019s nearly impossible for many freelancers to plan for retirement when they are forced to dip into their savings during periods between jobs.In response, we should develop a new system of portable benefits that reflects the realities of episodic income. Specifically, freelancers should be allowed to put away pretax income into shared accounts, where clients would also make prorated contributions based on the number of hours worked.This portable benefits system would be a new program, but it would not be another government entitlement. Instead, it would be administered by unions, nonprofits, faith-based groups and other community organizations that would collect payments and distribute benefits when freelancers needed them.Finally, unlike traditional employees, freelancers have little recourse against wage theft. In New York City alone, according to our research, 77 percent of freelancers have faced denied or late payment in their careers. At last count, 44 percent had dealt with clients who refused to pay in the previous year. And while the average amount owed was more than $6,000, the maximum amount that New Yorkers can sue for in small claims court \u2014 which itself can be a costly, time-consuming process \u2014 is $5,000. That\u2019s why freelancers need strict and enforceable protections from denied and late payment.Until now, politicians have been talking about the gig economy using outdated language. They\u2019re not talking about how we work today, and they\u2019re certainly not talking about how we\u2019re going to work tomorrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Turmoil May Stall Rebound in Watch Sales", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 After nearly three years of government austerity and slow economic growth, sales of luxury watches in China are showing signs of rebound \u2014 although many factors, including the recent weakening of the renminbi and stock market turmoil, could stall that momentum again.Swiss watches enjoy a near-monopoly on the luxury watch market in China, and also in Hong Kong, which is not subject to mainland tariffs on luxury goods. A popular shopping destination, Hong Kong is also a center for shipping and re-export.From 2005 to 2012, the value of watch exports to China from Switzerland grew 370 percent, to 1.6 billion Swiss francs, or $1.64 billion, from 351.6 million Swiss francs, according to industry data. During the same period, exports to Hong Kong grew to 4.4 billion francs, from 1.8 billion francs, an increase of 144.7 percent.Beginning in late 2012, however, Chinese demand for luxury watches took a hit. The value of exports to Hong Kong and China combined dropped 7.5 percent in 2013 before stabilizing and contracting 0.9 percent in 2014.\u201cThe slowing demand for luxury watches in Hong Kong and China is mainly due to two factors: the Chinese authorities\u2019 crackdown on extravagant gift-giving and more mainland Chinese traveling and buying luxury products abroad,\u201d said Alice Tsang, an economist on the Greater China Research Team at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.The renminbi\u2019s recent strength against the weak euro has bolstered Chinese tourism in Western Europe, with concomitant growth in luxury purchases, which are not subject to the import tariffs that are placed on mainland purchases.A trade agreement between China and Switzerland, which went into effect in July 2014, reduced tariffs on Swiss watches by 18 percent in the first year and will reduce them by a total of 60 percent over 10 years. The agreement does not affect import-related taxes, value-added tax or consumption tax, however, preserving some of Hong Kong\u2019s and Europe\u2019s appeal as destinations for watch purchases.In the meantime, sales in China are rebounding, while exports to Hong Kong continue to lag.\u201cAfter a decrease of our exports to China last year, we note a recovery this year, with growth of 5.3 percent for the first half-year,\u201d said Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, adding that the group expects the rebound to continue.But during the first six months of 2015, Swiss watch exports to Hong Kong, still suffering, were down 19.5 percent year on year.Swatch Group, which, along with Richemont, Rolex and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, dominate the Swiss watch industry, struck an upbeat note in its 2015 midyear report, released in July. Swatch owns brands including Blancpain, Breguet, Omega, Longines and Tissot.\u201cSales in Greater China and other regions will further increase in local currency,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor all brands, this growth will be supported by a high level of marketing investment, an expanded retail network and also by the many new product launches in all segments.\u201dRichemont described mixed performances for different brands in its report for the fiscal year ending March. Sales of Piaget, Vacheron Constantin and A. Lange & S\u00f6hne watches were weak in Hong Kong, the report noted, although Vacheron Constantin sales were strong in China. Overall the China slowdown was \u201cmoderating,\u201d it said.In general, Chinese demand has been shifting away from the market\u2019s higher end to more affordable purchases.\u201cBrands such as Omega, Rolex, Longines, Cartier and Tissot, which used to be considered medium-range luxury watches, are now top favorites,\u201d said Charlie Gu, a director at China Luxury Advisors, a consultancy that has offices in Paris and Shanghai.\u201cI think China\u2019s luxury watch market is maturing, but with growing pains,\u201d Mr. Gu said. \u201cDespite the crackdown on conspicuous spending by government officials and a slowing economy, the market is still growing.\u201dIn China, luxury watches are popular status symbols and were often presented as gifts to corrupt officials by businesspeople hoping to win contracts or approval for projects. The arrival of President Xi Jinping in late 2012 and his continuing anticorruption drive changed that.\u201cIt has definitely put a chilling effect on luxury watch sales, as government officials are refraining from lavish spending out of fear. But the initial shock from the top bracket is likely to be absorbed by the growing demand from the middle class,\u201d Mr. Gu said, adding that the market now favors watches priced from $1,600 to $4,000.Currency movements are also an issue. The floating of the Swiss franc in January did not affect watch prices in Hong Kong, Ms. Tsang said, but the recent weakening of the renminbi against the dollar is likely to have significant repercussions.\u201cThe devaluing of the renminbi means foreign goods become pricier for Chinese consumers in their own currency,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the medium term, demand for luxury watches may slow down.A weaker renminbi will also make travel beyond China\u2019s borders more expensive.\u201cMainland Chinese may decrease the number of overseas trips they take or buy fewer luxury products when traveling,\u201d she added.In addition to the renminbi, another major development is introducing uncertainty into the Chinese luxury watch market: the Apple Watch.Apple initially introduced its smartwatch in nine markets, including China and Hong Kong, as well as the United States, on April 24.While the company has yet to release its watch sales results for China and Hong Kong, the two markets are believed to be among its top performers, with the Apple Watch Sport version, for example, retailing for as little as 2,728 Hong Kong dollars, or $352.Since April, Apple\u2019s watch has received plenty of public attention in China \u2014 including being spotted on the wrist of a TV news anchorwoman during a broadcast and a new ad campaign featuring Chinese tourists using the watch in Germany and German tourists using the watch in China.\u201cApple is already considered a luxury brand by Chinese consumers. The introduction and popularity of Apple\u2019s watch will no doubt increase competition,\u201d Mr. Gu said, noting that LVMH is planning a TAG Heuer-branded smartwatch, scheduled to make its debut in October. \u201cApple Watch will challenge Swiss watchmakers to come up with a counterstrategy for an evolving consumer lifestyle.\u201dMr. Pasche was sanguine about the newest luxury watchmaker.\u201cWe do not fear the competition of the smartwatches,\u201d he said. \u201cSwiss mechanical watches have been successful in China, and smartwatches may also find success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Laura Everett and Abbi Holt: United by Love and Religion", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsA wedding of two women is no longer remarkable in Massachusetts, the first state to legalize gay marriage. But this one involved unusual religious complexity: The Rev. Laura Everett\u2019s public declaration of love involved informing her bosses, who happen to be a dozen church leaders from 17 denominations, of her intent to marry another woman.Ms. Everett, 36, a minister of the United Church of Christ and the executive director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, understood if some were surprised by the news that she was about to marry Abbi Holt, a middle-school Latin teacher in Arlington, Mass. In the past, Ms. Everett had dated only men.The two women met in 2006 during a Bible study class on economic justice at Hope Central Church in Boston, where both were members living in the same Jamaica Plain neighborhood.Midway through the six-month class, Ms. Everett\u2019s car died; Ms. Holt, 40, an ardent bike commuter, then built one of the custom two-wheelers she regularly assembles so her classmate could navigate the crowded Boston streets.For the next four years, they were simply good friends with much in common. In fact, Ms. Everett met her last boyfriend at an annual Halloween party hosted by Ms. Holt, who openly identifies as gay.Still, there was no denying a spark as they shared pastimes and passions: church, longer and longer bike rides, crafting, building community and building bikes.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I was drawn to Abbi,\u201d Ms. Everett said. \u201cShe strives to live justly and tread lightly.\u201dThey spent more time together, and Ms. Everett began looking for answers.\u201cI started asking myself, why am I choosing to go on such long bike rides with this person, and spending so much time with her?\u201d she recalled thinking. She began imagining the possibility of a relationship. \u201cI\u2019m not in the practice of turning down gifts from God, even if I\u2019m surprised by them,\u201d Ms. Everett said.Following an ancient Christian custom, Ms. Everett sought guidance about the relationship from her \u201cspiritual director,\u201d a Boston-based monk. \u201cAnd I decided it was more than a friendship.\u201dMs. Holt, in the meantime, was trying her best to play down her feelings.\u201cAs we spent more time together, I basically took the \u2018straight crush\u2019 angle and stuck away the idea of romance in the back of my brain,\u201d she said, but she was already attracted to Ms. Everett\u2019s \u201cconfidence, love of exploration and her \u2018Jesus nerdery.\u2019 \u201dMs. Holt had her own share of off-the-popular-path interests, including teaching Latin as a spoken language. Her mother, Zanne Macdonald, a retired librarian from Charlottesville, Va., added more. \u201c \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 \u2018Lord of the Rings,\u2019 \u201d she said, \u201cAbbi had nerdism down cold when she was little.\u201dIn July 2010, four years into their friendship and midway through a 40-mile bike ride, they took a break on a bench outside a country store in Dover, Mass. \u201cLaura walked out of the store and said \u2018I feel like there\u2019s been this energy between us,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Holt recalled her saying. \u201cAnd she was so serious that I immediately got worried and blurted out that straight crushes happen, but that we can still be friends.\u201dMs. Everett interrupted and said: \u201cWait! Let me finish this speech I\u2019ve prepared!\u201d Ms. Holt remembered her saying.\u201cI shut up and listened, and she told me that she had feelings for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI said we needed to go on a date.\u201dThey made plans to meet five days later, at a performance of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cOthello\u201d on the Boston Common. \u201cLaura showed up on a bicycle strapped down with two camping chairs, one bottle of wine, one blanket and enough food to feed an army,\u201d Ms. Holt said, remembering it as the moment that everything changed. \u201cThe show was probably too riveting for anyone to notice our first kiss.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that I resisted falling for Abbi as much as it took me a while to get used to the idea \u2014 imaginative capacity, I guess,\u201d Ms. Everett said. \u201cAbbi would have gotten married much sooner. In monastic communities, people take initial vows and then later, final vows. We\u2019ve been committed to one another for years, but I needed some time to get to those final vows. Abbi was gracious to wait for me. I needed some time to reimagine my life with this devoted person who happens to be a woman.\u201dTogether, they began building a life.With the benefit of Ms. Holt\u2019s master\u2019s degree in teaching Latin and classical studies from Boston University, Ms. Everett\u2019s sermons began to include more Latin and stronger connections between scripture and the ancient world. (She is a guest preacher in churches around the state.)Ms. Holt introduced Ms. Everett to the Boston bicycling community, and Ms. Everett now leads memorial services for cyclists killed while riding the city\u2019s streets. Ms. Holt said they delighted doing \u201cchurchy things\u201d together and even their hobbies blended: When they rescued a church pew from the side of the road, Ms. Holt repaired it and Ms. Everett sewed cushions.Ms. Everett said she was \u201cdrawn to Abbi because she wasn\u2019t waiting for someone else to make her happy. She was making her own joy. I wanted to join that party.\u201d But all the while, she knew how their relationship might affect her work at the Council of Churches, a 113-year-old organization that works for Christian unity among 17 Protestant and Orthodox Christian member denominations in Massachusetts.So, while they shared their lives fully with their families, their own church and their friends, they remained circumspect where their lives intersected with Ms. Everett\u2019s professional circles.\u201cI think Laura was trying to navigate her job and her love for Abbi,\u201d said her father, Rick Everett, a former managing editor of The Star-Ledger in Newark.Ms. Holt said she would refrain from appearing outwardly supportive or affectionate toward Ms. Everett. \u201cWhen we were walking around Cambridge or some other places, we were always a little careful,\u201d she said. And though Ms. Everett is active on social media, it, too, was off limits for expressions of their love and life together.That all changed last spring when they decided to get married. For three weeks in June, Ms. Everett made appointments to speak with each of the church leaders she works with. \u201cWhen Laura was telling the bishops, she had to get the words out really quickly: \u2018I\u2019m getting married \u2014 to a woman,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Holt said.Ms. Everett recalled the leaders\u2019 response. \u201cI was treated with respect,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, oh yeah, surprise. The president of my board and I had no template for how to do this. We took our best guesses. How do you make public this information at a time when some churches are really divided and others are celebrating a Supreme Court decision?\u201dThe Rt. Rev. Gayle E. Harris, the bishop suffragan of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts and the head of the board at the Massachusetts Council of Churches, said, \u201cLaura was asking us to be companions as we can, and as we are willing.\u201d After a moment she added, \u201cWhen something is presented as a theory or a law, it\u2019s one thing. It\u2019s another to experience a person in a situation. Her colleagues know her as a person. It\u2019s kind of like that old song, \u2018To Know Her Is to Love Her.\u2019 \u201dShe paused, again, before adding, \u201cThere was no strong disavowal.\u201dOn Aug. 29, the couple had a wedding that mixed the traditional and unconventional. Rousing hymns were sung throughout the service, officiated by the Rev. Greg Morisse, who attended Harvard Divinity School with Ms. Everett. Bishop Harris and the Rev. Laura Ruth Jarrett, the senior pastor of Hope Central Church, participated in the ceremony.Guests arrived in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston wearing custom suits and vintage party dresses, flax gauchos and flip-flops.Ms. Everett wore a vintage Priscilla of Boston gown bought from a thrift store, and Ms. Holt wore a kilt of her maternal family\u2019s tartan. Challah and gluten-free wafers were offered for communion. During his blessing, Mr. Morisse, who sports a mohawk, took a selfie that included all of the approximately 115 guests.The reception was held under a tent in the church playground, where Ms. Everett and her mother, Mary Everett, an assistant elementary-school teacher in Rockaway, N.J., had decorated the swings with bunting. A cornucopia held 10 pounds of saltwater taffy to honor Ms. Everett\u2019s Jersey Shore roots.Haley House, a local nonprofit that teaches culinary skills to ex-offenders, catered the food. Katie Leaird, a friend and a chef at America\u2019s Test Kitchen, baked the cake. Food scraps were composted by a local start-up, Bootstrap Compost, and will be returned to the brides as fertilizer for their garden.As guests drank prosecco and nonalcoholic blueberry shrub (made by Ms. Everett and Mr. Morisse), they spoke of the newlyweds. \u201cThey\u2019re both a little eccentric,\u201d said Sallie Holt, Ms. Holt\u2019s sister. \u201cBike parts are strewn around their house, they have a craft room, Abbi does woodworking and Laura will stay up in the middle of the night canning vegetables.\u201dMs. Holt\u2019s father, Charlie Holt, a professor of political economy at the University of Virginia, said his daughter had found a spiritual bond with Ms. Everett. \u201cLaura has a softness and warmth,\u201d he said, \u201cand a thoughtfulness in connecting people with what they love.\u201dKate Everett said when Ms. Holt came into her older sister\u2019s life, everything just fell into place. \u201cLaura\u2019s great love arrived in an unexpected package,\u201d she said, \u201cand no one saw it coming.

{"Headline": "China, Trying to Bolster Currency, Taps Foreign Reserves", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is burning through its huge stockpile of foreign exchange reserves at the fastest pace yet as it seeks to prop up its currency and stem a rising tide of money flowing out of the country.Even after a record monthly decrease of nearly $100 billion, China still has the world\u2019s biggest cache of foreign reserves, standing at $3.56 trillion at the end of last month, government data showed on Monday.The total has declined steadily from a peak of nearly $4 trillion in June of last year, as slowing economic growth caused investors to move money out of the country in search of better returns elsewhere. As a result, the Chinese central bank has had to sell huge amounts from its foreign reserves to maintain the strength of the nation\u2019s currency, the renminbi.Investors have been jolted in recent months by the sudden change in China\u2019s exchange rate policy and by the government\u2019s bungled handling of a stock market bailout. The sell-off in shares in Shanghai has become steeper in recent weeks, sending ripples through markets around the world and heightening worries that apparent confusion in Beijing could be a sign of more trouble to come.On Monday, the sell-off continued in a volatile day. The benchmark stock index in Shanghai closed down nearly 2.5 percent despite assurances by a Chinese official at a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers in Ankara, Turkey, on Saturday that the worst of the correction was almost over.The downward pressure on the renminbi reflects the bleaker prospects for China\u2019s economy as growth appears to be slowing faster than previously reported.\u00a0On Tuesday morning in Beijing, China\u2019s customs administration reported that exports in August declined 5.5 percent in dollar terms from a year ago on signs of weak demand from overseas buyers. Imports fell 13.8 percent, partly reflecting the global rout in commodity prices. China\u2019s trade surplus swelled to $60.2 billion in August, nearly matching the record monthly surplus set in February.\u00a0On Monday, China\u2019s statistics agency lowered its estimate for gross domestic product in 2014, saying the economy had grown by 7.3 percent last year compared with the 7.4 percent previously reported.The manufacturing sector grew faster last year than previously estimated, the agency said, but the service sector \u2014 specifically financial services companies like securities firms and banks, which benefited from a booming stock market \u2014 grew slower last year than originally reported.Pockets of weakness can be seen across China\u2019s economy.\u201cBusiness this year has been tough, and getting more tough as each month goes by,\u201d said Du Shengdu, a manager in the sales department of Hebei Hongchi Bicycles, a bicycle manufacturer in central China. \u201cFewer customers are asking for quotes, and even for those who ask for quotes, a lot of times, no order ultimately materialized.\u201dBut at least some exporters report seeing a recent uptick in business on expectations of a weaker renminbi. A weaker currency makes China\u2019s products relatively cheaper for overseas buyers.Economists have said the initial drop in the currency\u2019s value of around 3 percent against the dollar would have only a limited impact, but the effect could be intensified if the currency yields to market pressure for further depreciation.Kellen Chan, a sales manager in the export department at Guangzhou Xinxiu Fashion Bags, a handbag maker in the southern city of Guangzhou, said that business was slow earlier in the summer but had started picking up more recently.\u201cWe are getting a lot more inquiries starting from last month,\u201d Ms. Chan said. \u201cIt is probably due to the devaluation of the renminbi.\u201dSince the devaluation, China\u2019s central bank has kept the currency more or less steady at roughly 6.4 renminbi to the dollar. But the move raised expectations that the renminbi would weaken further, leading to the central bank\u2019s sales of foreign reserves to counter depreciation pressures. China amassed its huge pile of reserves in previous years, when the pressure had been for the renminbi to appreciate in value. Because China closely manages the value of its currency against the dollar, it had to buy dollars and sell renminbi to counter this appreciation.Now, the tables have turned and the pressure is on the renminbi to depreciate. But China retains a firm grip on its value, and this time it has been selling dollars and buying renminbi to prop up the Chinese currency\u2019s value.Some analysts interpreted the drop of nearly $100 billion as relatively good news, compared with estimates that the decrease could have been double that amount.China\u2019s central bank \u201cis not burning through its reserves as quickly as many had believed,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a report Monday evening after the data was released.Mr. Evans-Pritchard calculated that the net amount of money leaving China probably rose to a record $130 billion last month, up from about $75 billion in July.\u201cIt seems that the depreciation of the renminbi has not sparked as rapid an acceleration of outflows as many had feared,\u201d he wrote.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Premier Quits With Cabinet, Roiling Egypt ", "Date": "2015-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 The Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, accepted the resignation of his prime minister and cabinet on Saturday after a series of high-profile accusations of corruption.Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb offered the resignations in a meeting with Mr. Sisi on Saturday, the Egyptian president\u2019s office said in a statement. Mr. Sisi instructed Sherif Ismail, the petroleum minister in the departing cabinet, to form a new government within a week. Earlier in the week, Mr. Mehleb\u2019s cabinet was rocked by allegations of corruption. The country\u2019s agriculture minister, Salah Helal, resigned on Monday and was arrested in connection with a corruption investigation. The state prosecutor\u2019s office said it was investigating Mr. Helal and other ministry officials on charges of accepting bribes in exchange for land licenses.On Tuesday, Mr. Mehleb abruptly walked out of a news conference in Tunisia after a reporter asked a question about reports that he had been implicated in a separate corruption inquiry. Mr. Mehleb has been accused of involvement in a case in which former President Hosni Mubarak and his two sons were convicted of embezzling funds earmarked for the renovation of presidential palaces.\u201cThe minister of agriculture resigns after a corruption case, and you appointed this minister. You are one of the accused, the main accused, in the corruption case known as the presidential palaces,\u201d the reporter said in a video of the incident before Mr. Mehleb headed toward the door.The cabinet\u2019s resignation also illustrated a political dilemma facing Mr. Sisi, the former armed forces chief who took power during a wave of nationalist fervor following the military\u2019s removal of Mr. Morsi. In spite of the significant cult of personality around Mr. Sisi, his government has failed to resolve a number of problems facing Egypt.The government gave no specific reason for the cabinet\u2019s resignation, nor did the president\u2019s office return calls seeking comment.Hisham Kassem, a political analyst, said the timing of Saturday\u2019s announcement was puzzling, with parliamentary elections scheduled in October.\u201cThis is making things very obscure,\u201d Mr. Kassem said. \u201cIs Sisi going to form the next cabinet or is it going to be formed by the parliament?\u201dHe added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense unless there was something really drastic.\u201dMerna Thomas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "First U.S. Airbus Factory Gives Wings to Revival in Mobile, Ala.", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the first convoy of airplane parts snaked through the streets on a sultry June day, it seemed as if Mardi Gras had come early to the Gulf Coast city of Mobile, Ala.Drawn by the swinging brass horns of an approaching 10-piece jazz band, onlookers stepped out onto their front porches or drew up lawn chairs in the shade of the gnarled oaks along one of Mobile\u2019s main thoroughfares. A dragon-shaped float bearing waving dignitaries and sequined musicians rolled past small houses, modest churches and weathered storefronts.Trailing close behind was a column of flatbed trucks, laden with sections of fuselage, a pair of wings and the tail components of an A321 jet that had just made the three-week Atlantic crossing from an Airbus factory in Hamburg, Germany. They were on their way to a new Airbus assembly plant \u2014 the European aerospace company\u2019s first civilian aircraft factory in the United States.\u201cI think Santa Claus has been here, and he\u2019s left us an airplane,\u201d Mobile\u2019s mayor, William S. Stimpson, known as Sandy, said, beaming at the crowd.The new plant, which formally opened on Monday, offers Airbus an opportunity to expand its customer base in the lucrative American market. In Mobile, Airbus will make the latest, most fuel-efficient planes.It also provides the city a significant lift, representing a revival for a community that until the late 1960s owed much of its post-World War II growth to aviation.The $600 million plant, which encompasses 116 acres on what had been Brookley Air Force Base, is the culmination of a courtship ritual, one of many playing out across the country as communities vie for attention and investment from foreign companies. Like many states and cities, Alabama and Mobile sweetened the deal for Airbus with generous tax breaks and other financial incentives.Big manufacturers, in return, promise to create hundreds, if not thousands, of new jobs. For Mobile, a city of fewer than 200,000 people, the prospect of up to 4,000 jobs with Airbus and its suppliers over the coming years proved especially attractive. Unemployment in the area continues to hover at close to 8 percent, well above the national average.Airbus\u2019s foray into the United States forms part of a longer-term strategy.The company roughly splits the global market for commercial airplanes with its Chicago-based competitor Boeing. But Airbus, which last year had almost 61 billion euros in revenue, or $69 billion in current dollars, still lags far behind its rival in the United States market. That is especially true for the popular single-aisle models like the Airbus A320 and the A321 that compete directly against the Boeing 737. Much in the way that Japanese automakers did a generation ago, Airbus hopes that by producing aircraft that are \u201cmade in America,\u201d it will be able to gradually weaken Boeing\u2019s home-field advantage.A more recognizably American face also serves political goals, Airbus officials concede. At a time when austerity-minded governments in Europe are cutting military spending, Airbus, which also builds helicopters, fighter jets and other military aircraft, is looking to the United States and other governments as potential customers.\u201cWe want to be a global actor in the global aerospace market,\u201d Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, the chief executive of Airbus, said from the company\u2019s headquarters in Toulouse, France.The Mobile plant \u201cwill bring a lot of visibility to the entire Airbus Group,\u201d he continued, \u201cnot just in Alabama, but across the U.S.\u201dThis summer, construction workers were still finishing the 200,000-square-foot final assembly hall in Mobile. But even so, inside, a new airplane was rapidly taking shape, built from the first boatload of components that had arrived with fanfare in June.A few dozen mechanics and engineers in blue uniforms and work boots eased in and out of unfinished doors, installing multicolored bundles of copper wire or testing cockpit equipment. The muffled pulse and whine of power tools wafted through the windows of the still-hollow fuselage.For now, the pace of production in Mobile remains slow compared with that of Airbus\u2019s factories in Germany, France and China, which together produced more than 600 commercial airplanes last year. But even in low gear, the place is humming, echoing the site\u2019s long-ago past as a United States Air Force base.Matthew S. Metcalfe, 84, remembers when the military kept Mobile\u2019s working class supplied with opportunities for skilled employment. At its wartime peak, Brookley had more than 17,000 workers, and for a generation it remained Mobile\u2019s largest employer, providing as many as one in 10 jobs.\u201cLots of people came from smaller towns and rural communities as far away as Arkansas to work here during the war,\u201d said Mr. Metcalfe, a former chairman of the Mobile Airport Authority.When Brookley shut down in 1969, Mobile was devastated. Along with the military employment, thousands of affiliated civilian jobs also vanished.\u201cIt was traumatic to have that big a chunk of your economic engine taken out,\u201d Mr. Metcalfe recalled.Over the next two decades, Mobile struggled to regain its footing as many of the bigger private-sector employers, including textile and paper manufacturers, either shut down or moved their operations overseas. And as in much of the Deep South, Alabama\u2019s appeal to outside investors suffered from the stigma of a history of racial violence.Things began to change in 1993, when James E. Folsom Jr., Alabama\u2019s lieutenant governor, became governor after his predecessor was convicted of an ethics violation. While Mr. Folsom served for less than two years, many Alabamians credit him with helping transform the state\u2019s image with big business.Days after being sworn in, Mr. Folsom ordered the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the dome of the State Capitol in Montgomery. (Confederate flags that flew at a memorial on the Capitol grounds were removed only this year.)Next came an aggressive campaign by the state to lure new investments with generous tax breaks and other incentives. Within months, Alabama had secured a major manufacturing plant from Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury automaker, in Vance, near Tuscaloosa. The deal, which involved $300 million in inducements, was soon followed by others with foreign automakers, including Honda and Hyundai. Toyota set up an engine factory.Other manufacturers also made their way to Alabama, including military contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, as well as Boeing and other aerospace companies. But they clustered up north, particularly near Huntsville, the home of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and where, in the 1950s and 1960s, Wernher von Braun helped design the rockets that took astronauts to the moon.While Mobile secured foreign investments in a naval shipyard and a steel plant, efforts to attract a big manufacturer to the Brookley site foundered.In 1993, Mobile made the short list to build the McDonnell Douglas MD-12, a wide-body passenger jet that was ultimately abandoned because of a lack of demand. A decade later, Boeing considered assembling its 787 Dreamliner there before deciding to keep production in Washington State. And Indonesian Aerospace, a state-owned manufacturer of twin-engine turboprops and helicopters, developed plans for a production facility that never materialized.Mobile \u201cwas always kind of like the bridesmaid,\u201d said Jo Bonner, a Republican who represented Mobile in Congress from 2003 to 2013, \u201calways coming up short of getting that ring.\u201dAirbus had eyed the potential in Mobile for years. The city\u2019s deepwater port could accommodate ships carrying large structural parts from Europe. Freight trains run nearby, and the Brookley site, which is equipped with two long runways, is already home to a handful of smaller aviation maintenance companies and parts suppliers.The site was appealing for another important reason: It was on American soil.Airbus also wanted to crack the American military market, the world\u2019s largest. Military, space and security activities worldwide generate just 18 percent of the Airbus Group\u2019s revenue, compared with 34 percent at Boeing. A major American government contract would help the company reduce its dependence on commercial jets.To get big military deals, however, Airbus would need sway with officials in Washington, where large American contractors rank among the most powerful business lobbying groups.Airbus, and Mobile, know the difficulty of pulling that off.That day sticks with Will Fusaiotti, who lives in Mobile. \u201cYou just had the feeling that Mobile deserved to get this,\u201d he said.\u201cIt took us about a year and a half to really scrub the business case,\u201d said Allan McArtor, chief executive of Airbus\u2019s operations in North America. Airbus studied other locations but kept coming back to Alabama and Mobile, which together were prepared to provide $150 million in infrastructure investments, tax breaks, employee training costs and other incentives. By June 2012 it was decided. \u201cThis was the home we were looking for,\u201d Mr. McArtor said.Mobile is a low-slung town, affording Mayor Stimpson a panorama from his 10th-floor office. The view takes in the shipyard and the port as well as the gilded domes of the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, whose parish dates back to the early 1700s, when Mobile was the capital of French Louisiana. When the weather is clear, it is possible to make out the silhouette of Airbus\u2019s new assembly hall.\u201cI think it has restored some confidence that maybe had ebbed after we lost the tanker contract,\u201d Mr. Stimpson said of the Airbus plant.It has also fed intense interest from job seekers. When the first 20 job openings were posted in early 2014, more than 8,000 people applied. In all, the plane maker has received more than 18,000 applications, many from retired military personnel with aerospace or manufacturing experience.Tom Williams, Airbus\u2019s chief operating officer, was stunned when he visited Mobile about a year ago and an airport taxi driver presented him with a copy of his brother\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cIt was all a bit surreal,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Since then, Airbus has hired about 250 new employees in Mobile, who have spent up to nine months training in Europe.Linda Taylor-Bethea, 33, a manufacturing engineer, said she had started taking French and German lessons to ease communications with colleagues on the other side of the Atlantic.\u201cI interact directly with the plants in Europe, where some people are still shy about speaking English,\u201d she said.The company aims to deliver its first American-made plane next spring, to JetBlue Airways, one of 16 Airbus expects to assemble in 2016. For now, all the planes to be produced in Mobile are destined for American customers \u2014 including Delta Air Lines, Spirit Airlines and Virgin America \u2014 that already have combined orders for more than 900 Airbus single-aisle jets valued at close to $100 billion.Since Airbus announced that it would open the Mobile plant, its orders in the United States have been on the rise, said Mr. Br\u00e9gier, the chief executive. Over the last three years, the company has won about 40 percent of the new jet purchases made by American carriers, and Mr. Br\u00e9gier expects that figure to approach 50 percent by the end of the decade.\u201c \u2018Made in America\u2019 is important,\u201d said Michel Merluzeau, an aerospace analyst for Frost & Sullivan in Seattle.By the end of 2017, Airbus expects to be assembling new planes in Mobile at a rate of four a month. Airbus says the Mobile line has enough capacity to double that pace, which would require hiring several hundred more workers.That would fit in well with Airbus\u2019s efforts to step up production worldwide. Since 2008, both Airbus and Boeing have experienced a boom in new jet sales. To shorten the backlogs, Airbus plans to speed global single-aisle production to 50 planes a month by 2017 from 42 now.Higher production rates in Mobile could also prompt Airbus\u2019s American subcontractors to relocate, bringing even more jobs to the area.\u201cFor Mobile and for Alabama, economically there is more to be gained in terms of attracting the Airbus supply chain,\u201d Mr. Merluzeau said.A few months ago, Mr. Fusaiotti, who has some warehouse space near the Brookley site, said he got a call from a company that had won a contract to supply components to Airbus and wanted to take over his lease.\u201cI hadn\u2019t really expected that,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes to the possibilities.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Very Unusual Subway Stop in New York", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThat\u2019s a big question that Gov. Andrew Cuomo should be first in line to answer, followed by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. Cuomo controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and thus the purse strings of the nation\u2019s largest public transit system. Instead of quibbling about financing, as he\u2019s been doing, he needs to put up the money to help fill a $15 billion shortfall in the M.T.A.\u2019s $32 billion capital plan. Coupled with additional contributions from the city, this could upgrade the entire system and help the city jump-start another much-needed station on the No. 7 line at 41st Street and 10th Avenue.Finger-pointing about who pays what surfaced at an otherwise sunny event marking the opening of the new station, a project begun in 2005 to link an uninviting neighborhood to the 7 line to Queens. The M.T.A. chairman, Thomas Prendergast, challenged Mr. de Blasio to raise the city\u2019s modest capital contribution, to which Mr. de Blasio replied by pointing out that the city makes a major contribution to the system\u2019s operating budget.The city, under Michael Bloomberg, was largely responsible for the new station, and Mr. de Blasio, should he choose to go forward with another station, could do worse than emulate the Bloomberg strategy. The essence of that strategy was to float bonds that would be paid for by tax revenues from the new development that Mr. Bloomberg and one of his deputy mayors, Daniel Doctoroff, confidently predicted would precede and follow the new extension.The borrowing and various enticements to developers eventually amounted to about $3 billion. Over time, development near the High Line and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center is supposed to generate enough income to pay the interest on these bonds and provide billions of dollars in new tax revenues for the city. Hopes are high for this build-it-and-they-will-come approach. Early predictions were that the city would get more than $34 billion in revenue from the development by 2050.In short, this should be a moment of celebration, not an occasion for more squabbling between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio. The governor needs to make a major capital investment, the mayor needs to think of creative ways to build a new station, and both men need to begin working together to improve a subway system that\u2019s essential to the economy of both city and state.Advertisement"}

Ganim one big step closer to joining the ranks of comeback mayors, this city\u2019s incumbent mayor, Bill Finch, said he would not easily give up control to Mr. Ganim.\u201cThis is a personal thing for me,\u201d Mr. Finch said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my city to be turned over to the corrupt hordes. I\u2019m going to fight like heck.\u201dPrimary Day can be as decisive as Election Day here in Connecticut\u2019s largest city, where two-thirds of the 60,000 voters are registered Democrats.But the race may not be over, even after a blistering and expensive campaign for the Democratic nomination fought among Mr. Finch, Mr. Ganim and Mary-Jane Foster, a vice president at the University of Bridgeport and a co-founder of the Bridgeport Bluefish baseball team.The contest revealed a city sharply divided over what it most needs.Mr. Ganim focused his efforts on making personal connections and promising to lower taxes. Mr. Finch, meanwhile, trumpeted the progress he has made in rebuilding the city\u2019s economy after the recession. Ms. Foster distanced herself from both candidates during the campaign, saying Bridgeport needed an honest mayor. And maybe a female mayor, too.On Thursday, Mr. Ganim took phone calls and gave interviews to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for Bridgeport,\u201d Mr. Ganim said, adding that he was not surprised that he prevailed. He knocked on doors, visited churches and talked with voters in coffee shops over the last several months. \u201cI made a personal connection with thousands of voters,\u201d he said.One of those voters was Louise Gregory, who has lived in the city for 60 years. Outside the Dunbar School on Union Avenue where she voted for Mr. Ganim on Wednesday, Ms. Gregory echoed a sentiment that Mr. Ganim has promoted and one that seems to have resonated in Bridgeport: Everyone deserves a second chance.\u201cHe was just one of the ones that got caught. He didn\u2019t hurt anybody but himself. He didn\u2019t take anything from me,\u201d Ms. Gregory said. \u201cHe was just getting kickbacks, getting work done for other favors. So he didn\u2019t do it to us. He just stepped out of bounds, you know, that\u2019s all.\u201dIn the mayor\u2019s office, Mr. Finch said he lost the nomination because his campaign did not effectively communicate how deeply Mr. Ganim\u2019s crimes affected the city. And, he said, many of his supporters did not turn out for Wednesday\u2019s primary.\u201cThey probably didn\u2019t think it was possible for such a corrupt individual to make this much headway,\u201d Mr. Finch said on Thursday during a telephone interview from his office. \u201cBut he has, and now we have to keep the mob at the gate.\u201dMr. Finch said he planned to continue his bid for re-election as a candidate for the newly formed Job Creation Party, and he feels confident that voters will support him in the November general election. Mr. Ganim\u2019s traction with Bridgeport voters became apparent over the summer, when the city\u2019s Democratic Party leaders battled over which candidate to endorse. Mr. Finch prevailed, but not without a struggle.\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m relieved,\u201d Mr. Finch said on Thursday about losing the Democratic nomination. \u201cI\u2019m as far away from the corrupt local bosses as I can be.\u201dOn Wednesday, Glenn Marshall, who leads the Carpenters Local 210 union, stood outside Thomas Hooker school with a handful of Finch fliers. The mayor, he said, is moving the city in the right direction and should be re-elected to continue his work.\u201cWe\u2019re supporting Mayor Finch,\u201d Mr. Marshall said of the union\u2019s membership. \u201cWith Mayor Finch there\u2019s been great economic development.\u201dJust one office \u2014 city sheriff \u2014 had more than one Republican candidate. Councilman Enrique Torres is the Republican candidate for mayor.At home on Thursday afternoon, Ms. Foster said neither Mr. Finch nor Mr. Ganim should lead the city.\u201cBridgeport deserves better than that,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Ganim is not the only candidate deserving criticism. \u201cMayor Finch has been such a bad mayor that he essentially opened the door for an even worse mayor to come back,\u201d she said.Ms. Foster already has a place on the general election ballot as an unaffiliated mayoral candidate. But she planned to take the weekend off to relax with family and friends before making a final decision about whether to pursue her bid for mayor.Reggie Horne supported Mr. Finch in Wednesday\u2019s primary because, he said, Bridgeport is on the right path, and the mayor deserves more time to continue his work. Mr. Horne, who works for the city\u2019s maintenance department, said Mr. Ganim may have been more vocal in his courting of voters. And, Mr. Horne said, if Mr. Ganim is sincere in his promise that he has changed, he may still be the \u201cbest person for the city.\u201d But, Mr. Horne said, he does not believe Wednesday\u2019s vote was decisive.\u201cIs it over with?

{"Headline": "Stock Sell-Off Extends to Asia, but Glencore Edges Higher", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFears about commodity prices and an oversupply of raw materials have been reflecting broader weaknesses in global growth, said Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. Glencore, which owns mines but also actively trades commodities, has been hit doubly hard lately.Glencore\u2019s stock had plunged nearly 30 percent on Monday in European trading. And that selling continued on Tuesday, with its Hong Kong-listed shares falling 29 percent.That is why Glencore\u2019s shares were being closely watched on Tuesday in London.Glencore has taken the worst beating of the major mining stocks in recent months, in the face of plunging commodity prices and worries about the economy of China, which has been the major global customer for iron ore and other metals. The company\u2019s stock price has fallen about 80 percent over the past year.\u201cWe believe the market response is overdone,\u201d Heath Jansen, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients on Monday about Glencore. Mr. Jansen also said that Glencore\u2019s management should consider taking the company private if the stock market \u201ccontinues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly.\u201dBut some analysts worry that if prices of commodities like coal and copper fall further, Glencore may struggle to service its debt.Hunter Hillcoat, an analyst at Investec in London, estimates that Glencore has about $47 billion in debt, dwarfing its stock market value of about $16 billion. \u201cThe market is becoming increasingly concerned about the company\u2019s being able to refinance and roll over corporate bond debt,\u201d Mr. Hillcoat said in an interview.The company raised $2.5 billion recently at a price of 1.25 pounds a share, with the chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, and other employees buying 22 percent. But the stock has since fallen about 40 percent since then.In Asia on Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan closed 4 percent lower, and the benchmark Shanghai index closed down about 2 percent. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed down 2.97 percent, and the main index in Australia closed down 3.8 percent.Australia is exposed more than many other countries to the weaknesses in commodity prices. There are signs that other parts of its economy are doing better, but \u201ccommodity trumps everything,\u201d Mr. Neumann said.India\u2019s central bank cut rates more than expected on Tuesday, citing a weak economic outlook. It brought its benchmark interest rate down by 0.5 percentage point, rather than the expected 0.25, to 6.75 percent.All this showed that central banks were not confident that global growth would snap back anytime soon, Mr. Neumann said.An earlier version of this article misstated how much Glencore\u2019s stock has fallen since the company raised $2.5 billion. It is 40 percent, not 57 percent.Stanley Reed reported from London, and Amie Tsang from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico to Restructure Up to $5.7 Billion in Debt", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rico has secured a first foothold in its struggles with a towering $72 billion mountain of debt.The island\u2019s electric power authority and a group of big investors agreed late Tuesday on terms for restructuring as much as $5.7 billion of bonds. That deal offers a possible model for a much bigger, and almost certainly messier, restructuring of debt that Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, has described as \u201cunpayable.\u201dMelba Acosta Febo, president of Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank, called the agreement \u201can example of the promising results that can be achieved when the commonwealth and its creditors work together.\u201dEach side granted concessions, but the agreement also has elements that each side can point to as victories. Bondholders, who had initially feared that they might end up with losses of more than 50 percent, were happy to take a loss of 15 percent on their holdings. Puerto Rico in turn gets to receive interest rate relief and a five-year payment moratorium.Such harmony has been rare. The island\u2019s government is close to running out of cash and can no longer borrow on reasonable terms. Last month, it defaulted on a $58 million bond payment. At the same time, Puerto Rico has been trying without success to get access to the federal bankruptcy courts, something that would take an act of Congress.Restructuring the utility\u2019s debt alone does not solve those problems. Still, the new term sheet gives the Puerto Rican government something to show other creditors why a negotiated restructuring could be more beneficial for all than a long, ferocious battle in the courts.\u201cI hope this process \u2014 and its outcome \u2014 will further confirm our commitment to work collaboratively with our creditors to find satisfactory solutions for them and the people of Puerto Rico and their families,\u201d Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla said in a statement.He previously asked the island\u2019s creditors to work with his administration on a \u201cnegotiated moratorium.\u201dHis idea is to buy time and preserve cash so the government can keep providing essential services while trying to revive the island\u2019s depressed economy.But bondholders have shown little enthusiasm, and some say they believe Puerto Rico can, in fact, pay its debts.Some also question whether any democratically elected government could use a moratorium to achieve the kind of economic reforms that Puerto Rico needs, because they are likely to resemble the tough austerity measures that the International Monetary Fund must impose unilaterally on troubled sovereign debtors.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla initially said the details of his proposed moratorium would be ready at the beginning of this week, but on Saturday his chief of staff announced a one-week delay, attributed to a tropical storm.The new restructuring plan covers only bonds issued by Prepa, Puerto Rico\u2019s public electric power monopoly. Its debt has a total face value of $8.1 billion, but $2.4 billion of that is insured, and the insurers are expected to negotiate separate terms for resolving that debt later.With less risk, the new bonds are also intended to cost Prepa less in interest. The bonds have not yet been rated, but the securitization is supposed to make them so much stronger that they would pay an average interest rate of 4 to 4.75 percent \u2014 significantly less than the double-digit interest that Prepa would presumably have to pay if it tried to issue ordinary bonds in the current uncertainty. As Puerto Rico\u2019s financial problems mounted over the last year, some of Prepa\u2019s bonds changed hands for less than 50 cents on the dollar.The terms also call for one category of the new bonds to pay only interest \u2014 no principal \u2014 for the first five years, to help Prepa conserve cash.Another optional category of bonds would pay neither interest nor principal for the first five years, then make cash interest payments until maturity, when the holders would get their principal back. Those bonds would allow Prepa to conserve even more cash over the next five years, but they would involve more risk for investors and would therefore offer a higher yield.Stephen Spencer of the investment bank Houlihan Lokey, which advised the bondholders, said the deal was structured to produce savings that the utility could use to get back on its feet.Ms. Acosta of the Government Development Bank said the Prepa deal represented \u201cthe type of equitable burden sharing\u201d that would ultimately \u201ccontribute to the Commonwealth\u2019s ongoing economic recovery.\u201dThe negotiations for Prepa\u2019s restructuring have been going on for more than a year. The participating bondholders included mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutions that hold about 35 percent of Prepa\u2019s debt. Individual \u201cretail\u201d bondholders did not participate directly, but the agreement includes an option with terms intended to attract risk-averse small investors. If all of them decide to participate, roughly 80 percent of Prepa\u2019s debt would ultimately be restructured.The details are not final, but the restructuring is expected to include a cash tender facility that would give risk-averse small investors a way to redeem their bonds for cash, instead of new Prepa bonds. The loss in that case would be bigger \u2014 perhaps 35 percent \u2014 but small investors frightened by Puerto Rico\u2019s recent financial turbulence might welcome the chance to cash out, even at such a loss.Prepa said on Wednesday that negotiations with its bond insurers, MBIA and Assured Guaranty, and with the banks that finance its purchases of fuel, would continue.Advertisement"}

But unlike almost everything else that propels the cars, the fuel that feeds the world\u2019s most powerful and cleanest hybrid engines is a surprisingly discrete partner in the series.Amid all the public and media scrutiny of Formula One drivers, tires, aerodynamics and engines, the gasolines from Total, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas that fuel the 6-cylinder, 1.6-liter V6 hybrid turbo engines are rarely mentioned \u2014 unless something goes wrong.For Sebastian Vettel, the four-time world champion Ferrari driver who is in third place in the series heading into the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend, not hearing about the fuel means that everything must be all right.\u201cIt\u2019s good news if I don\u2019t have to think about it,\u201d Vettel said on a recent visit to his Ferrari team\u2019s Shell Oil fuel laboratory, which is set up at the back of the Italian team\u2019s garage at every race.Before he started racing in Formula One in 2007, Vettel said his relationship with what in the series is generally called fuel was limited to the way it tasted when he was starting out in his career at go-karting tracks in Germany.\u201cI had a lot of fuel in my mouth,\u201d he recalled. \u201cYou know, when you have to get the fuel from the tank to the carburetor and you suck it in a tube? When it went wrong, obviously you ended up with a lot of fuel in your mouth.\u201dBut behind the scenes in Formula One, forget about anything as haphazard as sucking on a fuel hose. The taste of success is all that counts for the various fuel providers.Since the introduction of the new hybrid engine last year, instead of the old \u201ctire war\u201d between the tire providers for the series (when there was more than one), there is now a largely unspoken \u201cfuel war.\u201d And that battle actually has more of an effect on the family road car than the tire rivalries ever did.In fact, the role of the fuel providers grew exponentially behind the scenes as soon as the new engine formula was established in 2011.\u201cOur scientists sat down with their engineers when the engine was still a drawing on a piece of paper,\u201d said Ian Albiston, the Shell Oil Formula One project manager, who attends all of the races and manages the oil company\u2019s fuel preparation at the track.The same is true for the Mercedes team, which is currently dominating the championship and whose engines use fuel from the Malaysian oil company Petronas.\u201cWhen we first joined Mercedes as a partner, it was when the V8 architecture was in place, and the fuel appetite of the engine was pretty much set in stone,\u201d said Adrian Bell, Petronas\u2019s track-side technical engineer. \u201cThere were limits to what we could do to provide performance gains.\u201d\u201cWith the new V6 engine,\u201d he added, \u201cthat has enabled us to work right from the beginning hand-in-glove with Mercedes engineers to develop products which give best performance \u2014 and engine hardware, gearbox hardware that can give best performance \u2014 and as an energy company providing lubricants and fuels, our formulations experts can come up with formulations that we know can provide benefits.\u201dHe said this involved modifying some aspects of the engine to fit seamlessly with the fuel or oil provided by Petronas, thus producing optimal engine performance.The move to new hybrid technology with turbo engines was a boon for scientists at the oil companies, providing an opportunity to work with engine manufacturers to develop new fuel formulas.Each company has dozens of scientists who work on the Formula One program \u2014 and on the road car program \u2014 to create fuels that will be cleaner, more efficient and, therefore, faster. Also, because Formula One teams are allowed to use only four engines for the full 19-race season, it is essential that the engine not be gummed up with dirty fuel or engine oil in order to perform at its highest level in each race.Shell has more than 50 scientists working on the program at a factory in Hamburg, Germany, while Petronas scientists work on the fuel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and on the lubricant oil in Turin, Italy.Although the biggest change in Formula One in recent years has been the development of new hybrid engines, the previous revolution for the fuel providers came when the International Automobile Federation, the sport\u2019s governing body, ordered that Formula One engine fuel had to be the same as that used in a road car.That rule has been in place for 20 years, with benzenes, toluenes and other chemical additives banned. But Formula One\u2019s V10 and then V8 engines had barely changed from their traditional, normally aspirated state over the years, and the oil companies had little room to innovate. Today, however, with the introduction of hybrid power units that use internal combustion turbo engines as well as heat and kinetic energy systems to power the car, the series has become a laboratory for development of fuels for tomorrow\u2019s road car.\u201cWith modern road cars and modern legislation, fuel economy is very important and reduced emissions are very important, and those two go hand in hand,\u201d said Bell, the Petronas engineer. \u201cAnd with modern-day Formula One racing fuel, economy is one of the prime concerns for us. We have gone from close to 300 kilos of fuel for a race 20 years ago, to 100 kilos today.\u201d\u201cSo everything we are doing to make the fuel burn more efficiently, provide more power for a given quantity of fuel, better economy, better engine cleanliness, and working together with the engine manufacturers to come up with designs that make better use of the fuel \u2014 all of that technology is being passed directly to the road cars because it is directly relevant to road cars,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody is concerned about the cost of the fuel these days. Everyone is concerned about the environment.\u201dThe harsh and competitive nature of Formula One racing drives the quick development of fuel, Albiston said.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have access to these engines \u2014 whether they are here or on the bench in Maranello \u2014 to create a new fuel from scratch may take four or five years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can try it on the bench engines in Maranello, get the data back, and then feed it back to the commercial programs, then it really does give us an ideal vehicle for transferring technology very quickly from track to road.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s the real advantage and competitive edge that it gives not just Ferrari at the racetrack, but gives us in our commercial programs,\u201d Albiston added.Shell scientists in Hamburg devote 21,000 annual man-hours to developing fuel for the series. But for Shell, he said, Formula One is also a marketing tool to sell road car customers the fuel that wins a Grand Prix race, and involvement in the series facilitates team-building and fosters motivation within the company.According to Istvan Kapitany, Shell\u2019s executive vice president for retailing on the marketing side, customers who buy the higher grade oil, the Shell V-Power \u2014 to which the Formula One program has most directly contributed \u2014 are among the most loyal to the company, and they tend to decide to invest in the higher-grade fuel based on such factors as the company\u2019s involvement in Formula One.Kapitany said that Shell invited the company\u2019s top-performing gas station attendants to attend Formula One races to watch the fuel in action, and even to meet the drivers.That\u2019s where Vettel comes back into the picture, letting it be known that the fuel indeed makes a noticeable difference. In fact, since the beginning of the season, Ferrari has measured an increase of at least 40 horsepower thanks to Shell developments.\u201cYou do feel a difference from one fuel to another \u2014 that is how powerful that it can be,\u201d Vettel said. \u201cAnd I think Ferrari is lucky. Shell is doing a lot of work and has brought significant performance to the car.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hossein Sajedinia, was quoted by the semiofficial Islamic Students News Agency as saying that garments imprinted with \u201csatanic symbols\u201d had been seized from stores in Tehran.The fiercest criticism aimed at the government, which negotiated the nuclear deal, came from General Jafari, Iran\u2019s most important military figure.Not directly addressing President Rouhani\u2019s administration at first, the general was quoted by Fars as saying that the \u201cassumptions by some,\u201d thinking the enmity of the United States has ended, are a \u201cmain reason for concern.\u201d\u201cWhat causes even greater concern is that with this simple-minded attitude these people believe that we need to choose another path and should change our behavior,\u201d he was quoted as saying.The nuclear agreement, reached in July between Iran and six world powers including the United States, will end most sanctions on Iran in exchange for verifiable guarantees that Iranian nuclear activities remain peaceful.For hard-liners in Iran like General Jafari, the agreement represents a loss of power to supporters of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government. Iran has scheduled parliamentary elections for February 2016 and the government is still riding a wave of success over the prospect of sanctions relief.Attention in Iran is starting to turn to domestic politics, with supporters of Mr. Rouhani expecting him to proceed with more economic changes and personal freedoms. Hard-liners seem intent on trying to block him.General Jafari, in his quoted remarks on Tuesday before a group of military figures, told them to prepare for new American threats, and he advised the government of Mr. Rouhani to do the same.\u201cThe enemy has now resorted to using soft political and economic power,\u201d he said of the United States, alluding to the sanctions and the nuclear deal. \u201cThe answer to these kinds of threats after the deal could be for the government of the Islamic Republic to adopt a revolutionary and clearer stance.\u201dMr. Jafari and military commanders have shown concern over possible constraints on Iran\u2019s missile program, under a provision of the nuclear agreement. In line with earlier United Nations Security Council sanctions, the agreement calls for limits on the missiles, which are regarded as vital to Iran\u2019s military strategy.Mr. Jafari said the range of missiles \u2014 now 2,000 kilometers, about 1,242 miles \u2014 would be increased. He also announced 20 military drills, but did not mention whether those would involve new missile tests. He also stressed that the Revolutionary Guards would stay involved in the economy as well.\u201cAfter over 20 years of engagement in civilian projects, the Revolutionary Guards Corps has enough experience in and we will continue our projects,\u201d he said.The public display of military defiance was not unexpected, given the influence the Revolutionary Guards have amassed over the decades of anti-American animosity.\u201cOur commanders will refuse any influence by the United States in our country,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst. \u201cToday they showed the enemy will never be able to limit our capabilities and resolve.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A number of books published recently suggest that creativity has the same holistic benefits as a weekend at Canyon Ranch Resort and Spa, boosting self-esteem and relieving stress. Zentangle, say practitioners, is helpful too as a dieting aid. Even the well-regarded Mayo Clinic recommends the benefits of painting and ceramics. In a recent four-year study, it reported that people who took up creative activities in middle age were less likely to suffer memory loss.Of course some companies have embraced creativity as a marketing gimmick. On a recent trip to Venice, Calif., I visited a pop-up shop \u2014 half workshop, half store \u2014 for a new lifestyle brand called \u201c5 Points\u201d that offered customers \u201cways to bring the benefits of creativity into the world.\u201d The small space included a near-empty wall set up for would-be artists. But the store mostly was crowded with shoppers buying stuff other people made. As if to underscore creativity\u2019s consumer appeal, a patio across the street next to a clothing boutique had a sign that beckoned, \u201cWelcome to our creative oasis.\u201dRebecca Saletan, editorial director of Riverhead Books, which is publishing Ms. Gilbert\u2019s latest work, said the collision of reader interest in self-help and happiness is fueling interest in books like Ms. Gilbert\u2019s. Despite the recovering economy, many people are still stuck in jobs they don\u2019t love. As a result, she said, they are seeking fulfillment elsewhere. Other titles published recently include Elle Luna\u2019s \u201cThe Crossroads of Should and Must\u201d and \u201cThe Book of Doing and Being: Rediscovering Creativity in Life, Love and Work,\u201d written by the producer Barnet Bain.\u201cWe\u2019ve been given license to pursue what people once called trivial pursuits,\u201d said Ms. Saletan. \u201cPeople want to keep some sense of themselves, their soulful spirit, alive.\u201dMore than a year ago, I indulged my own \u201ctrivial pursuits\u201d during a yearlong fellowship where I studied digital storytelling and creativity. The idea was to bring new skills back to the office. I learned video and was the director of cinematography of a student horror film. I took voice acting classes. My artistic enthusiasm was boundless. Guests wouldn\u2019t leave my house after a dinner party one night, so I offered them blank postcards and colored pencils and asked them to draw. When I got back to New York last summer, I wrote a proposal for a creativity festival I wanted to produce. I, too, started a creativity club with friends. We talk almost every Sunday via telephone and explore ways to rouse our imaginations.Of course, seeking a more creative life is hardly a new idea. Robert Henri, the famous teacher at the Art Students League of New York, counseled painters and sculptors in the 1920s that artful living was as much attitude as practice. His notes were published in the book \u201cThe Art Spirit.\u201d And Julia Cameron has schooled two generations of aspiring artists in \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,\u201d which was first published in 1992. If there is any doubt about its relevance today among baby boomers, consider this: Ms. Cameron is publishing \u201cIt\u2019s Never Too Late to Begin Again: Creativity in the Golden Years\u201d next year.Choosing to be more creatively focused, though, can be disturbing at first. Ms. Cameron argues in \u201cThe Artist\u2019s Way\u201d that it can upend the delicate balance of relationships. \u201cMany of us find that we have squandered our own creative energies by investing disproportionately in the lives, hopes, dreams and plans of others,\u201d she writes. Others perceive a creative life as a quit-your-job-or-nothing proposition. They \u201clike to think they are looking at changing their whole lives in one fell swoop,\u201d Ms. Cameron writes, adding that, in \u201cfantasizing about pursuing our art full time, we fail to pursue it part time \u2014 or at all.\u201dIndeed, many people aren\u2019t interested in a wholesale career switch. Instead they are simply seeking a respite from a harried work and home life. It is one reason adult coloring books are popular, and Ms. Basford\u2019s intricately designed pages are a favorite in bookshops and craft stores like Papyrus and Paper Source, a mecca for middle-aged do-it-yourselfers and journal keepers.\u201cIt speaks to what we loved to do as kids,\u201d said Meg Leder, executive editor of Penguin Books, which is publishing Ms. Basford\u2019s next title. She gets as many as eight pitches a day for new coloring books, up from one a month a year ago. \u201cThere are a number of coloring books that are meant to be calming. People are promoting it as mindfulness meets crafting,\u201d Ms. Leder said, explaining that she dabbles in the occasional coloring break herself.CREATIVITY is marketed as a model for self-fulfillment and a way to get ahead. But the communal aspect is appealing, too. On Saturday nights, adults often gather at the Make Meaning studio on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side to paint ceramic mugs and listen to music while sipping beer and wine. \u201cPeople want to walk away with something, the idea that, \u2018I made this,\u2019 \u201d said Amy Kotulski, the chief operating officer of Make Meaning. Since her company\u2019s opening in 2010, Ms. Kotulski said, at least 20 percent of its planned events have been for adults, a surprising turn.Make Meaning recently hosted an event for a public relations firm that was rebranding Lean Cuisine\u2019s spa food. Participants were asked to take a quiz and create a colorful painting based on a chakra symbol. The goal, Ms. Kotulski said, was to connect employees to one another and motivate new thinking about selling frozen food. \u201cPeople are walking a line between inspiration and aspiration,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is O.K. to be creative and not be a child.\u201dA reporter on the features staff of The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Export Data Points to a Deepening Industrial Downturn", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s industrial slowdown is showing signs of worsening, as the country\u2019s trade slump deepened further in August in the face of weaker demand from overseas buyers.Once seemingly indomitable as the world\u2019s workshop, China is now facing its most protracted decline since the global financial crisis. Overseas shipments fell 5.5 percent last month compared with a year earlier. That has dragged total exports 1.4 percent lower in dollar terms in the first eight months of the year.At the same time, China\u2019s imports are falling even more sharply, declining last month for the 10th month in a row, with a drop of 14 percent by value.Economists say sharp drops in global prices for commodities like oil and industrial metals have propelled the decline in import value. But the sheer volume of imports of crucial industrial raw materials like coal, iron ore, copper, aluminum and steel has also fallen this year. The declines are a clear sign of weakening domestic demand in China as a slump in manufacturing and new housing construction drag on economic growth.Beck Cai, a sales manager at the Shanghai Steel Fashion Industrial Company, a manufacturer and exporter of prefabricated steel structures, said his company\u2019s business in August dipped as much as 40 percent compared with a year earlier.\u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the way we operate; it is mainly that the overall environment is slowing down,\u201d Mr. Cai said. \u201cAs far as the recent devaluation of the renminbi, it is still too early to tell how it will impact our business.\u201dChina\u2019s leadership last month made the surprise decision to devalue the currency by about 3 percent, the renminbi\u2019s sharpest drop in two decades. But China\u2019s central bank has since intervened on a huge scale, propping up the currency further by selling dollars for renminbi.Still, analysts say the recent devaluation was probably too small to help China\u2019s exports.\u201cThe renminbi has appreciated substantially in real effective terms against a basket of currencies in the past year, which in relative terms makes China\u2019s exports less competitive than in the past,\u201d Ding Shuang, the head of greater China economic research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an email. \u201cBut China still registered a huge trade surplus and there is no reason for significant devaluation against most currencies.\u201d China\u2019s trade surplus with the rest of the world has surged, rising to $365 billion in the first eight months of the year. This is because imports are declining more sharply than exports.But the trade surplus also helps soften the blow of investors\u2019 withdrawing money from China with expectations that the renminbi will weaken further.Analysts at Nomura calculate the pressure on China\u2019s currency to weaken is stronger now than at any time since 1994, when the country adopted its modern exchange rate system and devalued the currency by a third.\u201cGiven the Chinese economy\u2019s weak growth and deep-seated structural challenges, we expect renminbi depreciation pressure to remain,\u201d the Nomura analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday. \u201cHowever, unlike in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we expect this pressure to be moderate and prolonged, rather than sudden and severe.\u201dOne potential complication in the August trade figures may be the exchange rate used by the customs administration. The administration said exports totaled $196.883 billion in dollar terms and 1.204 trillion renminbi in local currency terms.The reason for the discrepancy was unclear. But it raised the possibility that China\u2019s actual decline in exports in renminbi terms was not as bad as the 6.1 percent decrease reported \u2014 or that the real decline in dollar terms might have been worse than the 5.5 percent drop reported.Representatives of the customs administration\u2019s press office could not be reached for comment after normal working hours.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wrath of Volkswagen\u2019s Drivers", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deception could prove a major threat to Volkswagen\u2019s reputation in the United States and could break the trust that the German automaker had cultivated with car owners over the years. It could also have lasting consequences for the future of diesel-powered technology championed by Volkswagen, which has been seeking to make a comeback in the United States.On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would order Volkswagen to recall nearly 500,000 vehicles in the United States because they were equipped with software that allowed them to evade emissions standards for reducing smog during testing. No recall has been ordered yet, however, until Volkswagen can outline how it intends to fix the problem.But whatever the technological solution, it will most likely mean reducing the performance, drivability or fuel economy of cars to meet emission goals.In the meantime, car owners must reconcile what they thought they had bought with the revelation that their diesel cars emit from 10 to 40 times more pollutants than advertised.\u201cI feel totally ripped off,\u201d said John Decker, 55, a photographer from Sacramento, who owns a 2013 Jetta SportWagen with the diesel engine. \u201cIt just reeks of fraud and that they intentionally misled the buyers of their vehicles into thinking these were clean diesels, environmentally good cars, that were fun to drive.\u201dMore than any other automaker, Volkswagen had tried to win American consumers back to diesel cars, and erase memories of unreliable, polluting cars that spewed clouds of smoke and had trouble starting in winter weather. Unlike Europe, where about half the passenger vehicles sold run on diesel, such cars account for fewer than 1 percent of new car sales in the United States. Most of those vehicles are sold by Volkswagen.When new emissions standards were introduced in 2009, Volkswagen was the first major carmaker to offer vehicles that could meet the new rules. In August, diesel sales accounted for 23 percent of all cars sold by Volkswagen in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s a new level of cynicism in the auto industry,\u201d said Jack R. Nerad, executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cWe have seen honest mistakes and lapses of judgment before, and tragic things happening, but this strikes me as different. The intent from the beginning seemed to be to evade standard norms.\u201dIn growing numbers, automakers have been adding a diesel option in their lineup, marketing the vehicles as \u201cclean diesels\u201d that promise better fuel economy and faster acceleration.Diesel cars are now offered by BMW, General Motors, Jeep, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz. While Japanese makers have pursued electric-hybrid technology instead of diesel, Mazda said it would offer a diesel version of its Mazda 6 sedan at some point.What makes the diesel revival possible are advances in systems that can reduce tailpipe emissions, which are generally higher for diesel than for gasoline engines. Those systems work by combining the fuel with an additive that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxide, one of diesel engines\u2019 main and most harmful byproducts.\u201cIt was kind of slushy on the road; it wasn\u2019t very peppy,\u201d Mr. Decker said.When he tried the Volkswagen diesel, he was enchanted with how much fun it was to drive, including the engine\u2019s quick response and the sporty handling. The government\u2019s rating for fuel economy was far less than the Prius got: 29 miles per gallon city and 39 m.p.g. highway with the automatic transmission. But he was sold on the Volkswagen.\u201cIt was pretty powerful and pretty fast, and now I know why: It is because they are not controlling emissions,\u201d Mr. Decker said.Now, that fun-to-drive factor has lost its appeal, he said.\u201cIf the reason they are fun to drive is that they are spewing up to 40 times the amount of pollutants they are supposed to be, I just find it outrageous, frankly,\u201d he said.Volkswagen will be required to fix the emissions system so it complies with federal regulations, though the exact remedy has not been announced.But Mr. Decker says that he worries the engine may lose power or have drivability problems, and that he is sure the fuel economy will drop.\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they can get that emissions under control and still have the performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why they did this in the first place.\u201dSo, for now he no longer wants the diesel-powered car. He thinks Volkswagen should buy it back.And like other owners, he wonders what will happen next. The deception is certain to lead to a lot of customer lawsuits from angry drivers. On Monday, one Seattle-based law firm said it had already filed a class-action suit on behalf of car owners accusing Volkswagen of fraud, false advertising and violating consumer rights.However, they said, automakers are given \u201ca reasonable amount of time\u201d to engineer a remedy, and \u201cdepending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components, it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan and issue recall notices.\u201dVolkswagen will pay for the repair, but it was not known how long it would take the automaker to fix almost half a million vehicles once the recall begins.John Schilling, a Volkswagen spokesman, said in an email that it was unclear how long it would take to start fixing vehicles, but that the automaker was \u201ccommitted to fixing this issue as soon as possible\u201d and to developing \u201ca remedy that meets emissions standards and satisfies our loyal and valued customers.\u201dThe E.P.A. said Volkswagen owners should simply continue to use their vehicles, which it said were safe to drive.Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, said it was in Volkswagen\u2019s best interest to fix the problem quickly, before it loses its customer base for good. In the meantime, she said, consumers should wait before trying to sell their diesel-powered vehicles since their resale value will most likely drop before a fix is announced.\u201cOf course, owners who bought these diesel vehicles in part because of any environmental benefits may have moral objections to driving them, and they may feel they have no other option but to keep their cars parked for the time being,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cAnd then there are owners who just feel flat-out deceived and will want their money back.\u201cBut until Volkswagen reveals a plan for how they will either buy back the cars or fix them so that they truly meet emissions standards, all affected owners will have to wait and see.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Boehner Fades Away", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after the 2010 election, I encountered Representative John A. Boehner in the Capitol Building. His party had just won a majority in the House, which meant he would soon become speaker. Though he\u2019s a Republican and I was a longtime Democratic staff member, we got along well. \u201cJust wait,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn six months, I\u2019ll be more popular in your caucus than in mine.\u201dThe following spring, he and I met at a reception in his conference room. I reminded him of his earlier prediction. \u201cHow\u2019s that going for you?\u201d I inquired. In his typical droll style, he replied, \u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m getting there.\u201dFinally, he decided to quit trying. On Friday, a day after hosting Pope Francis, Mr. Boehner announced that he\u2019s outta here at the end of October: out of the speaker\u2019s office, out of Congress, out of the perpetual backstabbing among his \u201cgood friends\u201d in the G.O.P. conference. And though the timing of his announcement caught most people by surprise, no one thought he was long for the job. It never really fit him, and for all his affable coolness under fire, he was never completely comfortable with it.Mr. Boehner was always a bit miscast for the head of the House Republican Conference he came to lead. He was willing to employ much of the harsh partisan rhetoric of the Tea Party, but he was also prepared \u2014 as a speaker must be \u2014 to negotiate with the other party when he saw fit.Another problem was follow-through. When White House staffers called me in 2010 to ask, based on my years of interaction with Mr. Boehner, how to deal with the incoming speaker, I counseled them, \u201cBoehner loves to cut deals, but he never can deliver the Republicans to pass them.\u201dInvariably, he would have to come to the Democrats because a sizable chunk of his conference would reject the agreement he had negotiated, giving leverage to the White House and the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi. Indeed, virtually every continuing resolution, debt ceiling increase, tax extender or other must-pass bill over the last five years has required from 30 to 50 Democrats to overcome the deficit Mr. Boehner chronically encountered among his own members.Mr. Boehner\u2019s handicap with his troops was never more evident than in the fall of 2008, as the crisis on Wall Street threatened to crater the economy and Republican political hopes in the coming election. Mr. Boehner and his leadership posse \u2014 Eric Cantor, Roy D. Blunt and others \u2014 engaged in furious negotiations with the Bush White House and congressional Democrats to fashion a rescue bill, and had to swallow tough provisions Ms. Pelosi insisted upon, like requiring repayment of the taxpayer bailout with interest.He promised to deliver 100 votes to support his own president\u2019s bill, and he went to the House floor and, in tears, pleaded with his conference to accept the \u201ccrap sandwich\u201d he had negotiated. In typical fashion, Republicans voted \u201cno\u201d and the first bailout bill failed; when it was soon resurrected, following the stock market\u2019s 777-point plunge, Mr. Boehner still could not deliver the promised G.O.P. votes.Mr. Boehner\u2019s problem has been that he was positioned incorrectly within the Republican conference. Unlike Ms. Pelosi, whose unimpeachable liberal credentials enable her to pressure her caucus hard-liners into accepting bills on which they have deep reservations \u2014 health care, Wall Street reform, the 2013 tax extenders, continuing resolutions \u2014 Mr. Boehner has no such influence with his hard-liners. They do not believe they owe their seats to him, they do not believe he is genuinely sympathetic to the Tea Party cause and they could not care less if they create chaos that diminishes the stature of government.I am not suggesting that Mr. Boehner is a secret moderate. But based on years of fairly close observation, I think he lacks the blood lust that courses through so many in the G.O.P. ranks. He enjoys legislating, he likes politicians; he wants to succeed, albeit very much on his own terms. And he has a personable, thoughtful side that endears him to political adversaries and supporters alike, a contrast to the bombastic, tiresome nihilists who have driven him out of Congress. As chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, he once stopped a hearing to recognize my young son, Sam, who had just recorded his first hit in Little League. I am not sure a hard-liner like Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas would do that for the son of the Democratic staff director.Mr. Boehner still has not achieved his prediction of being more popular in the Democratic Caucus than among his fellow Republicans, but he obviously has tired of being a pincushion for the No Caucus. As was inevitable, he will cut his deal with Ms. Pelosi on a continuing budget resolution, there will be no language to ban funding for Planned Parenthood, and the latest shutdown crisis will fade away. And so will he.John Lawrence, a visiting professor at the University of California, Washington Center, worked in the House of Representatives for 38 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen C.E.O. Martin Winterkorn Resigns Amid Emissions Scandal", "Date": "2015-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Mr. Winterkorn, who had run the company since 2007, continued to insist that he had personally committed no misconduct. \u201cI am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part,\u201d he said.Separately, representatives of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board said they would refer the case to the German authorities for possible criminal prosecution. But they also said they did not believe that Mr. Winterkorn had any knowledge of the software.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.An executive committee of the supervisory board did not immediately name a successor. As Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s status came into doubt in recent days, speculation in German news media has focused on Matthias M\u00fcller, who is in charge of the division of Volkswagen that makes Porsche sports cars.Another potential candidate, according to news media reports, is Rupert Stadler, head of the company\u2019s Audi division. If Volkswagen brings in an outsider, one oft-mentioned person is Wolfgang Bernhard, the head of the trucks division at Daimler, who earlier in his career was a top manager at Volkswagen.Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s resignation was announced after a daylong meeting of the executive committee, which includes the company\u2019s main shareholders.\u201cIn the view of the executive committee, criminal proceedings may be relevant due to the irregularities,\u201d the panel said in a statement. It said that Volkswagen would cooperate fully with any investigation.Mr. Winterkorn, the panel also said, \u201chad no knowledge of the manipulation of emissions data.\u201dThat statement raised the question of why Mr. Winterkorn needed to resign if he had not known about the manipulation. One answer might be that Volkswagen has long been known as a top-down organization, where even relatively minor decisions require approval from the high-rise executive office building, topped by a giant VW logo, that looms over the company\u2019s vast main factory in Wolfsburg, Germany. Volkswagen\u2019s command-and-control structure probably made it difficult for Mr. Winterkorn to escape responsibility, even if there was no direct culpability. Critics, including management experts and analysts, have long faulted what they say is a company culture that hampers internal communication and may discourage midlevel managers from delivering bad news.\u201cFor something of this magnitude, one would expect that the C.E.O. would know, and if he doesn\u2019t know, then he\u2019s willfully ignorant,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Thinnes, a former Daimler executive who works as a consultant for European companies on compliance and ethics issues.Volkswagen, he said, should have had a system in place to ensure that something that exposed the company to so much risk came to the attention of top management.\u201cIt could well be he didn\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Thinnes said of Mr. Winterkorn. \u201cBut when it\u2019s risk-related, the information needs to get to the right people at the right place at the right time.\u201dIn the German news media on Wednesday, there was already speculation that the scandal would force Volkswagen to decentralize authority and make changes that the critics say are long overdue.Volkswagen shares, which rose on Wednesday after two days of steep declines, closed 5 percent higher in Germany. But they were still about 30 percent below the closing price in Frankfurt on Friday, before the Obama administration told the automaker to recall nearly a half-million cars over the test-rigging software.Even before Volkswagen\u2019s executive committee said it would refer the case to the authorities, state prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters, said in a statement that they were exploring whether there were grounds to begin a criminal investigation against unidentified company employees suspected of being responsible for installing the software to manipulate the test results.Even before Mr. Winterkorn resigned, there was growing concern in Germany on Wednesday that the scandal could damage the country\u2019s economy, which revolves around the auto industry. Volkswagen is one of its biggest companies, employing 274,000 people at 29 German factories, and it is already struggling with high labor costs. That figure does not count the tens of thousands of people employed in Germany by Volkswagen suppliers.\u201cWhile the German economy defied Greece, the euro crisis and the Chinese slowdown, it could now be facing the biggest downside risk in a long while,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING-DiBa bank in Germany, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe irony of all of this is that the threat could now come from the inside, rather than from the outside.\u201dThe regulator for the German stock market, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, said that it had begun an inquiry into what it described as unusual price movements in Volkswagen shares in recent days. The authority, known by its German acronym BaFin, said it was also examining whether Volkswagen had notified shareholders soon enough of its problems in the United States.As in the United States, German companies are required to advise shareholders of information that could affect stock prices, and face fines and shareholder lawsuits if they do not.The Volkswagen scandal has already raised questions in Europe about the accuracy of emissions testing, putting other automakers on the defensive. Environmental groups have long complained that existing tests understate the amount of pollution that cars generate under real driving conditions.On Wednesday, a European Parliament committee took steps to speed the adoption of rules that would require cars to be tested on roads rather than in testing centers.Some other European carmakers that have struggled for market share against Volkswagen, including Ford, Fiat and the Opel unit of General Motors, might view the scandal as an opportunity to gain ground against the company, which sells more cars in Europe than any other manufacturer.German criminal law does not allow for a company to be held responsible for crimes, but proceedings can be pursued against people believed to have been responsible. Part of the mission of a preliminary investigation like the one begun by prosecutors in Braunschweig is to identify who might have been responsible for wrongdoing.Mr. Winterkorn may yet be called to answer for Volkswagen, unless others are found to have been directly involved in the development or installation of the software.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin and Nicola Clark from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rage of the Bankers", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week the Federal Reserve chose not to raise interest rates. It was the right decision. In fact, I\u2019m among the economists wondering why we\u2019re even thinking about raising rates right now.But the financial industry\u2019s response may explain what\u2019s going on. You see, the Fed talks a lot to bankers \u2014 and bankers reacted to its decision with sheer, unadulterated rage. For those trying to understand the political economy of monetary policy, it was an \u201cAha!\u201d moment. Suddenly, a lot of what has been puzzling about the discussion makes sense: just follow the money.It\u2019s true that rates \u2014 near zero for the short-term interest rates the Fed controls more or less directly \u2014 are very low by historical standards. And it\u2019s interesting to ask why the economy seems to need such low rates. But all the evidence says that it does. Again, if you think that rates are much too low, where\u2019s the inflation?Yet the Fed has faced constant criticism for its low-rate policy. Why?I suppose this latest excuse for raising rates could be right. But it\u2019s striking how convoluted and dubious the case for rate hikes has become. I like to think of it this way: if left-leaning politicians were to offer rationales for their policies that were this dependent on shaky logic and weak evidence, they would be lambasted for their irresponsibility. Why does anyone take this stuff seriously?Many people have been led astray here by trying to figure out whether easy money is good or bad for wealthy people in general. That\u2019s actually a complicated question. What\u2019s clear, however, is that low rates are bad for bankers.The appropriate response of policy makers to this observation should be, \u201cSo?\u201d There\u2019s no reason to believe that what\u2019s good for bankers is good for America. But bankers are different from you and me: they have a lot more influence. Monetary officials meet with them all the time, and in many cases expect to join their ranks when they come out on the other side of the revolving door. Also, it\u2019s widely assumed that bankers have special expertise on economic policy, although nothing in the record supports this belief. (The bankers do, however, have excellent tailors.)But the Fed did the right thing last week: nothing. And the howling of the bankers should be taken not as a reason to reconsider, but as a demonstration that the clamor for higher rates has nothing to do with the public interest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Chinese Climate Change Negotiators to Meet in Los Angeles", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat announcement by the world\u2019s two biggest greenhouse gas polluters was seen as a breakthrough after decades of deadlock on efforts to forge an effective global accord on climate change. Now Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi are pushing for completion of such a deal, signed by every nation on earth, at a United Nations summit meeting in Paris this fall.White House officials said Tuesday\u2019s meeting was intended to demonstrate that both countries were moving forward to meet the terms of their agreement. Last month, Mr. Obama unveiled a sweeping regulation aimed at forcing heavily polluting power plants to cut emissions, and the United States and China have submitted details of their national plans to the United Nations.\u201cLast year was about the U.S. and China making those commitments,\u201d Mr. Deese said. \u201cThis year, having made those commitments, needs to be a year of implementation, as our two countries demonstrate commitment to implement those goals with concrete steps.\u201dOther states, including nine in the Northeast, also have cap-and-trade programs, but Republicans and some Democrats in Congress have successfully pushed against a national system. In its submission to the United Nations, the Chinese government noted that it was considering a national cap-and-trade system, and seven Chinese provinces have pilot programs.On Tuesday, the two nations announced an arrangement between government entities in China and California to begin working toward devising cap-and-trade programs in China. Several American climate policy experts have said they envision a future in which California\u2019s cap-and-trade market could be linked with China\u2019s regional cap-and-trade markets.In addition, the leaders of 11 Chinese cities, including Beijing, announced plans to reach their emissions peak earlier than the national target of 2030. Combined, those cities have the same annual level of emissions as Brazil or Japan, according to White House officials. Ten cities from China will team with 10 from California in a separate initiative that aims to reduce air pollution and attract clean-technology industries.The meeting was attended by Todd Stern, the United States\u2019 senior climate change negotiator, and Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s special representative for climate change affairs, as well as American mayors and governors, Chinese mayors and other municipal leaders, and Chinese climate change officials.While the United States, China and more than 40 other countries have submitted their plans to cut carbon pollution ahead of the Paris meeting, other major polluters, including India and Brazil, have yet to do so. United Nations officials have said that for the Paris deal to work, the plans must be submitted by October.In Washington, Republican leaders are working to block the deal. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has begun reaching out to other countries to tell them that he is doing all he can to halt Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change regulations, and thus prevent the United States from meeting its United Nations obligation.Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, is also working to block the deal, saying the United States would be forced to cut its emissions while China\u2019s pollution would continue unabated. Asked this summer about the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to enact a national cap-and-trade program, including the pilot programs already in place, Mr. Inhofe replied, \u201cThey\u2019re lying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Investigating Contract Awards in Buffalo Turnaround Project", "Date": "2015-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors investigating Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s marquee program to revitalize Buffalo\u2019s economy have been examining how the government-funded projects were awarded, and whether state elected officials played a role in choosing who would benefit from the major infusion of funds.People with knowledge of the subpoena to SUNY Polytechnic, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, described its contents in detail to The New York Times.One area of interest, according to these people, was a 2013 request for proposals that was written in a way that would have disqualified many possible bidders, and favored a construction company whose chief executive had donated tens of thousands of dollars to Mr. Cuomo. The subpoena also sought information about the hiring of staff members who would develop requests for proposals and distribute funds for Buffalo Billion projects.The subpoena, issued on June 26, provides the most detailed look yet at the investigation\u2019s scope, and listed the possible crimes that are the subject of the inquiry: mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.The inquiry is another attempt to target corruption in state government by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who, in 2014, opened an investigation into Mr. Cuomo\u2019s decision to shut down the Moreland Commission, an anticorruption panel. This year, he has brought cases against the leaders of both houses of New York\u2019s Legislature, Assemblyman Sheldon Silver and Senator Dean G. Skelos.The subpoena to SUNY Polytechnic indicated that at least three state-funded projects from the Buffalo Billion are of interest to federal authorities.One is the governor\u2019s flagship Buffalo project, a solar panel factory for SolarCity, whose chairman is Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors. Mr. Cuomo has pledged to invest $750 million on this, and claimed it would create 5,000 jobs, 3,000 of which would be in western New York. Construction of this facility is underway, and it could open in early 2016, officials have said.Federal authorities have also asked for records related to a Buffalo pharmaceutical research center and an information technology facility for IBM.It is difficult to gauge the current status of the investigation or measure its progress since the subpoenas were issued because grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret. Mr. Bharara\u2019s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, John P. L. Kelly, said the governor\u2019s office had not received a subpoena in connection with the inquiry. He declined to comment further.The subpoena to SUNY Polytechnic specifically asks for records related to \u201cany application to and or provision of funding from the Empire State Development Corporation,\u201d one of the people briefed on the matter said.In a statement issued Sunday, SUNY Polytechnic expressed confidence in the integrity of the bidding process and asserted that Empire State Development provided oversight for the Buffalo projects. Previously, the institute has said that to its knowledge, neither it nor any of its employees have been the target of any investigation.In July, Empire State Development\u2019s board authorized hiring the law firm WilmerHale \u201cin connection with an external investigation,\u201d according to the minutes from the board\u2019s meeting. The board authorized up to $200,000 for the legal expenses.Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said projects administered by the agency had \u201cmultiple protections to ensure accountability and transparency.\u201d He declined to answer questions about the subpoena or the hiring of WilmerHale. The subpoena to SUNY Polytechnic directed the institution to respond to a senior criminal investigator who has worked on some of Mr. Bharara\u2019s highest-profile corruption cases, including the pending case against Mr. Silver, the former Assembly speaker.Fort Schuyler later changed the requirement to 15 years and attributed the \u201c50 years\u201d figure to a \u201ctypographical error.\u201d Still, LPCiminelli, whose chairman and chief executive, Louis P. Ciminelli, is a financial backer of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s, was ultimately selected to construct the SolarCity factory.Records show that the Ciminelli family was supportive of the governor\u2019s campaign during the period when developers were being sought for Buffalo Billion projects.On Nov. 19, 2013, Mr. Cuomo traveled to Buffalo for a fund-raiser. Campaign finance records show that Mr. Ciminelli\u2019s wife provided facilities or services to the Cuomo campaign that day worth $2,350 \u2014 known as an in-kind contribution. A Cuomo campaign spokesman said the contribution paid for a private gathering that Mr. Ciminelli hosted for the governor that night.Three weeks later, on Dec. 10, LPCiminelli submitted its proposal for development work as part of the Buffalo Billion. In early January, Mr. Ciminelli and his wife gave more money to the governor \u2014 $29,200 in total. Mr. Ciminelli was so generous, he donated more to Mr. Cuomo than was allowed by law, so a portion of his donation was refunded.Later that month, LPCiminelli was selected as one of the winning developers, and would eventually build the SolarCity factory.The subpoena to SUNY Polytechnic sought records related to monetary and in-kind donations to any state elected official.Daniel C. Oliverio, a lawyer for Mr. Ciminelli and his company, said neither his client nor the construction company had done anything wrong, and neither were targets of the investigation.At a ceremony last year announcing the solar project, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged Mr. Ciminelli, who he said is \u201cgoing to build it all on time and ahead of schedule.\u201d The crowd proceeded to applaud the builder.In August, at a topping-off ceremony for the factory, Mr. Cuomo posed for pictures with workers in LPCiminelli hard hats and signed a steel beam that included LPCiminelli\u2019s logo. His office issued a news release that included a prideful quotation from Mr. Ciminelli, who said the SolarCity project was \u201cturning Governor Cuomo\u2019s vision for the new Buffalo into a reality.\u201dAsked by a reporter this month if he had spoken to Mr. Ciminelli during his time as governor, Mr. Cuomo responded, \u201cI have probably spoken with him, but I had nothing to do with the selection whatsoever.\u201d He said that his knowledge of the federal investigation was limited solely to what he reads in the newspaper.Two months later, McGuire donated $25,000 to the governor\u2019s re-election campaign. Later that year, five days before Mr. Cuomo won a second term, the company chipped in another $10,000.McGuire Development declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Voice of Maigret \u2014 and the Art of the Audiobook", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic at LargeThe musings, observations and procrastinations of T\u2019s critic at large Jody Rosen.An Inspector Maigret mystery is like a shot of good liquor: sharp, tasty stuff that delivers a sock to the senses when you swallow it in a single gulp. The books are short, averaging about 150 pages or so. For a working journalist, they\u2019re perfect palate cleansers. I\u2019ve been sucking down the new Maigret editions, in order, as they\u2019re published \u2014 taking them medicinally, between deadlines or bouts of writer\u2019s block.What Simenon serves up, in addition to thumping entertainment and a very Gallic blend of misanthropy and sensuality, is inspiration: The example of one of history\u2019s heroic graphomaniacs, a great writer who evidently was never blocked, who churned out hundreds of novels at an Olympian pace. (He told interviewers that it took him 11 days to write a book.) Simenon managed this feat by devoting himself to simplicity and economy. He wrote clear-eyed, sturdy, beautiful sentences that sketched people and places in brisk strokes: \u201cThe city looked as if it had been washed in clean water, so bright were the colors\u201d; \u201cShe walked ahead of Maigret with that aggressive dignity of those for whom mockery is the worst calamity\u201d; \u201cBig Louis\u2019 features looked swollen; one cheek was bigger than the other, or simply seemed so because of the way he always tilted his head to one side. Puffy flesh, and big eyes that seemed to start from his head.\u201d Simenon\u2019s best lines chime like poetry. Here he is describing a chance meeting between Maigret and a harbormaster in a foggy seaport town: \u201cThey shake hands, like two phantoms in the mist. And life goes on in the fog, where one may suddenly bump into an invisible man.\u201dRecently, Armstrong spoke to me by phone from his London home about the art of audiobook reading, about Simenon\u2019s writing and about Maigret\u2019s long, boozy lunches.You\u2019re an experienced actor, but the kind of performance that\u2019s called for on an audiobook is different than what you might do onstage or onscreen. How did you develop these skills? I\u2019ve been reading aloud since I was a child. My father was a Presbyterian preacher, and I used to have to read the Bible in church. I suppose that took away the fear of reading out loud.I also did a lot of radio as a younger actor. Occasionally, I read stories on radio. That was really my training \u2014 my vocal training, if you like. In the States, of course, you once had a lot of radio drama. Orson Welles, people like that, used to make the most fabulous plays on radio. In the U.K. we still have that tradition. Every day, you can hear a new play on the radio here. When you do an audiobook \u2014 particularly a book like a Maigret, which is a short novel \u2014 it\u2019s really in that radio drama tradition. It\u2019s a bit like doing a one-act play, all by yourself.How do you prepare for a Maigret recording? What\u2019s your process?The preparation takes longer than the recording itself. Nowadays, you get the text of the book as a PDF. It used to be that you got a paper script. If it was a long book, that could be five or six hundred pages. But now they send you a PDF, and you can annotate it on your iPad which means that you can highlight the different characters, write down what sort of voices you\u2019ll be using for the various characters. So I read the book once, putting the names by the side of the characters and deciding on the voices. Then I read the whole book a second time. And then I do the recording.How long does it take to record a Maigret, generally? The books tend to run about three hours. How long are you in the studio? We record a book in a day. The whole book in one day. It\u2019s a pretty full-on day. But it\u2019s good, because then you get the continuum of the story. It means that you can get characters\u2019 voices in your head and reproduce them accurately. If you recorded over two or three days, you might lose some of the nuances, some of the vocal nuances. Obviously, if you make a mistake, which inevitably one does quite a lot, you simply go back and start the sentence again. We have very fine editors who cut and paste the thing together. Of course you hope that the reading sounds seamless, as if it hasn\u2019t been edited.There are two voices, two accents, that you use in all the Maigret audiobooks. One is the voice of omniscient narrator \u2014 Simenon, if you will. The other voice, of course, is Maigret\u2019s. The voice of the narrator is my natural narrating voice. It\u2019s the voice I use when I\u2019m recording a nonfiction book. As for Maigret: From the descriptions of him you get in the books, you realize he\u2019s a big guy. I\u2019m not a big guy at all. I\u2019m quite slight. But I thought that he would have a very rich baritone-type voice. And that he would be laconic in his delivery, because he\u2019s pretty laid back, in his way. I tried to get a bit of warmth into it too, because although he\u2019s not overtly friendly, I do think there\u2019s a humanity about him that you need to be able to recognize from his voice. There needs to be a quality there where you think: Whatever this guy\u2019s doing, he\u2019s doing it for the right reasons. Even when he slightly steps outside the law.Obviously these books are translated into English; you\u2019re not reading the original French. You\u2019ve chosen to read them in an English accent, as opposed to, say, in French-accented English. And you\u2019ve given the characters various English accents that signify class and regional differences. So when there\u2019s a Parisian thug, you voice him as a kind of East End cockney.It\u2019s an approach that my producer and I took a little while to decide upon. I\u2019ve got a terrific producer called Paul Kent. He actually got me the part. Like me, he\u2019s a complete Maigret freak. Anyway, Paul and I decided that it would be foolish to try to put on French accents for all the characters, when the narration is in English. As for the regional accents \u2014 it\u2019s quite a tricky thing. I sort of decided that Brittany would be the equivalent of the West Country in England. In other words, I give characters from Brittany a West Country, a slightly rural, accent. The Parisians have an urban accent; they sound like Londoners. You have to very carefully decide on things like status, class, the way those things are reflected in the voice and accent of each character.Of course, there are French words in the text, too. Fortunately, Paul speaks perfect French. My French is a real schoolboy French. So I rely on him entirely for pronunciation. Because listeners that know French will be really irritated if you get a place name wrong. Or, you know, if you mispronounce somebody\u2019s surname.You have to voice lots of female characters in the Maigret audiobooks. Is that a challenge?Well, of course, most fiction has both men and women in it. I do a lot of audiobooks, so I\u2019m used to voicing women. Simenon creates such wonderful rich characters, male and female. I think he\u2019s particularly good with the female characters. He\u2019s quite old-fashioned in his view of women \u2014 there\u2019s quite a lot of sexism in his work. He generally describes the way a woman looks before he describes what sort of person they are. He can be harshly judgmental of his female characters. But I think he understands them. Simenon obviously loved women. That comes across, I think, in what he writes. Despite his sexism.You said that you were a big Maigret fan prior to landing this gig. What was it about the books that grabbed you?In certain books, Maigret will get stuck on a particular tipple. He\u2019ll spend half the novel popping into brasseries for a Calvados.Yes. Yes.You\u2019re under contract to do the whole Maigret series. You\u2019ve recorded a couple of dozen so far. Do you have favorite novels in the series?The early novels are very often set by the water. He writes a lot about canals and sailors. Simenon obviously had a passion for boats. The way he conjures up those worlds is fantastic.Those settings are so atmospheric. So dank.You can feel and smell it. He conjures up all the senses.You could say there\u2019s a spiritual dankness in the Maigret stories, too. There are a lot of nasty, sordid people and events in the books. Simenon took a pretty dim view of humanity. Yet underneath it all you sense his empathy. I think that\u2019s Maigret\u2019s experience of life. He\u2019s dealing with the scum of the earth a lot of the time, you know. But he\u2019s very humane. In the last book I read, there\u2019s a woman who has a very sad life. She\u2019s a prostitute. She\u2019s a drug addict. And at some point she starts to get withdrawal symptoms from cocaine. Maigret opens a desk drawer, takes out a little sachet of cocaine, and slips it to her, not letting anyone see him. He knows that this woman is in this terrible state. He knows he\u2019s never going to cure her addiction. So why not ease her pain? And very often, you know, Maigret lets people off. He forgives people. If he thinks that their crime is in any way justifiable, he moves on.You know Simenon pretty well at this point. Do you notice his tics, his mannerisms now? Do they books begin to feel formulaic? Do you ever say, \u201cOh, there he goes again \u2014 old Simenon, doing his schtick\u201d?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fate of Corfu Airport Puts Greek Bailout Deal to the Test", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCORFU, Greece \u2014 In the running debate over how to revive the Greek economy, there is one thing that locals and foreigners can agree on: The airport on this resort island, like many others in tourist-dependent Greece, does not befit a eurozone country.The big, divisive question is whether the Greek government will be willing and able to hand over management of Corfu and many of the country\u2019s other busiest airports to outside professional management, as part of Greece\u2019s economic makeover.The dispute is shaping up as an early test of the viability of Greece\u2019s new $97 billion bailout program, which demands the privatization of many state-run assets \u2014 including management of the airports. Whatever the outcome of the Greek national election next Sunday, challenges like Corfu will await the new government.The airports could also become a barometer of whether the new Greek government will be capable of fulfilling any of the program\u2019s tough conditions, which include either selling or transferring management of state assets like railroads and seaports. The bailout program requires these conditions as a way to repair Greek government finances and spur economic growth.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to the bailout conditions before he called for the coming election, which he hopes will consolidate his authority and marginalize the most left-wing dissidents in his Syriza party.At Corfu, the airport\u2019s shortcomings include a runway that ends so close to a public highway that the air traffic controller must switch on a stoplight during takeoffs to halt traffic. Otherwise, the cars can be buffeted by turbulence, or startled drivers might veer off the road.Inside the terminal, the luggage conveyors frequently break down. The rusting restroom fixtures rarely work, and some toilets lack seats. On summer weekends, when charter flights carry thousands of vacationers to and from cities like Birmingham, England, or Brussels, the overflow can force passengers to wait outside under the broiling Mediterranean sun.\u201cThe first and last picture of any island is the airport,\u201d said Dimitris Diavatis, who owns two hotels on Corfu. \u201cIf people are waiting in the sun, that is going to destroy the good picture from their one or two weeks here.\u201dAir traffic controllers, meanwhile, see a variety of safety concerns, as the government\u2019s debt problems have for years deprived many Greek airports of sufficient money for maintenance and modernization. One exception is the Athens airport, which has already been partly privatized and generally lives up to its role as a modern international hub.But there is little agreement on how best to bring Corfu up to modern standards, along with more than a dozen other airports now owned and managed by the government.The other eurozone countries are demanding that the government turn over airport management to Fraport, the company that runs the Frankfurt Airport and airports in eight other countries, including those in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Lima, Peru. But many Greeks, including the local government on Corfu, see that as an imperialistic incursion and are vowing to resist with all means necessary, including lawsuits and strikes.That the airport contractor in question comes from Germany, which many Greeks consider their chief antagonist among eurozone creditors, only adds to the tensions. For many Greeks, the airports deal is symbolic of their broader concerns about the bailout: They fear that the government is surrendering vital national assets at an extreme discount to Germans intent on forcing the country into economic subjugation.\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t manage in World War II they are managing now,\u201d Kostas Nikolouzos, the left-wing mayor of Corfu, said of Germany, voicing a common sentiment. \u201cIt may sound extreme, but it\u2019s true.\u201dFraport and a Greek partner, the Copelouzos Group, won a bid last year to take over management of 14 Greek airports, including those in Corfu and popular tourist destinations like Mykonos, Santorini, Rhodes and Kos. Most of the airports are on islands, but the deal also includes the airport at Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second-largest city.But the agreement has yet to go into force \u2014 initially because the Tsipras government demanded new conditions after it came to power in January. More recently, though, since Greece and its eurozone creditors agreed in July to the country\u2019s third bailout since 2010, Fraport has sought to reopen discussion about the terms.Some Greeks consider Fraport\u2019s partnership with Copelouzos Group a perpetuation of the dominance of Greek oligarchs over the country\u2019s economy. The company\u2019s founder, Dimitrios Copelouzos, is one of the country\u2019s wealthiest people and the main supplier of Russian natural gas to Greece.Mr. Nikolouzos, the Corfu mayor and a member of Syriza, said the deal would give Fraport a stranglehold over Corfu\u2019s economic lifeline.\u201cWe are a place totally dependent on tourism,\u201d Mr. Nikolouzos said in his office in a villa that serves as city hall. \u201cAirports belong to the strategic infrastructure of the country.\u201dFew would dispute that. But part of the rationale of the privatization program is to transfer management of crucial assets to private companies with more international experience and more money to spend on improvements.The public officials now in charge of many of the airports often show little entrepreneurial drive, critics say. While most modern airports have become de facto shopping malls, the Corfu airport has only a small duty-free outlet and two souvenir shops selling stuffed animals and \u201cI Love Corfu\u201d refrigerator magnets.More profit-oriented management, critics say, would create jobs on Corfu and other islands, helping to address Greece\u2019s staggering unemployment rate \u2014 25.2 percent, by far the highest jobless figure in the eurozone.\u201cThe basis of the Greek economy is tourism,\u201d said Stergios Pitsiorlas, chairman of the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, the Greek privatization agency. \u201cWe need a dramatic improvement of all the infrastructure.\u201dMr. Pitsiorlas, who was appointed privatization chief in March, said that despite some last-minute wrangling over terms, the agreement with Fraport was still valid and that he expected it to take effect by the end of the year.The Air Traffic Controllers Association of Greece, a labor union, is officially neutral on the privatization issue. But it would clearly welcome more professional airport management.\u201cWhat we want is for the airports to be functioning efficiently,\u201d said Spiros Rolakis, the union president. \u201cIf the state can provide that \u2014 which they can\u2019t \u2014 or a private operator, the result is what matters.\u201dRecently Serafim Petrou, the union\u2019s secretary, took visitors on a tour of the control center for all of Greek airspace, a region reaching east to Cyprus and south to North Africa.The large control room, in an otherwise abandoned airport on the outskirts of Athens, looked clean and modern. The controllers, mostly young women wearing headsets, stared at large screens, speaking in clipped tones to pilots.But Mr. Petrou said the computer technology dated from the 1990s, and had been under extra strain recently because the conflict in Ukraine had forced many flights to take routes further south, over Greece. \u201cThis is an exhausted system,\u201d Mr. Petrou said.Opponents of the Fraport takeover say that landing fees, about \u20ac25 million a year in Corfu, would be plenty to make needed improvements, if only airports had access to the money.Fraport\u2019s experience in neighboring Bulgaria might offer clues to how the company might operate in Greece. After taking over two Bulgarian airports at the end of 2006, Fraport made substantial improvements to facilities in the Black Sea resorts of Varna and Burgas.New terminals opened in 2013, with much faster baggage handling, modern restaurants and shops, and roomier arrival and departure areas. Passenger traffic to Varna and Burgas has risen by a total of 500,000 passengers since 2007, to 3.9 million last year.\u201cThe management of the two airports is much better, which has helped bring more passengers,\u201d said Blagoi Ragin, chairman of the Bulgarian Hotel and Restaurant Association.TIM, which has never been found guilty of any wrongdoing, declined to comment.In Germany, Greeks\u2019 resistance to the takeover of the airports by Fraport is seen as an example of Greek pride taking precedence over economic logic.\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation,\u201d said Frank Kaufmann, a member of the State Parliament in Hesse, which owns a 31 percent stake in Fraport. The deal \u201cis more help than exploitation, from our point of view.\u201dBut Giorgos Mavronas, head of the union that represents Corfu airport workers, said he worried that Fraport would have too much market power and could use it to play islands off one another to get what it wants.\u201cIf this goes forward it will be an unprecedented monopoly,\u201d he said recently, sipping a soft drink at a cafe at the edge of Corfu\u2019s old town, which was packed with tourists as dusk fell. \u201cThere is no other case in the world where the 14 most important airports are controlled by one company.\u201d\u201cWe intend to organize strikes,\u201d Mr. Mavronas said.Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting from Corfu, and Boryana Dzhambazova from Sofia, Bulgaria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Indonesia Prospers, Air Pollution Takes Toll ", "Date": "2015-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The young woman sat on a bench at a bus terminal here one recent morning, listening to her iPod beneath a bright blue sky. But despite the sunshine and a light breeze, the woman, Fety Dwiyanti, wore a face mask. She did not have the flu or a cold, though, she was just worried about what was getting into her lungs.\u201cIt\u2019s because of the air pollution and dust,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I go outside, I put it on.\u201dJakarta, a sprawling city of 10 million, has long had a problem with air pollution. To address it, the city phased out the use of leaded gasoline 10 years ago, among other measures. But as the economy has grown at a rapid clip over the last decade, the number of vehicles in the capital has soared, with more people able to afford them. And air quality has gotten worse.That has led to a strange development: a rise in the number of \u201cblue sky days\u201d \u2014 when the air is clear enough to allow views of the lush mountains of nearby West Java \u2014 along with higher pollution levels.\u201cWhen we see the sky is blue, it\u2019s just one indicator that air quality is good, and not really an accurate one,\u201d said Dasrul Chaniago, director of pollution control and environmental damage at the environment and forestry ministry. The ministry estimates that at least 70 percent of Jakarta air pollution is from vehicles.The main peril to public health is from fine particle pollution \u2014 measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller and found in, among other things, auto emissions \u2014 that can sneak into people\u2019s nasal passages and lungs. Such pollution particles are significantly smaller than mold spores, pollens or typical atmospheric dust.Jakarta has never been viewed as one of Asia\u2019s most livable cities. Imagine Los Angeles on a bad day, but with more smog and bumper-to-bumper traffic.While pollution here does not compare to the dire levels in cities like Beijing and New Delhi, it is serious enough for the State Department to have put Jakarta on a priority list of American Embassies to be fitted with air quality monitors this year. The American Embassies in Beijing and New Delhi already have the monitors; results posted online garner intense interest.The conditions include asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, said Dr. Budi Haryanto, chairman of the university\u2019s Department of Environmental Health, which carried out the studyDr. Budi said that nationwide, air pollution causes 2.8 million lost work days a year, along with 1.3 million absences at schools, 9,000 hospitalizations and at least 6,500 premature deaths. \u201cAnd we can say there\u2019s an increase in disease in all Indonesian cities. There\u2019s an increase in pollutants everywhere.\u201dJakarta accounts for around 40 percent of all auto sales in Indonesia; more than 480,000 new cars hit the capital\u2019s streets in 2014 in addition to 1.4 million new motorcycles, according to the Association of Indonesian Automotive Manufacturers.\u201cIndonesia lags more than five years behind its neighbors, including Thailand and China, in fuel quality standards,\u201d said Michael Dunne, who runs an automotive consultancy firm based in Hong Kong and has worked extensively in Indonesia.\u201cJunk fuel in, junk exhaust out, no matter how good the engine might be,\u201d he said.Still, there are signs that the government is tackling the problem. For instance, it is mandating that the auto sector improve emission standards on new vehicles to meet European levels starting in 2017.In Jakarta, the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Council collects data from eight monitoring stations across the city to measure air quality minute by minute. The agency also deploys vans with air monitoring equipment to take measurements in specific locations.Experts say it will take long-term projects to improve Jakarta\u2019s air quality, like the continuing construction of a mass transit system that officials hope will reduce the number of drivers on the streets and highways. Another project involves the city government buying land to create more green spaces.In the meantime, Jakartans who wear face masks are an increasingly common sight.Fina Chrisnantari, 30, an assistant in an office management company, says she will continue to wear a mask to and from work. She has been wearing one for about a year. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much it helps,\u201d she said as she waited for a bus in downtown Jakarta. \u201cA few days after being out, you can still feel it in your lungs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn, Unlikely Front-Runner for Labour Leader, Poised to Win Party Vote", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn, a 66-year-old veteran left-winger, stands a good chance of being elected leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, sharpening the ideological debate within the country and highlighting the rise of anti-establishment politicians throughout Western democracies.If he wins, it will prove a remarkable moment in politics here, and a spectacular repudiation of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the last Labour leader to win a national election and the architect of a strategy in which Labour abandoned much of its left-wing agenda and claimed the political center.Much like Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who has ignited liberal passions in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in the United States, Mr. Corbyn is promising radical approaches to longstanding problems. Under his leadership, Labour could become more like the new populist, leftist parties that have become prominent across Europe, including Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.As Labour leader, Mr. Corbyn would be some way from power, but his views could influence policy, particularly on foreign affairs. Mr. Cameron, for example, wants to know the position of the new Labour leader before asking Parliament to authorize military strikes in Syria. Two years ago, Mr. Cameron lost a vote on the issue, and Mr. Corbyn was a staunch opponent.Then there is a looming referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union, due by the end of 2017, in which Labour\u2019s role will be important. Though Mr. Corbyn has not said he wants Britain to leave the bloc, he has said he voted against British membership of the bloc\u2019s forerunner in a plebiscite in 1975.And in Washington there may be unease at the prospect of the main British opposition party\u2019s being led by a fierce critic of American foreign policy \u2014 one who, without endorsing their actions, has described Hamas and Hezbollah as \u201cfriends.\u201dSteven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, said Mr. Corbyn\u2019s rise had \u201ctaken everyone by surprise,\u201d yet even opponents concede that his campaign has energized a cohort of enthusiastic, and often young, supporters.Such people, Mr. Corbyn said at a rally in London this week, had been \u201cwritten off as being a nonpolitical generation, when in reality they were a political generation that politics had written off.\u201dAlthough Britain\u2019s economy is growing fast, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s message has struck a chord with workers and families still feeling the aftershocks of Europe\u2019s financial crisis of 2008.For many, prospects remain poor, wages low and employment insecure. Soaring housing prices in the south have left many locked out of the real estate market. Bankers remain the target of simmering resentment.Still, chance played a big part in Mr. Corbyn\u2019s rise, not least because he had to be persuaded to run as the left\u2019s leadership candidate, a position traditionally akin to that of a sacrificial victim.To stand, Mr. Corbyn needed 35 nominations from Labour lawmakers, and he scraped enough together only when several of those who did not support him decided he ought to be on the ballot to broaden the debate within the party. But, once there, he exploited a change of rules for the election of Labour leader, which had been devised to bolster the power of individual party members and curtail the influence of trade unions.For just three British pounds, about $4.60, anyone can become a \u201cregistered supporter\u201d and take part in what has become something like an American-style primary. The party, which had around 187,000 members before the May general election, has gained more than 105,000 since, plus an additional 112,000 \u201cregistered supporters.\u201d When those affiliated to the party, mainly through unions, are added, more than half a million people have a vote. The voting has been underway for several weeks.This system is now engulfed in controversy amid claims of organized efforts by hard-left supporters to register Corbyn voters and allegations that Conservative supporters have signed up to vote for Mr. Corbyn, calculating that this will sabotage Labour\u2019s chances in the next election. Having won a five-year term in May, Mr. Cameron does not have to call another election until 2020.Perhaps most of all, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success reflects Labour\u2019s internal failure to confront the toxic legacy of the war in Iraq, which Mr. Blair joined President George W. Bush in starting, and of the economic policies that many link to the financial crash.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s opponents \u2014 Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall \u2014 are all associated to varying degrees with a Blairite, centrist vision, yet none seem to have the charisma Mr. Blair possessed in 1994 when he won the party leadership.After a televised debate among the current four contenders, the Daily Telegraph commentator Dan Hodges declared Ms. Cooper the best performer, but lampooned her tendency to lapse into the type of robotic politician-style of speaking that has repelled many voters.Mr. Fielding sees Mr. Corbyn\u2019s success as a \u201csign of alienation from the system as it exists,\u201d adding that his three opponents are viewed by many within the party as \u201cTory-lite,\u201d a reference to Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives.The view among many supporters, Mr. Fielding added, was that \u201cvoting for Jeremy Corbyn might not work, but at least it is something that we believe in \u2014 and maybe it will work.\u201dThat chimes with the experience of the former Labour minister Chris Mullin, when he explained his reservations about Mr. Corbyn to party supporters.Yet the real thing would take Labour further to the left than at any time since 1983, which history suggests would be a high risk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joe Biden\u2019s Trip to New York Smacks of Campaign Visit", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs he contemplates whether to run for president, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is continuing his day job. And along the way, he is offering a peek into the kinds of issues that might animate a White House campaign, many of which have been at the center of his political identity for decades.In New York on Thursday, Mr. Biden highlighted women\u2019s issues, appearing with law enforcement officials to announce nearly $80 million in grants that will help the local authorities process evidence collected in rape cases, some of which has sat untested for years because of a lack of money.An hour later, the vice president rallied the union faithful with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to push for a minimum wage of $15 an hour, declaring his commitment to blue-collar workers as they seek to navigate an economy that has not fully recovered.In both cases, Mr. Biden claims longstanding passion for the subjects, which could help him reach out to women and workers if he runs for president.As a senator, Mr. Biden was the principal author of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, which began a continual campaign by him to ensure that evidence of rape is collected after an attack, at no cost to the victims, and is tested in a timely way. At Thursday\u2019s event, Mr. Biden was flanked by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., as he announced the grants for communities around the country.\u201cThis is about one woman at a time,\u201d Mr. Biden told an audience that included rape victims. \u201cIt\u2019s about a woman whose life in every way has been turned upside down. It\u2019s the ultimate violation.\u201dAt the later event, Mr. Biden joined Mr. Cuomo\u2019s call for a higher minimum wage and cited what he said was a career built on fighting for laborers and other workers.\u201cAnyone working 40 hours a week should have a shot at a decent life,\u201d Mr. Biden said to sometimes thunderous applause from the audience. \u201cIt used to be the basic bargain.\u201dAides to Mr. Biden insisted that Thursday\u2019s trip \u2014 which was also scheduled to include a taped appearance on the new \u201cLate Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d \u2014 was not part of any preparations for a presidential campaign.They said the vice president had been pushing those issues for his entire career, including as a part of the Obama administration\u2019s agenda.But whether or not the events were planned with a campaign in mind, Mr. Biden\u2019s performance throughout the day suggested ways in which he could seize on his long history as a policy maker to try to win support among key demographics.At the first event, Mr. Biden struck an emotional tone as he described his anger over how rape victims have historically been treated by law enforcement officials and others. He told a story about a fellow senator who once said to him that \u201csometimes, a man just has to use force\u201d during sex with a woman.\u201cIt takes an enormous amount of courage to stand up and talk about what happened to you, because you relive it when you tell it,\u201d Mr. Biden said to the victims in the audience.At the rally later, Mr. Biden\u2019s tone changed as he responded to the enthusiastic shouts from the mostly union crowd. His voice rose into a bellow as he called for politicians in Washington and elsewhere to address the plight of workers and those on the verge of poverty.\u201cPeople are further behind today than they were 10 years ago,\u201d he said, referring to the last time the federal minimum wage was increased.Mr. Biden praised Mr. Cuomo for pushing for a $15 minimum wage, even as the administration has backed a nationwide $12 minimum wage. And he blasted those who argued that an increase in the minimum wage would hurt the economy.\u201cYou\u2019ll raise everybody up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know boosting the minimum wage has a beneficial effect on the higher wage scales. The manager\u2019s salary goes up. Everybody\u2019s salary goes up.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

These have been joined by a growing number of professional networks, including a new Black Tech Employees Resource Group, and nonprofit groups like Black Girls Code and Code2040, which are bushwhacking the professional trail.\u201cA lot of African-Americans want to grow up to be LeBron James, Jay Z or Barack Obama,\u201d said Van Jones, the CNN political commentator and founder of #YesWeCode, a year-old program that has raised $3 million to connect young adults in Oakland to apprenticeships in tech companies. \u201cThey don\u2019t hear about David Drummond at Google, who is at the center of one of the biggest companies in the world.\u201d (Mr. Drummond is a senior vice president and Google\u2019s chief legal officer.)The idea with all of the new efforts, Mr. Jones said, is to create a generation of black entrepreneurial \u201cuploaders\u201d \u2014 those who create profit-making apps instead of simply downloading them.At the heart of the issue, underrepresented minorities \u201care up against a series of barriers and obstacles that their Caucasian and Asian counterparts don\u2019t have,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, founder of the Level Playing Field Institute in Oakland, which sponsors programs to increase diversity in technology. \u201cThe farther outside the tech ecosystem they are, the harder it is.\u201dAnd entry into the tech firmament remains challenging, even for African-Americans with engineering degrees. Consider Erin Teague, 33, director of product management at Yahoo, who grew up in a predominantly black suburb of Detroit and later became the only black woman among 1,200 students at the University of Michigan\u2019s engineering department.\u201cEveryone around me believed in me and saw me as smart,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was an exposure and access gap. I didn\u2019t know what to dream for.\u201d Eventually she received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and became one of the first 500 employees at Twitter.With only 1 percent of venture-capital-backed start-ups led by African-Americans, access to capital is also being viewed as a civil rights issue.\u201cIf you\u2019re a 20-something in Atlanta or Oakland, you might not have the familial wealth or the network you need to raise seed-stage funding from angel investors, who are mostly white men of a certain age,\u201d said Monique N. Woodard, the founder and executive director of Black Founders, a group dedicated to increasing the number of black tech entrepreneurs.Now new networking groups, both formal and informal, are trying to shift that equation. At a \u201cblacks in tech\u201d gathering in Oakland in May, nearly 100 African-American entrepreneurs and diversity advocates brainstormed about Oakland as \u201cthe soul city of tech.\u201d A new Bay Area Blacks in Tech organization also met in July at the San Francisco offices of Pinterest, the online scrapbooking start-up.\u201cSeeing almost 200 black engineers gathered together isn\u2019t a common sight,\u201d said Makinde Adeagbo, 29, a Pinterest engineer and one of the organizers. \u201cWe heard about what awesome things black engineers were working on at all these different companies. Events like these remind you that you aren\u2019t alone.\u201dKen Coleman, who is African-American and chairman of the data analytics firm Saama Technologies, started a \u201cMore Diverse Silicon Valley\u201d event in 2013 at the exclusive Sharon Heights Golf and Country Club on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif. \u2014 the Main Street of venture capital \u2014 with the goal of enhancing upward mobility and access to capital for blacks and others.\u201cThe most important ingredient for a tech company is talent,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cIt\u2019s shortsighted to overlook talent anywhere.\u201dPromoting entrepreneurship and increasing the numbers of math, science and engineering graduates has also become an imperative for historically black colleges and universities. About 28 percent of all math and tech-related degrees awarded to African-Americans are from those institutions.Two years ago, the United Negro College Fund collaborated with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and others to hold an \u201cinnovation summit\u201d at Stanford University, which was attended by provosts, deans and faculty members of some of these colleges and universities and intended to forge closer relationships with tech companies.\u201cIt was a very powerful event,\u201d said Chad Womack, a director at the United Negro College Fund, who added that the group visited Facebook and was greeted by Sheryl Sandberg, the social network\u2019s chief operating officer.Still, the hope that a consortium of tech companies would get together after the event to collectively invest in pipeline issues has yet to materialize. \u201cIf you look at the scale and speed with which the Valley moves, if they wanted to solve this problem, they could,\u201d Dr. Womack said.At the still-fledgling Hidden Genius Project, progress has been incremental, but there is traction. In total, 33 young men have completed the program or are in it, including 19 who just started. Mr. Young said the project had improved the academic performance of young people like Matthew Jones, 18, a student from East Oakland who described himself as a onetime \u201cknucklehead.\u201dBecause of Hidden Genius Project, Mr. Jones said he went from being a C student to graduating from high school with a 4.0 grade point average. He starts college at California State University, East Bay this month, with plans to major in computer science and the goal of becoming a software engineer.\u201cIt\u2019s taught me critical thinking skills and made me a better person,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cI want to keep going.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Refugee Crisis in Syria Raises Fears in South Carolina", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUNCAN, S.C. \u2014 The worried citizens gathered in the high school cafeteria, about 200 strong. Patriotic songs played on the stereo, a man in a blue blazer from the John Birch Society hovered by a well-stocked literature table, and Lauren L. Martel, a lawyer from Hilton Head, told the crowd that 25 Syrian refugees were already living among them.\u201cThe U.N. calls it \u2018refugee resettlement\u2019 \u2014 the Muslims call it hijra, migration,\u201d said another speaker, Jim McMillan, a local businessman. \u201cThey don\u2019t plan to assimilate, they don\u2019t plan to take on our culture. They plan to change the way of American life.\u201dNone of Syria\u2019s four million refugees have been resettled in this part of South Carolina in the last year, according to the State Department. Since May, a Christian nonprofit group, World Relief, has placed 32 refugees in the region, but most of them were Christians fleeing troubled countries like Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Even so, in South Carolina\u2019s Upstate region, as its conservative northwest corner is known, the crisis has divided those who want to welcome new waves of huddled masses from those who question the federal government\u2019s ability to weed out Muslim extremists. Some critics, echoing concerns in towns across the country, fear the newcomers will burden local government agencies or alter the character of their communities.The criticism here has encompassed both sober-minded questions about local school funding and warnings about global conspiracies. It began this spring when the Baltimore-based World Relief, one of nine nonprofit agencies that work with the federal government to resettle refugees, prepared to open its new office in Spartanburg, a city of 37,000 close to a major BMW auto plant.Lynn Isler, a stay-at-home mother, was among those who pushed back. She created a short-lived Facebook page that warned of the \u201cperfect storm that the Syrian refugees will bring.\u201d She has also warned that Communists had infiltrated some elements of the Christian Evangelical movement that supports refugee resettlement.Elected officials have weighed in as well. Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican whose district is part of the Upstate region and who leads the House select committee investigating the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, has complained that the federal government did not sufficiently coordinate with local officials before allowing the current crop of refugees to arrive.State Senator Lee Bright, who represents Greenville and Spartanburg Counties, has called for \u201copen hearings\u201d on the resettlement effort, echoing the concerns of some fellow Republicans who say it is difficult to perform background checks on Syrian refugees, given the chaos that has engulfed their country. Many critics point to the congressional testimony of Michael Steinbach, assistant director of counterterrorism for the F.B.I., who told a House committee in February that Syria lacked systems that could provide information to evaluate refugees.At the meeting in the cafeteria Sunday evening at James F. Byrnes High School in Duncan, a small city near Spartanburg, State Representative Mike Burns, a Republican from Greenville County, spoke more broadly of immigration policies that were threatening traditional American culture.\u201cThis immigration fiasco that we\u2019re in the middle of is going to take away the very things that we\u2019re dear about,\u201d Mr. Burns said.Evan Mulch, the field coordinator for the John Birch Society, the right-wing group, told the crowd the resettlements were \u201cpart of the New World Order game plan.\u201d Another speaker worried that the refugees would stress the state\u2019s already stretched Social Services Department.The United States, Ms. Martel said, is \u201ca Judeo-Christian nation.\u201d\u201cWe are not a Muslim nation, and those two things cannot coexist,\u201d she added.During a question-and-answer session, a woman asked if the refugees could be sent home on \u201ctroop ships.\u201d A man asked if they could be sent on a plane to Saudi Arabia. When he was told that they could not, his frustration mounted.\u201cDo we shoot them?\u201d he asked, to laughter and applause. \u201cCome on! I mean, this is crazy.\u201dJason Lee, 41, a Southern Baptist preacher who is the director of World Relief\u2019s Spartanburg office, said he had been surprised by the vehement resistance. In the mid-2000s, when he helped Somali refugees adjust to new lives in Kentucky, there were very few local complaints.\u201cThe fear-mongering seems really different,\u201d Mr. Lee said.The situation here has been troubling enough that Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, traveled to the Spartanburg area in late August to meet with skeptics and to try to correct what she called \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the local program.But she said that screening procedures had improved since then. She also said that the vast majority of the three million refugees brought to the United States since 1975 \u2014 including 19,000 Iraqis who were resettled in the 2014 fiscal year \u2014 have integrated peacefully. (The United States has taken in about 1,500 refugees from Syria since the start of the conflict there more than four years ago.)Ms. Richard said many Americans had long supported refugee resettlement programs. \u201cIt\u2019s an American tradition, and a lot of Americans get that,\u201d she said. In many parts of the country, including South Carolina, the Syrian crisis has elicited calls for compassion and offers of help: On Sept. 13, hundreds of people gathered in University City, a suburb of St. Louis, to ask the federal government to accept \u201cas many Syrian refugees as possible\u201d in the area, according to the St. Louis chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.But even before the Syrian crisis dominated headlines worldwide, resettlement agencies had noted a rise in anti-refugee sentiment in parts of the United States, said Melanie Nezer, vice president of policy and advocacy at HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that works with refugees. In the last two decades, they have increasingly placed people in smaller communities to try to avoid the high cost of living in traditional immigrant magnets like New York and Los Angeles. At the same time, unemployment and tight budgets have prompted some local governments to fight the placement of refugees.In South Carolina, a number of influential Upstate religious leaders have embraced the refugee program. The Rev. D.J. Horton, senior pastor of Anderson Mill Road Baptist Church, said dozens from his flock of 2,300 had already completed refugee support training. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to read your Bible, especially your New Testament, and refuse refuge to people who are vulnerable,\u201d he said.Mr. Lee said World Relief has proposed to the State Department resettling as many as 116 refugees in the Upstate region in the next year. He did not rule out the possibility that Syrians might be resettled in the area in the future. For now, he said, his group had resettled just one Muslim family of four, from Iraq, and a former Iraqi translator for United States security companies who has renounced his religion.The former translator met with a reporter on Monday and asked that his name not be used, for fear of attracting attention from anti-refugee activists. He said his reception in the United States had been warm, but he had been careful not to mention he is an Iraqi: Among Americans, he said, \u201cSuicider, killer \u2014 this is the stereotype of Iraq.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ring Cycle: Boxing\u2019s Eternal Cinematic Appeal", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySign of the TimesTrends come and go. Technology is ever-changing. But as a new spate of films prove, boxing movies are here to stay.BOXING IS A COMMUNION with the dead. A.J. Liebling, in his classic book on the sport, \u2018\u2018The Sweet Science,\u2019\u2019 rejoiced that he had been hit by Philadelphia Jack O\u2019Brien, who had been hit by the great Fitzsimmons, who \u2018\u2018had been hit by Corbett, Corbett by John L. Sullivan, he by Paddy Ryan, with the bare knuckles.\u2019\u2019 Boxing, to Liebling, was a chain of arms and fists leading back into the past. \u2018\u2018It is a great thrill,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018to feel that all that separates you from the early Victorians is a series of punches on the nose.\u2019\u2019 We love boxing because it stays the same as the decades pass.We love boxing films for the same reason. Action movies now look nothing like action movies from the 1930s. Comedies now aren\u2019t much like comedies then. But the boxing movies we watch today are a lot like the ones our grandparents watched. Most films try to appeal to our lust for novelty \u2014 new high-concept premises, new special effects, new sci-fi dystopias, new monsters \u2014 but boxing movies get to keep revisiting the same characters, without even adding new cars, like the \u2018\u2018Fast and Furious\u2019\u2019 series, or new ordnance, like the \u2018\u2018Star Wars\u2019\u2019 films.The latest boxing movie, \u2018\u2018Southpaw,\u2019\u2019 which came out this summer, pays so much homage to its predecessors that it\u2019s a kind of turducken of several older films. There\u2019s this white, left-handed boxer (\u2018\u2018Rocky,\u2019\u2019 1976) who holds back in the early rounds and endures inhuman punishment only to pulverize his logy opponent at the end, energized by the debasement of his own body (\u2018\u2018Raging Bull,\u2019\u2019 1980). When poor life choices deprive him of custody of his child (\u2018\u2018The Champ,\u2019\u2019 1931) he learns life lessons from a wise old black man at a gym full of at-risk teens (\u2018\u2018Million Dollar Baby,\u2019\u2019 2004) and plots a comeback (every boxing movie ever made).Three other forthcoming boxing movies all promise familiar pleasures. \u2018\u2018Bleed for This\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Hands of Stone\u2019\u2019 are biopics about champs who are brought low and bounce back. \u2018\u2018Creed\u2019\u2019 is the latest descendant of the \u2018\u2018Rocky\u2019\u2019 franchise. It finds Rocky Balboa training the son of his erstwhile opponent, the Ali-like African-American Apollo Creed, who was brained in the ring by a Soviet in \u2018\u2018Rocky IV.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s a pretty good bet that, win or lose his big fight, the young Creed will teach us a lesson in discipline and courage, like Rocky before him. There is nothing much new, in other words, about any of these stories. And yet we keep coming back, time and time again. But why?The reason is simple: We go to boxing movies to remind ourselves that boxing still exists, and that therefore so do real men. In an age when men best each other through superior portfolio management or high-tech gadgetry, boxing\u2019s often purer form of manliness, one stubbornly immune to new weaponry or accessories, is precisely the point. In the famous words of Joyce Carol Oates, \u2018\u2018Boxing is for men, and is about men, and is men. A celebration of the lost religion of masculinity all the more trenchant for its being lost.\u2019\u2019 It takes us back, she later wrote, to \u2018\u2018the warrior, of some mythopoeic time before weapons were invented.\u2019\u2019But Oates was writing in the early 1990s, when boxing was the closest thing to real violence in professional sports. Now, kids who might once have been boxers go in for mixed martial arts, which allows for kicking and grappling. But although boxing itself may have ceded its central place in our culture, our love for the boxing movie endures. For one thing, boxing is simpler, cleaner than M.M.A, which is like hip-hop or contemporary pop; it samples everything. Boxing is like folk or blues; there\u2019s the jab, the cross, the hook and the uppercut \u2014 four chords. More important, the staging of a match deifies the boxers. They stand on a raised platform, like figures carved into the pediment of a temple. When a boxer falls through the ropes, he falls out of the ring onto the lower plane of the spectators, as if cast down from Olympus. (See George Bellows\u2019s painting \u2018\u2018Dempsey and Firpo.\u2019\u2019) By contrast, M.M.A. is staged so as to bestialize its fighters; they roll on the floor of a cage. And Hollywood knows that when Americans drive to the multiplex, they want to see gods.But the biggest single reason boxing and film are natural partners is that boxing has a suspenseful, satisfying, back-from-behind narrative built into its very rules. Consider the practice of counting to 10 as a fighter lies prone at his opponent\u2019s feet. Boxers will generally take the full count, getting up around eight or nine, to fully exploit the opportunity for rest. We\u2019ve all seen it in boxing movies, if not in real boxing matches: Our man takes blow after blow, and suddenly, the tables turn, the crowd screams in excitement, and, lo, the bloodied underdog makes the show dog pay. This happens in both the stupidest boxing movies \u2014 \u2018\u2018Rocky IV,\u2019\u2019 for example \u2014 and in the smartest ones, like \u2018\u2018Raging Bull.\u2019\u2019The boxer\u2019s virtues \u2014 endurance, focus, skill with the hands, the willingness to risk everything \u2014 are the virtues of both working men (soldiers, sailors, firemen) and the virtues of artists (dancers, drummers, chefs). Boxing demands not just savagery and endurance but also lightness, a certain softness of motion. Boxing is not just the channeling of fear and anger into an act of physical aggression; it is also learning to repress fear and anger, to maintain the detachment of the craftsman under circumstances that would make a normal person go utterly ape. There is no image management in the ring, no politics, no mingling, no manipulation of abstract symbols, no entrepreneurialism. In the ring, it doesn\u2019t matter whether people like you. And it\u2019s fair. In other words, boxing both rewards the virtues that in postindustrial life tend to go unrewarded and shuns all that is 21st-century and white-collar. We watch boxing (and boxing movies) to experience an inversion of the power structure, to pay our respects to people whose power resides in their bodies, to leave the service economy behind.And finally: We go to boxing movies to see how young actors who play boxers measure up to previous generations of actors who played boxers. Pity Jake Gyllenhaal, who, despite getting shredded for \u2018\u2018Southpaw,\u2019\u2019 could not outbox the shadow of Robert De Niro\u2019s \u2018\u2018Raging Bull\u2019\u2019 performance. Not only did De Niro get into honest-to-god boxing shape, the way Gyllenhaal did (De Niro won two professional fights while training); he also ate himself into morbid obesity for the sections of the movie in which its subject, Jake LaMotta, has retired from boxing and gone to seed. In so doing, De Niro did what boxers do: He put himself in harm\u2019s way. He gained 60 pounds of flab, so much weight that his breathing became painfully labored, so much that Martin Scorsese became worried about his health.\u2018\u2018Raging Bull,\u2019\u2019 for that reason, is compelling in much the same way that real boxing is compelling. You see the fat body on the screen, De Niro\u2019s real, abused body, and think, \u2018\u2018My god, this is actually happening \u2014 look at what the man has put himself through.\u2019\u2019 And so for a moment you are distracted from your own everyday suffering, and feel the suffering of another person, in your gut.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Pledges to Work With U.S. to Stop Cybercrimes", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 President Xi Jinping pledged in a speech here on Tuesday night to work with the United States on fighting cybercrime, saying that the Chinese government was a staunch defender of cybersecurity. \u201cThe Chinese government will not in whatever form engage in commercial theft, and hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties,\u201d Mr. Xi said in an address to American business executives. At the end of his first day of a state visit to the United States, Mr. Xi told his audience, which also included Chinese business leaders, that \u201cChina is ready to set up a high-level joint dialogue mechanism with the United States on fighting cybercrimes.\u201dHere are a few excerpts from President Xi Jinping of China\u2019s speech to business leaders in Seattle on Tuesday night.Mr. Xi appeared to be attempting to reassure his business audience, many of its members from tech industries at the forefront of cyberspace issues, but how far his words would be believed by the Obama administration remained to be seen. At a briefing for reporters in Washington on Tuesday, a senior China adviser to President Obama said that \u201cwe won\u2019t paper over those differences,\u201d a reference to cyberspace and economic issues. There would be \u201cvery robust discussion\u201d with Mr. Xi, said the adviser, Daniel J. Kritenbrink.The meetings failed to lead to a concrete agreement that the administration had hoped for on how to deal with such attacks, particularly the theft of trade secrets from American companies that benefit their Chinese competitors, according to a senior administration official.The tone of Mr. Xi\u2019s address across a range of issues was positive, without a jarring word. He refrained from talking about thorny differences with the United States over China\u2019s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea. On China\u2019s softening economy he sounded a soothing tone, saying that all economies faced difficulties and though China was under downward pressure \u201cthis is only a problem in the course of progress.\u201d He also told his audience not to worry about the Chinese stock market, whose sudden plunge over the summer sent shock waves across the world. He defended his government\u2019s intervention, which failed to stop the fall, saying the \u201cgovernment took steps to stabilize the market and contain panic in the stock market and this avoided systemic risk.\u201d As Mr. Xi\u2019s advisers prepared him for his trip to the United States, he was encouraged by several Americans to include some personal themes that would resonate with the audience. He won applause for a line about his anticorruption campaign against government officials not being like the television show \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dThe audience also appreciated his anecdote about ordering one of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s favorite cocktails, a mojito, when he visited Cuba. The audience included Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and the company\u2019s founder, Bill Gates \u2014 they sat on either side of Mr. Xi\u2019s senior adviser, Li Zhanshu \u2014 as well as other senior executives whose tech firms have suffered in China from the imposition of new, intrusive security measures, commercial cybertheft and demands for transfers of technology. Mr. Xi addressed some of those concerns with general reassurances but no specifics, saying. \u201cWe will address the legitimate concerns of foreign investors in a timely fashion, protect their lawful rights and interests, and work hard to provide an open and transparent legal and policy environment.\u201dThe reactions of the business community to Mr. Xi\u2019s promises may become clearer at a high-level tech forum Wednesday, organized by the Chinese in conjunction with Microsoft, and expected to draw 200 executives.Since Mr. Xi came to power three years ago, human rights advocates and lawyers been rounded up and imprisoned, and Chinese nongovernmental organizations have been closed. The Obama administration has called these measures some of the most serious infringements of human rights in China in a long time.On that issue, Mr. Xi sounded a familiar refrain by Chinese officials, saying \u201cwe are ready to discuss rule-of-law issues with the U.S. side in a spirit of mutual learning for common progress.\u201dHe was more precise about the operations of foreign nonprofits that have come under increasingly restrictive regulations in the last year, offering few concessions. Such groups, he said, \u201cneed to obey Chinese law.\u201d In a speech before Mr. Xi spoke, the secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, warned him about problems with China\u2019s behavior on cyberspace practices, and seemed to want to disabuse Mr. Xi of an expectation that his meetings in Washington would be smooth going. \u201cWe \u2014 and our companies \u2014 continue to have serious concerns about an overall lack of legal and regulatory transparency, inconsistent protection of intellectual property, discriminatory cyber and technology policies, and more generally, the lack of a level playing field across a range of sectors,\u201d she said.Mr. Xi arrived in Seattle on Tuesday morning on an Air China Boeing 747-400 aircraft, landing at Paine Field adjacent to a Boeing manufacturing complex 30 miles from the city center. He will visit the Boeing plant on Wednesday.Accompanied by his wife, Peng Liyuan, a squadron of aides, senior government officials and nearly two dozen journalists from Chinese state news media, he was welcomed by the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee.He then headed to a downtown hotel to meet with a group of governors from Western states, including Jerry Brown of California. Afterward, he prepared for the dinner, scheduled to begin early to accommodate Jewish guests who wanted to attend prayers marking the start of Yom Kippur at sundown.The Chinese worked hard to front-load Mr. Xi\u2019s trip \u2014 his first to the United States as president \u2014 with two days of events in Seattle intended to show an upbeat relationship with American business. And in a broad sense it has worked as a show of force to President Obama about the power that China wields, and how much American companies need China even if its policies do not align with Washington\u2019s.Yet frustrations are simmering here. The U.S.-China Business Council, one of the hosts of the dinner, said member confidence about doing business in China has eroded considerably over the past five years.In 2010, 58 percent of executives were optimistic about the business outlook in China, while 33 percent were somewhat optimistic, said John Frisbie, the council\u2019s president. Now just 24 percent are optimistic while 67 percent are somewhat optimistic or neutral.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Names Matthias M\u00fcller, an Insider, as Chief Executive", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe replaces Martin Winterkorn, who resigned on Wednesday and took responsibility for the fraud but said he was not personally involved.\u201cThe same thing must never happen again,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said Friday in the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. He promised to overhaul the company\u2019s management structure. Volkswagen also said on Friday that it would revamp itself to give more independence to individual vehicle brands, addressing criticism that decision-making had been too centralized in Wolfsburg and too slow.For the last week, Volkswagen, one of the global auto industry\u2019s biggest corporations, has been dealing with the fallout of revelations that millions of its vehicles were enabled with software meant to deliberately trick diesel air-quality tests.The deception enabled Volkswagen diesel cars to pass air-quality tests in a lab setting but emit pollutants up to 40 times the allowable United States limits when actually driven, a ruse that enabled the cars to have more power and better fuel economy than they would have been able to achieve. Volkswagen has admitted that the devices exist in 11 million cars worldwide.Volkswagen said employees had been suspended in connection with the scandal, but did not name them. The company said it would hire an American law firm, which it did not identify, to conduct an internal investigation of the emissions deception. Berthold Huber, a labor leader who is the acting chairman of the company\u2019s supervisory board, attributed the deceit to \u201cdevelopers and technicians\u201d in the company\u2019s motor development operations. The company indicated that further dismissals were likely to follow.In the United States on Friday, federal regulators announced a rigorous new series of road tests to determine whether other automakers had used software to cheat on emissions testing.Officials of the Environmental Protection Agency said carmakers selling vehicles in the United States were informed that the spot checks were meant to find so-called defeat devices like those used by Volkswagen.Agency officials did not say whether they suspected any specific carmaker of installing the illegal devices, but vowed to inspect a wide range of new and used models.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to tell them what these tests are, and they don\u2019t need to know,\u201d said Christopher Grundler, head of the agency\u2019s office of transportation and air quality. The E.P.A. defended its standard laboratory emissions tests, even as it announced the new unspecified road tests. Mr. Grundler said the agency\u2019s standard tests, which every car must pass in order to be sold, were robust and responsible for substantial improvements in air quality.Janet McCabe, the agency\u2019s acting assistant administrator, said the level of standardized testing was not at fault for Volkswagen\u2019s ability to skew emissions performance with illegal equipment, blaming the automaker\u2019s actions.Ms. McCabe said the agency\u2019s investigation into Volkswagen action was continuing. The Justice Department is also investigating the company, as are a number of state attorneys general.The government can assign penalties of $37,500 for each vehicle that fraudulently passed the tests. Last week, officials told Volkswagen to recall 482,000 vehicles, bringing the potential fines to about $18 billion, though analysts expect the actual penalty to be smaller.Mr. Grundler said it appeared that the 2015 models would be fixed more quickly than the older vehicles, but he did not specify a timetable. He said consumers would need to wait for an official recall notice from Volkswagen for repairs. Until then, he said, \u201cthese cars are safe and legal to drive.\u201dAlso on Friday, the German government said it had identified 2.8 million Volkswagen vehicles in that country that were equipped with the illegal software, including cars with several different engines as well as some commercial vehicles. As the investigations into Volkswagen\u2019s deception multiply and broaden, the pressure rises on Mr. M\u00fcller to both cooperate with regulators and restore the carmaker\u2019s battered reputation. Since Mr. M\u00fcller, 62, moved into the top job at Porsche in 2010, after its takeover by Volkswagen, he has won praise for increasing sales and profits at the sports car maker while preserving its cachet among aficionados. Many had worried that the merger with Volkswagen would dilute the purity of the Porsche brand.But managing the far-flung Volkswagen empire is a challenge of a different magnitude, even without the emissions scandal. Volkswagen sales in China, the company\u2019s biggest single market, have been slowing, and they have been plummeting in Brazil, another important country. The company\u2019s market share in the European Union slipped to 26.5 percent in August from 28.1 percent a year earlier, though Volkswagen still has more than twice the share of any competitor.The company\u2019s management has been criticized for being unwieldy, and on Friday it said it would create a new organization for North America, combining the Mexican, Canadian and United States markets. Winfried Vahland, who has been in charge of the company\u2019s Skoda unit, which is based in the Czech Republic and makes lower-price vehicles, will head the new regional organization.However, Michael Horn will remain as chief executive of the Volkswagen Group of America, the company said. Despite the emissions scandal, Volkswagen dealers in the United States in recent days expressed strong support for Mr. Horn and urged the company to keep him in place.Volkswagen also said that Christian Klingler, its top sales and marketing executive, would leave the company but that his departure reflected \u201cdifferences with regard to business strategy\u201d and was \u201cnot related to recent events.\u201dMembers of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board read statements Friday and insisted that they would not take questions. But Mr. M\u00fcller, after speaking of a new beginning for the board, making it more flexible, found one question important enough to answer: Had he been aware of the effort to design and install the manipulative software?\u201cI definitively knew nothing about it,\u201d he said, before rising quickly with the others and leaving the room.Volkswagen\u2019s structure is unlike any other automaker\u2019s. More than half the shares are owned by members of the Porsche family, who have feuded among themselves, resulting in power struggles that have haunted the company for decades.\u201cThe Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families stand behind Volkswagen, even in these difficult times,\u201d said Wolfgang Porsche, a member of the Volkswagen supervisory board who represents the interests of the family, referring to the branch of the family that includes Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, the former Volkswagen chairman.Mr. Pi\u00ebch, a dominant figure in Volkswagen for decades, resigned as chairman in April after a power struggle with Mr. Winterkorn. Wolfgang Porsche, Mr. Pi\u00ebch\u2019s cousin, backed Mr. Winterkorn.\u201cVolkswagen has no corporate governance,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows the auto industry. \u201cThere is no clear border between oversight and management. It has to be made into a normal company.\u201dMr. M\u00fcller, who studied machine tool making and later information technology, has worked at Volkswagen since 1977, primarily in the company\u2019s Audi unit, based in the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt. He has an advantage of understanding the company well, but some corporate governance experts say Volkswagen should hire an outsider with no stake in the existing order.\u201cThe research shows that when there\u2019s a perception of a need for change on a large scale, outsiders do better,\u201d said Jo-Ellen Pozner, an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt just sends a more credible signal.\u201dMr. M\u00fcller said he was determined that the company would move forward.\u201cWe will overcome this crisis,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said. \u201cWe will emerge a stronger company.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Bill Vlasic from Detroit.

{"Headline": "Barriers for Women in the Workplace", "Date": "2015-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersReaders discuss work-family balance for women in today\u2019s corporate culture.I fully support Ms. Slaughter\u2019s argument. But I\u2019ve been deeply troubled by her equation of \u201chaving it all\u201d and having children. Women have multifaceted interests, priorities and pursuits \u2014 one of which may or may not be motherhood. More important, I\u2019m troubled by blaming women\u2019s paucity in the senior ranks on a competitive environment marked by long hours, which (naturally) privileges those without children.As a 27-year veteran of the diversity and inclusion field, I have done research showing that the barriers women face as they work their way up the corporate ladder are far more pervasive and insidious than a culture of long hours. Stereotypes about what women can and want to do continue to abound \u2014 and work to surreptitiously hold women back. Disparate access to the informal networks that are so critical to moving up the ladder are another enormous barrier. Mentoring and sponsorship of women also play a critical role; there is still a gender imbalance here.While I applaud Ms. Slaughter for her focus on the systemic roots of women\u2019s workplace inequality, she\u2019s doing a disservice by not taking up the case in its entirety. Without rigorous attention to the many and varied mechanisms, systems and cultural mores that combine to affect women\u2019s careers, we can expect to see little progress in this area.PAULETTE R. GERKOVICHBrooklynTo the Editor: I did a double take of recognition at these sentences: \u201cBut many women who started out with all the ambition in the world find themselves in a place they never expected to be. They do not choose to leave their jobs; they are shut out by the refusal of their bosses to make it possible for them to fit their family life and their work life together.\u201dWhile struggling to balance working full time as a physician with caring for my dying father, my special-needs daughter and my 90-year-old aunt who had fallen and broken her hip, I requested that my boss allow me to go part time or telework. He denied these requests and explained to me how many other physicians were successfully making it all work. (Really?) I loved my work passionately, but I took an unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. In his world, where his wife was primarily caring for his children, my boss (a caring and thoughtful person) could not understand my struggle.There remains a profound misunderstanding in the workplace of the toxic level of expectations and stress under which women are working. Does anyone really wonder why there are so few women \u201cat the top\u201d?RUTH RODGERSCorte Madera, Calif.To the Editor: Ms. Slaughter does a nice job of framing the concerns about the contemporary workplace and its failure to understand the importance of meeting its workers where they are. I discovered years ago in my research that as women came into the workplace, they brought their traditional caregiver roles with them. That meant a new social reality of workers covering for one another as a colleague took an aging parent to the doctor, or as mothers got on the phone midafternoon to be sure their kids arrived home from school safely.There is not just a need for paid family leave, but also for a flexible use of work hours to manage other responsibilities. Most of this flies under the corporate radar, which is another reason for bosses to get out and walk around a little to better know their employees.TERRY L. SINGERLouisville, Ky.The writer is dean of the Kent School of Social Work, University of Louisville.To the Editor: Ms. Slaughter says we used to have an infrastructure of care called \u201cwomen at home.\u201d Given our struggle today to fill this gap in care, you would think that we would do more to encourage those with the luxury to provide the care to choose to do so. Instead, the clear cultural message for two generations of women has been that if you aren\u2019t earning a wage, you aren\u2019t working, and if you are a well-educated woman, child care is beneath you.Is it any wonder, then, that so many capable women drawn to stay home feel that they must deny this inclination and stay in the work force where they will be respected? Some have flouted public opinion and stayed home anyway. Nevertheless, we waste a valuable resource by making a good-hearted and intelligent group of nurturers feel small.MARGARET McGIRRGreenwich, Conn.Leaving my job was an easy choice for me, but one that few parents can realistically make. Economic conditions still favor employers, who are unmotivated to change their ways when there are plenty of people willing to work the hours.Finally, Ms. Slaughter errs when she talks only of traditional family structures, rather then parents more generally.JENNIFER LYNN-WHALEYBerkeley, Calif.To the Editor: Toward the end of \u201cA Toxic Work World\u201d is a public policy agenda worthy of highlighting: \u201cTo support care just as we support competition, we will need some combination of the following: high-quality and affordable child care and elder care; paid family and medical leave for women and men; a right to request part-time or flexible work; investment in early education comparable to our investment in elementary and secondary education; comprehensive job protection for pregnant workers; higher wages and training for paid caregivers; community support structures to allow elders to live at home longer; and reform of elementary and secondary school schedules to meet the needs of a digital rather than an agricultural economy.\u201dKudos, Ms. Slaughter.KATHARINE H.

{"Headline": "Democracy and the Challenges Imposed by Freedom", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Democracy in 21st CenturyWestern democracy always seems to be in crisis \u2014 which may be its greatest strength. When the dizzying velocity of change seems the only constant in the world, democracy has proved supple and stable enough to respond, adapt and evolve and, thereby, endure.Among the challenges Western democracies face today, none are more surprising and complex than that posed by their steadfast bedfellow: freedom. Unlike authoritarian and repressive forces, the problems posed by freedom are especially tricky because they stem from democracy\u2019s deepest values and highest expression. They represent a bottom-up revolution led by the choices people are allowed to make rather than those they are forced to. Thanks to powerful and plentiful new technologies as well as deepening commitments to universal human rights, individuals around the world are enjoying an explosion of freedom. This phenomenon is apparent across the landscape, but nowhere more profoundly than in the far freer flows of people (immigration), goods (the global economy) and information (social media and the Internet).The popular tools and ideas empowering individuals to chart their own course, however, are weakening the ties that have long bound democratic communities together. In myriad ways they are rattling the foundation upon which Western democracy has long stood \u2014 the common purpose and identity that has inspired what John Stuart Mill called the necessary sense of \u201cfellow feeling.\u201d\u201cSomething has fundamentally changed at the foundation of society, in how we relate to one another,\u201d said Marc J. Dunkelman of Brown University, whose books include \u201cThe Vanishing Neighbor.\u201d \u201cThe truth is that you can\u2019t expect the institutions that existed and worked well in one context of community to continue to operate as effectively when the ground is shifting beneath them.\u201dStart with immigration \u2014 a timeless phenomenon that presents new and contemporary problems. It is easy to forget that until the 1960s Europe was a source, rather than a recipient, of immigrants. And although the United States has long been known as a nation of immigrants, restrictive policies limited the flow until 1965, when policy changes helped introduce a new era of legal and illegal immigration.The challenge of absorbing these newcomers has increased in recent years because of the increased ability of people once trapped in poor and distant lands to seek a better life in the West. \u201cFor all its hardships, migration is an enormous exercise of freedom by people to have better lives,\u201d said Peter H. Schuck, a professor at Yale Law School who has written extensively on immigration. \u201cManaging that flow is increasingly difficult because governments are rightly sensitive to human rights concerns, so that they cannot simply turn these people away without affording them some procedural rights.\u201dAs advances in transportation have helped make migration less expensive, new communication technologies are giving people a greater ability to stay in touch with their homelands and maintain their cultural distinctiveness. This, combined with larger critiques of assimilationist pressures and a greater respect for multiculturalism, diminishes the pressure on immigrants to adopt the beliefs, values and assumptions of their adopted countries.Numerous studies have found that, instead of bringing people together, diversity can alienate people from one another, leading to breakdowns in social trust. Robert D. Putnam, a professor of political science at Harvard, has argued that diversity often leads people toward \u201chunkering down,\u201d or self-segregation. So too does the freer flow of goods and ideas represented by globalization. That is what Gal Ariely of the University of Haifa in Israel found in a study of data from 63 countries. \u201cOn average, in those countries that benefit from a more relatively free spread of ideas and information, flow of goods and capital, people are less likely to be very proud of their country, less willing to fight for their country and less likely to support ethnic criteria for national membership,\u201d Mr. Ariely wrote. \u201cTherefore, these results support the argument that globalization is related to the decline of national identity.\u201dEven as new technologies are empowering some people to see themselves as parts of larger communities, the Internet provides others with the freedom to create their own identities. As a result, society is becoming more compartmentalized, said Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist whose books include \u201cThe End of History and the Last Man.\u201d He noted that \u201ctechnology allows people to organize better and share so that you have, for instance, many online communities that did not exist 20 years ago. You used to have to share things with people you didn\u2019t have much in common with, except that they lived on your street.\u201dMr. Fukuyama said this belied the notion that we are witnessing the wholesale breakdown of community and the social fabric. Instead, our social ties are evolving into new types of relationships and associations.Because it represents profound change, this trend poses threats to the traditional foundations of democratic societies. Dovetailing with other powerful forces emphasizing individualism and anti-authority stances, it has been linked to remarkable declines in trust \u2014 in most major institutions as well as in fellow citizens \u2014 throughout much of the West, and especially in the United States, since the 1970s.Advancing freedom is far from the only challenge to Western democracies, and its effects are amplified by other forces. Chief among these are the perceived failure of European and American leaders to respond effectively to various crises, including income inequality and economic stagnation.The irony is that bonds that tie citizens to their communities, the shared sense of purpose and identity that greases the wheels of collective action in democracies, are fraying at a time when people are increasingly dependent upon ever more powerful states to solve difficult problems.In the short run, this could have anti-democratic effects, especially through the rise of reactionary political groups that seek to limit freedom or the continued efforts of entrenched elites to impose their policies on a recalcitrant or tuned-out public.If the past is prologue, however, democratic societies will evolve to meet the needs of an ever-changing world. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a period of epic lag where the foundation of democracy has shifted and the institutions haven\u2019t shifted to reflect that new reality,\u201d Mr. Dunkelman said. \u201cThe miracle of democracy isn\u2019t that it somehow solves all the challenges facing the people that it governs but that it has proven malleable enough to develop new institutions calibrated to new norms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnophoriaWhat kind of tunes do you think Iago, the villain in William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cOthello,\u201d would listen to if he had an iPhone?That is the kind of question that Laura Randazzo, an exuberant English teacher, often dreams up to challenge her students at Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, Calif.So, when Ms. Randazzo heard about TeachersPayTeachers.com, a virtual marketplace where educators can buy and sell lesson plans, she was curious to find out whether the materials she had created for her own students would appeal to other educators.\u201cFor a buck, a teacher has a really good tool that she can use with any work of literature,\u201d Ms. Randazzo said in a phone interview last week. \u201cKids love it because it\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s also rigorous because they have to support their characterizations with evidence.\u201dShe clearly has a knack for understanding the kinds of classroom aids that other teachers are looking for. One of her best-selling items is a full-year collection of high school grammar, vocabulary and literature exercises. It has generated sales on TeachersPayTeachers of about $100,000.Speaking from her tiny home office, formerly a bedroom closet, Ms. Randazzo still sounded amazed at her success.\u201cWhat started out as a hobby has turned into a business,\u201d she said.Teachers often spend hours preparing classroom lesson plans to reinforce the material students are required to learn, and many share their best materials with colleagues. Founded in 2006, TeachersPayTeachers speeds up this lesson-plan prep work by monetizing exchanges between teachers and enabling them to make faster connections with farther-flung colleagues.To date, Teacher Synergy, the company behind the site, has paid about $175 million to its teacher-authors, says Adam Freed, the company\u2019s chief executive. The site takes a 15 percent commission on most sales.A former chief operating officer of Etsy and former director of international product management at Google, Mr. Freed is a veteran of data-driven growth companies. By selling tens of thousands of items, he says, 12 teachers on the site have become millionaires and nearly 300 teachers have earned more than $100,000. On any given day, the site has about 1.7 million lesson plans, quizzes, work sheets, classroom activities and other items available, typically for less than $5. Last month alone, Mr. Freed added, more than one million teachers in the United States downloaded material, including free and fee-based products, from the site.\u201cIf you have a kid in school in America, they are interacting somewhere with TeachersPayTeachers\u2019 content,\u201d Mr. Freed said in an interview last week at the company\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan.Last week, for instance, TeachersPayTeachers introduced an iPhone app from which educators can buy materials. The app replaced an older version that allowed users to look up products but, oddly enough, not to purchase them.\u201cWe were not a technology company until very recently. We were a teaching marketplace with a technology underlay,\u201d Mr. Freed said. \u201cNow we are trying to be both.\u201dThe site\u2019s popularity with teachers reflects the convergence of a number of trends in education and technology.For one thing, school districts around the country have been introducing new learning objectives, called Common Core state standards, for different grade levels. That has sent tens of thousands of educators to TeachersPayTeachers looking for lessons to reinforce particular math and reading standards \u2014 like the requirement that sixth graders and older students be able to delineate and evaluate the argument in a given text.At a time when many politicians, technology executives and philanthropists are pushing novel digital tools for education, many teachers are also seeking old-school offline techniques that other teachers have perfected over the years in their classrooms. That has positioned TeachersPayTeachers as a kind of Etsy for education.\u201cA lot of the stuff you see in the digital world that is interactive, teachers are making them in analog form,\u201d Mr. Freed said, noting that many teacher-to-teacher products are PDF or zip files meant to be downloaded and printed out.As an example, he cited an \u201cInteractive Reading Literature Notebook,\u201d developed by Ms. Cobb. In her lesson plans, \u201cinteractive\u201d does not refer to digital video or audio. It means students are asked to actively learn by, in part, cutting out and gluing assignments into their notebooks, taking deep notes in class and sometimes even drawing illustrations to demonstrate that they understood the reading.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of creativity and innovation,\u201d Mr. Freed said, \u201cbut it is tried and true in a lot of its methodology.\u201dFor teachers, building a successful business on TeachersPayTeachers may also entail a lot of work.She added that many teachers considered TeachersPayTeachers credible because they can find ideas from more experienced teachers who face the same classroom challenges they do.\u201cThat is what ground-level teachers are able to do that textbook publishers can\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Randazzo said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Tech Has Become Way Too Powerful", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBerkeley, Calif. \u2014 CONSERVATIVES and liberals interminably debate the merits of \u201cthe free market\u201d versus \u201cthe government.\u201d Which one you trust more delineates the main ideological divide in America.Two centuries ago slaves were among the nation\u2019s most valuable assets, and after the Civil War, perhaps land was. Then factories, machines, railroads and oil transformed America. By the 1920s most working Americans were employees, and the most contested property issue was their freedom to organize into unions.Now information and ideas are the most valuable forms of property. Most of the cost of producing it goes into discovering it or making the first copy. After that, the additional production cost is often zero. Such \u201cintellectual property\u201d is the key building block of the new economy. Without government decisions over what it is, and who can own it and on what terms, the new economy could not exist.But as has happened before with other forms of property, the most politically influential owners of the new property are doing their utmost to increase their profits by creating monopolies that must eventually be broken up.Whenever markets become concentrated, consumers end up paying more than they otherwise would, and innovations are squelched. Sure, big platforms let creators showcase and introduce new apps, songs, books, videos and other content. But almost all of the profits go to the platforms\u2019 owners, who have all of the bargaining power.Contrary to the conventional view of an American economy bubbling with innovative small companies, the reality is quite different. The rate at which new businesses have formed in the United States has slowed markedly since the late 1970s. Big Tech\u2019s sweeping patents, standard platforms, fleets of lawyers to litigate against potential rivals and armies of lobbyists have created formidable barriers to new entrants.The patent system is crucial to innovation. The law gives 20 years of patent protection to inventions that are \u201cnew and useful,\u201d as decided by the Patent and Trademark Office. But the winners are big enough to game the system. They make small improvements warranting new patents, effectively making their intellectual property semipermanent. They also lay claim to whole terrains of potential innovation including ideas barely on drawing boards and flood the system with so many applications that lone inventors have to wait years. The White House intellectual property adviser Colleen V. Chien noted in 2012 that Google and Apple were spending more money acquiring patents (not to mention litigating them) than on doing research and development.Antitrust laws used to fight this sort of market power. In the 1990s, the federal government accused Microsoft of illegally bundling its popular Windows operating system with its Internet Explorer browser to create an industry standard that stifled competition. Microsoft settled the case by agreeing to share its programming interfaces with other companies. But since then Big Tech has been almost immune to serious antitrust scrutiny, even though the largest tech companies have more market power than ever. Maybe that\u2019s because they\u2019ve accumulated so much political power.In 2012, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Bureau of Competition submitted to the commissioners a 160-page analysis of Google\u2019s dominance in the search and related advertising markets, and recommended suing Google for conduct that \u201chas resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d But the commissioners chose not to pursue a case. Investigators also found evidence that Google was pushing its products ahead of competitors\u2019 on search results, though no legal action was recommended on this point.It\u2019s unusual for commissioners not to accept staff recommendations, and they didn\u2019t give a full explanation. The F.T.C. noted a competing internal report that recommended against legal action, but another plausible reason has to do with Google\u2019s political clout. Google is now among the largest corporate lobbyists in the United States. Around the time of the investigation the company poured money into influencing both the commissioners and the commission\u2019s congressional overseers.GOOGLE is heading into a major fight with antitrust officials in the European Union for some of the same reasons the F.T.C. staff went after it. Not incidentally, Europe is also investigating Amazon for allegedly stifling competition in e-books, and Apple for doing the same in music. While many on this side of the Atlantic believe Europe is taking on these tech giants because they\u2019re American, another possible explanation is that Google, Amazon and Apple lack as much political clout in Europe as they have here.Economic and political power can\u2019t be separated because dominant corporations gain political influence over how markets are maintained and enforced, which enlarges their economic power further. One of the original goals of antitrust law was to prevent this.\u201cThe enterprises of the country are aggregating vast corporate combinations of unexampled capital, boldly marching, not for economical conquests only, but for political power,\u201d warned Edward G. Ryan, the chief justice of Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, in 1873. Antitrust law was viewed as a means of breaking this link. \u201cIf we will not endure a king as a political power,\u201d Senator John Sherman of Ohio thundered, \u201cwe should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale\u201d of what the nation produced.Sherman\u2019s Antitrust Act easily passed Congress and was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison on July 2, 1890. Twelve years later, President Teddy Roosevelt used it against the Northern Securities Company, which dominated rail transportation in the Northwest. In 1911, President William Howard Taft broke up the Standard Oil empire.The underlying issue has little to do with whether one prefers the \u201cfree market\u201d or government. The real question is how government organizes the market, and who has the most influence over its decisions. We are now in a new gilded age similar to the first Gilded Age, when the nation\u2019s antitrust laws were enacted. As then, those with great power and resources are making the \u201cfree market\u201d function on their behalf. Big Tech \u2014 along with the drug, insurance, agriculture and financial giants \u2014 dominates both our economy and our politics.Yet as long as we remain obsessed by the debate over the relative merits of the \u201cfree market\u201d and \u201cgovernment,\u201d we have little hope of seeing what\u2019s occurring and taking the action that\u2019s needed to make our economy work for the many, not the few.Frank Bruni is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One of the World\u2019s Most Powerful Central Bankers Is Worried About Climate Change", "Date": "2015-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsA new speech about climate change is fascinating both for what it says and who said it.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, declared that the warming climate presented major risks for the global economy and global financial stability, and that businesses and regulators needed to move more quickly to try to contain the potential economic damage even though it may seem uncertain and far off.\u201cWe don\u2019t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors \u2014 imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late.\u201dMr. Carney calls the economic challenges around climate the \u201ctragedy of the horizon,\u201d in contrast to the long-noted economic phenomenon of the \u201ctragedy of the commons.\u201d That is, the costs of a warming climate come on a time scale and with an uncertainty that go beyond the usual multiyear business cycle, beyond political cycles of presidential and parliamentary elections, or as he puts it, beyond \u201cthe horizon of technocratic authorities, like central banks, who are bound by their mandates.\u201dIt might seem odd for a central banker to be talking about a long-term problem of global climate, all the more so when the global economy is looking rather shaky. After all, the job is typically to worry about price inflation and the banking system.But if you back up and define a central banker\u2019s job a little more broadly \u2014 to worrying about the economy and the stability of the financial system writ large \u2014 it quickly becomes clear why climate matters.Consider that a housing bubble largely concentrated in a handful of Sun Belt American states, Spain and Ireland set in motion events that eight years ago caused a financial crisis from which the world economy has still not fully healed. It\u2019s easy to imagine how the effects of a shifting climate could similarly ripple through both the financial system and the real economy in ways that are impossible to predict with any precision today.Global insurers are already facing a higher frequency of large, expensive disasters from extreme weather, and in the future could face untold liabilities as the losers from a warming planet try to extract compensation from the (insured) companies that profited from fossil fuel production. It was no coincidence that Mr. Carney delivered his speech at the three-century-old insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London.Those energy extraction industries, which include many of the planet\u2019s biggest companies, could one day face existential risk. If global governments get more aggressive about restricting carbon emissions, it could mean that billions of investment in oil and gas extraction will be rendered useless and undermine both some of the most widely held investments and the government finances of oil-producing regions.These risks are uncertain, of course, as are the legal exposures, but Mr. Carney said that we \u201cknow all too well that what appear to be low-probability risks can evolve into large and unforeseen costs over a larger time scale.\u201dThose are things Mr. Carney mentions specifically in his speech, but one can easily envision other economic and financial ripple effects. Consider agriculture \u2014 both farmers themselves and the banks that issue loans on those farms \u2014 which could face losses in areas that become unsuitable for growing lucrative crops.More subtly, expensive efforts at remediation \u2014 spending to try to contain the damage of climate change \u2014 could crowd out other forms of investment. Think of it this way: Sorry, we can\u2019t afford to repair this bridge in Kentucky because interest rates are too high because Florida is borrowing so much money to try to keep Miami inhabitable.There is no certainty that any of these threats will materialize on a large enough scale to carry meaningful economic or financial risk. But any of them, or others that are harder to imagine, could well do so.A British official like Mr. Carney has particular incentive to worry about these matters: London is a key center for managers of global financial risk, with its insurers and other financial services. And he notes that 19 percent of the British stock market value is in energy extraction.But while each country might have its own mix of economic and financial risks from climate, this new speech from the Bank of England is a signal that others entrusted with managing economic risk might want these risks on their radar, even if the tools to combat them today are limited.There\u2019s little doubt that other large and powerful institutions, whether banks, insurers, industrial giants or regulatory agencies, will have to deal with these issues. Think of Mr. Carney\u2019s speech as a call to begin that work sooner, rather than later.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Enacting Cap-and-Trade Will Present Challenges Under China\u2019s System", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 American officials have applauded President Xi Jinping\u2019s commitment to a national market for greenhouse gas quotas as a breakthrough in environmental cooperation.But to work well, Mr. Xi\u2019s pledge, made at the White House on Friday, will demand big changes from a Chinese government accustomed to heavy-handed intervention and skewed statistics. It will take years of effort to build a substantial market that plays a major role in curbing emissions, and even then, it could founder, like similar initiatives elsewhere, experts said.China has had local trials underway since 2013. Their records have been mixed, supported by the liberal doling out of emissions permits or by cajoling companies to take part. Expanding those initial efforts nationwide by 2017, as Mr. Xi pledged to do, will be daunting even for China\u2019s authoritarian leaders.Mr. Yang and other policy experts said that Mr. Xi\u2019s target date would be just the start of a national trading plan, which would initially include big companies in several industries.Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201ccap and trade\u201d system would cover power, iron and steel, chemicals, building materials, papermaking and nonferrous metals. But the big transport sector has been left out for now.\u201cWe\u2019ll face the question of how to reduce emissions in industries and sectors not covered by emissions trading schemes,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cThen there\u2019ll be coordination issues between the different policies and sectors. It\u2019s complicated.\u201dMr. Xi arrived in Washington to doubts that his government was serious about market overhauls, reducing pollution or shouldering global burdens. He hoped to rebuff those criticisms by promising to recruit the forces of capitalism to tame the smokestack pollution driving global warming.So-called cap-and-trade programs limit the amount of pollution that companies can emit and then let them pay competitive prices for a share of the quota. Companies that do not use their entire quota can sell the remainder, while those that need more than their quota have to buy additional permits.To create a system that works for China, regulators must develop policies and trading platforms that give companies confidence that they are being treated equally and transparently as they buy and sell emission permits. If China\u2019s stock market is any guide, plenty of investors say their experience is often the opposite.\u201cThere\u2019s been a debate in Western countries about whether or not China is a market system,\u201d said Qi Ye, the director of the Climate Policy Institute of Tsinghua University in Beijing. \u201cEurope certainly is a market system, so if Europe cannot do an emissions trading system well, how would you expect China to have a successful carbon market?\u201dFor now, United States officials and many environmental groups have welcomed the plan as a stimulus for negotiations on a new global climate change treaty in Paris in December. Chinese officials have said before that they want to establish a nationwide emissions market by 2017, but Mr. Xi\u2019s declaration will put presidential weight behind that goal, the officials said.\u201cThe world\u2019s second-largest economy puts in place a price on carbon emissions, and this will be noted the world over,\u201d Professor Jotzo said. \u201cIf successful, it can grow into playing a major role in facilitating China\u2019s objectives for a cleaner energy and industrial system.\u201dA growing number of scientists now say that China\u2019s slowing economy and weakening dependence on heavy industry for growth make a peak by 2025 feasible.China\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are about double those of the United States, the second-biggest polluter. That has magnified international pressure on Beijing to do more to avert climate change. But Mr. Xi appears unlikely to budge from his more conservative peak date.Experts and policy advisers said the proposed national carbon trading plan would test a government that, during stock market turbulence in recent months, has shown that it can swiftly turn against private investors and subvert transparency.He added: \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that this will go smoothly. But this coming from the head of state, Xi, gives more confidence that this is going to be fairly significant and is a lot less likely to be watered down.\u201dSince 2013, China has experimented with pilot plans across seven economically varied areas, including Beijing and Guangdong Province, that allow designated companies to buy and sell the right to use power, burn fossil fuels and release carbon dioxide into the air.The trial plans initially struggled with murky rules; reluctant companies picked by the government to take part; and regulators inexperienced in measuring how much pollution factories, boilers and buildings release. Similar problems have troubled carbon markets in advanced economies like Europe, and several experts said China\u2019s markets were improving.That process will start when big companies in several industrial sectors, including steel, chemicals and construction materials, set quotas and prices so they can start trading the right to consume power and fossil fuels, Mr. Wang and other researchers familiar with China\u2019s plans said.Chinese officials have been studying that market and others. But the lessons have not always been promising. Europe\u2019s emissions trading system has stumbled amid criticism that it gave out emissions permits too generously and failed to make companies change their energy habits.\u201cCarbon emissions trading requires a trading exchange, third party inspection, and then there\u2019s a whole lot of monitoring and verification,\u201d said Mr. Yang from the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThe transaction costs are very high.\u201dThe challenges in China are compounded by unreliable statistics, corruption and local officials who have made blazing economic growth a point of honor. Overcoming those problems will demand far-reaching changes to the energy sector, so that trading emissions translates into reduced consumption of coal and other polluting fuels, several experts said.Under China\u2019s plans, the government would not place an overall cap on carbon dioxide emissions, an idea the government has rejected as premature.Instead, the system favored by Chinese policy makers would limit emissions for designated companies in certain industries. The companies would obtain quotas for their emissions through allocations, auctions or initial purchases.\u201cA national scheme can become effective over time,\u201d said Professor Jotzo, from the Australian National University. \u201cIt will not be the biggest factor in China\u2019s climate change policy toolbox at the start, and perhaps not for some time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe wounds of segregation were still raw in the 1970s. With only rare exceptions, African-American children had nowhere near the same educational opportunities as whites.Achievements like these breathe hope into our belief in the Land of Opportunity. They build trust in education as a leveling force powering economic mobility. \u201cWe do have a track record of reducing these inequalities,\u201d said Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia University.But the question remains: Why did we stop there?The problem, of course, doesn\u2019t start in college.Their story goes sour very early, and it gets worse as it goes along. On the day they start kindergarten, children from families of low socioeconomic status are already more than a year behind the children of college graduates in their grasp of both reading and math.And despite the efforts deployed by the American public education system, nine years later the achievement gap, on average, will have widened by somewhere from one-half to two-thirds.Even the best performers from disadvantaged backgrounds, who enter kindergarten reading as well as the smartest rich kids, fall behind over the course of their schooling.The challenges such children face compared to their more fortunate peers are enormous. Children from low socioeconomic backgrounds are seven times more likely to have been born to a teenage mother. Only half live with both parents, compared with 83 percent of the children of college graduates.The children of less educated parents suffer higher obesity rates, have more social and emotional problems and are more likely to report poor or fair health. And because they are much poorer, they are less likely to afford private preschool or the many enrichment opportunities \u2014 extra lessons, tutors, music and art, elite sports teams \u2014 that richer, better-educated parents lavish on their children.When they enter the public education system, they are shortchanged again. Eleven-year-olds from the wrong side of the tracks are about one-third more likely to have a novice teacher, according to Professor Waldfogel and her colleagues. They are much more likely to be held back a grade, a surefire way to stunt their development, the researchers say.Financed mainly by real estate taxes that are more plentiful in neighborhoods with expensive homes, public education is becoming increasingly compartmentalized. Well-funded schools where the children of the affluent can play and learn with each other are cordoned off from the shabbier schools teaching the poor, who are still disproportionally from black or Hispanic backgrounds.Perhaps pre-K programs serving poor and minority children have trouble attracting good teachers. Perhaps classrooms with more disadvantaged children are more difficult to manage. Perhaps teachers offer more basic instruction because disadvantaged children need to catch up. In any event, Ms. Valentino told me, \u201cthe gaps are huge.\u201d\u201cIf we could equalize achievement from age zero to 14,\u201d Professor Waldfogel told me, \u201cthat would go a long way toward closing the college enrollment and completion gaps.\u201dIt can be done. Australia, Canada \u2014 even the historically class-ridden Britain \u2014 show much more equitable outcomes.The policy prescriptions go beyond improving teachers and curriculums, or investing in bringing struggling students up to speed. They include helping parents, too: teaching them best practices in parenting, raising their pay and helping them with the overlapping demands of work and family.And yet the strains from our world of increasing income inequality raise doubts about our ability to narrow the educational divide. Poorer, less educated parents simply can\u2019t keep up with the rich, who are spending hand over fist to ensure that their children end at the front of the rat race. Our public school system has proved no match to the forces reproducing inequality across the generations.Fifty years ago, the black-white proficiency gap was one and a half to two times as large as the gap between a child from a family at the top 90th percentile of the income distribution and a child from a family at the 10th percentile, according to Professor Reardon at Stanford. Today, the proficiency gap between the poor and the rich is nearly twice as large as that between black and white children.In other words, even as one achievement gap narrowed, another opened wide. That kind of progress could dash one\u2019s hope in the leveling power of education.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Responsible for the Refugees?", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs a former adviser to the British prime minister, David Cameron, I understand the pressure politicians face from citizens demanding controlled immigration and tightly policed borders. As the son of immigrants welcomed into Britain from Communist Hungary, I feel a strong moral instinct to extend a similar welcome to others fleeing their homelands in even worse circumstances. But still. Before condemning European politicians, aid agencies or anyone else, let\u2019s try to cut through the complexity with some simple human truths.First, stop blaming Hungary. For months before this crisis hit the headlines in America, my hometown, Szeged, was the front line. Just days before I was there on a family vacation in July, 700 refugees were discovered in the woods where we used to play as children. My cousins told me, outraged, about the seemingly unending flow of new arrivals stealing fruit from their friends\u2019 trees and vegetables from their gardens; urinating and defecating in public places throughout the town; clogging up public services.You could say: How xenophobic. Or instead: How would you feel if your daily life was being made intolerable while the authorities, thanks to European Union rules about registering refugees, seemed unable to restore order? Hungary is small and relatively poor. It\u2019s a little unfair, to put it mildly, to condemn Hungary for callous \u2014 even racist \u2014 treatment of migrants when those doing the condemning bear far more responsibility for the crisis. Yes, America, I\u2019m talking about you.European leaders wanted, years ago, to intervene directly in Syria in order to check President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s cruelty; the United States didn\u2019t. You can understand why \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t for one second question the judgment of American political leaders that their country was reluctant to participate in another military conflict. But at least acknowledge the consequences of nonintervention: the protracted Syrian civil war, the emergence of a lawless territory ripe for exploitation by the sick zealots of the Islamic State, and the resulting flood of millions of displaced people.So it\u2019s a bit rich for American commentators to lecture Europeans when part of the reason the refugees are arriving on Europe\u2019s doorstep is American foreign policy. It\u2019s great that the United States is by far the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to Syrians, but America is bigger than Europe, and wealthier. Why should Europe be expected to take around a million refugees practically overnight and the United States, hardly any?There\u2019s one more simple truth to acknowledge. The ideal number of refugees is zero. Today\u2019s crisis will worsen in the years ahead unless we deal with the causes, not just the symptoms. That means serious and sustained action to create free societies people actually want to stay in. Places with a market economy, property rights, the rule of law, a free press, an independent judiciary and accountable democratic processes.This is America\u2019s chance to say, \u201cWe have a moral responsibility to help. So the United States will welcome as many refugees as Europe: Not just thousands; hundreds of thousands. But there has to be a bargain. We cannot keep doing this. So we will now embark on a new effort to bring the basics of a decent life to the world\u2019s hot spots.\u201dYes, it\u2019s a complicated world. But that\u2019s no excuse to do nothing. For America to lead in this way is not about imposing \u201cWestern values\u201d on the rest of the planet. It\u2019s much more basic than that. It\u2019s about treating every human being with humanity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hackers Took Fingerprints of 5.6 Million U.S. Workers, Government Says", "Date": "2015-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Just a day before the arrival of President Xi Jinping here for a meeting with President Obama that will be focused heavily on limiting cyberespionage, the Office of Personnel Management said\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that the hackers who stole security dossiers from the agency also got the fingerprints of 5.6 million federal employees.\u201cFederal experts believe that, as of now, the ability to misuse fingerprint data is limited,\u201d the agency said in a written statement. But clearly the uses are growing as biometrics are used more frequently to assure identity, in secure government facilities and even on personal iPhones.The working assumption of investigators is that China is building a huge database of information about American officials or contractors who may end up entering China or doing business with it. Fingerprints could become a significant part of that effort: While a Social Security number or a password can be changed, fingerprints cannot. Customs and immigration officials frequently fingerprint incoming travelers; millions of fingerprints in a Chinese database would help track the true identities of Americans entering the country. \u201cI am assuming there will be people we simply can\u2019t send to China,\u201d a senior intelligence official said this summer, before the most recent revelation. \u201cThat\u2019s only part of the damage.\u201dThe agency said that an \u201cinteragency working group,\u201d with help from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, \u201cwill review the potential ways adversaries could misuse fingerprint data now and in the future.\u201dOne of the biggest concerns about the breach of personnel records has been that China, or any other states given access to the data, could use it to identify intelligence agents, defense personnel or government contractors. Other data on the forms that were obtained, about matters as varied as bankruptcies and personal and sexual relationships, could be used for blackmail.Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been unsparing in their criticism of the personnel agency\u2019s handling of the data breach and its aftermath \u2014 and its habit of periodically revising upward the amount of information that was lost. Government officials have not been able to explain publicly why it took more than a year to discover that information was leaving its systems at a tremendous rate. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe massive new number of employees\u2019 fingerprints that was breached is shocking.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd it does little to instill confidence in O.P.M. that it took them so long to detect that the number was so much larger than originally thought.\u201dHe called for \u201clifetime identity protection coverage\u201d for the affected employees and contractors. But that assumes there was a financial motive to the theft; officials say it seems more likely that it was a national security motive. In testimony to a House committee recently, the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, said it had seen no evidence that the data lifted from the O.P.M. over more than a year had been used for any financial purpose, like gaining access to bank accounts or credit cards. In fact, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said over the summer that if the United States had the opportunity to steal that much data about an adversary, it would probably try to do it. And testifying to Congress alongside Admiral Rogers recently, he pushed back at members of Congress who called the breach at O.P.M. an \u201cattack.\u201d Instead, he suggested, it was ordinary espionage. Find out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.But despite those public statements, several officials have said in background briefings that the scale of the breach was so vast that it might require some kind of government response. Hackers did not just get the data on federal employees, but also on job applicants, contractors and many others who have been subjected to government background checks. \u201cIt was so big,\u201d one senior intelligence official said, \u201cthat we have to ask the question of whether the scope of it changed the nature of the theft.\u201dAlthough Mr. Obama has hinted at sanctions against China, largely for intellectual property theft, the administration has decided to put off the decision until after Mr. Xi\u2019s visit.Ahead of the meeting with Mr. Xi, administration officials have been coy about what form, and how extensive, any effort to come up with common rules for cyberspace may take. \u201cI don\u2019t want to suggest that we reached an arms control agreement here,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said on Tuesday in a briefing to reporters about Mr. Xi\u2019s visit.\u201cBut I do want to suggest that ultimately the goal here is we start from a common understanding that you have agreed-upon principles which we believe must include that cybertheft does not go forward.\u00a0And then as the two largest economies in the world, I think we can lead an effort to develop international norms that govern cyberactivity.\u201dBut he emphasized that America\u2019s main concern was the theft of intellectual property that is used by an adversary for commercial purposes. The breach does not fit into that category, and Mr. Obama has not said exactly how he would respond to it. videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Would Like to Buy Your Robotics Department", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "The Education IssueWhen the company wanted a team of roboticists, it raided a university lab to get them. Can high-tech academia survive today\u2019s Silicon Valley talent binge?Supported by\u2018\u2018I aged 10 years when that robot fell down, and I gained it back when he got up again,\u2019\u2019 says Herman Herman, the director of the center, who has worked there since its founding 20 years ago. The lab has come by its storied reputation by producing robot technology for clients like the American military and heavy-machinery manufacturers like John Deere and Caterpillar. Today the place is crammed with projects like \u2018\u2018Crusher,\u2019\u2019 an armor-plated military robot that can find its own way across craggy, wooded terrain, and a smaller wheeled robot designed to explore mines for the company Anglo American. Plaques hanging along a wall commemorate some of the hundreds of patents received over the years by the center\u2019s 100-person staff.There was something missing from the lab today, though. In February, a group of some 40 employees \u2014 including several longtime senior lab members \u2014 resigned. They had been lured away, en masse, by a new employer: Uber.The San Francisco firm, famous for its popular car-dispatch services, is getting into the robotics business itself. In February, barely a mile away, it opened the Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, where the former university researchers are now developing technologies to help Uber extend its reach over the roads. These include producing better maps and safer guidance systems \u2014 and most lucrative, even if they\u2019re still years away, Uber\u2019s very own fleet of self-driving cars.It was a startling raid of talent. By offering private-sector salaries substantially higher than university equivalents (as well as a chance to earn equity in a fast-rising tech firm), Uber was able to acquire a hefty chunk of the center\u2019s brain trust, including some top experts in autonomous vehicles. In doing so, the company has placed a bet that self-driving robots are no longer the stuff of scholarly visions but valuable intellectual property.Carnegie Mellon\u2019s experience is a familiar one in the world of high-tech research. As a field matures, universities can wake up one day to find money flooding the premises; suddenly they\u2019re in a talent war with deep-pocketed firms from Silicon Valley. The impacts are also intellectual. When researchers leave for industry, their expertise winks off the map; they usually can\u2019t publish what they discover \u2014 or even talk about it over drinks with former colleagues. In the long run, raids can generate symbiotic relationships; researchers who return to academia years later bring their real-world experience into the classroom and can draw on their network of wealthy industry contacts to fund university research. But as Carnegie Mellon\u2019s roboticists are finding, reaching that end point can make for a bumpy ride.Today\u2019s early-stage inquiry \u2014 so-called basic research, the Level 1 work, where scientists are still puzzling over fundamental questions \u2014 is financed almost exclusively by the federal government. It\u2019s too far out, too speculative, to attract much investment; it isn\u2019t clear if anyone will make any money on it. This wasn\u2019t always the case. Decades ago, corporations were more willing to engage in Level 1, moonshot research. Bell Labs supported the work that led to the transistor when it was far from clear that there would be a market for it; Xerox supported research into the \u2018\u2018windows\u2019\u2019 style of computing years before the market existed for such an interface. But in the last few decades, the vista of corporate R.&\u2009D. has shrunk as markets and executives have focused more on short-term profit, says Marc Kastner, an M.I.T. physicist. The far-off research questions have been left to university labs, though they struggle, too: The percentage of the federal budget devoted to basic research is about half of what it was in 1968.These days, private industry gets involved mostly when a field of research has matured to the midpoint of the NASA scale. In the \u201990s and early \u201900s this happened to \u2018\u2018machine learning,\u2019\u2019 the science of getting machines to recognize patterns. It had long been an academic concern. But once online firms like Google began grappling with \u2018\u2018big data\u2019\u2019 \u2014 search-engine requests, social-network behavior, email \u2014 the field became suddenly lucrative, and Silicon Valley started frantically hiring experts away from Stanford.Researchers who leave for industry are paid better, certainly, and often get sizable research budgets. But the intellectual register of their work changes. No more exploring hard, \u2018\u2018basic\u2019\u2019 problems out of deep curiosity; they need to solve problems that will make their employers money. When the computer scientist Andrew Moore left Carnegie Mellon to become a vice president of Google in 2006, his new job, he says, was to be \u2018\u2018as useful as possible to someone trying to buy something\u2019\u2019 \u2014 which is to say, to help Google\u2019s algorithms learn that the search query \u2018\u2018my basement is smelly\u2019\u2019 should point to a selection of dehumidifiers.At Carnegie Mellon, robotics scholars spent decades slowly approaching this moment. In 1979, the university founded its Robotics Institute to tackle the basic problems in the field, like how to interpret sensor data so a robot could \u2018\u2018see.\u2019\u2019 But by the \u201980s, government agencies and private firms struggling to create industrial and military robots were asking Carnegie Mellon\u2019s roboticists for help. To capitalize on this demand, the school established its National Robotics Engineering Center in 1995 and staffed it with a few faculty members and a large complement of full-time engineers, often young robotics graduates.In effect, Carnegie Mellon used the NASA scale to carve up its robotics research. The Robotics Institute would handle research from Levels 1 to 3 or 4, while the center would take technology from there and move it to 7. If John Deere approached the center for help with a self-driving tractor, for example, the center would produce a prototype that could be mass-produced while publishing its research publicly.\u2018\u2018Typically,\u2019\u2019 Legault says, \u2018\u2018people who call us, they\u2019ve been looking around, and there\u2019s nobody else who can solve their problem.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018If you\u2019re well versed in the area of robotics right now and you\u2019re not working on self-driving cars, you\u2019re either an idiot or you have more of a passion for something else,\u2019\u2019 says Jerry Pratt, head of a robotics team in Pensacola that worked on a humanoid robot that beat Carnegie Mellon\u2019s CHIMP in this year\u2019s contest. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a multibillion- if not trillion-dollar industry.\u2019\u2019This precise epiphany was dawning on many at the National Robotics Engineering Center. One was John Bares, who ran the lab from 1997 to 2010. He had always loved the intellectual challenge of the work but felt frustrated that his projects produced only prototypes for clients, who might do nothing with them. \u2018\u2018We\u2019d do a fantastic job engineering, do an advanced prototype, so-called throw it over the fence \u2014 and it would sit,\u2019\u2019 he told me. Bares wanted to invent something and then sell it himself. \u2018\u2018I just had the itch to do product,\u2019\u2019 he says. In 2010, he left the center to found a start-up, Carnegie Robotics. Within a year, his team built a robot that could detect land mines, which the Army bought.In 2014, Bares got an email from Uber that led to a meeting with its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Kalanick said he planned to open a lab in Pittsburgh and told Bares that Uber\u2019s mission was to increase the efficient use of cars, which would have environmental benefits. Bares was persuaded, and in January of this year he joined Uber. He knew that many of his former colleagues at Carnegie Mellon shared his entrepreneurial impulses.Back at the lab, in fact, a group was already preparing to break away. One of Uber\u2019s recent hires from the National Robotics Engineering Center told me that he and his 20-person team had long found their lab work rewarding, but that they had been stunned by the rush of money into robotics in recent years: Google bought Nest, the Internet-connected thermostat firm, for $3.2 billion; Makerbot, a start-up that creates inexpensive 3-D printers, was acquired by another company for $604 million. \u2018\u2018We were just flabbergasted,\u2019\u2019 he says, adding that his team could have invented those products \u2018\u2018in two weeks.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I have this big, well-tuned machine of a team, standing there looking at me saying, \u2018Hey, man, when the hell are we going to do something big?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he says. His response was: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m an entrepreneur at heart. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u2019 He visited venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and lined up tens of millions of dollars to fund a robotics start-up. By summer 2014, he informed the National Robotics Engineering Center that he and his team meant to exit on Jan. 1 this year.Then Bares made his own offer: Join Uber\u2019s new lab, where, he said, \u2018\u2018their efforts would impact the world.\u2019\u2019 The team would get bigger salaries, and Uber could produce their inventions quickly. The team leader agonized over the choice; he\u2019d spent the last year dreaming of his own start-up. But he opted for Uber. \u2018\u2018They have the road map, and they have the fuel,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018They just need some tech. Here they are with an actual market for what we do.\u2019\u2019The departures left Herman and Moore, who last year returned from Google to Carnegie Mellon as dean of the computer science school, scrambling to find replacements. They\u2019ve already hired a dozen new researchers, from institutions like Columbia University. In the long run, though, Moore says, they have to develop their own young scientists, encouraging robotics grad students to apply to the center: \u2018\u2018We\u2019re responsible for building all these duplicates of all these luminaries in robotics.\u2019\u2019Many familiar with Carnegie Mellon say the raid had a silver living, because it signals that the university is a hot place to work. One of those is Richard Florida, the urban-studies scholar who argues for the economic role of the \u2018\u2018creative class\u2019\u2019 in a city\u2019s economy. Florida himself was a social scientist at Carnegie Mellon for years, and his 2002 book, \u2018\u2018The Rise of the Creative Class,\u2019\u2019 was inspired in part by his noticing, in the \u201990s, that engineers there with a good high-tech idea had to leave for the East or West Coast to find investors, and they rarely came back. \u2018\u2018Pittsburgh has always been this caldron, but they couldn\u2019t get scale,\u2019\u2019 Florida says. \u2018\u2018What Uber provides is immediate scale.\u2019\u2019 And funding: This month, the company announced a $5.5 million gift to Carnegie Mellon to support a new robotics chair and three fellowships.A booming local industry gives \u2014 but also, inevitably, takes. Stanford gains luster from Silicon Valley, along with money for research. But the valley lures away promising scholars; in recent years, several have decamped to oversee online-course start-ups, for example, like Sebastian Thrun (who founded Udacity) and Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng (who created Coursera).\u2018\u2018Nobody is happy about that, but those are decisions that the faculty make, and they make them for rational reasons,\u2019\u2019 says Jennifer Widom, who led Stanford\u2019s computer-science department from 2009 to 2014. Short-term faculty stints in industry can be a good thing, she points out, because those who return can share with students their hard-won practical knowledge.Moore says there is still blue-sky work to be done in robotics. One example is the problem of \u2018\u2018grasping.\u2019\u2019 Sure, wheeled robots can steer themselves through an Amazon shipping center pretty accurately; a self-driving car can trundle around San Francisco without running people over. But no robot can yet match the dexterity of a human hand. It can\u2019t fluidly and confidently manipulate objects on a table \u2014 like picking up a coffee mug (assuming it can first identify it). This is, Moore notes, a huge research challenge in the humanitarian and health fields, because such robots could transform the lives of people with mobility issues, including both the elderly and people with spinal-cord injuries.\u2018\u2018There\u2019s maybe about one million people in the United States who, if they dropped their TV remote on the floor, just have to wait for a caregiver to come along and pick it up for them,\u2019\u2019 Moore says. Grasping is a classic early-stage technology, one that the Ubers of the world won\u2019t spend any time developing because the payoffs are too far away. Moore says he also wants this research done in a university setting so the results will be published openly and benefit the world at large.But given the lucrative payouts that come when Silicon Valley decides to invest in a field \u2014 compared with the evaporating federal funds for \u2018\u2018basic\u2019\u2019 research \u2014 will there even be academics who want to do early-stage, public-minded work?Based on my conversations at Carnegie Mellon, there are many such idealists left. One of them is Siddhartha Srinivasa, a leading expert on manipulation in the Robotics Institute who works on adding intelligence to robot limbs. Right now, someone with a spinal-cord injury can get a robot to pick up a spoon and use it to eat a meal. But the arm is so laborious to control that a single sip from a bowl takes fully 10 minutes. If Srinivasa succeeds, the arm will intuit a gesture (\u2018\u2018Feed me some soup\u2019\u2019) and complete the task on its own.Srinivasa is 37, and after a decade at Carnegie Mellon is frequently approached by firms \u2014 \u2018\u2018the Googles and Ubers and others of the world\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but he has yet to abandon academia. He says he doesn\u2019t want to give up the intellectual freedom, the ability to do good for the world at large without worrying about profit. Still, he acknowledges industry\u2019s attractions. It\u2019s not just money; it\u2019s also validation. Investors and customers paying for your work is proof that it truly works.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s like the Uber thing, right?\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018You can come up with a scheduling algorithm, but does it work when there are 50,000 people trying to do this? How does it scale? Does it work when somebody comes and pours grease over your robot arm? Like, I don\u2019t know, and I want to know.\u2019\u2019 Last year, Srinivasa created his own part-time start-up in part to try to answer that question. The lab is still where ideas are born, but the market is now where they are put to the test.Clive Thompson is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u2018\u2018Smarter Than You Think.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corruption Inquiry Appears to Expand to a Signature Cuomo Program ", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe longstanding focus of Manhattan federal prosecutors on Albany corruption appeared to be expanding with the issuance of grand jury subpoenas seeking records related to one of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s signature upstate economic development programs.The subpoenas, from the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, sought documents related to the bidding process on some projects that are part of the development program, known as the Buffalo Billion, according to officials who were briefed on the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly.The subpoenas were served this summer on the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute, whose president, Alain E. Kaloyeros, is a central player in the program, which was intended to create thousands of jobs upstate, the officials said. Dr. Kaloyeros is one of the state\u2019s highest-paid employees.A SUNY Polytechnic spokesman said in a statement that the institute was \u201cconfident that all processes regarding SUNY Poly projects in Buffalo were done appropriately,\u201d adding, \u201cTo our knowledge, neither SUNY Poly nor any of its employees are the target of any investigation.\u201dBut the spokesman, Jerry Gretzinger, did not respond to questions left in a phone message about whether the subpoenas contained any indications of who and what possible crimes were under investigation.One of the people briefed on the matter said the institute had hired a criminal defense attorney. SUNY Poly signed a contract with a law firm, Kelley Drye & Warren, in mid-July, around the time the subpoenas were served. But a spokeswoman for the firm would not answer questions about it.When Mr. Cuomo, speaking to reporters on Friday morning at the annual meeting of the Business Council of New York State at Lake George, was asked about the investigation, he answered: \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know anything about that.\u201dPressed as to whether he meant that no one from his office had been subpoenaed and whether he was aware of any investigation, he said only, \u201cNo.\u201dThe governor appoints a large majority of the members of the SUNY board and is known for a hands-on management style, especially when it comes to signature programs like the Buffalo Billion.The Buffalo Billion has not been without controversy. The selection of developers for projects that are part of the program has drawn scrutiny from Investigative Post, a nonprofit news organization in Buffalo which has raised questions about a lack of transparency surrounding contracts that have been awarded.In his nearly five years as governor, Mr. Cuomo has lavished attention on Buffalo, visiting often and prioritizing the turnaround of the city\u2019s economy.At the center of his effort has been the Buffalo Billion program, which has included a focus on advanced manufacturing.Among the projects that the governor has promoted is building a solar-panel factory for SolarCity, whose chairman is Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Motors. The subpoenas come on the heels of a broader investigation by Mr. Bharara\u2019s office into public corruption in Albany, which led to the arrests of the leaders of the New York State Assembly and Senate, Sheldon Silver and Dean G. Skelos, both of whom subsequently resigned from their leadership posts but continued to serve in the Legislature. They face separate trials in Manhattan on federal corruption charges in November.Mr. Bharara is also looking into the governor\u2019s decision to shutter the Moreland Commission, which he established in 2013 to investigate public corruption.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Targets Four States in Effort to Enroll the Uninsured", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With the third open enrollment season under the Affordable Care Act beginning in about six weeks, Obama administration officials said Tuesday that they would focus efforts to expand health coverage to the uninsured in Dallas, Houston, northern New Jersey, Chicago and Miami.\u201cOver all, this open enrollment period is going to be tougher than last year,\u201d Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said in a speech here at Howard University Hospital. Many of the uninsured have already signed up, she noted, shrinking the pool of eligible people who do not have coverage.And \u201cwith our economy improving,\u201d she said, \u201cmore people can get coverage under employer plans.\u201dMs. Burwell said the administration would focus on 10.5 million uninsured Americans who were eligible for coverage through the public insurance exchanges, also known as marketplaces.The enrollment period runs from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, 2016, and she encouraged Americans to prepare.At the end of the year, Ms. Burwell said, \u201cwe expect that 9.1 million individuals will have active coverage through the marketplace\u201d \u2014 the federal and state exchanges where consumers can shop for insurance. That number is down from 10.2 million at the end of March and 9.9 million at end of June. Some people failed to pay their premiums, and others could not adequately answer federal questions about their citizenship or immigration status.Ms. Burwell did not state a numerical goal for enrollment in the coming year. The Congressional Budget Office predicted in March that enrollment through the exchanges would reach 11 million this year and 21 million in 2016.But administration officials said those forecasts were based on two assumptions that inflated the numbers but have proved invalid. One assumption was that significant numbers of employers would drop insurance coverage and send their workers into the new insurance exchanges, but that has not happened, the officials said. The Congressional Budget Office also assumed that few consumers would buy insurance on their own outside of the new exchanges, but some have done so, officials said.While the federal government will try to increase coverage across the country, Ms. Burwell said, officials will focus on \u201cthe top five targeted areas\u201d where many of the uninsured live, in Texas, New Jersey, Illinois and Florida.Ms. Burwell acknowledged that \u201ccosts are still a big concern,\u201d with many consumers \u201cworried about fitting premiums into their budgets.\u201d People with the greatest need for coverage have probably obtained it, officials said, and many of those who remain uninsured have passed up opportunities or disregarded the threat of tax penalties for going without insurance.Ms. Burwell offered this profile of the 10.5 million uninsured Americans who she said were eligible for coverage through the exchanges:\u0095 Almost half of the \u201celigible uninsured\u201d are 18 to 34.\u0095 Almost 40 percent of them have incomes from 139 percent to 250 percent of the federal poverty level (about $34,000 to $61,000 a year for a family of four). So they qualify for tax credits to help pay premiums and discounts to reduce their co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs.\u0095 About one-third are members of minority groups. Nineteen percent are Hispanic, 14 percent are African-American and 2 percent are Asian-American.Based on a national survey of 1,270 uninsured adults, done for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Ms. Burwell said that about half of the uninsured had less than $100 in savings. And nearly three in five are confused about how the tax credits work or do not know that they are available, she said.Ms. Burwell said that consumers could sign up this fall without being deterred by political and legal fights that have raged over the health law for the last five years.\u201cKey provisions of the Affordable Care Act have twice been ratified by the highest court,\u201d she said. An earlier version of a caption with this article misstated when Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, testified before Congress.

{"Headline": "Owing to the Greeks", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s TakeIt is rare that a contemporary political state of affairs perfectly corresponds with a classical literary one \u2014 when the contours of the two align so entirely that not only does the latter help explain the former, but the new situation, with all its messy contingencies, seems to follow the carefully wrought logic of its aesthetic predecessor with such precision as to appear like a manifestation, or symptom, of it. Yet this is the case (I would argue) with the economic imbroglio between Germany and Greece.Economics, etymologically speaking, is a Greek invention. The word comes from the Greek oikos, which means \u201chouse\u201d or \u201cdwelling.\u201d At the basis of all economics is the practice of keeping one\u2019s house in order. This is what virtually all Greek drama is about: the attempt to manage domestic affairs, whether \u201cdomestic\u201d be understood at the scale of one household, or of a family spanning several generations (the house of Oedipus or Atreus, for instance), or of the literal stones and mortar of a home \u2014 the attempt to quell its rebellions from within, fend off attacks from without, keep it self-contained, autonomous, intact. What lends the drama to the equation is the fact that this attempt invariably fails. Take Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteian trilogy. The patriarch Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, and the ensuing household struggle escalates into affairs of state and even conflict between gods. One oikos opens up into another \u2014 Greek oikoi are never closed. If it\u2019s not present violence blowing them wide open, it\u2019s past acts (as she approaches Agamemnon\u2019s house, Cassandra shrieks that its very walls are spilling dreadful histories, \u201cRemnants of bodies hacked\u2009/\u2009And murdered children\u2019s bones\u201d), private intimacies unfolding into public knowledge \u2014 the whole process driven by an inexpungeable reserve of guilt.That guilt has its base in matters of the hearth \u2014 in other words, in economics \u2014 is echoed in the English \u201cguilt,\u201d a word that also retains links to gold. But it is German that is most attuned to this connection: In this language, the concepts of \u201cguilt\u201d and \u201cdebt\u201d are served by the same word, Schuld. To be guilty, schuldig, is to be in debt, and vice versa. Joyce, a writer obsessed with economic processes, embeds this word in the central episode of \u201cFinnegans Wake,\u201d which turns on a blackmailer attempting to extract money from a patriarch entrusted with a city\u2019s cash box, who, harboring a guilty secret, wears \u201cbillowing\u201d (or bill owing) clothes and an \u201covergoat under his schulder.\u201d Kafka builds his entire oeuvre around Schuld. Not only does the word recur with astonishing frequency throughout his work, but he continually compresses the economic and moral aspects of the term. In his \u201cLetter to My Father,\u201d he pins his obsessive outpourings of shame (Schuldbewusstsein) to his monetary debt to his father, to whom he is able to feel grateful \u201conly as a beggar is.\u201d In the English translation, one paragraph ends with two clauses: \u201cOn every side I was to blame. I was in your debt.\u201d But in the original, one clause alone suffices: \u201cVon allen Seiten her kam ich in Deine Schuld.\u201dThis echo in German of a Greek theme or relation is exemplary: Germany has always been particularly indebted to Greece. Indeed, from a cultural point of view, it could be argued that Germany more or less created itself as a modern state by plugging into vast reserves of Greekness. The poet H\u00f6lderlin reinvented his native Swabia by remolding it as mythical Hellenic Patmos. Heidegger elaborated his theories from the writings of Parmenides, Anaximander and Aristotle. Germany, in the best instances, has in return read Greece back to itself \u2014 as witnessed by the work of archaeologists such as Schliemann, who interpreted the findings at Troy and Mycenae. But the demands now being forced on Greece by the German government, the requisition of the former\u2019s civic cash box on bill-owing technicalities placed on its \u201cschulder\u201d by far-from-\u00adtrustworthy patriarchs, represent a worst instance, founded (it seems) on a willful misinterpretation of the nature of indebtedness and culpability. Greece is schuldig by definition, since it owes. But its debt, crippling though it is to the Hellenic household, is miniature compared with that of a nation that, within living memory, first (during occupation) plundered Greece\u2019s gold, then (after armistice) received monumental sums of unearned credit.The great lesson of Greek literature (as Oedipus learns to his cost) is simply: You are guilty. Before you\u2019ve even done anything, guilt is the precondition of your being. The house of Germany is indebted, more than most; it takes no Cassandra to spot the murdered children\u2019s bones spilling from its walls. Its leaders, having profited from an open economy, are imposing upon Greece a spurious closed one tailored to suit their own ends. From a literary point of view, it must be concluded that Angela Merkel and her associates are bad readers. And this matters: Nations are symbolic constructs, mechanisms for regulating citizens\u2019 lives according to certain axes of meaning. So is democracy.In the Oresteian trilogy, the inexorable guilt (of Agamemnon, who sacrificed his daughter; of Clytemnestra, who murdered him in revenge; of Orestes, who killed her as a riposte to that; and so on, backward and forward for generations) gives rise to a series of claims and counterclaims that get resolved in what is effectively the West\u2019s first civic trial, presided over by Athena. The task, for her and the citizen-jury she appoints, is not to work out who is right (all parties\u2019 arguments are good), but rather to come up with an arrangement that can set all these contesting demands in some kind of balance that accommodates all sides. In so doing, she founds democracy. The groundbreaking event takes place in Athens. That the current Athenian parliament\u2019s own resolutions are being struck down by Berlin-mandated bureaucrats makes the Greek citizenry\u2019s long-running slogan \u201cError 404 \u2014 Democracy Not Found\u201d even truer than they might realize.Tom McCarthy\u2019s novel \u201cSatin Island\u201d has been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dovish Tone of Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Statement Surprises Economists", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA majority of economists on Wall Street and market indicators of investor sentiment had predicted the Fed would hold off on any move to tighten monetary policy at the two-day meeting that concluded Thursday afternoon. But several analysts said the language in the rate-setting committee\u2019s statement suggested that officials were even more cautious than they had thought.\u201cIt felt like a dovish result with a dovish statement,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cBefore this meeting, there was a supposition that they\u2019d set the table for a future move. I didn\u2019t see any silverware in this announcement, and I think October is off the table.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they are in much of a hurry,\u201d he added. \u201cThe international situation must have generated a real re-evaluation.\u201dStill, other experts argued that the central bank is prepared to move as soon as global conditions improve, illustrating the uncertainty that will persist until at least the next Fed meeting in late October \u2014 or more likely until the last gathering of the year for policy makers in mid-December.\u201cThe global deterioration has caught their attention and, clearly, that was the main factor,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will keep them on hold for an extended period of time. Both the meetings in October and December remain live.\u201dIndeed, traders on Wall Street could not make up their minds Thursday on how to greet the Fed decision not to enact its first rate increase since 2006. After initially dropping after the 2 p.m. announcement, stocks quickly rallied by more than 1 percent, only to fall in the final hour of trading. Major market indexes finished the day down by about 0.25 percent.Several analysts said they were struck by the second paragraph in the Fed\u2019s statement, in particular the conclusion that global volatility and economic events \u201care likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.\u201dIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said those conclusions constituted the major news in Thursday\u2019s announcement.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised they didn\u2019t move, but I am slightly surprised that they were so explicit with their reasoning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new stuff is the recent financial global developments, and for now they are kind of paralyzed.\u201dMr. Shepherdson said he expected the United States economy to continue to strengthen in the months ahead while volatility lessens in China and other markets, prompting the central bank to finally start tightening in December.What is important to understand, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, is that the Fed has concluded inflation will remain depressed, even if the other economic fallout from problems abroad is minimal.\u201cThat\u2019s significant,\u201d said Mr. Gapen, who is an outlier on Wall Street in predicting that the Fed will wait until March 2016 to move. \u201cWhether or not the risk materializes, they think it will suppress inflation, and that means they can let labor markets go a little longer without an increase.\u201dWith wage gains still scarce for most workers, and many having trouble finding full-time positions despite a 5.1 percent unemployment rate that would normally signal employers to raise pay, labor unions and liberal economists hailed the Fed\u2019s move as a sign policy makers see continuing slack in the labor market as much more of a threat than inflation.\u201cWe are pleased that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged,\u201d said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cWe know the economic recovery still has not reached working families, and even a small increase can have devastating effects on our economic stability.\u201dJared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said he believes that Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, is focused on how uneven the recovery in the labor market has been.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel like an economy that needs a brake tap,\u201d he said, adding that Ms. Yellen \u201chas been consistently, and thankfully, mindful of the absence of full employment despite the 5.1 percent unemployment rate.\u201dWith the dollar strengthening by more than 15 percent over the last 12 months against other currencies, making imports into the United States cheaper, economic forces are quietly combating inflation through another channel, Mr. Bernstein noted.\u201cThe appreciation of the dollar has been doing the Fed\u2019s work many times over,\u201d he said. Many observers expect the dollar to continue to rise against other currencies, because of economic weakness in Asia and the relative strength of the American economy.On the other end of the political spectrum, conservative economists and Republicans on Capitol Hill expressed worry that the longer the Fed waits to make its inevitable move to raise interest rates, the greater the threat that investors will get cold feet.Thursday\u2019s decision \u201chas less to do with the underlying weakness of the economy than the timidity of the Fed to take the first necessary step to normalize monetary policy,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, the top House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cAs long as the Fed remains fearful to act lest it be blamed for any economic hiccup, market uncertainty will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If seeking a decent life makes one an \u201cexpressive individualist,\u201d then rational human beings should all be one. Americans on both the right and left increasingly resent being treated as mere serfs and cannon fodder in our elite\u2019s great globalist games.MATTHEW CARNICELLIBrooklynTo the Editor: We used to speak of alienation in society \u2014 the point at which an individual or group feels estranged from the political system. Today, some feel that their religious beliefs are at odds with secular society. Others who used to have a direct voice in politics through their unions now feel they have lost that voice, and their jobs to boot. And then there is the American tradition of blaming one\u2019s woes on the most recent wave of immigrants.The common ground may be that government is not getting its job done. People are more at ease with one another when they can go home to a reasonably comfortable life, secure in their beliefs, secure in their homes and secure against the unexpected. More people seem unable to say that today, despite generations of nation and wealth building.Government is where a diverse society finds a common voice. However, for too long we have been trapped in the politics of disruption, and it is almost shocking when a compromise is reached. The special interests seem to control so much of what goes on. Hence, one is left with the feeling that nothing gets done.The voice of the lone wolf is not so alone. He speaks to the frustration of people seemingly on the outside whose needs never seem to get met. And while we think the lone wolf can never win in the end, should the frustration of the voters boil over that is exactly what may happen, if a more severe revolt does not. Today\u2019s leading candidates should listen carefully to the lone wolves in today\u2019s races. They echo the frustration of millions of Americans.BRUCE NEUMANSag Harbor, N.Y.To the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s lumping of Senator Bernie Sanders with Donald Trump and Ben Carson was unwarranted. He is egregiously wrong to say of Mr. Sanders: \u201cThese sudden stars are not really about governing. They are tools for their supporters\u2019 self-expression. They allow supporters to make a statement, demand respect or express anger or resentment.\u201dMr. Sanders has been a successful mayor and longtime member of Congress, in both the House and the Senate. He has more experience of actually governing than most of the Republican candidates. In fact, he has more experience at governing than either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney had when they ran for president.When Mr. Sanders was mayor of Burlington, the streets got paved in the summer and plowed in the winter while important economic development moved forward in ways that worked for business and residents. He has been continually re-elected not because he is an ideologue, as journalists love to imply, but because he has made government work for the people of Vermont.MICHAEL HECHMERWestford, Vt.To the Editor: I don\u2019t see much support for any of the current candidates, Republican or Democrat. Our citizens have become so cynical, jaded and divided that they no longer trust either party to act in their best interests. With the election of Barack Obama the people of this country unified around a set of ideas that made sense to them: Get us out of senseless war. Fix the economy. Provide us with decent wages and benefits. Enact meaningful health care reform. Clean up the environment.Those who oppose these changes have fought diligently and successfully to stop them because they are controlled by the money behind them. This fragmentation you see in our political parties is simply the effect of too few people controlling our politics. Get the excessive PAC money out of campaigns and the problem will solve itself. Maybe, in a generation, voters will return to the ballot box because they will know that their vote will mean something.PATRICK STEVENSMoose Lake, Minn.To the Editor: The root of our political problem is the cumulative effect of decades of increasingly sophisticated, powerful marketing techniques designed to sell everything from fast food to sneakers. In order to sell stuff, marketing encourages us to be atomized, each of us focused on our personal wants and choices. The very idea of communality, which is at the heart of citizenship, has been massaged out of our individual consciousnesses to the point where \u201cthe common good\u201d has become an archaic, fossilized concept. No politician even uses the phrase \u2014 it doesn\u2019t play well in focus groups. Instead they talk about cutting our taxes.Consumerism is the antithesis of citizenship. We respond as a consumer to Donald Trump because he has spent more than a decade marketing himself to us as a brand. And like any successful brand, he makes us feel good about ourselves because he tells us, \u201cYou deserve a break today.\u201d And that\u2019s what we want to hear.MATTHEW HUGHESCaprile, ItalyTo the Editor: The last paragraph of David Brooks\u2019s column describes his image of a desirable presidential candidate for 2016 as if it\u2019s a highly unlikely possibility: \u201csomebody who could express the disgust for the political system many people feel, but who instead of adding to the cycle of cynicism, channeled it into citizenship, into the notion that we are still one people, compelled by love of country to live with one another, and charged with the responsibility to make the compromises, build the coalitions, practice messy politics and sustain the institutions that throughout history have made national greatness possible.\u201d But, on closer reading, it seems a pretty accurate description of the man who has been in the White House since 2009.CHUCK McVINNEYEastham, Mass.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Experts Reject Official Account of How 43 Mexican Students Were Killed", "Date": "2015-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot only did physical evidence contradict the government\u2019s version of what happened to the students, but the review showed that federal police and soldiers knew that the students were being attacked by the municipal police and failed to intervene.That episode helped shatter the image that the president had worked hard to establish \u2014 as a modern young reformer poised to turbocharge Mexico\u2019s economy, and it thrust the nation\u2019s chronic afflictions of organized crime and corruption back into the public consciousness.\u201cWe ask the Mexican authorities to clarify the disappearance of the students and to make a general reassessment of the entire investigation,\u201d said Carlos Beristain, one of the five members of the panel appointed by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, part of the Organization of American States.\u201cThe brutal actions shows the extent of impunity in which the state security forces acted along with organized crime,\u201d added Mr. Beristain, a Spaniard who has worked on many human rights investigations in Latin America that involved disappearances.After the report\u2019s release, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on Twitter that he had ordered investigators to take into account the experts\u2019 recommendations.Mexico\u2019s attorney general, Arely G\u00f3mez, called the committee\u2019s work \u201ccrucial\u201d and added that prosecutors would carefully analyze the findings and ponder whether to incorporate them into the inquiry.She said that the report\u2019s recommendation for a second forensic investigation at the dump site would be carried out with a new team of \u201chigh-quality and prestigious experts.\u201dAccording to the government\u2019s account, about 100 students who attended a teachers college in the town of Ayotzinapa went to Iguala to steal buses for transportation to a demonstration.The authorities say that Iguala\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Abarca, ordered his police force to subdue the students. Three students were killed by the police. Forty-three others were taken off the buses and turned over to a drug gang, Guerreros Unidos, that was allied with the mayor, according to the official account.Six weeks after the disappearance, the Mexican authorities said that the students had been taken to a garbage dump in the neighboring town of Cocula, killed, and cremated in a giant pyre of wood and tires doused with gasoline.Yet the clearest sign that the government\u2019s version was not true came from the dump itself, according to the report.\u201cThe students simply were not burned in that place,\u201d said Francisco Cox, a Chilean lawyer and another member of the panel. The intense heat needed to burn 43 bodies would have blackened the surrounding vegetation, and, Jos\u00e9 Torero, a leading fire expert engaged by the panel, agreed that there was no evidence to support the government\u2019s scenario.The report concluded with a strong recommendation that the Mexican authorities reconsider the entire case based on the investigation\u2019s \u201cclear shortcomings\u201d and \u201cserious inconsistencies.\u201dThat investigation, the report charged, took a haphazard and improvised approach, and much of the case that resulted was based on testimony from police officers and gang members, who later claimed that they had been tortured.The report did not establish where the students went or even whether they were killed. Only one body has been identified, from a bone that the authorities said was found near the dump. The other 42 should still be considered \u201cdisappeared,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said.Many other questions remain unanswered. Recordings from C4, the communications system that coordinates information for local, state and federal police, as well as the army, were not available to explain critical lapses as events unfolded on Sept. 26 and in the early hours of Sept. 27. Videos from security cameras were lost, and in one case erased. Clothing left behind by the victims was not tested until last month. The dump and other potential crime scenes were left unguarded for days.Human rights activists who have been following the case offered searing assessments.Santiago Canton, the executive director of RFK Partners for Human Rights at Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, said in an interview that \u201clives could have been saved and this could have been prevented.\u201dThe report also suggested a possible motive \u2014 something that the government had not been able to establish with any specificity.The region around Iguala is a key source of heroin for the American Midwest, and evidence in a Chicago drug case showed that traffickers use long-distance buses similar to the ones taken that night to smuggle the drug.One of the five buses that the students took was not examined until months later.The panel rejected possible motives suggested by the authorities, including that some of the students belonged to a rival narcotics outfit.At a news conference on Sunday evening, Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas Tlatempa, the mother of one of the missing students, said, \u201cWe are the victims of our own government because they lied to us.\u201dDuring the news conference, a chant rose repeatedly: \u201cAlive they took them, alive we want them back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Fed Is Likely to Raise Interest Rates This Year", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve still intends to raise its benchmark interest rate this year, barring unpleasant surprises, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Thursday.Ms. Yellen, speaking a week after the Fed announced it was not ready to raise interest rates just yet, reiterated that the central bank was not planning to wait much longer. She said that labor market conditions were improving and that the Fed expected inflation to follow.But she cautioned that if the Fed\u2019s expectations for growth were disappointed again, it might again delay lifting rates.\u201cAchieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter,\u201d Ms. Yellen said in a speech at the University of Massachusetts. \u201cBut if the economy surprises us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.\u201dMs. Yellen concluded her remarks with obvious difficulty and only after a long pause. A spokeswoman for the Fed, Michelle Smith, issued a statement saying Ms. Yellen \u201cfelt dehydrated at the end of a long speech under bright lights.\u201d\u201cAs a precaution,\u201d the statement said, emergency medical technicians examined her. \u201cShe felt fine afterward and has continued with her schedule Thursday evening.\u201dShe also played down the likelihood that slower growth in other countries would cause the Fed to delay raising rates.\u201cThe committee is monitoring developments abroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,\u201d she said.The committee next meets Oct. 27 and 28, and then again Dec. 15 and 16.Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech earlier this week that he voted to keep rates near zero because he was concerned market volatility might be a symptom of broader economic problems.He said he wanted to see more recent economic data before moving forward. But Mr. Lockhart said he was \u201csatisfied\u201d that labor markets had improved sufficiently to start raising rates, and that he was \u201ccomfortable enough\u201d inflation would rise.John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, described the September decision as a \u201cclose call\u201d in a speech last week in Armonk, N.Y. \u201cGiven the progress we\u2019ve made and continue to make on our goals, I view the next appropriate step as gradually raising interest rates, most likely starting sometime later this year,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Ms. Yellen\u2019s speech was largely devoted to explaining why the Fed expects inflation to rise back toward the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as most healthy. Since the recession, inflation has generally stayed under that pace, and prices have barely increased over the last year.While acknowledging that economists do not entirely understand the movements of inflation, Ms. Yellen said the Fed remained most confident in the longstanding view that inflation in the long term was determined by public expectations. Economic slack, changes in import prices and other events can affect it in the short term, but eventually inflation returns to trend.Ms. Yellen said that model suggested inflation would soon begin to do that. About half of the shortfall in inflation over the last year was the result of lower energy prices, and most of the rest was the result of a stronger dollar. She said the role of economic slack in holding down inflation was steadily diminishing, which is the reason she expects a rebound as the temporary restraints fall away.\u201cThe fact that these survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that prevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its prerecession average level of about 2 percent,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen also played down the importance of the decline in another measurement of inflation expectations, which is derived from the market prices of financial assets. She said recent declines most likely reflected other factors, like increased demand for safer assets, rather than a long-term shift.Ms. Yellen said there were risks to the Fed forecast that could push liftoff into next year. So far, however, she said the Fed\u2019s plans had not changed.\u201cTo be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation expectations remaining near their prerecession level,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, prospects for the U.S. economy generally appear solid.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Politicized Border", "Date": "2015-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Antonio del T\u00e1chira, Venezuela \u2014 At the immigration point in San Antonio del T\u00e1chira, some 60 people wait to cross the Simon Bolivar bridge to Colombia. One elderly woman, who has dual citizenship, pleads with a National Guard officer to let her through, but is refused.Pedro, a Venezuelan who until last month drove a taxi in Colombia, has been particularly affected by the shutdown. Unable to cross the border, he now sells sodas and water near the bridge. \u201cThey ruined me!\u201d he says. \u201cBefore this I was able to make a decent living. Now I can barely make ends meet.\u201dMr. Maduro says these measures are necessary to curb regional violence and prevent Colombians from smuggling goods out of Venezuela. Borders in another six T\u00e1chira State towns are now closed, as is the main crossing in Zulia State.Colombians have certainly benefited from Venezuela\u2019s hefty subsidies for staples like flour, milk and fuel, and a favorable exchange rate. Likewise, the resale of trafficked Venezuelan contraband has long provided Colombians with much-needed revenue. But in shutting borders and enforcing deportations, Mr. Maduro is blaming Colombians for all of Venezuela\u2019s self-inflicted wounds, which today include a collapsing currency, inflation and food shortages. With parliamentary elections slated for December and Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party lagging in the polls, the consensus is clear in San Antonio: the crackdown has nothing to do with contraband and everything to do with convincing us that the government can fix the economy.Two weeks ago, I made the hourlong bus trip to San Antonio from San Crist\u00f3bal, the T\u00e1chira State capital. Like me, half of the 28 passengers on board hoped to cross to Colombia. Some wanted to visit family; others, myself included, sought to purchase basic goods that are in limited supply and heavily regulated in Venezuela. (Ultimately, I was prevented from crossing, and returned home.)At the checkpoint at Peracal, a National Guard officer searched us for contraband. A few people were carrying household goods; the officer requested receipts to prove they had been legally purchased. The atmosphere was tense, but nobody was detained, and we drove on.Border residents have long appreciated the close ties between Venezuela and Colombia. Colombians come to San Antonio for our leather belts and shoes; Venezuelans buy groceries in Colombia (everyone agrees that the market in C\u00facuta, just over the bridge, is the only place to find a flavorful potato). As a child, I loved going to C\u00facuta with my grandmother to stock up on apple soda and my favorite League of Justice action figures. Street vendors weaved through the traffic-clogged streets, selling Popsicles; if I behaved, my grandmother bought me one.Though the particulars of Venezuelan-Colombian border economics seesawed, the sense of connectedness remained constant. In the \u201970s, Venezuelans took advantage of the favorable exchange rate between the bolivar and the Colombian peso. When the rate started favoring the peso in the early 2000s, Colombians accepted our credit cards.With easy transit and few restrictions, San Antonio and C\u00facuta often felt like one large city. Now this freedom has been severed. San Antonio\u2019s once-hectic streets are quiet, and restaurants and shops are empty.The raids and aggressive deportation operation have convinced many Colombians to repatriate \u2014 even those who have lived in Venezuela for years, or who have dual nationality. As a consequence of the border\u2019s historic fluidity, some Venezuelans have sons or daughters who are legally Colombian. Fearing their children may be targeted, some think it safest to leave as a family.Twenty days into the shutdown, lines at the Simon Bolivar bridge and the nearby authorization point are longer than when I last tried to enter Colombia. Transit is still permitted in certain circumstances. Venezuelan schoolchildren can continue their studies across the border; approval may be granted to Venezuelans who need to access medicines or medical care in C\u00facuta. But obtaining medical leave is a frustrating process, with applicants required to present an increasingly bewildering array of documents. Colombians who live or work legally in Venezuela may return home. But due to the volume of people wanting to leave, they must often wait for hours, sometimes spending the night at the checkpoint.A man named Julio approaches the line. For a fee, he offers passage across a \u201ctrocha,\u201d an unguarded section of the T\u00e1chira river. Most decline, but others are sick of waiting, and follow him.Since August, Venezuelans have turned to Colombian or international news reports for fairer accounts of the crisis, as most Venezuelan coverage has been either government-controlled or heavily self-censored. National channels disingenuously announce that lines have shrunk and goods are available that would previously have been smuggled to Colombia. In response, many of us have become citizen journalists, sharing videos of military raids on social media.In the end I am turned away at the checkpoint again, and return to San Cristobal. Regulated goods have just arrived at a local drugstore; the line winds out the front door. Two hours later I leave with two tubes of toothpaste and a bar of soap \u2014 the most we are allowed. Back home, President Maduro is on T.V., celebrating Venezuela\u2019s economic recovery.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Behaviorists Show the U.S. How to Improve Government Operations", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government found a clever way to make a little extra money last summer.Some vendors who provide federal agencies with goods and services as varied as paper clips and translators were given a slightly different version of the form used to report rebates they owe the government.The only difference: The signature box was at the beginning of the form rather than the end. The result: a rash of honesty. Companies using the new form acknowledged they owed an extra $1.59 million in rebates during the three-month experiment, apparently because promising to be truthful at the outset actually caused them to answer more truthfully.The altered form is among the early successes of a year-old effort by the Obama administration to apply academic research on human behavior to the business of running a government. The idea is that a little science might help the government collect taxes, distribute benefit payments and even help people find jobs, get an education or save for retirement.Governments generally operate on the assumption that people are rational. One of the basic implications of mainstream economic theory is that public policy works best when people are treated as rational decision makers.Yet a growing body of research has found that people are not only irrational on occasion, but they tend to be irrational in some consistent and predictable ways. People tend to be influenced by the last thing they heard. They tend to fear losses more than they like profits. They tend to be a little lazy.And researchers from this new school argue the government should account for these tendencies.Moreover, nudges are hard to mass-produce. The British government, which created a \u201cnudge unit\u201d in 2010, found it could increase collections from delinquent taxpayers by telling them nine in 10 neighbors had paid up, a common marketing technique. But when the United States Treasury Department tried a similar technique last year, it did not work.And changing behavior is tricky. The most important change behavioral economics has made in federal policy is a 2006 law that made it easier for companies to enroll workers in retirement plans by default. The change has increased participation, but it also may have reduced the amounts some people have saved. People enrolled by default also tend to stick with the default savings rate, often lower than the average for people who sign up themselves.\u201cIs the government really competent to determine the directions in which we should be nudged?\u201d asked John Cochrane, a Stanford University economist.Mr. Cochrane said the administration\u2019s experiments so far seem basically harmless \u2014 \u201cgovernment spam, messaging people to tell them to do x or y or z.\u201d But he said he was troubled by the possibility of more forceful nudges devised by technocrats influenced by lobbyists or other political considerations.Still, behavioral scientists have won the attention of policy makers partly by holding out the promise of improvements at very little cost. Nudges are cheap. The idea that tweaking a tax-collection letter might bring in as much money as hiring tax collectors is deeply appealing in an era of austerity.An early victory: The British team found people who had not registered vehicles were more likely to do so if they were sent a picture of the car beside the standard warning it could be taken away.Ms. Shankar\u2019s team asks federal agencies about their priorities, then mines the academic literature for ways to improve those policies. The team also has created a network of academic institutions to provide advice.(The persistence of these effects is an open question. The first time a person signs, they answer the questions more honestly, but by the 10th time, the nudge might be powerless. Ms. Shankar said there had been \u201ca little dip\u201d in rebate payments since last summer, but the effect remained quite strong. Mr. Thaler noted that alarm clocks wake people up every morning.)Perhaps even more than new ideas, the behavioral group is bringing a new approach to government. Experimentation is the key: Different nudges are tried systematically, results are quantified and, even after the best approach is selected, the team goes back to see how things are working.The team, for example, created eight versions of an email encouraging members of the military to enroll in a retirement savings program. About 80,000 service members received each version. The most effective, which combined step-by-step instructions with an example of how much a person could save by putting away a little money each month, roughly doubled enrollment rates.These efforts are informed by common sense as much as academic insight. People are more likely to do things that are easier to do. Yet simplicity has rarely been a priority in the development of federal programs. \u201cThey\u2019ve been more worried about making sure it\u2019s legally perfect than making sure it\u2019s understandable to anybody,\u201d Mr. Thaler said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of room to simplify things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the agricultural heartland and on the Greek islands, informal bartering, which has historically helped communities survive, has intensified as more people exchange fruits, vegetables, other crops, equipment, clothing and services.The latest three-year bailout, which Greece\u2019s lenders approved last month, is likely to only exacerbate the problems, since it requires additional austerity measures. And just pushing through those measures will provide a critical test for Mr. Tsipras in the coming months.\u201cThe economy continues to deteriorate,\u201d said Yiannis Deligiannis, the founder of Tradenow. \u201cThe capital controls were the last bullet to the head. People have to find other ways to make things work. We are offering them one alternative.\u201dMuch of it is being done virtually through online networks that match offers and needs, a digital twist on a centuries-old tradition.After capital controls were imposed in June, about 6,000 users signed up for Tradenow, on top of 25,000 registered members. Even small businesses that had previously shunned barter networks as unworkable have come aboard.The system equates one tradepoint to one euro, and lets users barter directly or rack up the digital currency to get goods and services from others in the community. To attract business, users can also deal in a mix of euros and points.The modern online systems make bartering more efficient. The activity can also have a multiplier effect in the economy, generating new work and business.At Mr. Roussos\u2019s butcher shop, the first 20 chickens and 20 packages of ground beef he posted online for seven tradepoints each sold out quickly, allowing him to rack up points in his account. He doubled his offers, and new customers lined up.\u201cIt went viral,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to barter because they have little money to buy.\u201dSome deal offers were not up to snuff. \u201cOne person wanted me to trade a Madonna CD for a chicken,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I said no. The Madonna CD was definitely not worth a chicken.\u201dMr. Roussos approached the tire vendor, whom he had met on the platform, and worked out the deal to renovate his van. He paid with a month\u2019s supply of meat and tradepoints, which the vendor used to get an iPad.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Some advocates are pushing to make the so-called alternative economy more widespread, not only to combat the liquidity squeeze, but also to have some kind of system should Greece ever come crashing out of the euro. While the new government has pledged to keep Greece inside the single currency, analysts said new instability could reappear if Greece cannot carry out structural reforms demanded by its lenders.When Greece verged on exiting the euro this summer, the government explored nationwide backups including I.O.U.s, a possible parallel currency or a return to the drachma. But barter advocates say communities would be able to cope more quickly if a barter system were in place.\u201cGreeks are aware there are devastating consequences of being in a single currency, like capital controls,\u201d said Helen Panagiotopoulos, a researcher at the City University of New York who studies the Greek barter system. \u201cThere\u2019s a pressing sense that we need to be working together to form something that connects us all, because we don\u2019t know what may happen in the future.\u201dThe economy has been in disarray. People have been out of work for years. The banks have been running out of money. It sounds a lot like the Great Depression in the United States. But it is Greece \u2013 and in some ways, the situation is worse.But many of those systems were plagued by inefficiencies. Time banks discovered that one unit of a doctor\u2019s time was more valuable than a unit of a babysitter\u2019s, complicating trades. In Volos, and in online barter clubs, problems arose because no rules ensured that counterparties to transactions would keep their end of a deal.Similar troubles arose in Argentina, where a huge social money movement evolved in 2001 after the peso crisis. Scams and inefficiencies eventually plagued the system, causing it to splinter.Greek barter advocates say they are learning from those mistakes. As they seek to revive barter platforms, their focus is on better rules and oversight.To avoid \u201cphantom traders,\u201d people who sign onto barter platforms and get goods or services without returning them in kind, Mr. Mouroulis requires users to provide identification and financial guarantees. A social activist who says he is driven by an ethos of solidarity for Greece, he has been meeting with other barter club founders to strategize over whether his model can help.With just 85 members, Free Economy is hardly a parallel economic universe. But for some, the system has become a lifeline.Jorgos Kazianis, 59, an experienced electrician who worked on projects like the Athens metro, had not found steady work since 2010 until he heard about Mr. Mouroulis\u2019s network. He wired Mr. Mouroulis\u2019s garage in exchange for alternate currency, which he used to procure olive oil, food and motorcycle parts. Other people began contacting him through the barter platform and now, one out of every five projects is a barter deal.\u201cIt makes a difference,\u201d Mr. Kazianis said. \u201cI have virtual money in my barter account, and the best part is, there are no capital controls.\u201d He does not trust the banks, and has \u20ac400, about $445, in his regular bank account, but \u20ac600 worth of virtual currency in his Free Economy account.While some view bartering as a step backward, Mr. Kazianis said he saw it as a natural progression to relieve some of the misery that money \u2014 and the country\u2019s membership in the euro currency \u2014 has brought to Greek society.\u201cSince ancient times, when there was no money, transactions happened through bartering,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no faith in money the way it has evolved today. This crisis is the byproduct of what money has become, where there\u2019s a lot of it in the hands of the few, and a deficit of it for most other people.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposition in Venezuela Is Unsettled by Leader\u2019s Sentence", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS \u2014 A year ago Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a Venezuelan opposition leader, walked at the head of rallies of tens of thousands of people, calling for the exit of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and setting off a wave of demonstrations and unrest as the country boiled with discontent. But on Friday, only a few hundred people showed up at a demonstration to support him, a day after he was convicted and sentenced to nearly 14 years in jail for his role in leading last year\u2019s protests.The small size of the crowd told the story: The opposition finds itself discouraged and off balance even as it retains hopes of winning crucial legislative elections scheduled for December. \u201cIn Venezuela, since there is no justice, protest is useless,\u201d said Sergio Reyes, 23, a flight attendant at the rally on Friday. Referring to last year\u2019s protests, in which dozens of people were killed on both sides, he said, \u201cLots of people have taken to the streets, like the students who died last year, but they did not get results because the government doesn\u2019t pay attention when people ask for change.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife, Lilian Tintori, read a letter to the demonstrators that he had written from prison. \u201cThis sentence is not directed only against me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt seeks to weaken the spirit of all of those who are fighting for a better country.\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez urged his sympathizers not to become demoralized or frustrated.The gathering was held on a cramped traffic island where at times members of the news media seemed to almost outnumber those who had come to support the jailed leader. It was here last February that Mr. L\u00f3pez turned himself in to authorities after giving a defiant speech to masses of sympathizers. Many of those who showed up on Friday left before Ms. Tintori arrived \u2014 she said that after visiting her husband in jail in the morning, prison guards had not allowed her to leave promptly.Flanked by opposition leaders, Ms. Tintori sought to direct anger over her husband\u2019s sentence toward preparations for the coming elections. She called for a march on Sept. 19 to be led by opposition candidates. An opposition victory in the elections, which analysts say could come as a result of widespread discontent over a disastrous economy, would upend the balance of power here. Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s trial ended on Thursday. Hours later the judge, Susan Barreiros, found him guilty of inciting violence, arson and other crimes linked to a peaceful protest he helped lead on Feb. 12, 2014, which later turned violent. She sentenced him to 13 years, nine month, seven days and 12 hours behind bars, to be served in a military prison.Three student protesters put on trial with Mr. L\u00f3pez received sentences from 10 and a half years to four and a half years. A fourth student who was also a defendant fled the country last week and was reported to be seeking asylum in the United States.Mr. L\u00f3pez is the most prominent of a group of opposition leaders and ordinary protesters who have been arrested and charged with crimes since Mr. Maduro, a leftist, was elected in 2013 to replace his mentor, the country\u2019s longtime president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.Critics of the government inside and outside Venezuela say that there is no evidence that Mr. L\u00f3pez committed any crime and that he is being punished for his role in leading the opposition. Secretary of State John Kerry released a statement on Friday saying that the United States was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the conviction and sentence, adding that \u201cthe decision by the court raises great concern about the political nature of the judicial process and verdict, and the use of the Venezuelan judicial system to suppress and punish government critics.\u201dThe European Union issued a statement calling the verdict harsh and saying that the trial lacked \u201cadequate guarantees of transparency and due legal process.\u201d A spokesman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also expressed concern over a lack of due process during the trial.\u201cIt\u2019s clear this case is politically motivated, that the public prosecutor\u2019s office has never had the intention to truly base the process on the protection of human rights, due process and fair trial,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director of Amnesty International, who is based in Mexico City. \u201cThe government wants to give an example that any opposed idea or opposition demonstration against the government is going to be punished.\u201dGovernments in Latin America, however, remained mostly silent. The Union of South American Nations, a regional group, said in a statement that it \u201creiterates its respect for the decisions taken by the judicial authorities of its member states.\u201dThe foreign minister of Venezuela, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, defended the verdict during a visit to the United Nations in New York. \u201cThe public powers in Venezuela are independent,\u201d she said, according to news media reports here. \u201cA decision has been made, due process has been respected, human rights have been respected.\u201dIn a series of comments posted on Twitter, she lashed out at the United States, painting Mr. L\u00f3pez as a terrorist.Referring to Mr. Kerry\u2019s statement, which came on the anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, she said that \u201cthe double standard towards terrorism that it portrays is enormously worrisome, especially on such a sensitive date for the people of the United States.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez regularly advocates nonviolent protest, yet the government\u2019s case against him rested heavily on two experts who testified that his speeches and Twitter posts provoked antigovernment feelings among his followers that spurred them to violence.In a news release on Friday, the national prosecutor\u2019s office said that Mr. L\u00f3pez had inspired a \u201cnegative euphoria\u201d among his sympathizers and that evidence in the trial showed that \u201cthe statements made by L\u00f3pez through the media and on social networks incited his followers to commit violence in the streets and to disavow the national government and its institutions.\u201dPatricia Torres and Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Call at U.N. to Fight ISIS With Ideas Is Largely Seen as Futile", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Obama called upon a conclave of world leaders on Tuesday to fight violent extremism not just with weapons but with ideas, jobs and good governance, a strategy he has long advocated. There are few signs that it is succeeding.Military pressure, Mr. Obama said at a United Nations summit meeting, will be insufficient to vanquish groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.\u201cThis means defeating their ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeologies are not defeated with guns. They are defeated by better ideas \u2014 a more attractive and compelling vision.\u201dMr. Obama spoke without having to hear a robust riposte to his strategy moments later, which was what happened to him on Monday at the General Assembly when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia defended his government\u2019s support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and other authoritarians.But the echoes of Mr. Putin\u2019s more muscular strategy still reverberated in the United Nations hallways, where many leaders have little enthusiasm for the kind of political changes Mr. Obama has urged upon them that might empower or at least legitimize their political opponents.Mr. Putin, in his speech Monday, said the American strategy of promoting democratic changes in the Middle East had backfired.\u201cInstead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence poverty and social disaster,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cAnd nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.\u201dEven Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. acknowledged in a candid moment when he arrived in New York that little would come of Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He asked a group of reporters who were following him if they would stay awake at the United Nations meeting and \u201c30 speeches about how we\u2019re going to go after ISIS.\u201dThe conclave seemed to highlight the bewilderment of world leaders in how a movement like the Islamic State, which slaughters opponents, enslaves women and destroys historical artifacts, continues to attract followers from around the world.Nearly 30,000 foreign recruits have poured into Syria and Iraq since 2011 from more than 100 countries, almost doubling the total that was estimated a year ago despite international efforts to tighten borders, share intelligence and enforce antiterrorism laws.A $500 million Pentagon effort to train rebel forces to take on the Islamic State in Syria has produced only a handful of fighters. And the fight against the Islamic State has expanded beyond its cradle in Iraq and Syria \u2014 where, senior Pentagon officials recently said, the struggle is at \u201ca stalemate\u201d \u2014 into North Africa.\u201cWe have ISIL taking root in areas that already are suffering from failed governance,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd as a consequence of the vacuum that exists in many of these areas, ISIL has been able to dig in.\u201dIslamic State combatants have shown themselves to be resilient, and the group is adept at attracting adherents through social media.At least eight Islamic State branches in the Middle East and Afghanistan have cropped up in recent years or have redefined themselves as allies, such as the Boko Haram insurgency group in Nigeria.So far, the Islamic State\u2019s violent narrative \u2014 promulgated through thousands of messages each day \u2014 has effectively \u201ctrumped\u201d the efforts of some of the world\u2019s richest and most technologically advanced nations, the State Department assessment said.Some of the leaders attending the United Nations General Assembly this week acknowledged the challenges.\u201cWe need to win this propaganda war far more effectively than we have to date,\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said. The way to do that, he said, is to stop the dissemination of hateful messaging in schools and prisons.\u201cI believe in freedom of speech, but freedom to hate is not the same thing,\u201d he said.Such speeches cause concern among rights activists, however, who say laws in at least 30 countries designed to prevent people from joining the Islamic State could result in repression.\u201cGovernments are responsible for protecting their populations from violence by extremist groups, but that\u2019s not a license to trample basic rights,\u201d said Letta Tayler, senior terrorism and counterterrorism researcher at Human Rights Watch.Russia intends to host its own meeting Wednesday in the Security Council devoted to counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East. It is expected to introduce a draft Council resolution along the lines of what Mr. Putin proposed in his General Assembly speech Monday \u2014 to authorize the \u201ccoordination\u201d of anti-Islamic State activities in Syria.Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France openly criticized the Russians for doing nothing to strike militarily. \u201cThey talk about fighting ISIL, but I haven\u2019t seen anything,\u201d he told a group of reporters Tuesday morning.The conclave on combating violent extremism coincided with an announcement on Tuesday by the Treasury Department in Washington that it was freezing the assets or preventing banking transactions for 15 people deemed to be key facilitators for the Islamic State.Such measures may be far less effective against the Islamic State than they were against Al Qaeda because the Islamic State commands territory from which it extracts taxes, extortion fees, ransoms and other payments.Counterterrorism experts said Tuesday that while the Treasury designations would be unlikely to find any bank accounts or assets that could be frozen, they may be able to shut down some financing channels through otherwise legitimate businesses.\u201cThough ISIS runs a local and somewhat insular war economy, their financing does touch elements of the financial system \u2014 whether brokers in Turkey or microfinancing via social media,\u201d said Juan Zarate, a former top counterterrorism official under President George W. Bush. \u201cTreasury is trying to do whatever it can to disrupt ISIS\u2019 ability to access the financial system and attempting to deter others from supporting the group.\u201dGardiner Harris reported from the United Nations, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.

{"Headline": "Students in South Africa Protest Slow Pace of Change", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAPE TOWN \u2014 It was only when he landed at the University of Cape Town, a bastion of the fight against apartheid, that Ramabina Mahapa became truly conscious of his race.Mr. Mahapa, 23, grew up in a village with only black South Africans, and he graduated at the top of his high school class. But when he got to the University of Cape Town, the gap between black and white students became clear to him: Of the 15 people who owned cars in his dorm, only one was black. When the first test results came in, the black students ranked at the bottom.\u201cThat\u2019s why I then started feeling black,\u201d said Mr. Mahapa, who was born two years before the end of apartheid and is now a third-year psychology and philosophy major, as well as the president of the university\u2019s student government.\u201cEven when I occasionally would see pictures on TV about apartheid, you never internalized it or thought about it \u2014 up until you come to a space where you actually experience it,\u201d he added.The protests that roiled this campus, the country\u2019s most prestigious public university, have quieted for now. But they have spread to other institutions with similar problems, including Stellenbosch University, whose campus less than an hour east of here has been dominated by demonstrations in the past week.The student actions have shed light on a much broader national dissatisfaction with the glacial pace of transformation, as South Africa\u2019s policy of giving blacks equal representation is called.In today\u2019s South Africa, forged in negotiations between the African National Congress and the former apartheid government in 1994, whites retain disproportionate power over the economy and other important sectors, like higher education. Transformation is widely seen as having greatly benefited a small, politically connected black elite, while bringing much less to the broader population.\u201cDuring the protests, you had a lot more people questioning the project of 1994, and condemning it,\u201d said Rekgotsofetse Chikane, 24, another student leader at the University of Cape Town, adding that the criticism extended to former President Nelson Mandela. \u201cIf Mandela wasn\u2019t safe, no leader was.\u201dMr. Chikane took part in protests and in the occupation of administrative buildings, where students held marathon reading sessions of Frantz Fanon, an anti-colonialist author, and Steve Biko, the South African leader of the black consciousness movement.The protesters\u2019 rallying cry is the need to \u201cdecolonize\u201d the university. They are calling for more black faculty members, continued affirmative action policies to increase the number of black students, and a curriculum that is less Eurocentric and more African-oriented.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of national, political unresolved issues and the students\u2019 own personal search for issues of identity and meaning,\u201d said Xolela Mangcu, an associate professor of sociology at the university and one of the national leaders in the debate over transformation in higher education.The slow pace of change at the nation\u2019s 26 public universities \u2014 where only 14 percent of full professors are black \u2014 has more far-reaching consequences for South Africa than does transformation in other institutions, critics say.\u201cThe only way they can legitimize themselves is to befriend black people who can be their spokespersons and who can drive their values,\u201d Mr. Makgoba said of white South Africans. \u201cWhat happens, in essence, is that you change the government from white to black, but you choose the blacks\u201d who will protect white values, he added.Here at the University of Cape Town, widely considered the continent\u2019s best institution of higher learning, discontent among black students had been brewing for years. But the recent protests here \u2014 as well as elsewhere in the country \u2014 were set off by an unusual act of defiance.The statue, at the heart of the campus, had long been the object of student protests. But things were different this time.Dr. Max Price, the vice chancellor of the university, said he had been surprised by the enduring reaction against the statue, given that earlier demonstrations had fizzled.\u201cIt tapped into \u2014 and a statue was a perfect way of articulating \u2014 the sense of alienation that black students feel on this campus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe culture of the place feels white. The architecture is a European, Oxbridge architecture. Obviously, the language of instruction is English. The culture of what\u2019s held up to be excellent universities and excellent science, and what we emulate and aspire to be, are the Ivy League universities and European universities.\u201dDr. Price pointed to signs of progress since the end of apartheid. The number of students from other African nations has risen sharply, highlighting the university\u2019s increasing ties with the rest of the continent. The percentage of black South African students has also risen, to 24 percent last year from 18 percent in 1994, although the increase has been held back by South Africa\u2019s weak primary and secondary schools, he said.The single area in which the university has \u201cfailed completely,\u201d Dr. Price said, is in hiring more black members of faculty. Talented black South Africans do not gravitate to academia, he said, but are often plucked instead by the government or the private sector.What\u2019s more, Dr. Price said, it simply takes time for an academic to rise through the ranks to become a full professor. It would take one more generation for blacks to make up a majority of full professors at South Africa\u2019s public universities, Dr. Price said, and two generations to match the percentage of the South African population that is black.Mr. Mangcu, the sociologist and a leading critic of the lack of change at South Africa\u2019s universities, agreed with Dr. Price\u2019s assessment. But he said that changes in hiring and promoting could quickly establish \u201ca critical mass\u201d of black faculty members who would change the environment and intellectual discourse on the campus.The recent protests drew a diverse group of black students, and class divisions simmered below the surface.Lindokuhle Patiwe, 18, grew up in a poor township outside Cape Town. He lived with his family \u2014 his mother, a brother and two cousins \u2014 in a public housing unit that his mother, a child-care worker, bought in 2000. On the 25th of each month, the mother\u2019s payday, the family went out to eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u201cFor someone from the townships, coming from there to here is a huge change,\u201d Mr. Patiwe said. \u201cNo one goes into your face and says, \u2018You\u2019re not welcome here.\u2019 No one says that you don\u2019t belong here. But it\u2019s just that the structure, and the environment itself, says that I\u2019m not welcome here.\u201dMr. Patiwe\u2019s mother worried that participating in the protests would get him expelled. \u201cShe was not impressed at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a trust fund to go back to.\u201dFor Mr. Chikane, the 24-year-old student leader, and his family, post-apartheid South Africa has brought great opportunities. The son of a famous anti-apartheid leader, the Rev. Frank Chikane, he grew up in Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg. But he had attended private schools as a child, and his family had moved to a gated community north of the city.Just as the protests drew Mr. Chikane and Mr. Patiwe, they also attracted the participation of gay people, students of mixed race, anarchists and other marginalized groups.\u201cThe elephant in the room was class,\u201d Mr. Chikane said. \u201cClass was never discussed. It was neatly swept underneath the rug.\u201d\u201cI knew that if you bring up class too early in this organization, all you would do is to split the black students,\u201d he added. \u201cThen it would be blacks-who-have and blacks-who-don\u2019t-have. And at U.C.T., you can see that quite blatantly.\u201dThe movement has held together, at least for now. The students realized their first goal by pressing the university to remove the statue of Rhodes. A few days later, though, students woke up to see that a shadow had been painted on the ground, as if cast by the fallen monument.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Eases Some Limits on Cuban Travel and Commerce", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rules will allow American companies, including telecommunications and Internet providers, to open locations and hire workers in Cuba, facilitate financial transactions between the two nations and remove limits on the sums that can be taken to the island nation. They are to take effect on Monday on the eve of the visit to Washington by Pope Francis, a proponent of the reconciliation who quietly helped broker the agreement between Mr. Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro last year.Mr. Obama spoke to Mr. Castro by telephone on Friday to discuss the normalization process before the pope traveled to Cuba on Saturday and then to the United States on Tuesday, the White House said. In addition to praising the pope\u2019s role in their rapprochement, the two presidents \u201cdiscussed steps that the United States and Cuba can take, together and individually, to advance bilateral cooperation,\u201d an official said, even as they continue to have differences on important issues and \u201cwill address those differences candidly.\u201d Administration officials said Mr. Obama was still hoping that Congress would take action to lift the travel and trade embargo, although senior aides to the president offered a grim assessment of the chances that it would happen in the short term.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a whole lot of evidence to indicate that those prospects have significantly improved,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. Still, he said, the rules would deepen connections among Cubans and Americans in the interim and expose Cuba\u2019s citizens to American values while helping United States businesses.Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said the rules, issued by his agency and the Commerce Department, could lead to \u201cconstructive change for the Cuban people.\u201d\u201cA stronger, more open U.S.-Cuba relationship has the potential to create economic opportunities for both Americans and Cubans alike,\u201d Mr. Lew said in a statement. \u201cBy further easing these sanctions, the United States is helping to support the Cuban people in their effort to achieve the political and economic freedom necessary to build a democratic, prosperous, and stable Cuba.\u201dThey also hold out the prospect of new business opportunities for American companies in Cuba, which some observers said was intended to increase pressure on Havana to take corresponding action to open its economy.The White House is working to show momentum in the rapprochement with Cuba before Dec. 17, the first anniversary of when it was announced.\u201cIn addition to expanding our commercial engagement with the Cuban people, these additional adjustments have the potential to stimulate long overdue economic reform across the country,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the secretary of commerce, said in a statement.American corporations have been working behind the scenes with the Obama administration for months to bring about the normalization the president promised, which began with an initial set of regulatory changes in January. But the new rules exceeded the expectations of some business leaders, who said they had sent a clear message to Cuba that it must do more on its end.Administration officials acknowledged on Friday that the scope of the changes that can be brought about by lifting sanctions and loosening commercial rules would depend to a degree on Cuba\u2019s willingness to facilitate the new cooperation and make reforms in its state-run economy.\u201cIn part, this depends on the government of Cuba,\u201d said a senior official who worked on the rules, \u201cand we don\u2019t have control there.\u201dFor example, the lifting of some United States export restrictions, such as those on certain electronic equipment and civilian aviation safety goods, may have limited effect if Cuba does not change the way it handles imports, which now must go through a government agency.But officials said they foresaw many potential areas of cooperation, including a venture between Etecsa, Cuba\u2019s government-owned telecommunications provider, and an American firm that could improve service on the island.The regulations will for the first time in decades allow United States companies to do business directly in Cuba, setting up subsidiaries or opening offices or warehouses there, and allowing Americans to have bank accounts and Cubans to maintain bank accounts outside of their country. Cruise ships will be able to travel between the United States and Cuba without making a stop in a third nation. And close relatives will be able to visit family members in Cuba for a wider array of purposes.They will also allow American telecommunications and Internet companies to locate in Cuba and market their services there, as well as to import mobile applications made in Cuba for development in the United States.\u201cAll of the machinations that they had to go through to get to these provisions just shows the crying need for lifting the embargo, because while all of this is really good, it is so obvious that it would be so much simpler to lift the embargo,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar, a sponsor of legislation that would remove the trade and travel ban, said in an interview. \u201cWhile it is a very positive step, it just shows the absurdity\u201d of keeping the embargo in place, she added.James A. Williams, the president of Engage Cuba, a bipartisan public policy group pushing for normalization, cheered the changes but said there was \u201cmore the Obama Administration can and should do, such as allowing individuals to participate in people-to-people travel without third-party brokers.\u201d He also said Congress must \u201cdo its job\u201d and lift the embargo.Opponents of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy argued that the rules were one-sided concessions to a brutal government that has done nothing to change its behavior.\u201cThe Obama policy of pouring more American money into the Castro regime\u2019s coffers won\u2019t make America safer or the Cuban people freer,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and presidential hopeful of Cuban descent. \u201cNot only do these measures harm the cause of a free Cuba, they also raise serious questions about the legality of the Obama administration\u2019s regulations.\u201dMr. Earnest said the administration would \u201ccontinue to press the Cuban government to implement the kinds of reforms that we believe are long overdue.\u201d In the meantime, he said, relaxing commerce and travel rules would give leaders there \u201can incentive that they didn\u2019t have before to start implementing those reforms, so that they can take advantage of the opportunity that the United States has extended to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank to Shrink Investment Banking Unit in Russia", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Deutsche Bank said on Friday that it was scaling back its investment banking operations in Russia as the bank\u2019s new co-chief executive, John Cryan, looks to reshape its business.The move reflects the bank\u2019s own organizational challenges as well as the increasing difficulty for international companies of all sorts to do business in Russia in light of Western sanctions and the country\u2019s stumbling economy.On Friday, the bank said it would close its onshore corporate banking and securities operations in Russia. Instead, its Russian corporate finance and markets businesses will operate from the bank\u2019s other international hubs.Deutsche Bank said it would continue to offer prices in Russian securities to its clients, using third parties for execution, and would continue to provide banking services to core Russian clients.The move, expected to affect about 200 full-time employees, is meant to be mostly completed by the end of the year. Following the pullback, Deutsche Bank will have about 1,100 employees in Russia.The scaling back of Deutsche Bank\u2019s business in Russia comes as Western economic sanctions, the decline in the value of the ruble, and the falling price of oil have weighed heavily on the Russian economy.President Vladimir V. Putin has responded to the Western measures with countersanctions.Deutsche Bank itself is facing regulatory scrutiny over a series of so-called mirror trades in Russia that may have breached laws against money laundering.In July, Deutsche Bank said that it was investigating the circumstances of equity trades entered by clients in Moscow and in London that appeared to offset one another and that the volume of the transactions under review was \u201csignificant.\u201d\u201cThe ongoing internal investigation includes a review as to whether violations of law, regulation or policy have occurred, as well as a review of Deutsche Bank\u2019s related internal controls,\u201d the bank said at the time.After the changes announced on Friday, the bank\u2019s Global Transaction Banking business, which has been in Russia for 134 years, will continue to operate in the country, providing trade finance, cash management and currency trading services.Its institutional cash business, however, will serve Russian clients from offices in other countries.Deutsche Bank said it would also continue to serve wealth management clients in Russia, but that it would consolidate the business\u2019s administration and booking outside the country.Of the employees remaining in Russia, about 200 will be primarily associated with its Global Transaction Business, and about 900 will be involved in its global technology operations.Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems are by no means limited to Russia. The bank has had poor profitability in recent years and has faced several scandals that have led to huge fines and hurt its reputation.Deutsche Bank has set aside 3.8 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion, in additional provisions to cover costs from lawsuits and official investigations into allegations of misconduct, primarily in the years before the financial crisis began in 2008.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Trump the Candidate Reform Conservatives Are Seeking?", "Date": "2015-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016\u201cReform conservatism is based on a recognition that the American economy has not served middle-income people well, not just since the crisis of 2008 but at least since the year 2000,\u201d said David Frum, the prominent Canadian-American conservative journalist and former speechwriter for George W. Bush who serves as a senior editor at The Atlantic.Though the reform conservatives dissent from conservative tax orthodoxy, they are not necessarily moderates. For example, many of them (including Mr. Frum) advocate a significantly more restrictive immigration policy, arguing that high immigration levels, particularly for low-skilled workers, cut against the economic interests of ordinary Americans.Hmm.There happens to be a Republican candidate for president who wants less immigration but also thinks it\u2019s \u201coutrageous\u201d how little tax some rich people pay, and he\u2019s doing pretty well in the polls. Is Donald Trump the candidate the reformocons have been waiting for?\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Frum said.But.\u201cHe may be the jolt that the Republican Party needs to compromise its pro-plutocratic agenda,\u201d he said.It\u2019s an awkward thing: The reform conservative movement, to the extent it exists, is pointy-headed, technocratic and soft-spoken. Mr. Trump is none of those things. But his campaign has helped bolster a key argument from the reformocons: that many Republican voters are not devotees of supply-side economics and are more interested in the right kind of government than in a simply smaller one.\u201cThere were a lot of people who wanted to think the Tea Party is a straightforward libertarian movement,\u201d said Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review. But he said Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to lead the polls while attacking Republicans for wanting to cut entitlement programs showed that conservative voters are open to \u201cgovernment programs that help the right people.\u201dMr. Frum attributes most Republican candidates\u2019 continued devotion to cuts in taxes and entitlements to the desires of a Republican donor class that benefits directly from lower tax rates and indirectly, through lower labor costs, from high immigration. Mr. Trump, as Mr. Trump will happily tell you, does not need rich donors\u2019 money, and the polls show that Republican voters have not yet punished him for his praise of single-payer health care (in other countries) or his past support for a wealth tax.\u201cTrump served notice that the donors\u2019 platform isn\u2019t even acceptable inside the party,\u201d Mr. Frum said.Of course, there are reasons the reformocons have not lined up to support Mr. Trump. Just because he has identified some of the same problems as the reformocons does not mean they agree on solutions.Even those reformocons who are immigration hawks do not necessarily find much to love in Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. In an email, Yuval Levin, the editor of the conservative policy journal National Affairs, wrote that Mr. Trump \u201chas confounded what I take to be some reasonable ideas (like a tempering of future immigration rates) with what I take to be some very unreasonable ideas (like deporting 12 million people) in a way that doesn\u2019t help the more reasonable ones get heard.\u201dThere are also, of course, the insults. Mr. Salam favors a more restrictive immigration policy and would like to see more candidates speaking thoughtfully about issues of assimilation and integration. But he adds, \u201cWhen it seems like you\u2019re demonizing that population, that\u2019s completely counterproductive.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump could be a useful stalking horse for the reformocons even if they think he has bad policy ideas, says a lot of offensive things, can\u2019t win an election and wouldn\u2019t be a good president.\u201cIf Trump isn\u2019t offering workable solutions but he is identifying problems that others have ignored, the hope is some more policy-focused, more governance-focused competitor will make use of the opportunity that Trump has publicized,\u201d Mr. Frum said.In an analogy that won\u2019t make anyone very comfortable, he said Mr. Trump could be useful in the same way George Wallace was in 1968: \u201cWallace talked about a lot of issues, many of them pretty dismaying, but he also seized on the crime issue. Crime was rising fast, and it was not an issue that respectable politicians wanted to talk about. The result was that Richard Nixon stole his issue and deracialized it.\u201dIf Mr. Trump is Wallace in this analogy, then the reform conservatives are still waiting for their Nixon. Whether that\u2019s a hopeful prospect or an alarming one is up to you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Western Showdown With Mussels", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOUTTS, Alberta \u2014 At an inspection station here on the border with Montana, a black dog in an orange vest briskly scoured the hull of a motorboat, her nose twitching as she investigated every crevice.Suddenly she found the scent: a quagga mussel. Wicket sat and looked expectantly at her handler.Exercises like these are fun for Wicket, but they are deadly serious to her handlers. Montana, Wyoming, Washington, Oregon and Idaho are the only states in the West still free of invasive quagga and zebra mussels. State officials want desperately to keep the mussels out of blue-ribbon trout streams and pristine mountain lakes.Boat inspections are an important part of the effort. Along major highways in the Northwest, bright orange signs direct all travelers towing boats to pull over for a mandatory search for the two invaders, thumbnail-size creatures that have wreaked damage across the continent. Roving crews also travel to fishing derbies to search out mussels. National parks such as Yellowstone have their own inspection efforts.Out of 10,000 boats inspected in Alberta this year, just nine have been found to have mussels affixed to their hulls. But even that is too many when just a couple could start a population surge.\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent effort,\u201d Robert McMahon, emeritus professor of biology at the University of Texas at Arlington, and an expert on invasive mussels, said of the searches. But if the mussels evade detection, he added, \u201cin three or four years, they take off and you\u2019ll get massive populations. And they would greatly change the ecology.\u201dThese search efforts are expensive for sparsely populated Western states, and surveillance will be needed for the foreseeable future. But the price of a mussel invasion would be far greater.Invasive mussels cost the national economy at least $1 billion a year, though the real figure is likely much higher, Dr. McMahon said. In Idaho, officials estimate that turning back an explosion of zebra and quagga mussels could cost $100 million a year.In the 1980s, a freighter from Europe discharged ballast water into Lake Erie, and with it, some mussels. From that humble start, the invaders colonized the Great Lakes and spread across the country on towed boats.The quagga has already made its way into the West. California has battled its spread from the southern part of the state, largely successfully, with an ad campaign \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t Move a Mussel\u201d \u2014 that urges people to clean, drain and dry their boats. (For now, zebra mussels are less of problem in the West: Only San Justo Reservoir, in Central California, is infested with them.)Mussels are successful in large part because they spread by expelling clouds of wispy veligers \u2014 larvae, invisible to the naked eye, that float in a river current for weeks and perhaps hundreds of miles before attaching to rocks or pipes. With calcium in the water, they build their shells and grow into adults.While mussels don\u2019t thrive in cold streams, their numbers explode in lakes and large, slow-moving rivers. In the Great Lakes, multitudes of these filter feeders consume so much algae that the water has become crystal clear in places.\u201cThat means less food for small organisms, small fish and then large fish,\u201d Dr. McMahon said. More light is reaching the lake bottoms, too, increasing plant growth. The decay of these plants contributes to the increases in botulism, which has killed large numbers of fish and birds.Mussels also clog irrigation pipes and water intakes, and once established are impossible to permanently eradicate. That\u2019s why surveillance has become so important.If a mussel is found on a boat, it can mean quarantine, a meticulous search and decontamination with hot water, which for a large boat can take a full day. Some commercial boat haulers know they can sidestep mandatory inspections by traveling at night.Enlisting public support is part of the program, and inspectors do their best to speed boaters on their way. A sign at the inspection points describes \u201cwhat we\u2019re looking for,\u201d followed by a picture of a mussel. Below that is \u201cwhat we\u2019re not looking for,\u201d followed by pictures of marijuana, a handgun and alcohol.Beyond the inspections, biologists are testing lakes and rivers for mussel DNA. If it\u2019s found, \u201cwe have a rapid response team in place,\u201d said Cindy Sawchuk, who heads efforts to manage aquatic invasive species for the province of Alberta.The goal? Keep the mussels at bay until a successful mussel killer can be developed. \u201cEvery year we keep them out, new progress is being made,\u201d Ms. Sawchuck said.An article on Tuesday about efforts to stop the spread of invasive mussels referred incorrectly to Wicket, a dog that is trained to detect the scent of mussels. As an accompanying picture caption correctly noted, Wicket is female, not male.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Dangerous Ambivalence", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 FOR the first time in years, Greece\u2019s debt problem and the challenge this poses to the eurozone\u2019s integrity have been upstaged \u2014 pushed aside by the surge of refugees entering the European Union, most of them through Greek islands just off the Turkish coast. For us Greeks, however, as we prepare to vote on Sunday in our second national election this year, the prospect of our political impasse continuing makes us almost oblivious to the human river flowing northward through our country.The latest polls suggest a close race between the radical-leftist Syriza party, which governed between January and August, and the center-right New Democracy, which led the coalition government before that. With neither party appearing within reach of a clear majority in Parliament, many voters are hoping for a coalition that will provide stability and implement measures to revive the economy. Two bailout deals since 2010 have not achieved this; we have now negotiated a third.Greece\u2019s continuing economic crisis and the surge of refugees into the European Union have very different origins but both reflect the same phenomenon, a fundamental structural paradox: The European Union is as strong as its most powerful member, but as weak as its weakest. This allows each member to punch above its weight when things are going well, but when trouble comes, it can also expose members to forces they cannot control. As long as national interests determine European Union policy, and there is no collective response reflecting the union\u2019s political and economic power, individual states will improvise and struggle, they will quarrel among themselves, the union will look shaky and people will suffer.Syrian refugees risking their lives to get to Germany, Greece\u2019s well-educated but jobless youth, worried workers and pensioners in rich and poor countries alike \u2014 all are victims of the European Union\u2019s scattershot approach to challenges. Lacking a comprehensive policy, the union adopts measures that are a compromise among vastly different needs and positions, are often inadequate and are immediately ignored.The euro crisis reflects Europe\u2019s fears about moving toward closer political union, adopting a single currency without the appropriate structure to support it. When the first crisis arose \u2014 with Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt \u2014 the response was so haphazard that the common currency was jeopardized. Similarly, the lack of a viable policy on refugees and migrants is now testing the other core principle of the union \u2014 open borders between members.In the push and pull between national interests and collective policy, the country with the strongest economy, Germany, has been rearranging the union\u2019s political and economic relationships over the past few years. But even as it wields decisive influence on European Union policy, Berlin remains largely ambivalent toward accepting this leadership role. This imbalance between power and institutional responsibility has influenced developments not only in Greece but also in the refugee influx.Greece\u2019s membership in the eurozone allowed it to run up unsustainable debt because of the unspoken understanding that the euro was underwritten by the economic might of Germany. This allowed Athens to borrow easily to fund a deficit that in 2009 reached 15.7 percent of gross domestic product; the public debt stood at 129.7 percent of G.D.P. Greece was borrowing at rates just slightly higher than those of Germany. But when the shock waves from the 2008 global crisis hit Europe, Greece had to ask its European Union partners for support. It had borrowed like a prince, but now it faced creditors like a pauper.Similarly, the sincere welcome toward refugees on the part of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany gave hope to countless desperate people, mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. This enticed them to begin a precarious journey in a rush to get to Germany. One of the reasons the issue has not featured strongly in Greece\u2019s election campaign is that most of the 205,000 migrants and refugees who entered the country between Jan. 1 and Aug. 28 this year have moved on, even as thousands more arrive each day.With Germany\u2019s sudden imposition of temporary border controls last Sunday, Greece, and other stations on the way like Hungary and the former Yugoslav republics of Macedonia and Serbia, find themselves with large numbers of migrants who do not want to be there. The European Commission\u2019s proposal to divide 160,000 refugees among European Union members on a mandatory quota basis will most likely be ignored by refugees who want to choose where they will go, and by countries that do not want them but cannot stop them from entering. The \u201cDublin Regulation,\u201d which demands that asylum seekers apply for asylum in the country they enter, has already fallen by the wayside.If Greece is forced to keep refugees out, it will not be able to cope. Its eastern border is a lacework of islands just off Turkey\u2019s coast that cannot be patrolled adequately. Also, in dealing with desperate people there can be no military solution, nor are borders and fences inviolable. People will keep coming as long as they fear for their lives at home. And once on European soil, they must be cared for.Clearly, no country can deal with a refugee crisis of this magnitude on its own, just as no national economy can survive a crisis like the one that hit Greece. On the economic front, the European Union has shaped institutions and procedures to help members that run into trouble. But Greece\u2019s inability to revive its economy has meant it risks (perhaps temporary) suspension from the euro. On migration, the European Union\u2019s response has been equally ambivalent and dangerous \u2014 a jumble of national and collective interests, of solidarity, fear and impatience.Without any clear policy, the European Union delays responding to challenges until they cannot be ignored. But then, as each country focuses on its domestic politics, any collective actions end up being hasty and haphazard, undermining achievements, raising tension among members \u2014 in short, jeopardizing the union.Nikos Konstandaras is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rising to Your Level of Misery at Work", "Date": "2015-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEVERYONE has heard of the Peter Principle: Managers rise to the level of their incompetence. Today, however, a whole class of hyper-competent Americans will never find their level of incompetence. Instead, they will suffer a similar principle in which they rise to their level of misery.Here\u2019s how it works: Ambitious, hard-working, well-trained professionals are lifted by superiors to levels of increasing prestige and responsibility. This is fun and exciting \u2014 until it isn\u2019t.People generally have a \u201cbliss zone,\u201d a window of creative work and responsibility to match their skills and passions. But then the problems start. Those who love being part of teams and creative processes are promoted to management. Happy engineers become stressed-out supervisors. Writers find themselves in charge of other writers and haranguing them over deadlines. In my years in academia, I saw happy professors become bitter deans, constantly reminiscing about the old days doing cutting-edge research and teaching the classes they loved.Why don\u2019t people stop rising when they are happy? Because we are built to think that more is better \u2014 more power, authority, money and responsibility. So we incorrectly infer that promotions will equal greater satisfaction. In an economy that has left so many people behind in recent years, this might seem like a nice problem to have. But it is a problem nonetheless, as recent research clearly demonstrates.In 2009, scholars from the University of Illinois published a study in the journal Social Indicators Research charting the relationship between success and stress. Not surprisingly, poverty was a predictor of stress, as a lack of resources puts great pressure on everyday life. But interestingly, wealth also increased stress, probably because of high-pressure work with time constraints. So while success may initially relieve stress as people rise into the middle class, it seems to introduce a whole new set of stressful problems for those who keep climbing.So what\u2019s the solution?Here\u2019s one that many people try: Drink a lot. Research from 2010 found that people with high incomes reported consuming more alcohol than people of more modest means. Specifically, 81 percent of respondents making over $75,000 per year drink alcohol, versus 66 percent of those making $30,000 to $49,000 and 46 percent earning under $20,000.If strategies like drinking seem less than satisfactory, one might take the problem head-on instead: Identify the bliss zone and get back into it. An unhappy dean should resign and go back to the happy professorial life, right?Easier said than done. People are wired for progress, and regression looks and feels like failure. Furthermore, if one is a manager long enough, one risks falling behind in the skills in which one previously, happily functioned.If the road back is blocked, are there other options? A clue comes from scholarship on jobs designed to serve others. In 2014, two researchers published an article in the Journal of Positive Psychology looking at the lives of lawyers. They found that lawyers in high-income fields like corporate law, tort and malpractice were unhappier and less satisfied than their lower-paid counterparts in service roles such as public prosecutor or legal defender. (Not surprisingly, they also drank a lot more.)Does this suggest quitting and joining the Peace Corps? Not necessarily. In the immortal words of the Bhagavad Gita, \u201cThe renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of work.\u201d In other words, even better than renouncing your exalted position is converting it into a source of personal liberation by devoting it to the good of others.I believe that service reduces stress and raises satisfaction because it displaces the object of attention from oneself. When I am working for myself, any disappointing outcome is a stressful, unpleasant reflection on me. When I am serving, on the other hand, the work is always intrinsically valuable because of its intention. Adopting a service mind-set guarantees some measure of success.Through this added layer of intentionality, almost any work can be understood as a genuine service job. The type of work is actually less important than the attitude of the worker. This point is illustrated in the parable of a traveler who happened upon stonemasons. When he asked the workers what they were doing, one mason simply replied, \u201cI am making a living.\u201d But another stonemason answered differently: \u201cI am building a cathedral.\u201dEvery one of us is building a human cathedral. In our interconnected world and global economy, our work transforms the lives of countless others. Sometimes the impact is obvious: Managers and executives directly inflect their employees\u2019 happiness and career success. But everyone, in every industry, affects the lives of co-workers, supervisors, customers, suppliers, donors or investors. How often do we spend our morning commute thinking consciously about how to make their lives better through our work? What if we made this as routine as our morning coffee?So cheer up, kvetchers. Relief is as close as the kindness you show to others. Build your cathedral. And for God\u2019s sake, stop drinking so much.Advertisement"}

He had spent the early morning at a $1,000-per-person fund-raising luncheon in San Juan.A 10-minute drive down the highway, Mrs. Clinton held a round-table event at the Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico y del Caribe, where she focused on the health and economic challenges facing Puerto Rico, whose government is in a financial crisis and struggling to pay $72 billion in debt.After arriving an hour late, Mrs. Clinton sat and did more listening than talking at first \u2014 \u201cI came here to listen,\u201d she told the panel \u2014 nodding and taking notes as seven health officials and practitioners listed issues plaguing Puerto Rico\u2019s health care system, from struggling with Affordable Care Act regulations to an exodus of talented doctors to the mainland. One of the panelists handed her a magazine, and while Mrs. Clinton recognized it was in Spanish, she said she got the message.\u201cI can read crisis and crisis,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, to a few laughs from the crowd.The Rubio campaign billed the dueling events as a battle between him and Mrs. Clinton, blasting out a press release titled \u201cMarco vs. Hillary in Puerto Rico this Friday\u201d and criticizing Mrs. Clinton in his only English remarks at his event.\u201cIt sounds to me like Secretary Clinton\u2019s plan for Puerto Rico is to continue the same projects that they\u2019re doing now,\u201d he said in response to a question. \u201cThe people who are rallying behind her today are the people who put Puerto Rico in this fiscal mess to begin with.\u201dMr. Rubio also wrote an op-ed article (in English and Spanish) published on Friday in El Nuevo D\u00eda, Puerto Rico\u2019s highest-circulation newspaper, that highlighted his opposition to granting Puerto Rico the right to seek a Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which Mrs. Clinton supports. His position drew challenging questions from local reporters, and Mr. Rubio reiterated that he believed Puerto Rico must reform its spending policies before it is granted relief.Mrs. Clinton, however, while not mentioning Mr. Rubio or any other Republican in her speech, obviously disagreed.\u201cI do not believe you can fix your economy through austerity alone,\u201d she said, to whoops and cheers in the crowd.She did take the same position as Mr. Rubio on potential statehood, saying that should Puerto Ricans vote for it, she would stand with them.The two candidates\u2019 presence on the same day here underscored the importance of the commonwealth in the nominating process.For Mrs. Clinton, the visit to the commonwealth reflects both short- and long-term goals. Trying to bat away the increasingly popular Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race, Mrs. Clinton is also in the delegate-grabbing game.And she hinted at as much as she closed her remarks in Puerto Rico.\u201cIt always struck me as so indefensible that you can\u2019t vote for president if you live here,\u201d she said with a slight smile. \u201cBut if you move to Florida \u2014 which, of course, I\u2019m just naming a state \u2014 you can vote for president.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Wilderness conservation and the hydrocarbon economy have been uneasy bedfellows ever since, with protected lands often viewed as compensatory gestures for our voracious remaking of the landscape elsewhere.Every fire season since 2002, I\u2019ve served as a lookout in one of these wilderness preserves, in the Gila National Forest in New Mexico. The whole complex of life in this arid landscape evolved to thrive in the presence of flame, and so, each spring and summer for nearly 40 years, a certain number of prescribed burns and unplanned, lightning-caused fires have been managed with the long-term health of the forest in mind. Recently, however, these efforts have been dwarfed by the new reality of the megafire.In 2011 and 2012, I inhaled smoke from the biggest blazes in the recorded history of Arizona and New Mexico, respectively. In 2013 I was evacuated from my mountain by helicopter, after the tower where I spend five months of the year was made uninhabitable, first by smoke and then by flame, as a lightning-ignited burn stranded my perch in the middle of a 216-square-mile scar. In each of these cases there was not much for firefighters to do but stand back and watch, protect a few cabins, and pray for rain.Some days, gripped by fatalism, I\u2019m tempted to think of my purpose as little more than presiding over a funeral for the old-growth forests of the American Southwest. In more sanguine moods, I concur with ecologists who argue that we should celebrate a burned forest as evidence of recovery from its having been kept artificially green too long. This philosophy flips the policy of total fire suppression, which held sway in the country\u2019s public-lands agencies for most of the 20th century, on its head. It begs for the creation of a new pyromancy; it is willfully hopeful in a time of grave doubt.Nature consumes the majority of accumulated forest biomass in one of two ways: It rots or it burns, depending on available moisture. As the planet heats, the balance shifts. Of all the stunning news photos from this summer of fire in the West, it was an aerial view of a small burn in the Olympic National Park that spoke most astonishingly to the changes afoot. There, in a place that receives an average of 140 inches of precipitation annually, the axis tilted toward flame. A temperate rain forest managed to ignite.Astonishing, too, are the photographs of James Balog, which allow us to see the face of wildfire in a novel way. His infrared images from this summer's wildfires in California, as well as prescribed burns in Canada's Northwest Territories \u2014 of the sort often used in fire management \u2014 focus our attention on heat, erasing the apocalyptic smoke that dominates most such photos. \u2018\u2018I wanted to get down to the elemental,\u2019\u2019 he says of this project, inspired in part by the Fourmile Canyon fire outside Boulder, Colo., five summers ago, which came within a half-mile of burning his family\u2019s home. \u2018\u2018Infrared renders heat as white and allows us to really look at flames with a lingering gaze, without that instinctive mammalian response of fear at the sight of orange and red,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re in the midst of an epochal moment, in a pure geological sense, and these pictures are very much an expression of that, as much as calving glaciers and melting ice.\u2019\u2019James Balog is a photographer based in Boulder, Colo. His most recent book is \u201cIce: Portraits of Vanishing Glaciers.\u201d Philip Connors is the author of \u201cFire Season: Field Notes From a Wilderness Lookout\u201d and a new memoir, \u201cAll the Wrong Places: A Life Lost and Found.\u201d He lives in New Mexico.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt Rescue Plan Called Into Question", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA week after the governor of Puerto Rico laid out a plan for attacking the island\u2019s heavy debt, analysts are beginning to publicly question the proposals and even the financial assumptions on which they are based.The doubts suggest that Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s strategy to persuade bondholders and other investors to voluntarily help the island restructure the debt \u2014 and take losses on their investments as a result \u2014 is a long shot.One credit analyst, Ryan Brady of Morgan Stanley, said it appeared that the planners had greatly overstated Puerto Rico\u2019s financial needs over the next five years. As a result, he said in a private presentation to clients, Puerto Rico was hoping to get $14 billion in concessions from its creditors, when in fact it might need as little as $5.7 billion.And Sergio M. Marxuach, public policy director for the Center for a New Economy, a research institute in San Juan, P.R., said on Wednesday that the five-year plan appeared to be \u201ctilted toward austerity rather than growth,\u201d which could undermine its key goal of reviving the island\u2019s economy.Mr. Marxuach also questioned whether the Puerto Rican government could carry out the plan, because it relies on an independent control board to enforce politically unpalatable austerity measures. Mr. Marxuach said it was not clear how the board would function.The Puerto Rican legislature is expected to take up the issue of a control board in the next two weeks, but lawmakers have said other elements of the five-year plan will not be considered until January.Barbara Morgan, a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank, which arranges the island\u2019s borrowing and liquidity needs, said the bank did not have access to the data underlying the Morgan Stanley assessment. But in an email, she said, \u201cThis analysis appears, at best, sloppy and, worse, a disservice to the 3.5 million American citizens of Puerto Rico.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unfortunate that something of such quality was used to inform an investment bank\u2019s clients or the public at large.\u201dPuerto Rico\u2019s governor warned in June that its debt was \u201cunpayable,\u201d and the only hope was to reduce scheduled payments for a few years while reforming the island\u2019s deeply depressed economy. He assigned a team of government finance specialists to develop a plan, which was released to the public last week. The planners projected the total cost of providing government services on the island for the next five years, and found that it would be about $28 billion more than the resources available. They then devised a number of austerity measures and tax changes, which they said could whittle the projected five-year shortfall down to $14 billion.Over the same period, they said, the Puerto Rican government is scheduled to pay about $18 billion to a large group of creditors. The plan calls for withholding about $14 billion of those payments and using the money to fill the gap.In a slide show that accompanied a client briefing last week, Mr. Brady discussed the assumptions that led the planners to those numbers, saying that a different set of assumptions could produce a much smaller shortfall, just $5.7 billion. Mr. Brady\u2019s slides suggested that Puerto Rico\u2019s planners had excluded the effects of certain tax changes in arriving at a five-year shortfall of $14 billion. For example, the working group accounted for a sharp increase in sales taxes on the island in a way that increased the five-year shortfall by $5.3 billion, Mr. Brady concluded.Mr. Brady declined to comment on his presentation, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Disclaimers at the end of the report said it was a \u201csales and trading commentary,\u201d prepared for institutional clients considering derivatives transactions with the bank. It said it did not necessarily reflect the opinions of Morgan Stanley\u2019s research department.At the Center for a New Economy, Mr. Marxuach said that he had turned to research on other debt crises by Carmen M. Reinhart and other economists. Their work showed that \u201ckick the can\u201d strategies that pushed debt payments farther into the future did not provide enough change in countries with very protracted sovereign debt crises, he said, adding, \u201cYou still have people unwilling to invest in your country because of the huge debt cloud over it.\u201dMr. Marxuach said he was closely watching a second report, on Puerto Rico\u2019s available cash, which was issued on the same day as the five-year debt-adjustment plan but has received much less attention. It showed that Puerto Rico\u2019s treasury would exhaust its cash in November, despite taking \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to conserve cash whenever possible.In addition, the island\u2019s development bank is expected to exhaust all of its cash at the end of December. That will coincide with a large payment due on the island\u2019s general obligation bonds in early January. Those bonds were sold with an explicit constitutional guarantee, and Mr. Marxuach said that not making the payment on time, from the investor\u2019s perspective, would be \u201ca declaration of war.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t pay, you\u2019re losing any chance of negotiations with the bondholders,\u201d he said.On the other hand, if Puerto Rico runs out of cash in December, it might have to shut down the government for a time. It did so once before, during a fiscal crisis in 2006, causing an outcry.\u201cAre you really going to send government workers home in the middle of the Christmas season, without a paycheck? Are you really going to default on January 1?\u201d Mr. Marxuach asked. \u201cThose are really tough decisions, but those are the kind of decisions we may have to make.\u201dGovernor Garc\u00eda Padilla may have signaled the answer to that question in a recent speech that was televised in Puerto Rico. He said that if Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors would not negotiate concessions, he would have to execute the five-year plan without them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citic Securities, a Pillar of Finance in China, Is in Beijing\u2019s Cross Hairs", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With its market dominance, banking talent, global ambition and sterling political connections, Citic Securities fancied itself the Goldman Sachs of China.Citic Securities, the brokerage arm of the biggest state-owned financial conglomerate, rode China\u2019s stock market boom and a surge in corporate borrowing. The company\u2019s stock price tripled in six months.That a financial company as embedded in the Communist Party elite as Citic Securities has fallen on hard times highlights the uncertainty in Chinese stock markets, the broader economy and the political climate in Beijing.In this environment, the usual rules don\u2019t seem to apply, putting financial stalwarts like Citic Securities on shaky ground.Even the company\u2019s political connections have not provided protection. The Georgetown-educated chairman of Citic Securities, Wang Dongming, is the son of a former Chinese diplomat. The father of Liu Lefei, a vice chairman, is the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda chief and a member of the ruling seven-member Politburo Standing Committee.Citic Securities also finds itself fending off rumors on Chinese websites and on social media. Shares of the company are off by almost two-thirds since peaking in late April.As with much involving the Chinese government, a lack of information is making it difficult to discern exactly what is happening.Citic Securities is an important member of the government-controlled \u201cnational team\u201d that carries out the will of the state in financial markets. With the government now trying to prop up the markets, big brokerage firms like Citic Securities are tasked with buying stocks to help stabilize shares.Which stocks brokerages are buying and how those purchases are managed is veiled in secrecy. But some experts on China\u2019s financial system worry that such information could be leaking out, giving some investors an unfair advantage.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a dreadful situation that the Chinese government\u2019s put themselves in, because there are clearly people in the know about what the government\u2019s intentions are, what it\u2019s buying,\u201d said Fraser J.\u00a0T. Howie, a longtime banker in Asia and a co-author of \u201cRed Capitalism: The Fragile Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise.\u201d\u201cPeople could easily look to front-run them,\u201d he added.Calls to Citic Securities\u2019 board secretary and a press officer went unanswered.The authorities are broadly looking at the role of financial players in the market rout, adding to the sense of anxiety in the markets.\u201cIt seems like the government will not give up until it reaches its goal,\u201d said Liu Shengjun, the executive deputy director of the Lujiazui Institute of International Finance at the China Europe International Business School, \u201cand that it has to save the market no matter what it takes.\u201dThe dearth of information is breeding rumors, complicating matters for big players like Citic Securities.Officials at Zexi, the retailer and Citic Securities were not available to comment on the matter.It is an uncomfortable new spotlight for Citic Securities.Citic Securities, started in 1995, has been the top equity underwriter in China for years. In the last five years, the brokerage firm has raised more than $30 billion for companies in China, including for marquee players like the state-owned nuclear power company, according to data from Bloomberg.Citic Securities is also the biggest shareholder in the Citic Private Equity Fund Management Company, one of the biggest private equity firms in China, whose chairman is Mr. Liu, the son of the propaganda chief. The company has made early investments in big businesses that later had successful initial public offerings, like the New China Life Insurance Company in 2011.The chairman of Citic Securities, Mr. Wang, has been cited in the Chinese news media as saying he wants his company to become known as the Goldman Sachs of China.But the official inquiry into Citic Securities shows that there are limits to political connections in China, especially as industries such as finance become more professional and competitive, said Mr. Liu of the Lujiazui Institute.He points to the declining market share of the China International Capital Corporation, the country\u2019s first investment bank, which until October was headed by the son of a former premier. Its dominance in underwriting shares was supplanted by Citic Securities in recent years.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Corporate Efforts to Address Social Problems Have Limits", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThere is something appealing about the concept of \u201cshared value.\u201dThe strategy, first articulated by Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School and the management consultant Mark R. Kramer, is based on the belief that companies can increase profits and enhance their businesses even as they address pressing social problems.\u201cIf you are creative, you can find ways to create economic value and social value simultaneously,\u201d said Stuart Thorn, Southwire\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSome stuff that we are doing results in lifting up people that otherwise might not have the opportunity, while the business is also lifting itself up.\u201dSuch outcomes are promising. Done on a large scale, reconfiguring companies\u2019 relations with their multiple stakeholders \u2014 their workers, customers and communities \u2014 could, advocates hope, help reconstitute the nation\u2019s social fabric.And yet the case for enlisting corporations to address rising inequality and stagnant mobility warrants some skepticism. For starters, social and corporate objectives are obviously not always aligned. If so many so-called win-win opportunities for companies exist, why haven\u2019t more been taken?Surprisingly, perhaps, executives care about such things. Two-thirds said it was more important to address poverty, inequality, middle-class stagnation or economic mobility than to stimulate economic growth.\u201cThere is a compelling new sense that generally very wealthy and senior business leaders are starting to understand this is a significant problem,\u201d said Professor Porter, a co-author of the study with his colleagues Karen Mills and Jan W. Rivkin.Most interestingly, many executives say they believe the growing gap in income and opportunity is not just bad for the country, it is bad for business, too. It curbs consumer spending, undercuts worker morale and produces political polarization. \u201cEven with their business hat on, the system isn\u2019t working for them,\u201d Professor Rivkin said.Much of this concern grew out of the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. Public frustration over the slow recovery of workers\u2019 fortunes while businesses prospered reached the executive suite.And yet Professor Porter argues that executives are driven by a broader set of business considerations. It\u2019s about businesses that cannot find skilled workers and realize they have not paid attention to what he calls \u201cthe supply chain for skills.\u201d It\u2019s about companies\u2019 realization that low wages can be costly, too, sapping motivation and increasing turnover.Of the respondents to Harvard\u2019s survey whose companies employed low-wage workers, a third said they had either already increased pay or planned to do so in the coming year. \u201cCompanies that have customer-facing employees and want to keep them must rethink the issue of worker pay,\u201d Professor Porter said.The most significant shift in corporate decision-making, he said, may stem from a serious re-evaluation of globalization.The wave of outsourcing to cheap labor markets across the world is being reassessed in light of the growing importance of flexible production schedules and proximity to customers. In tech-heavy industries, piracy has increased the cost of outsourcing. In other businesses, automation and rising Chinese wages have changed the cost-benefit equation.This dynamic offers the tantalizing possibility that multinationals that long ago shed the local bonds that characterized the industrial giants of an earlier era might again anchor their prosperity on the success of American communities, families and workers.Does this add up to meaningful social transformation? While these new business dynamics could add up to powerful forces for change, addressing America\u2019s lack of shared prosperity may also require higher taxes, more stringent regulations and other changes that lavishly paid corporate leaders with Harvard M.B.A.s would be unlikely to welcome.\u201cI don\u2019t see too many people inside companies thinking that pay in some absolute sense is too high,\u201d Professor Porter said. There is interest in better tying pay to performance, he added, but \u201clots of people are still offended by the discussion saying that somebody is getting paid too much.\u201dHarvard\u2019s survey offers good reason to temper one\u2019s optimism: Corporate chieftains are pretty pessimistic, too. More than a third of respondents forecast wages and benefits will be lower three years from now, a bigger share than those forecasting wages and benefits will be higher.Things do not pick up from there. Over half of respondents expect inequality to be worse a decade from now, if the United States sticks to its \u201ccurrent economic and political institutions.\u201d Almost half expected poverty to deepen. A quarter expect economic mobility to deteriorate further. (Only one in 10 expected it to improve.)Social change will not happen without profound changes in corporate culture and practice. The growing chasm between the incomes and opportunities of the rich and the rest is not fixable with taxes and transfers alone.But can we rely on the executive suite to effect change?But there are also reasons for despair. In Times Square, a billboard was erected a few days ago, paid for by the fast-food lobby, to protest the new $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers in New York State.The companies behind that billboard appear to have no time for \u201cshared value\u201d initiatives like those put in place by Southwire. It is making an entirely different case: Addressing social problems will have to take a back seat to the bottom line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Tax Plan Is a Large Tax Cut for the Wealthiest", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016In recent weeks, Donald Trump has torn up the usual Republican script on taxes. He has called for tax cuts for the middle class while complaining of \u201coutrageous\u201d tax breaks for multimillionaires, especially hedge fund managers.On Wednesday, Jeb Bush joined Mr. Trump by issuing a tax plan that ends certain tax breaks for hedge fund managers. But aside from that detail, Mr. Bush\u2019s plan stays very much on script for Republican tax plans: It cuts taxes for almost everyone who pays income tax, with by far the largest tax cuts at the top.According to an analysis by The New York Times, Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan would reduce the effective income tax rate on filers making $10 million or more per year to approximately 21 percent, down from 26 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. The average taxpayer in this group earned $29.2 million in 2013, meaning the plan proposed by Mr. Bush would have saved them an average of $1.5 million that year.High earners were hit with a large tax increase in 2013, because of the partial expiration of the George W. Bush tax cuts and new taxes in the Affordable Care Act. Jeb Bush\u2019s tax plan would lower the tax burden on the wealthiest to near the levels that prevailed under his brother.The reason Mr. Bush\u2019s plan cuts taxes for the rich so much is simple: He would cut the top tax rate on regular income by almost 12 percentage points and on capital income by almost 4 points. The current seven-bracket tax system, with rates from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, would be replaced with just three brackets of 10, 25 and 28 percent. Maximum tax rates on investment income would drop from 23.8 percent to 20 percent.Mr. Bush would eliminate and cap many deductions, and tax a greater share of top earners\u2019 income. However, The Times\u2019s analysis finds that these base expansion effects would be small relative to the tax rate cuts.Mr. Bush\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t cut taxes just for the rich. In part by doubling the standard deduction, it would cut income taxes on all income groups and most tax filers. By expanding the earned-income tax credit, it would cut taxes for some who currently pay no federal income tax. It would also significantly cut the corporate income tax.This tax-cuts-for-nearly-everyone approach is a major departure from Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 tax plan, which promised deep tax rate cuts without increasing the deficit; it led to claims by opponents that he\u2019d need to raise taxes on many middle-income taxpayers in order to put the same amount of money in federal coffers.Here\u2019s the math behind The Times\u2019s estimate of the Bush plan\u2019s effects on the highest earners. Taxpayers earning $10 million or more (the highest income category reported by the I.R.S. in its income tax statistics) paid federal income taxes equal to 26.1 percent of their income in 2013. That was the first year in which high-earning taxpayers faced tax increases related to the Affordable Care Act and the partial expiration of the Bush tax cuts.Under Mr. Bush\u2019s plan, these taxpayers would face a nominal tax rate of 28 percent on ordinary income. However, even after the rule change on carried interest, about 60 percent of these taxpayers\u2019 income would enjoy a preferential rate of 20 percent because it consists of capital gains, interest payments, dividends and other similar returns on capital. Taking a weighted average of those rates results in a blended rate of 23.1 percent. Itemized deductions (mostly for contributions to charity, which Mr. Bush\u2019s plan would not impose new caps on) would reduce that rate to about 21.1 percent, five points below the actual figures for 2013.According to examples provided by the Bush campaign, typical taxpayers would get tax cuts that raise their after-tax income by amounts ranging from 1.9 percent (for a single adult earning $50,000) to 4.3 percent (for a married couple making $250,000). By The Times\u2019s calculation, taxpayers earning over $10 million would experience a 6.8 percent rise in their after-tax incomes on average under the Bush plan.Mr. Bush also plans cuts in corporate taxes, which are ultimately borne by individuals. Economists debate exactly how the corporate tax burden is spread between shareholders (in the form of lower after-tax profits) and workers (in the form of lower wages paid by corporations), but consensus estimates generally put the bulk of the burden on shareholders.The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 75 percent of corporate taxes are paid by owners of capital. Assuming that is right, Mr. Bush\u2019s corporate tax cut would constitute an additional significant tax cut for the highest earners. However, many economists also believe corporate tax cuts are more effective than personal income tax cuts at spurring economic growth; a corporate tax cut could drive economic gains that raise pretax incomes for people across the income spectrum, while having direct tax effects that mostly benefit the wealthy.\u201cIf this plan was financed by contemporaneous entitlement cuts, I think it\u2019s clear there would be a significant increase in economic growth,\u201d said Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But he said middle-income people might not be better off, despite getting tax cuts.\u201cSome income groups will be hit by the entitlement reductions that are being adopted under the scenario, and so then obviously you have to take that into account,\u201d Mr. Viard said. \u201cOne might ask whether the growth effects are sufficiently big so that those groups come out ahead in the long run, and certainly I think that\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t know.\u201dOf course, deep tax cuts wouldn\u2019t have to be financed with spending cuts, at least not right away. They could be financed with borrowing, as was done in the last decade. Mr. Viard argued this approach would provide much less of an economic lift, because the effects of added government borrowing would offset the positive economic effects of tax cuts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s President Says Peace Talks Overcame Late Surprise ", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia met with the leader of his country\u2019s largest guerrilla group this week to seal the outline of a deal to end more than five decades of war, he received an unsettling shock. At the last minute, he said, the rebel leader, Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, tried to back out of a crucial part of the newly negotiated framework.Mr. Santos said that in their first meeting ever, on Wednesday in Havana, Mr. Londo\u00f1o, the leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, seemed to reject an agreement, negotiated just the night before, to set a six-month deadline for the signing of a final accord to end the war.Recalling the episode on Friday during an interview in New York, Mr. Santos said that Mr. Londo\u00f1o questioned whether his negotiators had indeed agreed to the six-month timetable, which Mr. Santos considered essential to completing the negotiations. He told Mr. Londo\u00f1o that he had flown to Havana that day only for the meeting because of the agreement on the timetable.Mr. Santos said that the two men called in the negotiating teams and Mr. Santos addressed the rebels\u2019 lead negotiator. \u201cI said: \u2018What is this? Did you not inform this guy about the deadline?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, we did.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHe said Mr. Londo\u00f1o then reconsidered and agreed to go ahead. \u201cThat was a difficult moment,\u201d Mr. Santos said with a wry smile.Mr. Santos said the rebel leader worried that the government would use the deadline to force the guerrillas to make concessions at the last minute, but he assured Mr. Londo\u00f1o that he wanted only to speed up the end of the talks. That smoothed over the impasse.Besides the deadline, the two sides announced Wednesday that the rebels would begin to hand over their weapons 60 days after the signing of a final peace deal.And they said that according to their basic agreement, rebel leaders and military officers who had committed human rights violations and other egregious crimes during the war would be punished \u2014 a breakthrough on what had long been an obstacle to a final accord.Mr. Santos said that the punishment would include detention in a special site that he described as \u201can austere installation\u201d but \u201cnot a typical jail with black-and-white pajamas.\u201dThousands of low-level FARC fighters would be granted an amnesty under the deal, but Mr. Santos said several dozen rebel leaders could be subject to the punishment, possibly including Mr. Londo\u00f1o. The rebels would be required to confess to their crimes before a tribunal, and a failure to do so could lead to more severe punishment. On Friday, Human Rights Watch criticized the measure, saying it would \u201cdeny justice to thousands of victims of grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law by allowing their abusers to escape meaningful punishment.\u201d Mr. Santos said that he had come to trust the FARC \u2014 a step that will be necessary for many Colombians if an eventual peace deal is to gain wide acceptance.\u201cI have learned to believe in the sincerity of what the FARC wants,\u201d Mr. Santos said, adding that he believed that \u201cthey want to lay down their arms and continue their struggle through peaceful means.\u201dMany critical details still need to be worked out before a final deal is signed. And Mr. Santos said that winning over Colombians was another obstacle.Speaking in English, Mr. Santos, who wore a dove pin in his lapel, also talked about the crisis on the border of Colombia and Venezuela and his recent clashes with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela.Mr. Maduro shut down several major border crossings last month and began deporting hundreds of Colombians, claiming that Colombian paramilitary fighters were part of a plot to kill him and were masterminding widespread smuggling that was hurting Venezuela\u2019s economy.He accused the Colombian government of approving a plot to assassinate him, called Mr. Santos a liar and said Mr. Santos had \u201clost his senses.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Mr. Santos said in the interview on Friday, adding that he had told Mr. Maduro the same thing in a meeting on Monday.Asked how Mr. Maduro responded, Mr. Santos said, \u201cHe changed the subject.\u201dMr. Santos repeated earlier assertions that Venezuela had mistreated and violated the human rights of the deported Colombians. And, referring to his neighboring country\u2019s economic crisis, he said, \u201cVenezuela\u2019s problems are made in Venezuela.\u201dMr. Santos avoided taking a clear position on the 14-year prison sentence handed down this month to Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a Venezuelan opposition politician whose trial on charges of inciting violence during antigovernment protests has been denounced by the United Nations and the Organization of American States as lacking in due process.\u201cThe Venezuelans claim that they did not violate his process,\u201d Mr. Santos said. \u201cI personally think that he should have been treated more fairly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With the first anniversary of the normalization announcement only a couple of months away, Mr. Obama has been pressing to make as much headway as possible in breaking down barriers between the United States and Cuba.When the rules were issued this month, Ms. Pritzker said they could help create \u201clong overdue economic reform\u201d in Cuba, and business leaders who had been agitating to loosen the regulations said doing so would pressure Havana to open its own markets and relax its own strictures.At the same time, officials acknowledge that some of the changes announced by the Obama administration will yield results only if Cuba modifies aspects of its state-run economy to facilitate them. For example, while the Commerce Department lifted export restrictions on some electronic equipment and civilian aviation safety materials, such items would still be difficult to transmit unless Cuba drops rules that mandate that all imports go through a government agency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economy Falters, Military Parade Offers Chance to Burnish Image", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe event allows Mr. Xi to push a much bolder nationalist agenda just as the Chinese public is beginning to question the party\u2019s main source of legitimacy: its ability to deliver economic growth.\u201cAs social conflicts continue to sharpen, the party needs to divert attention, and of course a parade is a good way to do that by whipping up nationalist fervor,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing.Though billed as a commemoration of the war\u2019s end, the holiday has been carefully conceived to project Mr. Xi\u2019s vision for a \u201crejuvenated\u201d China: a rising military power that will stand up to rivals \u2014 most notably Japan and its main ally, the United States. But the turn to the past has left the party open to criticism that it is manipulating the history of the war to overstate the Communist role in ending Japan\u2019s 14-year occupation of parts of China.The turnout robs Mr. Xi of international prestige to make the event more credible, and suggests he may have misjudged the anxiety across Asia over rising Chinese nationalism. Washington has expressed unease with the parade\u2019s demonization of Japan, saying it would prefer that China hold a forward-looking event that promotes reconciliation and healing.Inside China, critics have questioned Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to break a tradition that calls for a military parade only once every decade to celebrate the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The next anniversary, in 2019, will signal 70 years since Mao\u2019s rebels vanquished the Nationalists after a bloody civil war, and Chinese officials have not said whether they will hold another parade just four years after this one.\u201cEvery emperor has his weakness, and Xi wants to demonstrate his might and prestige,\u201d said Hu Jia, a prominent Chinese dissident. \u201cThe parade is a chance for the Communist Party to show its gleaming knives and shiny boots so the people will submit to the fear and the charm,\u201d he added.Perhaps the most stinging criticism has come from historians in China and abroad, who have accused the party of distorting the narrative of China\u2019s fight against Japan.Historians generally agree that the Nationalist armies of Chiang Kai-shek, not Mao\u2019s Communist guerrillas, did the bulk of the fighting against the Japanese. The majority of the estimated three million Chinese soldiers who died from 1937 to 1945 wore the Nationalist uniform, while the Communists, nearly vanquished by Chiang at the time of Tokyo\u2019s invasion, spent most of the war rebuilding behind enemy lines and only occasionally ambushing Japanese troops.For decades, the Communist Party portrayed their Nationalist foes as too corrupt to battle the Japanese effectively. But that narrative has shifted in recent years as China, eager to improve ties with Taiwan and deflate pro-independence sentiment on the island where Chiang and his troops fled, has acknowledged and even celebrated the Nationalists\u2019 role in fighting Japan.\u201cThere\u2019s been a stealth rehabilitation of the Nationalists,\u201d said Rana Mitter, a professor of Chinese history at Oxford University and the author of \u201cForgotten Ally: China\u2019s World War II, 1937-1945,\u201d noting that wartime soap operas on the mainland now often include an honorable Nationalist officer as a stock character.Organizers have even invited Nationalist veterans to participate in Thursday\u2019s parade, but the move has proved controversial in Taiwan. Among those planning to attend is Lien Chan, a former Taiwanese vice president who once led the Nationalist Party. Some have called his decision to go a betrayal, saying it lends credence to the Communists\u2019 self-promoting version of history.Party propagandists frequently sidestep another crucial detail about World War II: Though Chinese troops tied down a million Japanese soldiers who might have otherwise been free to fight Allied forces in the Pacific, Tokyo\u2019s surrender is generally attributed to the American atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Manchuria, the northern Chinese region that was then a Japanese puppet state.Over the decades, the party has all but ignored the anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. In fact, historians say, Mao repeatedly played down Japanese wartime atrocities, even rebuffing Tokyo\u2019s offer for reparations. Fixated on class struggle and his Nationalist nemeses on Taiwan, he was willing to let bygones be bygones partly because he was eager to court Japanese investment.The decision to cast Japan as an unrepentant enemy of the Chinese people was made after 1989, when the party\u2019s violent suppression of student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen Square prompted a crisis of faith among the educated elite. In the years that followed, Chinese leaders introduced a patriotic education campaign that emphasized Japanese wartime atrocities and the indignities wrought by a century of foreign invasions.Zheng Wang, director of the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at Seton Hall University, said the ideological re-education campaign had largely succeeded in forging a national identity based on a narrative that is part myth, part trauma.Mr. Xi has taken that narrative further in promoting \u201cthe Chinese Dream,\u201d an emotional appeal for national rejuvenation and military greatness.\u201cThe humiliation narrative is a very important part of China\u2019s identity formation, but I didn\u2019t expect President Xi to continue on the same track, as his China has already risen to be a major world power,\u201d Professor Wang said. \u201cIn fact, the current administration has been giving even more emphasis to that narrative.\u201dThree months later, China will celebrate a second new holiday on Dec. 13 to memorialize Japanese atrocities in the eastern city of Nanjing, where tens of thousands of unarmed civilians were massacred over several weeks in 1937.Some warn that the party has fanned anti-Japanese sentiment to dangerous levels.During a recent visit to the Chinese People\u2019s Anti-Japanese War Memorial Hall, a museum on the outskirts of southern Beijing, young people voiced anger over what they described as Japan\u2019s reluctance to acknowledge its wartime behavior as others snapped selfies standing atop Japanese flags and other Imperial army relics displayed under a glass floor.\u201cI would shed my blood in the face of Japanese aggression,\u201d declared Feng Hao, 19, a college student from Shaanxi Province who was spending the afternoon at the museum with dozens of classmates wearing matching red Windbreakers.Mr. Hao, a journalism major, eagerly recited the details about Mao\u2019s struggle against the Japanese that dominated the museum\u2019s exhibits. But he drew a blank when asked about the episode in 1989 when Chinese troops opened fire on unarmed protesters or the famine, social chaos and three decades of economic stagnation that resulted from Mao\u2019s misguided policies.\u201cWe don\u2019t learn that much about those things at school,\u201d he said apologetically. But then he brightened with another thought. \u201cWe mostly study ancient history,\u201d he explained. \u201cChina has a long history, and the things you mention are just a tiny portion of our past.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when a state-backed film about the Cairo Declaration of 1943 was criticized by members of the Chinese public.

He has taken control of the party\u2019s most important policy committees. His scorching anticorruption campaign has subdued potential opponents. His prime minister and other colleagues have been relegated to cheerleading roles.Mr. Xi\u2019s bustling, forceful approach was meant to yield bold and nimble governance after years of torpor and paralysis under his predecessors. But with so much authority concentrated in his hands, and such broad ambitions, the risks of bureaucratic confusion and overload are increasingly apparent, especially in the management of the Chinese economy, the second largest in the world.Mr. Xi \u201cappears to be powerful, because he has placed himself in key positions,\u201d Mr. Suettinger added. \u201cBut the question is: Are decisions being made, and is the system beginning to move in the direction that he wants? That part, I think the jury is still out on.\u201dFew see much likelihood of a serious leadership challenge to Mr. Xi, but his authority could suffer if these policy-making problems intensify and the economy continues to sputter.\u201cXi, in his impressive consolidation of power in the short run, raises questions for the long run. Has he put himself in charge of too much?\u201d said David M. Lampton, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who has long studied China\u2019s leaders.\u201cA principal danger\u201d confronting Mr. Xi is that the economic slowdown will undermine public support for one-party rule, Professor Lampton added, and \u201cPresident Xi seems to be compensating by emphasizing China\u2019s resurgent role in the world.\u201dThough the Chinese economy has softened, Mr. Xi remains in a strong position for his meeting with Mr. Obama on Thursday.Unless something extraordinary happens at the highest echelons of the Communist Party, Mr. Xi can expect seven more years in power, while Mr. Obama will leave office in 16 months, a gap that some Chinese scholars say has led Mr. Xi to view his counterpart as a lame duck.\u201cHe believes we are a major power and is more willing to confront the U.S.,\u201d Professor Shen added.Mr. Xi and Mr. Obama are expected to discuss their differences on a number of subjects, including cybersecurity, tensions in the South China Sea, the repatriation of Chinese officials accused of corruption and the Chinese government\u2019s harsh treatment of dissidents and lawyers.Mr. Xi has left his mark on all of these issues since assuming leadership of the party in November 2012, taking tougher positions than his predecessors in most cases.American corporate executives have complained that a new national security law in China and proposed laws on cybersecurity and counterterrorism will restrict their operations by subjecting them to unnecessary scrutiny from China\u2019s ever more powerful domestic security apparatus. But Mr. Xi offered a robust defense of the legislation in the meeting, according to the American with knowledge of the meeting.In foreign policy, too, Mr. Xi \u201cseems less interested in cutting deals\u201d than his predecessors, Professor Lampton said. \u201cHe has demonstrated a willingness to have more friction with the outside world than his predecessors.\u201d\u201cIt is an area we have not seen progress or change in their behavior,\u201d a senior administration official said.Bilahari Kausikan, a former permanent secretary of Singapore\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said Chinese hacking of American targets was likely to continue because Mr. Xi had little incentive to stop it. \u201cAt present my guess is that, as China is relatively less wired than the U.S., it is also less vulnerable,\u201d he said.In a speech here last week intended to preview Mr. Xi\u2019s positions on major issues between China and the United States, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, sounded a defiant tone. \u201cI wish to reiterate that the Nansha Islands are China\u2019s territory,\u201d he said, using the Chinese name for the archipelago. \u201cThese are China\u2019s positions that will not change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And it\u2019s important to note that Altice isn\u2019t contributing much cash.The move isn\u2019t exactly a surprise given Mr. Drahi\u2019s ambitions in the United States, even if it comes earlier than expected. The deal for Suddenlink hasn\u2019t even closed. The rationale for the larger deal looks similar: Hack costs to the bone. Cablevision, which operates in the New York metropolitan area, already has high broadband penetration but seems ripe for Altice\u2019s rigorous cost treatment. Its cable unit delivered Ebitda margins of 32 percent last year \u2013 well below Suddenlink\u2019s 39 percent Ebitda and the mid-to-high 40s achieved in some of Altice\u2019s other subsidiaries.Altice expects $900 million in synergies, as well as $150 million in savings on capital expenditures, which would reduce the headline enterprise value to 6.1 times Ebitda. But savings imply an overall margin of 44 percent, Deutsche Bank analysts say, a tall order given the high content costs in the United States. There may also be economies of scale from scrunching the two together.As with the Suddenlink deal, Altice is contributing only a sliver of equity. It will put in $3.3 billion of cash by issuing shares. The balance will come from $14.5 billion in new and existing debt at Cablevision, plus cash on hand. BC Partners and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have the option to buy 30 percent of the equity, reducing the costs further.This leaves leverage at Cablevision \u2013 which will retain an independent capital structure \u2013 at more than seven times. But Altice thinks it can get that down to 4.9 times including synergies.All this makes the latest multibillion-dollar deal a fairly low-risk proposition for Altice shareholders. Debt should be equivalent to five times 2016 Ebitda after the deal, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate.Yet there is a clear risk of overreach, considering recent jumbo deals in Europe. Altice has yet to prove it can make its United States deals work.Advertisement"}

But the recent protests by the Patel clan, of the Patidar caste, are significant because the group is part of the middle class and is from Gujarat, a state that grew rapidly when Mr. Modi ran it for 12 years before becoming prime minister last year.The fact that 500,000 Patels, who have been a big part of Mr. Modi\u2019s electoral base, attended a rally late last month to press their demands is a rebuke of the prime minister\u2019s economic policies.The Patidar campaign, which is led by a 22-year-old firebrand named Hardik Patel, seeks a bigger slice of the economic pie. But no matter how officials decide to allot government quotas for the underprivileged, the main problem is that there is not enough pie to go around.In theory, the increased number of educated workers should help to expand the manufacturing and service sectors. But companies in India are unable or unwilling to expand because it is so hard to operate there.Chronic energy shortages, for example, make it expensive or impossible to set up factories in many parts of the country. Federal and state labor laws requiring that large companies get government approval before laying off workers encourage businesses to stay small or hire contract workers. And it can be very difficult to enforce contracts, because Indian courts are backlogged with cases that drag on for years.Mr. Modi now has less than four years before the next national parliamentary election to make good on his campaign pledge. If he doesn\u2019t show results soon, the young electorate that swept him into national office could just as easily vote him out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us Brings Temporary Foreign Workers to U.S. to Move Jobs Overseas", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWAYNE, N.J. \u2014 When Congress designed temporary work visa programs, the idea was to bring in foreigners with specialized, hard-to-find skills who would help American companies grow, creating jobs to expand the economy. Now, though, some companies are bringing in workers on those visas to help move jobs out of the country.\u201cShe just pulled up a chair in front of my computer,\u201d said the accountant, 49, who had worked for the company for more than 15 years. \u201cShe shadowed me everywhere, even to the ladies\u2019 room.\u201dThese former employees described their experience training foreigners to do their work so it could be moved to India. They would speak only on the condition that their names not be published, saying they feared losing severance payments or hurting their chances of finding new jobs.In most cases when American workers lost jobs, the positions have been in technology, with employers arguing there are shortages of Americans with the most advanced skills. But in recent years, many jobs that American workers lost have been in accounting and back-office administration \u2014 although there is no shortage of Americans qualified to do that kind of work.Outsourcing firms, and the companies hiring them, say they are careful not to violate any laws. But some experts argue the intent of the visas is being thwarted.\u201cAt the very least, those are violations of the spirit of the law,\u201d said Christine Brigagliano, a lawyer in San Francisco with extensive experience advising American companies on obtaining visas. \u201cThose contractors are signing on the bottom line, saying we will not undercut the wages and working conditions of Americans. But, in fact, they are.\u201dThe companies see it differently.Kathleen Waugh, a spokeswoman for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, said the staff reduction there was part of \u201cdesigning a streamlined, more efficient global organization to make it fit for growth.\u201d She said the contractors were required to comply with \u201cany and all immigration laws.\u201d The outsourcing, she noted, \u201cresulted in significant cost savings.\u201dWilliam Werfelman, a vice president and spokesman at New York Life, said the outsourcing was part of a transformation of its technology systems that would soon result in more jobs in the United States. \u201cOur decisions are centered on keeping the company competitive, keeping it in the United States, keeping it growing,\u201d he said.A Cengage spokeswoman, Susan M. Aspey, said the company needed to install higher-grade accounting systems. \u201cTo do this quickly and efficiently,\u201d she said, Cengage sought support from Cognizant. Employees who were laid off were given \u201cfair severance packages commensurate with their years of service,\u201d she said.Temporary H-1B visas are limited to 85,000 each year. In the last five years, federal records show, most of the companies that received the largest share of H-1B visas have been global outsourcing firms, including TCS; Infosys, another large Indian company; Cognizant, which is based in the United States; and Accenture, a consulting operation incorporated in Ireland.Those companies also use another temporary visa, the L-1B, which has no annual cap and allows businesses to internally transfer their employees who have \u201cadvanced knowledge\u201d from branches in other countries to offices in the United States. A spokesman for TCS, Benjamin Trounson, said it maintained \u201crigorous internal controls to ensure we are fully compliant with all regulatory requirements.\u201dAt the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us headquarters on a leafy campus by a reservoir here in New Jersey, someone dressed as Geoffrey the Giraffe, the retailer\u2019s mascot, often wanders around greeting employees to bolster company spirit. But the mood was hardly playful on the morning of March 3, when a company vice president summoned nearly 70 employees to a conference room and told them their positions would be transferred by the end of June to workers from TCS.\u201cWe were asked to cooperate and show them respect and train them to do our individual job functions,\u201d said another former accountant, 36, who had worked for the toy seller for almost 12 years. But, she recalled, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t cooperate, you would be asked to leave.\u201dA few days later, TCS workers arrived to begin the training called \u201cknowledge transfer.\u201d Most had flown in days before from India and were staying at a La Quinta Inn nearby.The 36-year-old accountant said the young Indian assigned to shadow her appeared to have no extraordinary knowledge of accounting. His expertise was in observing and mapping what she did.\u201cHe was watching me like a hawk,\u201d she said, remembering long hours at close quarters at her desk under the fluorescent lights of the accounting floor. \u201cIt took him a while to learn what I did.\u201dShe had a hard time maintaining her composure. \u201cI felt like, \u2018Why am I sitting here showing this man how to do my job when they are taking it away from me and sending it to India?\u2019 \u201dMs. Waugh, the spokeswoman, noted that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us employed about 33,000 people in the United States. She said the company offered workers \u201ca severance package, including benefits and career transition services.\u201dThe layoffs at New York Life were set in motion in 2014 when the company announced a $1 billion plan for an ambitious upgrade of its financial and data technology systems.Since New York Life is not a technology company, said Mr. Werfelman, the spokesman, it turned to outside contractors for the upgrade. The company plans to cut about 300 positions, including up to one-fifth of its 1,400 technology workers, as well as some financial accountants. With 9,000 staff employees and 12,000 agents nationwide, New York Life is the largest mutual life insurer in the United States.\u201cWe know there will be pain along the way,\u201d Mr. Werfelman said. But he said that with new innovative technology, the company could rapidly expand despite the job cuts. He said it planned to hire 1,000 employees and 3,500 agents this year alone.Accountants at New York Life were among the first scheduled for layoffs that started in May, under a contract with Accenture. The company\u2019s accountants found out only by accident \u2014 when Accenture managers in India mistakenly sent out a group email with a full outsourcing plan \u2014 that the Indian workers they had been training for several weeks would be taking their jobs back to India.One accountant said a worker from India made an exact digital \u201crecording\u201d during the day as he performed his job. At the close of business, the recording was transmitted to India, where workers practiced mimicking his tasks.\u201cIt\u2019s all just repeating exactly what we have been doing,\u201d he said.As a condition of his severance, he was asked to stay on for nine months to complete the training. The accountant, who at 26 was confident he would find a job elsewhere, preferred to resign.An Accenture spokesman, James E. McAvoy, said it was assisting New York Life to build new global, 24-hour systems. He said H-1B workers were a small part of the Accenture employees involved; most were United States citizens or residents.In July, about 100 New York Life technology workers were informed their jobs would be taken over by TCS, to be moved to India. At the insurer\u2019s verdant campus in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., and at offices in New York City, New Jersey and Georgia, tech employees began receiving individual layoff notices last week.\u201cAfter 30 years, it is very, very disappointing being told you are going to lose your job to a foreign country,\u201d said one technology team member who is 49, and started with New York Life when he was 18.Many tech workers facing layoffs are older, with years at the insurer. They were galled by executives\u2019 statements that they were less qualified to learn the new systems than the foreign workers replacing them. \u201cThere are a lot of new technologies coming in all the time,\u201d said an applications engineer in New York, who is 58 with 18 years at the company. \u201cThere is no reason at all we can\u2019t do training for that.\u201dSome workers were not as dismayed, saying the company was offering generous severance packages.But a hard irony for many of the New York Life employees losing jobs to immigrants is that they are immigrants themselves. They came to the United States a generation ago from the Philippines, Eastern European countries, and even India and raised families in this country. They followed the immigration rules \u2014 some coming as refugees, others with work visas and computer degrees from their home countries. Most became American citizens.One technology manager, an immigrant from Europe, recalled that when he was hired at the insurer. \u201cThere was an open position that had to be filled,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody lost their job because I got my job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Collateral Victims of Criminal Justice", "Date": "2015-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisSINCE the financial crisis, complaints that corporate wrongdoers suffer light penalties have become routine. One reason is the Department of Justice\u2019s longstanding policy that prosecutors must consider the \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d that pursuing a corporation might have on innocent employees, shareholders, pensioners and even the financial system at large.Amid public outrage, Congress has hauled in prosecutors to ask precisely how often collateral consequences have led them to give the banks a pass. Last spring, when four of the country\u2019s biggest banks pleaded guilty to felonies, raising the issue again, I had a different question. As a reporter covering the criminal justice system\u2019s impact on both the accused and their families, I wondered why we don\u2019t give more consideration to collateral consequences when prosecuting individuals.We think of punishment as calibrated to the offense, measured out in fines levied and time served. But collateral damage begins for many defendants and their families at the time of arrest, not conviction, and continues long afterward. And it does not spare those with minor charges, including many that do not result in conviction.\u201cIt is the rough equivalent,\u201d he continued, \u201cof cutting off your own nose to spite your face, but society is doing it to itself on a mass basis.\u201dCollateral damage is not limited to the guilty party. When money for fines or bail is needed, often a relative pays. When prisoners are released, often with no job prospects, no driver\u2019s license, and crippling court debt, their families bear the burden.\u201cProsecutors are attuned to collateral consequences in prosecuting a corporation because of the unfair economic consequences that it can have on third parties,\u201d said Jenny Roberts, a law professor at American University who has studied the repercussions of misdemeanor charges. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the same for individuals \u2014 but remember that an individual is part of a family, a community, a society and a country.\u201dAt a Pennsylvania legislative hearing in June, Ms. Roberts of American University raised an economic argument for more forgiving policies. She pointed out that neighboring Maryland was about to allow many misdemeanor convictions to be suppressed, giving that state\u2019s workers an edge. \u201cOther countries incarcerate far less,\u201d Ms. Roberts said. \u201cWhen we think about who\u2019s going to be able to get jobs and who\u2019s going to be able to work, I think we better think about that in light of the competition we\u2019re going to have in a global economy, and every state needs to think about it in light of what\u2019s going on across the border.\u201dPunishment is supposed to be proportional to the severity of the offense, but collateral consequences are often unmoored from such considerations, obscuring their true cost. \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to acknowledge the extent to which we\u2019re not just punishing individuals, we\u2019re punishing entire communities,\u201d Ms. Warth said. \u201cSometimes we become so harsh that we\u2019re punishing ourselves.\u201dShaila Dewan is a national correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BTG Pactual Is Cleared to Acquire Swiss Private Bank BSI", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual has received approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to acquire the Swiss private bank BSI, and in doing so concluded the transaction, the firm, based in S\u00e3o Paulo, said on Tuesday.That follows other regulatory approvals, including one from Brazil\u2019s central bank, and clears the way for one of Latin America\u2019s largest banks to continue pushing into global private banking as Brazil\u2019s economy contracts.BTG agreed to pay a final amount of 1.25 billion Swiss francs to Assicurazioni Generali of Italy, BSI\u2019s owner, it said in a statement. That represents a drop from the 1.5 billion Swiss francs originally agreed to last July, according to a statement issued then.A BTG spokesman said on Tuesday that the difference was an adjustment stemming from the cost of BSI cooperating with the United States Justice Department in a self-reporting tax program earlier this year.BSI, founded in 1873, is one of Switzerland\u2019s oldest banks. The Lugano-based bank will keep its name and continue to run independently, BTG said. The combined company will hold $186.5 billion in assets under management.That is a significant boost for the Brazilian bank, which on its own had $99 billion in assets as of June 30. BTG also said that Alfredo Gysi would step down as the president of BSI\u2019s board and be replaced by Joseph Rickenbacher, effective on Wednesday.Brazilian banks have long sought a global presence. Now in the face of recession and a recent downgrade of the country\u2019s sovereign debt rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s, they face increased pressure to diversify markets.Last week, Standard & Poor\u2019s lowered its rating on BTG Pactual and more than a dozen other Brazilian financial institutions. The ratings agency noted that \u201cthe expected economic contraction in 2015 will take its toll on banks, which in our view will move to a correction phase over the next 12 to 18 months and offset the recent improvement in their asset quality and profitability.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Volkswagen Pushed to Be No. 1, Ambitions Fueled a Scandal", "Date": "2015-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartin Winterkorn, Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, took the stage four years ago at the automaker\u2019s new plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., and outlined a bold strategy. The company, he said, was in the midst of a plan to more than triple its sales in the United States in just a decade \u2014 setting it on a course to sweep by Toyota to become the world\u2019s largest automaker.\u201cBy 2018, we want to take our group to the very top of the global car industry,\u201d he told the two United States senators, the governor of Tennessee and the other dignitaries gathered for the opening of Volkswagen\u2019s first American factory in decades.One way Volkswagen aimed to achieve its lofty goal was by betting on diesel-powered cars \u2014 instead of hybrid-electric vehicles like the Toyota Prius \u2014 promising high mileage and low emissions without sacrificing performance. Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, endorsed the company\u2019s commitment to diesel that day, calling it an \u201cingredient in the recipe for our long-term energy security.\u201dVolkswagen\u2019s unbridled ambition is suddenly central to what is shaping up as one of the great corporate scandals of the age. On Tuesday, Volkswagen said it had installed software in 11 million diesel cars that cheated on emissions tests, allowing the vehicles to spew far more deadly pollutants than regulations allowed. About 500,000 of the cars were sold in the United States, including Passats that rolled off the assembly lines in Chattanooga.Disabling the emissions controls brought major advantages, including much better mileage \u2014 a big selling point in Volkswagen\u2019s push to dominate in America.Volkswagen\u2019s current crisis has its roots in decisions made almost a decade ago. In 2007, it abandoned a pollution-control technology developed by Mercedes-Benz and Bosch and instead used internal technology.At the same time, the determination by Mr. Winterkorn, the company\u2019s hard-charging chief executive, to surpass Toyota put enormous strain on his managers to deliver growth in America.To capture market share, Volkswagen, which also makes such brands as Audi and Porsche, would need to build the larger cars favored by Americans. But it would also need to comply with the Obama administration\u2019s toughening standards on mileage. All automakers developed strategies to meet the new mileage rules, and diesel was a big part of Volkswagen\u2019s plan. But diesel engines, while offering better mileage, also emit more smog-forming pollutants than conventional engines, so Volkswagen\u2019s strategy ran head-on into American air pollution standards, which are stricter than those in Europe.Cheating on emissions tests solved several issues at once. Not only were drivers rewarded with better mileage and performance, but the automaker also avoided more expensive and cumbersome pollution-control systems.The scandal has shaken not just Volkswagen, but the whole auto industry. And it is painful for Germany, where one in seven workers is employed directly or indirectly by the auto industry. Volkswagen has long been a symbol of the efficiency and engineering acumen that make the country one of the most formidable economies in the world.Over the last year, when confronted with evidence that its system was not performing as promised, Volkswagen aggressively pushed back, saying that regulators were not doing the testing properly.Scrapped TechnologyIn 2007, Mr. Winterkorn attracted little attention when he made his first trip to Detroit as Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, during the industry\u2019s annual auto show there. The company was then a bit player in the United States. There was more excitement about Changfeng Motor, the first Chinese automaker to participate in the show.One Volkswagen executive did make headlines \u2014 but he was not there. Wolfgang Bernhard, head of the Volkswagen brand, was a well-known figure in Detroit, having spent several years as the second-highest-ranking executive at Chrysler, then part of Daimler. He was remembered for dressing in black leather during one auto show while he rode a four-wheel, 500-horsepower motorcycle called the Dodge Tomahawk.Mr. Bernhard was widely expected to resign in a corporate shake-up, and he did a few days later. His departure set off ripples not just in Volkswagen\u2019s boardroom, but also under the hoods of its future diesel vehicles. Mr. Bernhard, a longtime Daimler executive, previously announced a deal to use a technology called BlueTec, which was developed by Mercedes, a division of Daimler, and Bosch, a German supplier.BlueTec mixes a chemical known as urea with engine exhaust to neutralize nitrogen oxide, one of the most harmful diesel pollutants. While it is an effective system, it can be costly and requires drivers to periodically top up a tank of urea.A few months after Mr. Bernhard\u2019s departure, the plan was scrapped. The trade publication Automotive News quoted an Audi executive saying Volkswagen\u2019s own technology was strong enough. \u201cWe don\u2019t need BlueTec,\u201d the executive said.There have been no suggestions to date that BlueTec vehicles sold by Mercedes violate emissions standards.\u201cVolkswagen wanted to make the diesel ownership experience as easy as possible, akin to having a regular gas engine,\u201d he said.In the 1970s, Mr. DeLorenzo said, when automakers all switched to catalytic converters to meet American emissions standards, Honda developed an engine technology that it claimed would run clean without the converters. It worked \u2014 at least at first \u2014 and Honda sold the cars for several years. But emissions requirements kept tightening each year, and Honda\u2019s solution could no longer keep up. The automaker was forced to switch to catalytic converters like everyone else.Mr. DeLorenzo theorized that Volkswagen may have faced a similar situation, in which the company thought it could start selling its non-urea diesels in America and get a year or two of sales on the books, and as emissions standards ratcheted up, it would find a way to improve the technology to keep pace.\u201cIt could have been an incremental thing that got them caught up in this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey thought they could maybe fix this later, then discovered they couldn\u2019t and went down a dark path.\u201dChance RevelationThe same year Mr. Winterkorn made his speech in Chattanooga, officials from California\u2019s environmental regulator began hearing about a problem from their European Union counterparts: They were finding discrepancies between the emissions of diesels in the lab and on the road, across the industry.It was not completely unexpected that on-the-road performance might not match lab tests, given the varying road conditions vehicles face. But it led to the idea that new testing methods outside laboratories might be needed.California regulators decided to team up with the group. They had an attractive chip to offer: the state\u2019s laboratory, where vehicles were tested for California emissions compliance.The transportation council, staffed by a number of former E.P.A. officials, did not expect to catch Volkswagen, or anyone else, cheating. In fact, it assumed that American diesel cars would run much cleaner than their European counterparts, thanks to stricter United States emissions rules. The group felt that by promoting a success story for diesel, it could pressure \u2014 and perhaps shame \u2014 automakers in Europe into improving their own emissions.\u201cWe thought we would be seeing some clean vehicles,\u201d said John German, one of the project leads at the council. \u201cThat was the whole point when we started.\u201dIt was only by chance that the group\u2019s testing of three vehicles began with two Volkswagens. The researchers already had a BMW X5 and a Volkswagen Jetta \u2014 and then a Passat owner happened to see an ad seeking cars for the project and offered up his.Researchers hit the road, traveling five routes with varying terrain and traffic. Almost immediately, the two Volkswagens set themselves apart from the BMW.\u201cIf you\u2019re idling in traffic for three hours in L.A. traffic, we know a car is not in its sweet spot for good emissions results,\u201d said Arvind Thiruvengadam, a research professor at West Virginia University, which was hired to conduct the tests. \u201cBut when you\u2019re going at highway speed at 70 miles an hour, everything should really work properly. The emissions should come down. But the Volkswagens\u2019 didn\u2019t come down.\u201dIt was difficult to know what was going on: When the two Volkswagens were placed on a \u201ccar treadmill\u201d known as a dynamometer, they performed flawlessly.\u201cIt just didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Mr. German said. \u201cThat was the real red flag.\u201dComing CleanBy 2014, the California regulators determined what to do next. First, they alerted their federal counterparts at the E.P.A. Then, they opened an investigation. \u201cWe brought in Volkswagen and showed them our findings,\u201d said Stanley Young, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. \u201cWe asked them, \u2018How do you explain this?\u2019\u00a0\u201dVolkswagen fired back. \u201cThey tried to poke holes in our study and its methods, saying we didn\u2019t know what we were doing,\u201d Mr. Thiruvengadam said. \u201cThey were very aggressive.\u201dThe company offered many explanations: Weather conditions. Driving styles. Technicalities that it claimed the researchers and regulators did not understand.\u201cThere was always some story, some reason they\u2019d come up with each time,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cMeeting after meeting, they would try to explain it away, and we\u2019d go back to the lab and try again. But we\u2019d get the same results.\u201dThe back-and-forth lasted for months. Finally, in April, Volkswagen made an offer: It would conduct a voluntary recall, or service campaign, to fix the problem in certain model year 2010 to 2014 diesel vehicles.Regulators got the software update for their test vehicles and returned to the lab. The results were not good. \u201cIt didn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d Mr. Young said.Confronted again, Volkswagen continued to maintain that there was a problem with the testers, not the vehicles.California regulators changed tack, examining the company\u2019s software. Modern automobiles operate using millions of lines of computer code. One day last summer, the regulators made a startling discovery: A subroutine, or parallel set of instructions, was secretly being sent by the computer to what seemed to be the emissions controls.Regulators were floored. Could Volkswagen be trying something similar to what the heavy-truck industry did to manipulate emissions tests in the 1990s?Regulators set out to cheat the cheat, tweaking lab test parameters to trick the car into thinking it was on the road. The Volkswagens began spewing nitrogen oxide far above the legal limit.Government officials then increased the pressure on the company, threatening to withhold approval for its 2016 Volkswagen and Audi diesel models. According to the E.P.A., that is what forced Volkswagen\u2019s hand. On Sept. 3, a group of senior engineers admitted what the regulators had suspected: The company had installed defeat devices on nearly 500,000 diesel vehicles sold in the United States. In a presentation, they admitted that the software subroutine had been added to vehicles going back to the 2009 model year, when Volkswagen\u2019s \u201cclean diesel\u201d arrived in America with promises of an environmentally friendly future.\u201cIt was the repeated answers that did not add up that really led to the discovery of the problem in the first place,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cThey were kind of hoisted on their own petard.\u201dThe revelations were so stunning that some executives at Volkswagen Group of America were kept in the dark about the pending E.P.A. violation until just before it was announced, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.This month, Volkswagen and Audi executives in Herndon, Va., began pressing executives in Germany for information about the delay in certifying the 2016 models for sale. The absence of details was already hampering plans for product introductions at United States dealerships.But there was no explanation from Germany \u2014 until just before the E.P.A. announced the violation of the Clean Air Act.After the scandal broke, Mr. Winterkorn issued a written and then a video apology. He resigned on Wednesday, saying that he had no knowledge of the trickery. \u201cI am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cVolkswagen needs a fresh start.\u201dVolkswagen\u2019s supervisory board named Matthias M\u00fcller, head of the Porsche division, the new chief executive, on Friday.On Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s watch, Volkswagen did become the largest automaker in the world, surpassing Toyota in July. He had two months to savor it.Reporting was contributed by Nicola Clark, Bill Vlasic and Melissa Eddy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: No Jokes, Just China", "Date": "2015-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the industry.What did you get me? I didn\u2019t see any big packages in my mailbox yet.But let\u2019s talk about China. Apparently I\u2019m an idiot for not lining up Mandarin lessons, since in 10 years or less, we\u2019ll be part of a global economy dominated by China. Who knew? Besides, you know, economists.Farhad, tell me what to think. Do you speak Mandarin, or are you as ill-equipped for the new economy as I am?So let\u2019s use Mr. Xi\u2019s visit as an opportunity to talk about the way American tech companies have approached China. China holds the promise of becoming an unspeakably huge market \u2014 a place where Facebook and Google could connect billions, and where Apple and Amazon could sell to a burgeoning middle class. But China is also perilous to American tech companies: a place where their technology could be copied or stolen, or where smarter, more culturally astute upstarts could come in with unusual business models and eat their lunch.But the other tech giants face a tougher time. Google and Facebook are shut out of the market as a result of Chinese censorship, and local search engines and social networking companies are well-entrenched in China. The same goes for e-commerce: Amazon has tried to make inroads there, but Alibaba rules the Chinese e-commerce market more handily than Amazon rules the American one.It feels like the Chinese Internet industry and the American Internet industry are effectively cut off from each other. There\u2019s no overlap \u2014 but at some point, they may collide. Right?As you said, on the one hand China is so lucrative and must be amazing to look at from the perspective of an outside business hungry to enter a huge market. Imagine some chunk of 1.3 billion more people using your services. That\u2019s just under Facebook\u2019s current worldwide footprint.But China wants to exert its muscle over its people and the types of speech that are permitted on its Internet. That means no anti-state speech, nothing that could involve collusion against the government. And that\u2019s the polar opposite of what companies like Facebook, Google or Twitter really stand for.Companies like Uber and Lyft have a much easier time, I think, because catching a ride has little to do with speaking one\u2019s mind. Though local regulators aren\u2019t exactly friendly to American companies coming in and potentially dominating the ride-hailing market, but that\u2019s another issue.So to answer your question: I have no idea what\u2019s going on or what will actually happen. Also, this newsletter was not very funny. China is serious business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. to Announce Loosening of Business and Travel Restrictions on Cuba", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Friday will announce an array of regulatory changes to loosen travel, commerce and investment restrictions on Cuba, according to people familiar with the plans, the latest move forward in the thaw in relations with Havana.The rules will allow American companies to open locations in Cuba and will clarify how they can conduct transactions and finance operations there, according to a draft submitted to the Office of Management and Budget this month. The changes will also make it easier for cruise ships and other vessels to travel to Cuba.The White House declined to comment on the rules. But one person who had reviewed them said they were a sweeping set of changes that would raise expectations among American companies about business opportunities in Cuba and could increase pressure on Havana to open its economy.\u201cThey\u2019ve gone farther at one time than most anyone expected,\u201d said John S. Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, who has read the regulations. \u201cNot only are companies able to establish a physical presence in Cuba and hire Cuban workers, but they are also extending loans and lease payment terms for authorized products.\u201dRestrictions on food and agricultural products will remain, Mr. Kavulich said, \u201cbut this allows everything else to move in a much more normalized way.\u201dThe White House is working to show momentum in the rapprochement with Cuba before the Dec. 17 anniversary of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement that he and President Ra\u00fal Castro had agreed to normalize relations between their countries.The changes come shortly before Pope Francis, who played a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in the two nations\u2019 reconciliation, is to visit Havana and Washington.On Thursday, Mr. Obama received credentials from the first Cuban ambassador to the United States since 1961. The ceremony took place in the Oval Office without fanfare. The envoy, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Caba\u00f1as Rodr\u00edguez, had been the chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington for three years.The regulatory changes, which were first reported by The Associated Press, are part of a push by Mr. Obama to use his power to re-establish travel and commercial ties between the United States and Cuba in the face of congressional obstacles to lifting the embargo outright.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Picasso, Completely Himself in 3 Dimensions", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany exhibitions are good, some are great and a very few are tantamount to works of art in their own right \u2014 for their clarity, lyricism and accumulative wisdom.10 PhotosThe show, which opens on Monday, is the latest in a string of landmark Pablo Picasso exhibitions for which the Modern has been justly famous since 1939. It is full of loans that perhaps only this museum has the clout to secure, including about 50 pieces from its collaborator, the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris. The approximately 140 sculptures here were made between 1902 and 1964; encompass at least 10 media \u2014 among them wood, plaster, sheet metal, clay, beach-smoothed pebbles \u2014 and, in assemblage, all manner of found objects great and small. The galleries are dotted with works never before exhibited in New York, and reunite related efforts not seen together since they were in Picasso\u2019s studio.This \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, which brings together more than 100 Picasso works, will close on Feb. 7.The show\u2019s two grandest, most thrilling reunions are the gathering in its second gallery of all six \u201cGlass of Absinthe\u201d sculptures of 1914, those tiny weirdly Keatonesque charmers of painted bronze that can suggest drunken faces and profiles; and in its fourth, the five monumental tumescent heads in white plaster of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, more than have ever been shown together, at least in the United States. Seen from the vantage point of the absinthe glasses, the first Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se bust looms in the distance, as if at the end of a garden.High points aside, there hasn\u2019t been a Picasso sculpture survey of this scope in this country since 1967. That\u2019s when the first large exhibition of sculpture that Picasso ever permitted reached the Modern after incarnations in London and Paris. He kept his sculptures close, like family, and none closer than the great plasters, which were apparently absent from the \u201967 presentation. He lived among great jumbles of them from the 1930s on, as attested by the photographs that Brassai took in the artist\u2019s studios between 1932 and 1945. Two dozen Brassai images line a small gallery here, adding to the show\u2019s ricocheting cross-references and insights.Like its predecessor, this exhibition raises the question of whether Picasso was a better sculptor or painter. It\u2019s a tough call. In each medium, he disrupted art with a track-switching masterpiece: In painting there is the vehement \u201cDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d of 1907, on view in the fifth-floor galleries, one of the central pylons on which he and Braque erected Cubism. And he did art perhaps an even greater favor with the boxy constructed wall piece \u201cGuitar\u201d \u2014 a 1914 work that initiates modern sculpture by establishing space itself \u2014 hollowness, volume, weightlessness \u2014 as one of its primary materials.Picasso was more completely himself in three dimensions: a magician, a magpie genius, a comedic entertainer and a tinkerer with superb reflexes. His many gifts \u2014 versatility, voraciousness, a need for constant reinvention \u2014 are more sharply apparent in real space and tangible materials. We can\u2019t miss his consummate grasp of tactility and form or of the potential for found objects and materials to lead double lives. Screws could be legs of a girl reading a book. A spigot could be the crest of a crane whose body and tail feathers were once the head of a shovel. A small flat-faced deity carved from a scrap of wood is reddened and rubbed until it looks like ancient terra cotta.That\u2019s just one way he brought painting with him to sculpture. In the show\u2019s eighth gallery, covering 1945 to 1953, he paints with glaze on ceramic vessels in the shape of figures and animals, on bronze casts of assemblages, including the shovel-backed \u201cCrane,\u201d and on a woman and toddler cobbled together from flimsy scraps of lumber that might be a work by an outsider artist. Here also, he makes monstrous assemblage flowers for a ceramic pot and a watering can from wood, metal and crockery shards ingeniously stuck together with plaster and painted. Their bristling energy and yellow colors suggest a homage to van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers. And then, in the same time span, he goes tiny and smooth, incising stunning little faces on impeccably chosen beach pebbles, out-Kleeing Paul Klee with a little Cycladic thrown in for good measure.Picasso\u2019s constant motion is much more apparent, and maybe more fruitful, in sculpture. In the show\u2019s opening gallery, which covers 1902 to 1909, we see him first in capable thrall to Gauguin with a pint-size unfired clay rendering of an old seated woman, whose sensitive face is clearer in a Brassai photograph later in the show. But soon come the double jolts of Iberian and African sculpture, evidenced by a scary little wood idol, carved from what once seems to have been a table leg painted green. Its furious black eyes are the heads of tiny screws.He also always cut his losses. In this first gallery, the 1909 bronze \u201cHead of a Woman\u201d is powerful as ever, but also more clearly one of the great dead ends in early modernism: a futile attempt to bring the flickering facets of Analytical Cubism, and C\u00e9zanne into three dimensions. The future of sculpture lay with Braque\u2019s innovation, Cubist collage.Goaded by African art, Picasso then arrived at the groundbreaking \u201cGuitar\u201d by coaxing collage\u2019s flat clean shapes into three dimensions. This mirage of hovering planes, voids and shadows in sheets of cutout, darkly rusted ferrous iron is simultaneously a mask, a body and a musical instrument. In addition to breaking open sculptural space, it made self-evident structure almost de rigueur. Next to it hangs its crucial dry run, an exact but radiant replica in creamy paper and paperboard. They preside over the absinthe glass bronzes like proud parents.All these works \u2014 the guitars, the glasses \u2014 pointed toward abstraction, but again Picasso moved on, leaving it to others to develop. Almost every sculpture he ever made during the rest of his long life was a recognizable thing, usually a living one, whether human or animal. As this show proves, it was as if \u2014 having irrevocably altered sculpture with the guitars \u2014 he then set out to reveal all the ways to depict the figure that remained to be explored.And yet the guitars in particular haunt many of these efforts. Their hollowness is implicit in the great vegetal shapes of the plaster busts of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, who looks dominant and alert in sculpture as she rarely does on canvas, and who might be given Braque-like billing as collaborator.The guitars\u2019 planar composition is explicit in the proto-installation piece \u201cThe Bathers,\u201d whose six flattened sentinels Picasso made in 1956, using more decrepit lumber and the occasional ingeniously placed open frames. The planes and weightlessness recombine in the faces and figures and one wizardly chair formed from bent and painted sheet metal in the show\u2019s final gallery. Some of these works are mostly white. Others served as tensile canvases for color, most notably, \u201cWoman With Hat,\u201d a pop-out reprise of a frequent Picasso motif: a woman in an armchair. All of them seem ready to take flight over the Modern\u2019s garden just beyond the window.\u201cPicasso Sculpture\u201d has been wrested into being by Ann Temkin, chief curator, and Anne Umland, curator, both in the Modern\u2019s department of painting and sculpture, and Virginie Perdrisot, the Mus\u00e9e Picasso\u2019s curator of sculpture and ceramics. We are in their debt.Each gallery of this brilliantly installed effort is an exhibition unto itself, full of subtle links, allusions and contrasts that tie the works together or hold them apart. The last gallery delivers you back to the entrance and the circular path \u2014 a great chain of being in art \u2014 is fitting: Picasso\u2019s sculptural progress was nonlinear, and, anyway, one\u2019s impulse is to keep circling through, taking in more and more with each rotation.This is one of the best exhibitions you\u2019ll ever see at the Museum of Modern Art, especially in its current iteration. The fourth-floor galleries, which usually house the permanent collection, postwar division, have never looked better.

While the music is full of punched-up emotion and raw tales of wrongdoing, the politics, in recent decades, has tended to be drama-averse, sober-minded and even a bit wonkish.The mudslinging has caught many residents by surprise in this fast-growing city, where friendliness is regarded as a civic attribute. Mr. Fox has even given it a name: \u201cThe Nashville Way.\u201d Which makes it even stranger that Mr. Fox, 54, and Ms. Barry, 51 \u2014 who move in the same relatively privileged Nashville social circles \u2014 are acting out a kind of real-life version of \u201cYou\u2019re the Reason Our Kids Are Ugly,\u201d Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty\u2019s insult-trading duet from 1978.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say about it,\u201d said Jack Cawthon, the owner of Jack Cawthon\u2019s Bar-B-Que, a local chain. \u201cWe\u2019re used to staying on the issues, you know.\u201dMs. Barry has denied the claims, and she accused Mr. Fox of gutter politics. At the same time, the Tennessee Democratic Party has run ads noting that Mr. Fox, a former school board chairman, once voted for a rezoning plan opposed by the N.A.A.C.P. The ad said that a Fox victory would amount to a \u201cstroll down memory lane\u201d and would move Nashville back to the segregated 1950s.Mr. Fox, in turn, denounced the tone of the race. \u201cThey\u2019re false, they\u2019re sad, and they\u2019re desperate,\u201d he said of the ads at a recent news media event.And both candidates appear to set the business class at ease: Last month, the Nashville Business Coalition, a political action committee dedicated to electing \u201cbusiness-friendly candidates,\u201d endorsed them both.Before things turned ugly, it seemed as though the election would turn on differences in the way the two candidates promised to manage the growth of a city that added 40,000 residents from 2010 to 2014, and where cranes and new condominiums are abundant. The surrounding 10-county region is expected to add a million residents in the next two decades.Mr. Fox has positioned himself as a social moderate and fiscal conservative. He has warned that the city needs to be more cautious in its spending and more mindful of its debts and unfunded liabilities. During an Aug. 24 debate at Vanderbilt University, he criticized the Metropolitan Council and Ms. Barry for raising property taxes and depleting a reserve fund by $74 million to balance the budget.\u201cWe have massive economic growth here, huge employment gains,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is it possible that we could not stay within our means?\u201dMr. Fox, who grew up in Nashville, has spoken often about his Jewish faith, and has broadcast a series of buzz-generating television ads that are by turns clever, provocative and goofy. A few of them feature Mr. Fox driving around while an interior monologue plays, in a style reminiscent of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s recent car ads. In one, a deadpan Mr. Fox faces off against someone in a plush fox costume.\u201cThat\u2019s a really big fox,\u201d Mr. Fox says. \u201cHe\u2019s protecting Nashville from Megan Barry.\u201dIn a more serious ad, Mr. Fox\u2019s wife, Carrington, a former writer at The Nashville Scene, an alternative weekly, says that people should vote for Ms. Barry if they want Nashville to become \u201ca platform to talk about extreme issues of the social left.\u201dMs. Barry, who moved to Nashville in 1991 to pursue a master\u2019s in business administration at Vanderbilt, has unabashedly defended what she calls \u201ccritical investments\u201d that the city has made in the last eight years under Mr. Dean, her political ally. She says those investments kept the economy chugging through the recession.\u201cI think we have made strategic decisions that have brought 32,000 jobs to Nashville,\u201d she said at the debate. \u201cAnd we need to continue to make sure we\u2019re doing that.\u201dShe is also an unabashed Southern liberal who supports a minimum-wage increase and presided over Nashville\u2019s first same-sex wedding.

She insisted she was a Christian who said the words \u201cunder God\u201d during the pledge. She also said that her husband\u2019s work with the A.C.L.U. (he once referred to conservative faith groups as part of the \u201cJesus-Industrial Complex\u201d) occasionally put them at odds.\u201cSometimes, my spouse does things I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I love him. And he\u2019s not running.\u201dMs. Barry\u2019s campaign has said it had nothing to do with the Democratic Party ads against Mr. Fox. But in late August, her campaign criticized Mr. Fox for meeting with Republicans, including a state senator who supported a bill allowing guns in parks.John G. Geer, a Vanderbilt political science professor, said he was not surprised by the tough talk. \u201cI think it reflects the broader changes in American politics,\u201d he said. \u201cPolarization has infiltrated all aspects of the polity.\u201dIf nothing else, the polarization may clarify how conservative or liberal the new Nashville is these days. Its entertainment industry contains liberal and conservative strains.

{"Headline": "For Thousands of Exhausted Migrants, a Journey\u2019s End in Munich", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUNICH \u2014 The journey for more than 2,000 migrants, who overcame border crossings, deprivation and erratic enforcement of European migration policies on a land route through southeastern Europe, ended Tuesday when the trains that had carried them from the Hungarian capital rolled into Munich\u2019s vast main station.There, the exhausted men, women and children were met by the police, who escorted them to the first step on the final leg of their trek to safety \u2014 registration with the German bureaucracy.Yet many of the arrivals here, who continued through the evening to pour in on trains from the east, were too traumatized by the hardships of their travels to enjoy their newfound abundance and safety. Others expressed the fear that their happiness would be short-lived, and that they would be sent back to the tumultuous homelands from where they came.One was Mohmad Atif, 22, who arrived with a group of friends from Afghanistan. His preferred destination was any place safe \u2014 not necessarily Germany.He said he and his friends had flown to Iran and walked through Greece, Turkey, Serbia and Bulgaria. There, he said, they were laid upon by smugglers and saw people so exhausted that they collapsed.\u201cThat was a bad journey,\u201d he said.Some 2,100 migrants had poured into Munich\u2019s main station by Tuesday night, said Carsten Neubert, a police spokesman. That was on top of 1,750 who arrived there or in the surrounding region on Monday, said Matthias Knott, a spokesman for the federal police. Many spread blankets on the stone-tiled floor and stretched out, their heads propped on their backpacks, in a wing of the station cordoned off to provide them with a place to rest.For many of the migrants, Germany was their dream destination, a safe haven and an opportunity to begin new lives after enduring war and strife in the Middle East or Northern Africa. Drawn by its strong economy and the prospect of securing jobs, nearly a quarter-million people have already applied for asylum in Germany in the first six months of 2015. Government officials have said they expect a total of 800,000 new arrivals by year\u2019s end.But the final phase of the trek for those who arrived Monday and Tuesday was particularly harrowing, as completion of a new barbed-wire fence on the Hungary-Serbia border and discord over immigration policy slowed their passage through Hungary, en route to Austria and then Germany.At the train station in Budapest on Monday, many of the travelers were met by confusion, long lines and a dearth of police officers and other personnel to help them navigate the station and the next leg of their journeys.Some of the migrants were again stopped at the train station near the Hungary-Austria border, the Vienna station or close to Austria\u2019s border with Germany.While European Union rules call for arriving migrants to be registered in the country where they first enter the bloc, many were let through without any documentation \u2014 and then were allowed to continue their trip again when they reached Vienna, even if they chose not to register there, as well. The German authorities said they would register every migrant and, when applicable, initiate an application for asylum.Those who landed in Germany on Tuesday morning narrowly avoided being trapped in Budapest, where the authorities on Tuesday suddenly stopped allowing unregistered migrants onto trains, essentially shutting down the station \u2014 and the route west \u2014 to most of them.But in Munich, the scene was markedly different. Many of the new arrivals seemed overwhelmed by the abundance of volunteers and food, water, clothing, toys and other gifts that were bestowed on them as they poured off trains through the day and into the evening.Bavaria, in Germany\u2019s southeastern corner, has been the front line for many of the new arrivals, and emergency plans have already been in place for months.\u201cOur main priority is the refugees,\u201d said Ines Schantz, a spokeswoman for the Upper Bavaria regional government, responsible for the initial registration and administration of medical checkups for the new arrivals.Preparations included establishing a center to process the applications of the hundreds of people arriving from Kosovo, Albania and elsewhere in the Balkans, who are considered economic migrants, albeit from poor areas, and ineligible for asylum. The first of these centers opened Tuesday, and three more were expected to help take the strain off the system so the migrants fleeing war and political persecution could be processed more swiftly.Ms. Schantz said her team had worked through the night, after watching reports late Monday that hundreds of people were packing trains bound for Vienna and on to Munich. They began putting emergency plans into action, as updates of the migrants\u2019 progress toward Austria and north to Germany came in from the police tracking their movement from border to border.European Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.As the hundreds swelled to more than a thousand early Tuesday, buses were organized to ferry asylum seekers from Munich\u2019s city center, which was sweltering under nearly 90-degree temperatures and bright sunshine. Long lines of people waited patiently behind red-and-white ribbons of police tape on streets closed to traffic for the buses that would take them to other parts of Bavaria and the neighboring state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\u201cWe want to swiftly get them to a shelter where they can rest and find a bit of peace,\u201d Ms. Schantz said.The first priorities were addressing hunger, thirst and medical needs, said Mr. Neubert, the police spokesman.At the station, boxes piled high with bread, fruit and stacks of drinks were set up on the long wooden tables and benches typical of the city\u2019s many beer gardens. Organizers said they had fed some 800 people the previous night and called early Tuesday for more donations.By early afternoon, the Munich police put out notices over social media asking people to slow down, saying they were \u201coverwhelmed\u201d with goods and had enough to meet everyone\u2019s needs.One of the volunteers was Ashley Fliess, 39, who stood outside Tuesday night handing out umbrellas after it began to rain. She said she, like many of the other volunteers, had just shown up after realizing that the trains from Budapest and Vienna would be arriving.\u201cIt was just logic,\u201d she said. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Well, then they will be in Munich very soon.\u2019\u201d She had been there for about 24 hours, with one hour\u2019s sleep, she said.Ren\u00e9 Hinkfoth, 34, of Munich, said he was on vacation. He showed up in the morning and was still there Tuesday night.\u201cDo you need something warm?\u201d he asked, holding out a plate of rice to a woman as she entered the makeshift migrant center with two children. It was not the first food they had been offered in the Munich station; almost immediately after passing the handmade \u201cWelcome in Germany\u201d signs, they had accepted a pretzel from a large crate, and stuffed it into an increasingly full shopping bag.\u201cNow is not the moment to think about so many refugees, the consequences,\u201d Mr. Hinkfoth said, commenting on the politics of the situation as he stood next to piles of bananas. \u201cThere are so many refugees. They need what a human needs.\u201dMelissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Policy Mechanics Retool for a Rise in Interest Rates", "Date": "2015-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s easy to take for granted the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to raise interest rates. Even among the legions who doubt that Fed officials will pick the ideal moment to start increasing rates for the first time since 2008, few question the Fed\u2019s technical competence. The central bank has a long history. The engine is known to work.So it may come as a surprise to learn that the old engine is broken. When the Fed decides that it\u2019s time to \u201clift off\u201d \u2014 perhaps this week, but more likely later this year \u2014 it will be relying on a new system, assembled from spare parts, to make interest rates rise.There is a general agreement among economists and market analysts that the Fed\u2019s plans make sense in theory. A team led by Simon Potter, a former academic who now heads the Fed\u2019s market desk in New York, has been testing and fine-tuning the details by moving billions of dollars around the financial system.But markets have a long history of scrambling the best-laid plans.\u201cIf something is going to go wrong, I haven\u2019t been able to figure out what, but there\u2019s a lot of reason for caution,\u201d said Stephen G. Cecchetti, the former chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before.\u201dThe stakes are huge. The Fed is in charge of keeping economic growth on an even keel: minimal unemployment, moderate inflation. It tends to operate conservatively and to change very slowly because when it errs, the nation suffers.Yet the Fed has found itself forced to experiment. The immense stimulus campaign that it started in response to the 2008 financial crisis changed its relationship with the financial markets. It has pumped so many dollars into the system that it cannot easily drain enough money to discourage lending, its traditional approach. Instead, the Fed plans to throw more money at the problem, paying lenders not to make loans.The Fed, embedded in the banking system, has also concluded that working through the banks is no longer sufficient to influence the broader economy. It plans to strengthen its hold by working directly with an expanded range of lenders.Fed officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the plan will work. \u201cThe committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, told Congress earlier this year, referring to its policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee.And if the new approach does not work at first, Mr. Potter said in a recent speech, then his team of monetary mechanics \u201cstands ready to innovate\u201d until it does.The markets desk at the New York Fed has put monetary policy into practice since the mid-1930s. In the decades before the Great Recession, the desk exercised its remarkable influence over the American economy through its control of an odd little marketplace in which banks could come to borrow money for a single night.The Fed requires banks to set aside reserves in proportion to the deposits the banks accept from customers. The reserves can be kept in cash or held in an account at the Fed. Banks that need reserves at the end of a given day can borrow from banks that have a surplus. Before the crisis, the Fed controlled the interest rate on those loans by modulating the supply of reserves: It lowered interest rates by buying Treasury securities from banks and crediting their accounts, increasing the supply of reserves; it raised rates by selling Treasuries to banks and debiting their accounts.As the crisis hit in 2008, the Fed pressed this machine to its limits. It bought enough securities and pumped enough reserves into the banking system to drive interest rates on short-term loans to nearly zero. The federal government now pays about a dime to borrow $1,000 for one month. Companies with good credit pay about a dollar to borrow $1,000 from money market funds and other investors.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.One result is a banking system almost comically awash in money. In June 2008, banks had about $10.1 billion in their Fed accounts. The total is now $2.6 trillion. Picture all of the money in June 2008 as a single brick; the Fed has added 256 bricks of the same size. On top of that first brick, there is now a stack five stories tall.Bank of America, for example, had $388 million in its Fed account at the end of June 2008. Seven years later, at the end of June 2015, it had $107 billion. The bank could double in size and double again and still have more reserves than it needs.To switch metaphors, the old monetary-policy machine sits at the bottom of a lake of excess reserves. The Fed would need to sell most of the securities it has accumulated before short-term rates would start to rise. Selling quickly could roil markets; selling slowly could allow the economy to overheat. So the Fed decided to find another way.Instead of draining all that excess money, the Fed decided to freeze it.For the last seven years, the Fed has encouraged financial risk-taking in the service of its campaign to increase employment and economic growth. By starting to raise interest rates, the Fed intends to gradually discourage risk-taking.The straightforward part of the plan is persuading banks not to make loans.In a serendipitous stroke, Congress passed a law shortly before the financial crisis that let the Fed pay interest on the reserves that banks kept at the Fed. Written as a sop to the banking industry, it has become the new linchpin of monetary policy.Say the Fed wanted to raise short-term interest rates to 1 percent, meaning that it did not want banks to lend at lower rates. Because the glut of reserves is so great, the Fed could not easily raise rates by reducing the availability of money. Instead, the Fed plans to pre-empt the market, paying banks 1 percent interest on reserves in their Fed accounts, so banks have little reason to lend at lower rates. \u201cWhy would you lend to anyone else when you can lend to the Fed?\u201d Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, asked rhetorically.At first, Fed officials thought that paying interest to banks would establish a minimum rate for all short-term loans, exerting the same kind of broad influence as the old system. It soon became clear, however, that rates on most such loans remained lower than 0.25 percent. Even banks that needed overnight loans found they could borrow more cheaply. The average rate in July was 0.13 percent \u2014 about half of the Fed\u2019s new benchmark rate.The rest of the financial system is also awash in cash, and lenders \u2014 like money market mutual funds \u2014 put downward pressure on interest rates as they fight to attract borrowers.And here\u2019s where the Fed\u2019s plans got a little less orthodox.The Fed lacks the legal authority to pay these lenders a minimum interest rate on deposits, as it does to the banks. But two years ago, Lorie Logan, one of Mr. Potter\u2019s top aides, suggested the Fed could achieve the same goal by borrowing from these companies at a minimum interest rate.The resulting deals, known as overnight reverse repurchase agreements, signal a significant break from the Fed\u2019s history of working through only the banking industry.\u201cWe\u2019re pushing more activity out of the regulated banking sector, and so monetary policy has to take account of the unregulated sector,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who until recently served as an adviser to Ms. Yellen, and before that to her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. \u201cThe world is changing, and I think the bigger risk is not changing along with it.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.When liftoff arrives, however, the Fed plans to place this machinery inside the familiar language of the old system. It is likely to announce that it is raising the federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks pay to borrow reserves, from its current range of 0 to 0.25 percent to a new range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. The Fed does not plan to emphasize that this rate is now a stage prop or that the real work of raising rates will be done outside the limelight by its new tools.On weekdays at about 12:45 p.m., the New York Fed\u2019s trading portal, known as FedTrade, plays three musical notes \u2014 F-E-D \u2014 signaling that Mr. Potter\u2019s shop is open for business. So begins another day of training camp, another test of the Fed\u2019s plans to borrow money from nonbank financial companies.The Fed\u2019s traders sit at terminals in a converted conference room. Along one wall are five chairs and five sets of computer monitors beneath five historical photographs of the trading desk: men answering phones, men writing bids in chalk on a long board and, in the most recent photograph, from the 1980s, a glimpse of a woman in the background. On another wall is a screen that links the room in New York by videoconference with a backup trading room at the Chicago Fed.Potential lenders \u2014 a preapproved group of 168, including a bevy of money market funds and the housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 have 30 minutes to offer the Fed up to $30 billion each. At 1:13 p.m., a warning message starts blinking red. At 1:15 p.m., the Fed closes the auction and accepts up to $300 billion in loans at an interest rate of 0.05 percent.During two years of experiments, the Fed team has adjusted the rates it pays, the amounts it accepts and the time it enters the market, among other variables. Mr. Potter and his lieutenants have also held lunch meetings with investors on the other side of the portal to solicit advice and complaints.The size of the program poses the most obvious risk. Fed officials limited daily borrowing to $300 billion because they didn\u2019t want to freeze more money than necessary. They also worry about exacerbating market downturns by giving investors a new place to flee. These concerns were heightened by reports that some investment companies were interested in creating money market funds that would be advertised as the safest place to park money \u2014 because the money would be parked at the Fed.Last year, at the end of September, shortly after the cap was imposed, lenders offered the Fed $407 billion on a single day. Demand was so high that instead of asking for interest, some lenders offered to pay the Fed to take the money. The Fed ended up borrowing at zero percent and turning away $107 billion in loans.A cardinal rule of central banking is that you don\u2019t starve financial markets during panics, and the Fed has been leaning in the direction of doing more. It has already announced that it is willing to borrow at least $200 billion through a parallel program at the end of September this year, for a total of $500 billion. It has also suggested that it may raise the cap during liftoff. \u201cMy sense is we\u2019re better off making sure we can maintain control,\u201d James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said in a recent interview.\u201cThis is where the nutty people on the bond-trading desks have control,\u201d joked Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, when asked if the Fed\u2019s plan would work.Mr. Blinder\u2019s point was that markets ultimately determined the cost of borrowing money, particularly for longer-term loans like mortgages and corporate bonds. The Fed can be precise in its planning, but the market is unpredictable in its reactions.But there are at least three reasons markets are becoming less predictable.The rise of an interconnected global financial system has weakened the Fed\u2019s influence over interest rates. When the Fed last raised short-term rates, beginning in 2004, officials were surprised that long-term rates failed to rise because foreign money was pouring into the housing market and other domestic investments. This time, there are plenty of warnings that the weaknesses of other developed economies could once again make it harder for the Fed to raise domestic interest rates.\u201cFinancial market conditions have come to depend increasingly not only on developments at home but also on developments abroad,\u201d William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a February speech in which he cautioned the Fed\u2019s control over those conditions had been \u201cloosened.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s audience also increasingly consists of computer programs that will start buying and selling securities before people have time to read the first words of the Fed\u2019s policy statement, creating the potential for new kinds of chaos.On Oct. 15, for example, automated trading programs drove up the price of 10-year Treasuries in a burst of buying so intense that a government report later found the machines bought more than 10 percent of the securities from their own firms. Then, just as quickly, the computers turned around and drove prices back down.The 12-minute spree was among the largest price movements ever seen in one of the world\u2019s most liquid markets, yet the government report found no clear cause.Finally, investors say regulatory changes are keeping some large traders on the sidelines, making it harder to buy and sell, even in the highly liquid market for Treasuries. That can exacerbate market movements because when people are in a hurry to buy or sell, they tend to chase the best available offers. \u201cThe depth of the market is not what it used to be,\u201d said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, a Los Angeles investment firm that manages some of the world\u2019s largest bond funds. \u201cYou can get the same trades done, but it takes more time.\u201dOther observers, however, urge a broader perspective.Moreover, Mr. Cecchetti said that removing some liquidity was a good thing because much of that liquidity was a result of public subsidies for the banking system that had encouraged undue risk-taking.\u201cDoes it mean that there\u2019s going to be more high-frequency volatility? Sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means the Simon Potters of the world are going to have to be much more careful about what they\u2019re doing. But that seems to me to be kind of O.K.\u201dMr. Potter has worked at the New York Fed since the late 1990s, but he spent most of his career there in the research department before taking over the markets desk in 2012. He became more involved in the practical side of the Fed\u2019s work during the financial crisis. In a 2012 speech at New York University, Mr. Potter said the experience \u2014 particularly during a four-week period at the peak of the crisis \u2014 had impressed upon him the limits of theory, the need to understand what investors are thinking and the value of flexibility in policy making.\u201cFor economists who did not have the opportunity to observe the panic up close as I and most of my colleagues had, the developments in this four-week period must have been bewildering, given how widely events on the ground and theory diverged,\u201d he said.That perspective may come in handy. The last time the Fed shifted the basic mechanics of monetary policy was in the early 1980s, when Paul Volcker was its chairman. That campaign is remembered as a triumph of central banking. Mr. Volcker succeeded in driving inflation down toward modern levels, ending a long period in which governments had floundered helplessly to prevent rising prices.But Mr. Faust, the Johns Hopkins economist, says the messiness of Mr. Volcker\u2019s triumph is often overlooked. The Fed\u2019s initial plans did not work and were revised and did not work and were revised again \u2014 and still didn\u2019t work.He said the Volcker episode was a reminder that monetary policy is not figure skating. The Fed is likely to flail, he says, but it will be measured by its success in getting interest rates to rise, not by the grace of its performance.\u201cIf you\u2019re into the internal plumbing, I suspect there will be times when that looks messy because this is new,\u201d Mr. Faust said. \u201cBut central banks can raise interest rates, and they will. And as long as that happens, from the standpoint of the broader economy, everything is fine and the rest will be forgotten or become a footnote of history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Call for a Free Market", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe worldwide turbulence of recent days is a strong indication that government intervention alone cannot restore the economy and offers a glimpse of the risk of completely depending on it. It is time to give the free market a chance.Since the crash of 2008, governments have tried to stimulate their economies by a variety of means but have relied heavily on manipulating interest rates lower through one form or other of quantitative easing or simply printing money. The immediate rescue of the collapsing economy was necessary at the time, but the manipulation has now gone on for nearly seven years and has produced many unwanted consequences.It has exacerbated the inequality of income around the world. Money has been artificially allocated by the abnormally low rates to reward speculation and to discourage savings and longer-term investments that produce real economic and employment growth.The Federal Reserve, waiting for signs of inflation to change its policies, seems to be looking at the wrong data. Actually its policies have been highly effective in the areas stimulated most heavily, but the low interest rate policies have not stimulated the broad economy or made most people better off. In fact, it may have actually hurt those people.Low interest rates have hugely lifted assets largely owned by the very rich, and inflation in these areas is clearly apparent. Stocks have tripled and real estate prices in the major cities where the wealthy live have been soaring, as have the prices of artwork and the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods.Cheap financing has led to a boom in speculative activity, and mergers and acquisitions. Most acquisitions are justified by \u201cefficiencies\u201d which is usually a euphemism for layoffs. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, one of the nation\u2019s most active acquirers, routinely fires \u201credundant\u201d workers after each acquisition to enhance reported earnings. This elevates its stock, with which it makes the next acquisition. With money cheap, corporate executives have used cash flow to buy back stock, enhancing the value of their options, instead of investing for the future. This pattern, and the fear it engenders, has added to downward pressure on employment and wages.Similarly, older adults and those on fixed incomes are getting next to nothing on their savings. In a typical bank today, $1 million astonishingly yields only about $2,000 a year. As interest income has fallen for seniors, their spending has understandably moderated. Thus consumer spending, which would have otherwise expanded the broad economy, has been sluggish.Extended Fed intervention has actually increased the risks of severe trouble ahead. Many pension systems are woefully underfunded because, while their liabilities are fixed, their fixed-income investments yield far below their actuarial assumptions. This forces them to take greater risks or to seek other means to close the gap. Historically this hasn\u2019t ended well.So, the income gap widens. The rich get richer and most of the country is treading water at best, not what one would expect from a Democratic administration ostensibly committed to the broader public.Another risk of the current policy is that investors, rather than doing their own thinking, have increasingly been taking their cue from the Fed. They are addicted to stimulus, like a drug. In the short term, markets are gyrating less on an analysis of fundamentals and more, buffeted by the endless speculation of the talking heads, on the basis of whether they believe they can rely on the Fed to enrich them or bail them out.An even more concerning trend has emerged in the last few weeks. With huge Chinese stimulus failing to support its manipulated stock market through currency devaluation, cash infusions and eased rules, the presumed confidence in the ability of central banks to control economies has come into question. Further, there is a growing realization that, by keeping interest rates at essentially zero, the tools the central banks have available to arrest another decline are very limited.The Fed should raise rates in September. The focus on a quarter-point change in short rates and its precise date of imposition is foolishness. Expected rates of return on new investments are typically well above 10 percent. No sensible businessman would defer a sound investment because short-term rates are slightly higher for a few months. They either have a sound investment or they don\u2019t. The reluctance to raise rates now would likely do more harm than good as it would suggest to investors that the Fed foresees a more fragile recovery. This might encourage the businessman to hold off on planned investments, further undermining the recovery.David Rocker is the founder and former managing general partner of the hedge fund Rocker Partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Police Clear \u2018You Stink\u2019 Protesters From Minister\u2019s Offices in Beirut", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut on Tuesday evening, after an hourslong standoff, riot police officers cleared them from the offices, grabbing, beating and shoving demonstrators, according to protesters. \u201cThis is a peaceful evacuation by the Lebanese authorities,\u201d Wadih Al-Asmar said sarcastically, showing a large bruise on his arm. Until the move by the police, the occupation by the demonstrators had been peaceful. Interior Ministry police officers stood outside the building and the environment minister, Mohammad Al Mashnouq, said he would remain in his office. Videos posted online by the protesters showed at least a dozen of them sitting along the sides of a hallway, grinning, singing, cheering and chanting: \u201cLeave! Leave! Leave!\u201d They called on the public to join them, and chanting crowds soon gathered outside.The sit-in signaled a new phase of the You Stink movement, which drew its largest crowd yet to central Beirut on Saturday as thousands demonstrated peacefully in a rare show of unity from a public often divided along political and religious lines. Organizers had given officials three days \u2014 a deadline that expired Tuesday evening \u2014 to meet their demands or face what they called escalation. The government, not accustomed to this mode of protest, appeared not to have prepared a graceful way to react.Inside the minister\u2019s offices, the air-conditioning was shut off and the bathrooms were locked. The police gave the protesters a half-hour to get out. Outside, army vehicles arrived and riot police officers gathered. While it is not unusual for the army, considered the least partisan of Lebanon\u2019s security forces, to take part in keeping civic order, protesters said it seemed like an overreaction.Lebanese news channels broadcast for a time from inside the ministry headquarters, as the demonstrators sought to provide a kind of national tutorial on nonviolent protest tactics.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that we are doing civil disobedience,\u201d one organizer told a reporter when asked what would happen if police officers entered. \u201cWe will not leave. And of course we will not confront them.\u201dThe demonstrations began in July over the mountains of garbage that piled up after political disputes disrupted trash pickup, and expanded to include the general gridlock and corruption that paralyze government services and the economy.Questions about whether and how the movement can sustain and broaden itself remain. It is unclear if it can win concessions from a political class that has counted on inertia and division to deflect challenges to its rule.\u201cWe want to have some small successes so we can fight more,\u201d said Lucien Bourjeily, a member of the small group that coined the name You Stink, a jab at political leaders on all sides.\u201cThe challenge is to be able to be responsible for this historical moment that happened on Saturday,\u201d he said in an interview hours before the sit-in began.The focus on Mr. Mashnouq reflected this pragmatic approach: He is the person most visibly responsible for the sanitation crisis, since his ministry handles trash disposal. And he is closely identified with the centrist prime minister, Tammam Salam, making him a symbol of the government in general and allowing protesters to deflect concerns that they are serving either side in Lebanon\u2019s main political divide between Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group, and its primary rival, the Future Movement.Since the demands were issued, Mr. Mashnouq has resigned from a committee created to manage the garbage problem \u2014 but not from the cabinet.\u201cCan you imagine, the minister of environment stepped down from the committee that deals with the garbage, but he is still a minister,\u201d said Mr. Bourjeily, a theater director. \u201cWho should deal with it then?\u201dMr. Bourjeily was one of those who occupied the office and was later taken to a hospital with an injured arm, protesters said. You Stink is a loose-knit group that includes longtime good-government activists and political neophytes. The organizers say they are making decisions along with a committee of citizens from different sectors of society.Existing labor, environmental and other organizations have been broadly supportive of the movement. But so far, there have been few concrete results; while garbage has been picked up in fits and starts, it has been dumped illegally, and there is no long-term disposal plan.As supporters gathered outside the office building, which houses the ministry along with private businesses, riot police officers lined up nearby.The action took place in the heart of downtown Beirut, just opposite Roman ruins, the central clock tower and the pedestrian area of Nejmeh Square, and two of the city\u2019s grandest houses of worship, a mosque and a church that stand side by side.The protesters insisted that they did not want to talk to anyone but the minister himself and would not leave until he stepped down. But the prime minister was quoted in the local news media as saying that he had \u201cruled out\u201d the resignation.Mr. Asmar said the protesters told Mr. Mashnouq\u2019s staff that \u201che failed in his job,\u201d and chanted it loudly so that the minister could hear. \u201cThis kind of action, Lebanese people should do more often,\u201d Mr. Asmar added. \u201cThis is what we are asking for, accountability.\u201d After several hours, security forces ordered journalists to leave and even cut the transmission cable of one television station. Soon after, the police moved in. News of the clash brought several hundred people to the area, where they kept up a tense standoff for hours with several hundred police officers and soldiers.\u201cIn other countries people have asked to take down their state,\u201d Mr. Asmar said. \u201cWe are asking for a state, and they are beating us.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

For years, Washington has tried both sanctions and dialogue to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and long-range missile development, to no avail.Instead, North Korea in recent years has been renovating and expanding its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, the capital, as well as its primary satellite-launching site in Tongchang-ri near its northwestern border with China.The state media report on Tuesday quoted the Atomic Energy Institute director as reaffirming that \u201call the nuclear facilities\u201d in Yongbyon, including the uranium-enrichment plant and a 5-megawatt graphite-moderated reactor, \u201cwere rearranged, changed or readjusted\u201d and were in \u201cnormal operation.\u201dNorth Korea is widely believed to have built at least several nuclear bombs using plutonium gleaned from the spent fuel of the Yongbyon reactor before it was shut down under a short-lived nuclear disarmament deal with Washington in 2007. In 2013, after the deal collapsed, North Korea said it had restarted the reactor, as well as a newly disclosed uranium-enrichment complex there.That same year, Mr. Kim declared that his nuclear weapons were not a bargaining chip and called for expanding his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal both in \u201cquality and quantity\u201d during a Workers\u2019 Party meeting. He said the nuclear weapons would help his country focus on rebuilding its economy, dismissing warnings from Washington and Seoul that it would only deepen the country\u2019s isolation and economic misery.The restarting of the Yongbyon reactor and the operation of the uranium enrichment plant there were particularly worrisome for American officials because they provided the North with two sources of fuel for more nuclear bombs: plutonium and highly enriched uranium.American and South Korean intelligence officials have closely monitored Yongbyon. Private research institutes, citing commercial satellite images of the site, have said that North Korea may be attempting to expand its uranium-enrichment capacities as well as trying to extract more plutonium from spent fuel.North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006, the latest in February 2013. The renewed activities in Yongbyon raised concern that North Korea was significantly increasing its nuclear fuel stockpile. Western intelligence officials say that North Korea is trying to build, if it has not already, a nuclear warhead small enough to be mounted on a ballistic missile.Historically, increased activities at Yongbyon have increased tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. On Tuesday, both Washington and Seoul warned that a new satellite launching by North Korea would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, which barred the country from developing or testing ballistic missile technologies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Russians, Local Options but Higher Prices", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeMOSCOW \u2014 Russia is at war with European food products. That much was made clear last month when TV crews filmed bulldozers carrying out an offensive against mountains of contraband Western cheeses that had slipped across Russian borders in violation of a year-old embargo.But that doesn\u2019t mean that Russian consumers can\u2019t find happiness on the supermarket shelf in the form of their favorite cheeses. The only condition is that these be produced in Russia or a \u201cneutral\u201d country \u2014 and not in the European Union, the United States or Canada, all of which fell under the Russian ban imposed in retaliation for Western sanctions.Here are a few anomalies found on a recent shopping spree: Hungarian smoked cheese, produced in the Russian region of Bashkortostan; a Camembert, produced in Krasnodar, in the country\u2019s southwestern region; a Bulgarian Brinza produced in the Penza region; and a Cheddar, produced by a company called Chizzi in the Moscow region.There is nothing illegal about most of this, except, perhaps, the Camembert, sold here in the round box that distinguishes the creamy cheese from Normandy, which, in theory, enjoys protected status. Otherwise, Brinza, Cheddar, even Dutch cheeses like Edam and Gouda \u2014 these are names that indicate a type of cheese, not a brand, which can be made anywhere. Whether these Russian knockoffs actually resemble the original is a matter of dispute. Shaun Walker, the correspondent in Moscow, wrote there was \u201cnothing particularly disgusting about it. It just doesn\u2019t taste of anything at all.\u201d He compared it to a cheesy version of Russia\u2019s mild-mannered prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev \u2014 \u201cinoffensive and vaguely pointless.\u201dMr. Walker gave a burrata from Tula a nine out of 10. The worst was something called Parmesan Dolce, which Mr. Walker described as a \u201ca lump of gluey cheese- like matter\u201d with the odor of the \u201cfluids of a gym changing-room floor.\u201d Worse yet, this slab of cheese was the most expensive, at 510 rubles, or about $7.What is the beleaguered Russian consumer to do? As the economy sinks into recession, families are already struggling with rising inflation \u2014 up 15 percent since last year, with even higher increases for such basic food items as sunflower oil, carrots and cabbage.With names like Parmesan Dolce, or Villa Europe, an unidentified cheese in a package depicting a pretty European village, they are aiming for a well- known Russian soft spot, nurtured in Soviet times and indulged in the decade when trade barriers came down, and borders opened up. Western foods, particularly from Europe, were valued, even treasured, for their taste, yes, but also for their guaranteed quality.Western companies are now scrambling to keep their position in the Russian market. After the Russian embargo took effect, Valio, a Finnish dairy company, could no longer sell its popular Oltermanni cheese, made in Finland. Instead, the company has stepped up production of sliced cheeses, made in Russia and sold under the generic names, \u201cEnglish\u201d and \u201cDutch\u201d as well as \u201cRussian.\u201dOf course, consumers lose more over all than manufacturers gain. Why? Because protected domestic producers deliberately produce less than the market demands to keep prices high.The reduced supply means that what remains costs more, even if it is locally produced. Russians are paying a third more for sunflower oil, a fifth more for yogurt and three-quarters more for carrots compared with a year ago, according to government statistics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Melting Ice Isn\u2019t Opening Arctic to Oil Bonanza", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Kremlin spent billions in the last decade in hopes of turning it into a northern hub of its energy powerhouse, Gazprom. It was once the most ambitious project planned in the Arctic Ocean, but now there is little to show for it aside from a shuttered headquarters and an enormous gravel road carved out of the windblown coastline like a scar.\u201cThere are plans,\u201d said Viktor A. Turchaninov, the village\u2019s mayor, \u201cbut the facts \u2014 the realities of life \u2014 suggest the opposite.\u201dTectonic shifts in the global energy economy, fierce opposition from environmentalists who oppose tampering with the ecologically fragile waters, and formidable logistical obstacles have tempered enthusiasm that only a few years ago seemed boundless. After years of planning and delays, Shell\u2019s drilling project in the stormy waters of the Chukchi Sea is now being watched by the industry, officials, residents and critics as a make-or-break test of the viability of production in the Arctic.\u201cFrom an economic point of view, I\u2019m not sure going offshore Arctic is very rational,\u201d said Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, chief executive and president of Total, the French oil company, which once also planned to drill off Alaska\u2019s northern coast.Shell has already spent $7 billion and this summer has faced tribulations like those that marred an ill-fated exploration three years ago, including dogged protests, harsh weather and an accident in July that gouged a hole in one of its ships after it struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutian Islands.\u201cThe entire cost structure up there is three to five times more expensive than onshore lower 48,\u201d said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a Texas-based oil company. Two years ago, his company gave up on a field projected to contain 100 million barrels of oil in the Beaufort Sea \u2014 drilled from a man-made island and connected by an eight-mile pipeline to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska \u2014 in order to invest more in Texas shale fields.\u201cOne-hundred-million-barrel-type discoveries will not be economical in a $100-a-barrel oil environment, and they certainly won\u2019t be economical today,\u201d Mr. Sheffield said.Even optimistic projections suggest the Arctic might not prove to be as transformative as once imagined. According to Rystad Energy, a global consultancy based in Norway, production from offshore fields in or near the Arctic could double between 2015 and 2025 to 1.4 million barrels a day, which would still be less than 2 percent of current global production.\u201cWhen people say the Arctic is the next frontier and there is great resource potential, of course there is the risk that it is hype,\u201d said Jon Marsh Duesund, a Rystad senior project manager.High Hopes in DisrepairTeriberka, a village of 1,000 people on the Barents Sea, is where Gazprom\u2019s offshore ambitions collided with the harsh realities of the Arctic.It was a thriving fishing village in Soviet times, with fish-processing factories and even a farm for harvesting the pelts of snow foxes, but it fell into decline in the 1970s with the advent of industrial fishing. The population dropped from more than 6,000, wooden piers crumbled, and fishing boats that once brought back cod were scuttled in the bay where the Teriberka River flows into the sea.Like people in Alaska and other places who look to the changing Arctic for economic development and jobs, the village\u2019s residents welcomed Gazprom\u2019s plans to tap an enormous gas field, called the Shtokman, that was discovered in 1988 about 370 miles offshore.Under the control of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Gazprom emerged as an energy giant controlled by the state, and for much of the 2000s, the Shtokman was its biggest prize, a project that Russia dangled before eager foreign investors. After reaching deals with Total and Statoil, Gazprom began construction of the road in Teriberka where it hoped to build terminals for processing and shipping the gas in liquefied form \u2014 all at a cost estimated to rise to $20 billion.After years of work, however, Russia\u2019s plans for the project came under pressure from enormous technical challenges, the changing energy market and finally the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Russia, as the world\u2019s largest producer of natural gas, found itself struggling to compete against alternative supplies to countries in Europe eager to reduce their dependence on Mr. Putin\u2019s government, even as prices dropped significantly.Statoil pulled out in 2012, writing off more than $335 million in costs. Total wrote off $350 million last year and, according to Russian news accounts, returned its 25 percent share of the project to Gazprom in June.The Arctic is at the core of the nationalist ambitions of Mr. Putin, who once said that tapping the region\u2019s resources was as natural as hunting and harvesting berries and mushrooms.The Shtokman field, Mr. Putin has boasted, remains a prospect, but one for the next generation.\u201cAs soon as they speak of the next generation, it means something is wrong,\u201d Mr. Chuprov, of Greenpeace Russia, said. \u201cIn this country \u2014 in Soviet times, in czarist times \u2014 nobody thinks about the next generation.\u201dDespite Gazprom\u2019s promises to resume drilling \u2014 in 2014, then in 2016 or 2019 \u2014 residents in Teriberka have become resigned about the boom that never was. The contractors who arrived in droves have departed, and the enormous embankment where Gazprom built a gravel road, encroaching on the village\u2019s cemetery, comes to a dead end at a rocky cliff.\u201cThey built the road,\u201d Igor Abanosimov said when a neighbor lamented that the project had changed little. Mr. Abanosimov owns a series of floating cottages that he rents out, dreaming, perhaps improbably, of developing a yacht club and other amenities that might attract tourists instead of energy companies. The Arctic, he said, has its own soul.\u201cThose it wants to accept, it accepts,\u201d he explained. \u201cThose it wants to banish, it banishes.\u201dShell\u2019s Many MishapsTo environmentalists, the accidents bolstered their arguments that exploration in the Arctic is simply too risky. Shell did not give up, though. The company replaced its senior Arctic leadership team and devised another plan to overcome the natural and regulatory hurdles.Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call last month that the company\u2019s stake could ultimately be \u201cmultiple times\u201d more bountiful than in the vast Gulf of Mexico.\u201cAlaska is a long-term play,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the way you have to look at it. We can\u2019t be driven by today\u2019s, tomorrow\u2019s, or next year\u2019s, or last year\u2019s oil price.\u201dSteven Lee Myers reported from Teriberka, Murmansk and Moscow, Russia, and Barrow, Alaska, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Jeremy Corbyn Elected as New Leader, Britain\u2019s Labour Party Takes a Hard Left Turn", "Date": "2015-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After three decades as a political outsider and clarion of the left, Jeremy Corbyn on Saturday won the leadership of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party with an emphatic victory and a program that includes expanding the economy, scrapping nuclear missiles and dismantling the centrist policies of his predecessors, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair.Mr. Corbyn, 66, won the Labour leadership overwhelmingly with the backing of thousands of newly recruited supporters, and in doing so delivered one of the biggest upsets in modern British politics.His success underlines the extent to which European political structures have been destabilized by the aftershocks of the financial crisis in 2008, with voters increasingly attracted away from the political center ground, either to the socialist left or the nationalist right.However, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s program, which includes nationalizing energy and rail companies, has shallow support among fellow Labour lawmakers, a fact that suggests he may struggle to unite his party. Several senior party figures, including Emma Reynolds and Tristram Hunt, have already announced that they will not be serving on Mr. Corbyn\u2019s team, though another, Hilary Benn, promised to support him.On Saturday there were jubilant scenes after the release of results showing that Mr. Corbyn had won almost 60 percent of the vote, crushing his three opponents, Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be unequal, it doesn\u2019t have to be unfair, poverty isn\u2019t inevitable,\u201d Mr. Corbyn told a cheering audience in a short acceptance speech.\u201cThings can change and they will change,\u201d he added, denouncing \u201cgrotesque\u201d levels of inequality and placing blame for the migration crisis currently sweeping Europe on the bitter legacy of going to war. One of his first acts, Mr. Corbyn said, will be to attend a demonstration in London to highlight the plight of refugees.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s perceived integrity and his willingness to speak his mind have struck a chord in a party in which many supporters were left disillusioned by the leadership of Mr. Blair, whose decision to join President George W. Bush in invading Iraq poisoned his legacy. Yet Mr. Blair is one of only a handful of Labour leaders who has ever won a general election, and Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics fear he will turn the Labour Party into a protest movement, rather than a realistic alternative to the Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron.\u201cI\u2019m learning how to grit my teeth and bite my tongue,\u201d one Labour lawmaker, who asked not to be named to avoid alienating Mr. Corbyn, said outside the conference center where the results were made public.How long Mr. Corbyn\u2019s critics stay quiet remains to be seen. His parliamentary record as a serial rebel who frequently defied the party line will also make it hard for him to appeal for loyalty.Yet the scale of his win may give Mr. Corbyn some time to establish his leadership. In fact Mr. Corbyn, a vegetarian and teetotaler, had to be persuaded to run as the left\u2019s leadership candidate, and he nearly failed to make the ballot paper.To stand, Mr. Corbyn needed 35 nominations from Labour lawmakers, and he scraped enough together only when several of those who did not support him decided he ought to be on the ballot to broaden the debate within the party.Mr. Corbyn\u2019s victory was then helped by a rule change under which, for just three British pounds, about $4.60, anyone could become a \u201cregistered supporter\u201d and take part in the vote. The party, which had around 187,000 members before the May general election, has gained more than 105,000 since, plus 112,000 \u201cregistered supporters.\u201d When those affiliated with the party, mainly through unions, are added, more than half a million people had the right to vote, and more than 420,000 ultimately took part. On Saturday, political opponents moved quickly to condemn Labour\u2019s leftward shift. Michael Fallon, the defense secretary, described the opposition party as \u201ca serious risk to our nation\u2019s security, our economy\u2019s security and your family\u2019s security.\u201d\u201cWhether it\u2019s weakening our defenses, raising taxes on jobs and earnings, racking up more debt and welfare or driving up the cost of living by printing money \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party will hurt working people,\u201d he said in a statement.More worrying for Mr. Corbyn will be internal critics. Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, said that the emphatic nature of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s victory made it likely that his opponents would keep quiet for some months, and hope for him to trip up.\u201cI think there will be some kind of cease-fire, and that they will see how it goes, assuming that in six to 12 months, Labour\u2019s opinion poll position will start to fall, and then they can start acting more assertively,\u201d Mr. Fielding said.Doing so more quickly might risk the wrath of the party supporters, many of whom have been energized by Mr. Corbyn\u2019s campaign, Mr. Fielding added.On Saturday they thronged the conference center where the results were announced, some cheering or chanting.Among those supporting the new leader was Sean Maher, a telecom executive from London, who said he had lost interest in the party during the 1990s because of the policies pursued by Mr. Blair, whom he likened to a Conservative.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of winning elections by being Conservative?\u201d he said. By contrast, Mr. Corbyn, \u201coffers a great deal of hope, and it has been a long time coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Between Iraq and a Hawk Base", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureBush said yes. Shortly after that, he said that he had misheard the question; later, that the question was hypothetical and thus unworthy of an answer; and finally, upon further review, that he in fact would not have authorized the invasion. The jittery about-face suggested that Bush had spent little, if any, time digesting the lessons of the war that defines his older brother\u2019s presidency.The shadow that George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy casts over Jeb Bush\u2019s quest for the White House is particularly prominent. But it also looms over the entire G.O.P. field, reminding the candidates that though Republican voters reject what they see as Obama\u2019s timid foreign policy, the public has only so much appetite for bellicosity after more than a decade spent entangled in the Middle East. At some point, even the most conservative of voters will demand an answer to the logical corollary of Megyn Kelly\u2019s question: How does a president project American strength while avoiding another Iraq?Among the many advisers recruited to help Jeb Bush answer that question is Richard Fontaine, the president of the Center for a New American Security, a policy group based in Washington. Fontaine was a senior foreign-\u00adpolicy adviser for Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, where he first learned that winning over voters was a radically different task from those he navigated during his career in the Bush administration. \u2018\u2018Diplomacy is about minimizing differences,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Pol Pot and the Pope \u2014 surely there\u2019s something they can agree on.\u2019 A political campaign is exactly the opposite. It\u2019s about taking a minor difference and blowing it up into something transcendent.\u2019\u2019Watching Jeb Bush flub the Iraq question confirmed a theory about that war and its unheeded lessons that Fontaine had been nurturing for several months. In February, he co-wrote an essay in Politico Magazine arguing that Congress should not authorize Obama to use military force against ISIS until it had done the kind of due diligence that Congress utterly failed to do before authorizing Bush to invade Iraq in 2002. In response to the essay, Fontaine said, many of his peers acknowledged to him \u2018\u2018that there actually hasn\u2019t been a lot of thinking on this from the entire foreign-policy establishment other than the knee-jerk \u2018Well, we\u2019re never gonna do that again.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Fontaine, who is 40, Clark Kentish in appearance and wryly self-deprecating in conversation, has been doing quite a bit of thinking on the matter of Iraq. He worked in the State Department as well as the National Security Council during the first year of the Iraq war before signing on as McCain\u2019s foreign-policy aide in 2004. Over the next five years, he and McCain traveled to Iraq 10 times. His boss had been one of the loudest advocates of toppling Saddam Hussein and then one of the most candidly chagrined observers when the war effort began to crumble before his eyes. \u2018\u2018We\u2019d been running this experiment from 2003 to the end of 2006 of trying to make political changes in Iraq and hoping this would positively influence the security,\u2019\u2019 Fontaine recalled. \u2018\u2018It only got worse and worse. Things got to the point where there was no political or economic activity in the country, because the violence was so bad.\u2019\u2019The troop surge in 2007 succeeded in stabilizing the country. By then, however, Americans were weary of military aggression. In 2008, they elected president a one-term U.S. senator who had consistently opposed the war in Iraq and vowed to end it so he could devote most of his attention to a foundering economy. Four years later, the electorate awarded Obama a second term, with the same priorities in mind. Exit polls showed that 60 percent of voters regarded the economy as the predominant issue in 2012, while a mere 4 percent cited foreign affairs as their chief voting issue.Three years later, this has changed \u2014 especially for Republican voters, who, according to several polls, now say national security rivals the economy as a foremost concern. Several factors explain this. While the economy has continued to improve, the Obama administration has watched with seeming helplessness as ISIS dominates swaths of Iraq and Syria while beheading American hostages; as Iran threatens to make good on its nuclear ambitions unless the United States agrees to lift sanctions; as Vladimir Putin reasserts Russian primacy by invading the Crimean Peninsula; and as China spreads its influence across Asia and Africa. These and other developments have revived concerns that the United States has become dangerously weaker under a Democratic president, one whose first secretary of state happens to be the apparent favorite for that party\u2019s presidential nomination.The swaggering rhetoric of Donald Trump, the current Republican front-runner, seems deftly calibrated to reflect the mood of a G.O.P. base spoiling for fights abroad. According to a Quinnipiac University poll in July, 72 percent of registered Iowa Republican voters (where the first contest for presidential delegates will be held early next year) favor sending American ground troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS. In August, Quinnipiac found that 86 percent of all Republicans opposed the Iran nuclear deal.Fontaine is among the conservative foreign-policy thinkers who argue that the Obama administration has overlearned Iraq\u2019s lessons. \u2018\u2018Their core belief was \u2018We\u2019re here to wind these wars down, and the risks in doing so are manageable,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The instinct was to limit our investment, whether diplomatically or in terms of blood and treasure. That\u2019s caused a willful disregard for the realities at hand. You hear it all the time: \u2018This is the Iraqis\u2019 fight,\u2019 or \u2018The Syrians should be fighting.\u2019 Yes, they should. But if they\u2019re not, then we have a national interest, and we should be doing something.\u2019\u2019Eventually, each G.O.P. candidate will be called upon to define exactly what that \u2018\u2018something\u2019\u2019 is and determine whether Americans have an appetite for it. To that end, for the next 14 months, it will fall to advisers like Fontaine to help the candidates craft a post-Bush/post-Obama foreign-policy vision, one that simultaneously projects more muscle than Obama and less reckless use of muscle than Bush. The tricky part, as their advisers \u2014 avowed hawks whose careers were shaped by Iraq \u2014 know all too well, will be to demonstrate that an aggressive foreign policy can somehow avoid becoming a reckless one.As a national-security expert who worked with politicians but had no political agenda of his own, Fontaine received multiple inquiries. He declined to work with the campaigns of Scott Walker and Marco Rubio but agreed to join the Bush foreign-policy team after Bill Simon, a former Wal-Mart chief executive and now the Bush campaign\u2019s policy-team recruiter, asked him to come aboard as an informal outside adviser. Simon had heard about Fontaine through other recruits, including the former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who had been a consultant for several campaigns before Bush prevailed upon him to pledge his fidelity.Zoellick and Fontaine belong to a nomadic tribe of worldly Republican technocrats who migrate from academia to government to nonprofit policy centers to the private sector. Nearly all are hawks who abhor not only Obama\u2019s posture of caution but also the old-style, consensus-building internationalism espoused by officials who served in the first Bush administration, like Richard Burt and Lorne Craner, who are now on Rand Paul\u2019s foreign-policy team. Among the conservative intelligentsia, a few \u2014 Meghan O\u2019Sullivan, Kristen Silverberg and Elbridge Colby \u2014 are comparatively moderate alumni of the second Bush administration who now advise his brother\u2019s campaign. Others have made their names on the Hill as forceful interventionists: Robert S. Karem, who advised the House majority leaders Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy before directing Jeb Bush\u2019s foreign-policy team; Jamie Fly, formerly Rubio\u2019s aide in the Senate and now in his campaign; and Michael Gallagher, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member who now runs Scott Walker\u2019s foreign-policy shop. In addition, advisers like Vance Serchuk, who was Senator Joe Lieberman\u2019s foreign-policy aide and now works in a geopolitical-strategy unit for the global investment firm KKR, and Christian Brose, the staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, are not committed to a particular campaign but are routinely called by campaign aides for their thoughts on foreign policy. What most of them have in common is that they are under 45 and have been influenced far more by the fall of the twin towers than by the collapse of the Berlin Wall.The candidates are pulled toward experience as well, creating an odd dissonance within these teams as they are taking shape. For example, Jeb Bush\u2019s team includes not just a new generation of foreign-policy thinkers but also Paul Wolfowitz, a prominent 71-year-old neoconservative. Wolfowitz\u2019s long career in the national-security arena reached both its peak and its nadir when he served as George W. Bush\u2019s deputy secretary of defense and pushed aggressively for the invasion of Iraq just after 9/11, assuring skeptics that the Iraqis would \u2018\u2018welcome us as liberators\u2019\u2019 and that the indigenous oil revenues would largely finance the country\u2019s reconstruction. In no small measure because of Wolfowitz\u2019s erroneous predictions, the neocon brand came to be ridiculed during the early stages of the Iraq war, only to be vindicated somewhat by the triumph of the 2007 troop surge, which quelled Sunni violence and stabilized the Shia-dominated government.Throughout that period, not every hawk self-identified as a neocon, including Fontaine, who told me, \u2018\u2018Where I come down on this is I believe in the promotion of human rights and democracy, but there are times when you have to have pragmatic relationships with autocracies.\u2019\u2019 And today there are fewer still who call themselves neocons, the moniker being generally viewed as an epithet. Its basic principles, however \u2014 among them, a belief in the aggressive promotion of American values throughout the world, an unapologetic distrust of international institutions and the conviction that a more democratic world is a less belligerent one \u2014 are abiding specters in conservative foreign-policy thought.The persistence of a chesty, exceptionalist view of America\u2019s place on the world stage is, of course, also abetted by today\u2019s nuance-free zone of political dialogue. \u2018\u2018The discourse in Washington just becomes like a self-licking ice cream cone of maximalist foreign policy,\u2019\u2019 Obama\u2019s deputy national-security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told me. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s what gets you on television. That\u2019s what gets your think-tank paper read.\u2019\u2019But conservative voters far from the Beltway are also clamoring for a return to a more muscular foreign policy, and there is almost certainly one major reason for this: It would be very different from the current foreign policy. Obama\u2019s worldview, seven years into his presidency, is aptly reflected by something else that Rhodes said to me: \u2018\u2018There\u2019s such an extreme vanity that everything happening in the world is an extension of our agency. There are just forces happening. They\u2019re happening all across the Middle East. And our narrative of what\u2019s supposed to happen in these places has never been right, because they\u2019re at different stages of development and have different politics. And where we succeed in foreign policy is when we patiently and methodically incentivize better behavior, and you give space for that to occur. It\u2019s very hard to completely impose a system on a country. The last time it worked was in postwar Japan.\u2019\u2019Talent, a placid-faced 58-year-old Midwesterner, was a congressman from St. Louis when he won a special election to the U.S. Senate in 2002 with heavy backing from President Bush, whose desire for congressional authorization to invade Iraq Talent heartily endorsed. By 2006, when Talent was up for re-election, the war had taken a disastrous turn. Talent nonetheless insisted that \u2018\u2018the mission is going well\u2019\u2019 and further declared that the invasion was justified even when no weapons of mass destruction were found. He lost to Claire McCaskill and has been out of electoral politics ever since.A second career soon awaited him \u2014 that of national-security guru. While serving on congressionally established advisory commissions, Talent also became a national-security adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. It was commonly speculated that a President Romney would tap Talent to be his secretary of defense. Today the same can be said for Talent under a Walker presidency.If Bush, the candidate being advised by Richard Fontaine, is challenged by the need to distinguish his foreign-policy vision from that of his brother, Talent\u2019s candidate \u2014 a Wisconsin governor with no experience on international issues \u2014 is obligated to come up with a vision from scratch. Talent asserts that Walker, the man who dismantled Wisconsin\u2019s public-employee unions, will face down enemies abroad with equal fortitude. On Aug. 28 at the Citadel, Walker laid out his own foreign-policy approach, emphasizing the need for strong executive leadership, much as Rubio\u2019s foreign-policy address in May made the case that America must \u2018\u2018lead with strength and principle,\u2019\u2019 and Jeb Bush\u2019s speech in August cited America\u2019s need to \u2018\u2018lead again\u2019\u2019 in the Middle East \u2014 all of them stopping short of Lindsey Graham\u2019s pledge to send 10,000 troops to Iraq.To assist in constructing Walker\u2019s foreign policy, Talent says that he is urging the candidate to articulate what he also \u2018\u2018hammered on Mitt\u2019\u2019 to put forward: an encompassing vision with strategic clarity that the public, Congress, allies and enemies can all understand. \u2018\u2018The real lesson of Iraq,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018is that you always have to ask, \u2018O.K., what are we trying to achieve and how does it fit into our broader goals?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 He continued, \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t spend the next term with everybody pointing fingers about what went wrong with Iraq.\u2019\u2019I asked Michael Gallagher, the coordinator of Walker\u2019s foreign-policy team, what distinguished his own philosophy from that of the neoconservatives. He replied that such distinctions weren\u2019t meaningful, given that all Republicans favored a robust alternative to Obama\u2019s seeming reluctance to lead: \u2018\u2018I think lost in this debate between isolationism and neoconservatism is the fact that there is a striking amount of consensus within the party.\u2019\u2019 When I asked if there was anything in his experience \u2014 Gallagher was a Marine captain deployed to Anbar Province in late 2007 \u2014 that would make him question the neoconservative worldview, he paused at great length before finally saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have anything to offer on that.\u2019\u2019Republicans like Walker have criticized Obama\u2019s incursion into Libya on the front end (\u2018\u2018leading from behind\u2019\u2019) as well as the back end (failing to prevent the free-for-all of warring militias that currently prevails there). But they have been far more reticent in explaining how they would have responded to the popular uprising against Qaddafi or to the Arab Spring in general. When I asked Talent, he thought for a moment before replying. \u2018\u2018Well, I\u2019ll tell you as Jim Talent \u2014 I don\u2019t think Governor Walker has opined on this topic yet,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The question of when purely humanitarian goals, assuming there is such a thing, should be an object of American policy is one that I think reasonable people can really debate over.\u2019\u2019Prodded to specify what he would have advised the president to do in Libya, Talent mentioned \u2018\u2018two reasonable options.\u2019\u2019 One would have been to limit American activity to humanitarian aid, on the grounds that the circumstances did not significantly affect our national interests. The other recourse would have been to drive Qaddafi out of power but then \u2018\u2018continue to be involved post-conflict, to help ensure that the government that emerges is a partner.\u2019\u2019 In Talent\u2019s view, \u2018\u2018Either of those options would have been better than overthrowing him and seeing what happens next. Now we have a much worse humanitarian disaster and elements on the ground that are enemies of America.\u2019\u2019 Of course, as Talent conceded, he did not warn against such scenarios in real time, before the Libya bombing, just as many Republicans did not forecast the complications that would arise from invading Iraq in 2003.In May, Walker offered a textbook case of how a Republican presidential candidate can reframe the failures of the Iraq war: Skip past the first four years of chaotic bloodshed and focus instead on President Bush\u2019s decision in 2007 to send another 20,000 troops into Iraq. Bush, Walker said, deserved \u2018\u2018enormous credit for ordering the surge, a courageous move that worked,\u2019\u2019 and then lamented that Obama \u2018\u2018threw away the gains of the surge,\u2019\u2019 with brutal consequences. And in his foreign-policy address last month, Jeb Bush also glossed over the questionable decision to invade Iraq and instead lavished praise on the surge as the \u2018\u2018turning point we had all been waiting for,\u2019\u2019 one that was then squandered by Obama with a \u2018\u2018premature withdrawal\u2019\u2019 of troops that constituted \u2018\u2018the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill, and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.\u2019\u2019As a Bush staff member, Jordan watched Iraq degenerate into turmoil \u2014 observing at close hand, she said, \u2018\u2018a really clear disconnect between what we were telling ourselves and what was happening on the ground.\u2019\u2019 The surge revived her hopes in America\u2019s ability to quell sectarian violence by military means. But after leaving the White House, she worked as a freelance journalist, visiting Afghanistan in 2010 to embed with U.S. troops for an article about the military\u2019s counterinsurgency efforts against the Taliban. This was during a troop surge modeled after the maneuver in Iraq, but in Afghanistan, the tactic proved ineffectual. Jordan began to question the value of the war there and, more broadly, the neoconservative notion that America can impose its values on other nations. \u2018\u2018While I still believe that all people deserve freedom, it\u2019s paternalistic to think we can bring it to them,\u2019\u2019 she told me.Those attacks have dwindled of late, no doubt because Paul has struggled to raise money, mount a disciplined campaign and break through the primal roar of the Trump movement. Still, it remains the case that Paul is the only candidate committed to designing a post-neocon Republican foreign policy. As another of his advisers, the Carnegie Mellon University international-relations professor Kiron Skinner, says, \u2018\u2018He\u2019s trying to provide a corrective to both the Bush and Obama administrations, in which we use American military power responsibly and when there\u2019s a clear understanding of what\u2019s needed.\u2019\u2019That feat has been difficult for Paul to pull off as he attempts to placate both the libertarian followers of his father, Ron Paul, and the conservative G.O.P. base. He has hedged on his commitment to eliminate all foreign aid, gone out of his way to show his support for Israel and adopted more confrontational language toward Syria and Iran. Paul has also said that if he were president, he would \u2018\u2018seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily.\u2019\u2019 Asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper to clarify what this would entail, he said that he meant \u2018\u2018Arab boots on the ground.\u2019\u2019 The candidate has yet to elaborate on how he would be the first American president to inspire an Arab army to \u2018\u2018destroy\u2019\u2019 an Islamist extremist group.Of course, presidential campaigns don\u2019t tend to be incubators of complex foreign policy. Throughout the 2008 campaign cycle, Obama the candidate was fond of declaring on the stump that Al Qaeda grew stronger because the Iraq war had caused the Bush administration to \u2018\u2018take our eye off the ball\u2019\u2019 instead of \u2018\u2018refocusing our attention on the war that can be won in Afghanistan.\u2019\u2019 Today the president is at pains to explain why this refocusing has not come close to fulfilling his campaign declarations.The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS\u2019s ideology was to \u2018\u2018take territory away from ISIS.\u2019\u2019 And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: \u2018\u2018The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?\u2019\u2019Zakheim\u2019s realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation\u2019s most intellectually rigorous foreign-\u00adpolicy thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.But Fontaine was not won over. \u2018\u2018Their argument \u2014 don\u2019t roll them back, hold them in place and they\u2019ll defeat themselves through their internal contradictions \u2014 has never happened to a terrorist group,\u2019\u2019 he said later. \u2018\u2018And I think we can roll them back. We\u2019ve already shrunk their territory by a third. Containment, if you stop there, is a recipe for endless bloodshed.\u2019\u2019 That was his distinctly minority, stubbornly hawkish opinion. And if Fontaine had his way, it would soon become Jeb Bush\u2019s as well.An article on Sept. 6 about Republican presidential candidates referred incorrectly to comments about foreign policy and neoconservatives made by Michael Gallagher, the coordinator of Scott Walker\u2019s foreign policy team. He was giving his own views, not those of Walker.Robert Draper is a contributing writer for the magazine. His next book is about race and murder in Washington.Illustration credits:\u00a0Alex Wong/Getty Images (Bush); Associated Press (Reagan); Getty Images (biceps); Massoud Hossaini/Associated Press (drone); Pete Souza (Obama); Hasan Sarbakhshian/Associated Press (Khamenei); Getty Images (flag); Mike Blake/Reuters (eagle); Ivan Sekretarev/Associated Press (Putin).Advertisement"}

And many of my compatriots have, out of sheer melancholy, successfully executed this act as a train arrived.These people walking all the way from Syria, however, are definitely not suicidal. They are hungry for life. Only, they don\u2019t believe they can find that life here.Hungary is not explicitly a poor country. But it is a frustrated, and frustrating, place \u2014 with its \u201cseen better days\u201d culture, antiquated manias and obsessions, barely functioning bureaucracy, tepid economy and corrupt politicians.\u201cI play a new game these days,\u201d a friend of mine said. \u201cI watch the news with my back turned to the TV, and just by listening I can tell which party a politician belongs to. If he blames the government for the refugee crisis, he\u2019s from the opposition. If he blames the European Union and its legislation, he must be with the government.\u201dAn easy game to play, no question. My friend is a sensitive woman who has dedicated many years to organizing the lives of senior officials in international charity organizations with offices in Budapest \u2014 in the course of which she has witnessed many flaws in the way they operate. And because she\u2019s smart, she also saw that while, economically and culturally, Europe hardly knows what to do with the refugees, some are glad to have them as tools to shape domestic politics.If you want to find out whether Hungarian people possess any measure of good will toward these poor creatures, go to the Keleti train station and take a look at the mounds of donated goods, distributed by a growing army of volunteers. But if you enjoy studying the various forms of hypocrisy, then browse the Facebook posts of Hungarian intellectuals who parade their own narcissistic love of humanity and their disgust with the government.Posing as a fully fledged humanitarian is not that difficult. Much harder, these days, is for a politician \u2014 especially one who claims to be conservative, patriotic and Christian \u2014 to show a compassionate human face and at the same time soothe his worried voters. Compassion is a minimal requirement: Even if you don\u2019t have it by birth, you must learn to fake it.Admittedly, the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban doesn\u2019t even bother faking it. These leaders\u2019 cruel charm has now attracted secret admirers.You\u2019ll find them in the ruin bars of Budapest. These are an institution that could exist only in this country: pubs set up in abandoned buildings and vacant lots of the city\u2019s old Jewish quarter that trade on a faded Austro-Hungarian glory. After a few drinks, when people drop the mask of political correctness they wear for the rest of the week, they quietly team up to express \u201chow tired\u201d they are of the \u201cdirty mob\u201d around the railway stations and loitering downtown.\u201cCan\u2019t tell you how fed up I am with Orban,\u201d said one after a fourth beer. \u201cBut may God help him build that blasted fence!\u201dIt makes no difference whether one is a border fence enthusiast, or a liberal intellectual nauseated by our prime minister, or a middle-class Budapest resident longing for self-respect and aggrieved at the international news coverage. At heart, we all share a desire to belong to a nation of freedom fighters.Fighting for freedom and earning moral victory: This is the religion in which we are raised in Hungary, and we have built our whole national identity around it.Unlike the last two times we thought ourselves world-famous freedom fighters \u2014 in 1956, when hundreds of thousands of Hungarian refugees fled the Communist regime to Austria, and in 1989, when thousands of East Germans climbed to Austria via Hungary through those same fences \u2014 this time, there is no chance for us to be the good guys again.The extreme situation has made the European Union\u2019s rules on how to handle immigrants impossible for Hungary to comply with. But combined with our government\u2019s mixture of aggressive self-defense and hidden self-hatred, this has meant that we cannot help but be the bad guys. All we have left is the fun of exchanging roles: hero for villain.\u201cTerrible, this situation with the migrants,\u201d said my mother over the phone. \u201cWhat do you think, darling?\u201dBy which she means: \u201cWhat should I, a retired small-town elementary school teacher, think of all this? You tell me, my big girl living in the capital.\u201dMy mother knows what a refugee is. Twenty years ago, during the Balkan conflict, my family lived near Hungary\u2019s southern border, close to recently abandoned Soviet barracks that were set up as a refugee camp for ethnic Hungarians fleeing the war. Eventually, all the residents either moved to the West or resettled in Hungary, and the camp shut down.These days, like others in Hungary and Eastern Europe, my mother needs to revise her notions of migration, Europe and Europeans. And she could use my advice.I won\u2019t frighten her by telling her that I don\u2019t always know what to think.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Report Finds Most Nations Hinder Women", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States is one of four countries around the world with no national laws requiring paid parental leave for new mothers.Russia bars women from a variety of jobs, including freight train conductor and mining rig operator.And Iran and Qatar are among 18 countries that require a married woman to ask for her husband\u2019s permission to go to work.Those are among the findings of a World Bank study of 173 countries on how domestic laws impede women\u2019s ability to work, open a business and participate in public life.The bank said 90 percent of the countries surveyed had at least one law that discriminated against women \u2014 and that, in turn, has far-reaching consequences for women, their families and their countries\u2019 prospects.The bank does not require countries to remove those legal barriers, but in the report, issued Wednesday, Kaushik Basu, the bank\u2019s chief economist, said, \u201cRemoving these can unleash energy and growth.\u201dThe study is the latest to explore how domestic laws discriminate against women; an advocacy group, Equality Now, produced a report this year, as did the International Monetary Fund.All this comes 20 years after a landmark United Nations conference in Beijing in which countries pledged to advance gender equality. The next round of development goals, which world leaders are expected to adopt this month, calls on countries to achieve gender equality by 2030.The restrictions on women are spread across rich and poor countries, the World Bank study found, and where there are no restrictions on women\u2019s work, the wage gap between men and women is likely to be lower. The restrictions also vary greatly.In France, for instance, women are prohibited from jobs that could require lifting more than 25 kilograms, or about 50 pounds, which the chief author of the study, Sarah Iqbal, compared to the weight of an average 5-year-old. That restriction prohibits women from, say, delivering FedEx packages.Thirty-two countries, including Barbados, Egypt and Uganda, prohibit a married woman from applying for a passport without her husband\u2019s permission.Some former British colonies still have colonial-era legislation that bars women from certain farm and factory jobs. Jamaica just scrapped one such law, according to the report.\u201cIf you\u2019re cutting out half your population from employment and entrepreneurial activity, you\u2019re reducing overall\u201d economic growth, Ms. Iqbal said.Most countries have some legal provisions for paid parental leave, making the United States an outlier in this regard, along with Suriname, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. (United States law provides for unpaid parental leave.)The most restrictive laws are in the Middle East, where nations prohibit women from applying for a passport or opening a business without the permission of their husbands. The 11 \u201cmost restrictive economies,\u201d the report found, are several American allies, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Iraq, along with Iran and Syria.One change that the report applauded was that 127 economies have specific legislation against domestic violence, unlike 25 years ago, when very few countries had such laws on the books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Saudi-American Reset", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContributing Op-Ed WriterNow that it\u2019s clear that the nuclear agreement will be implemented, both the United States and Iran are forced to consider one another\u2019s policies on issues beyond the nuclear question. This brings American perspectives much more in line with the Saudi government\u2019s views.In this new relationship, however, new wrinkles are inevitably emerging.The newfound independence of Saudi security doctrine is simultaneously reassuring and worrying to Washington.

With teachers walking the picket lines and classes across the city canceled, Elias, 5, instead got a day at a city community center near his home and a brief lesson in labor relations from his father, Noah Lawrence.\u201cWe talked a lot about how the teachers are unhappy with how they\u2019re being treated at work, and so they are deciding not to work to make the point \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he totally gets it,\u201d said Mr. Lawrence, 37, an engineer. The first systemwide teachers\u2019 strike here in 30 years, which was set in motion Tuesday night after contract talks broke down over issues of pay and staffing, was a novelty on Wednesday, with teachers, parents, administrators and students improvising on unfamiliar terrain. At Ingraham High School in the city\u2019s north end, the principal, Martin Floe, carried a pot of coffee out to serve the teachers who were walking in a picket line on the sidewalk under a blue sky, joined by several parents who supported them. Lief Herald, a teacher who works with at-risk students, strummed out Peter, Paul and Mary tunes and Joan Baez anthems. Drivers honked and waved their support. But bitter feelings \u2014 or pangs of anxiety about the future if the strike drags on \u2014 were just below the surface. With nearly 53,000 students displaced from classrooms, and about 5,000 teachers and other staff workers off the job, each side accused the other of playing hardball. \u201cThey broke it off,\u201d said Stacy Howard, a spokeswoman for the Seattle Public Schools, referring to the teachers\u2019 union, the Seattle Education Association. \u201cThe district\u2019s bargain team has been ready and willing to meet anytime, day or night.\u201dBut Alan Goodin, 70, the head of the art department at Ingraham High \u2014 and a veteran of the Seattle Public Schools, around long enough to remember the last strike, in 1985 \u2014 said the district had not put any real compromise positions on the table. And he said he had been struck by the level of resolve he saw this time among his colleagues.\u201cWhen they said, \u2018All the folks opposed to going out on strike, please say nay,\u2019 there wasn\u2019t a sound in the room,\u201d Mr. Goodin said, describing the union meeting before the strike.Seattle teachers are also being careful about the message their strike sends to residents. Plans call for picket lines to be shut down on Friday, for example \u2014 the anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 with strikers encouraged instead to volunteer across the city in soup kitchens, shelters or parks. Other time clocks related to the strike have begun ticking loudly as well \u2014 like how the days lost to the strike might have to be made up by shortened holidays or an extended school year. Seattle Parks and Recreation, which runs before- and after-school care at community centers during the school year, has committed, at least so far, to all-day camps only through Friday.Contract talks are set to resume Thursday.For Finn Johansen, 6, who was walking on a picket line with his father, Peter Johansen, a special-education teacher, spending the day with the strikers mostly came down to a lack of choices.\u201cThere was nothing else for me to do,\u201d Finn said with a shrug. \u201cMy brother was going to preschool, and my mother was going to work.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the inside story,\u201d Mr. Johansen said.Finn spoke up again: \u201cI was excited for school,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Under his leadership, Republicans pursued an unprecedented strategy of scorched-earth obstructionism, which did immense damage to the economy and undermined America\u2019s credibility around the world.Still, things could have been worse. And under his successor they almost surely will be worse. Bad as Mr. Boehner was, he was just a symptom of the underlying malady, the madness that has consumed his party.For me, Mr. Boehner\u2019s defining moment remains what he said and did as House minority leader in early 2009, when a newly inaugurated President Obama was trying to cope with the disastrous recession that began under his predecessor.This was know-nothing economics, and incredibly irresponsible at a time of crisis; not long ago it would have been hard to imagine a major political figure making such a statement. Did Mr. Boehner actually believe what he was saying? Was he just against anything Mr. Obama was for? Or was he engaged in deliberate sabotage, trying to block measures that would help the economy because a bad economy would be good for Republican electoral prospects?We\u2019ll probably never know for sure, but those remarks set the tone for everything that followed. The Boehner era has been one in which Republicans have accepted no responsibility for helping to govern the country, in which they have opposed anything and everything the president proposes.What\u2019s more, it has been an era of budget blackmail, in which threats that Republicans will shut down the government or push it into default unless they get their way have become standard operating procedure.So why is he out? Basically because the obstructionism failed.But Republican leaders who have encouraged the base to believe all kinds of untrue things are in no position to start preaching political rationality.Mr. Boehner is quitting because he found himself caught between the limits of the politically possible and a base that lives in its own reality.

{"Headline": "Uber Case Highlights Outdated Worker Protection Laws", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorA dispute in California over whether Uber\u2019s drivers are employees or contractors shows that labor laws that were passed decades ago just don\u2019t work in the smartphone world.But it\u2019s not just about the workplace. This litigation is becoming a Rorschach test for people\u2019s views of the sharing economy and whether it is a force for good \u2014 or for exploitation.In the California case, a law firm based in Boston led by Shannon Liss-Riordan has brought a class-action lawsuit against Uber, contending that its drivers are illegally paid as independent contractors and not employees.As with most disputes, this one is about the money. If Uber\u2019s drivers are employees, then they are entitled to the benefits that go with such classification, such as unemployment insurance and overtime, that are not required to be bestowed upon independent contractors.Uber\u2019s critics say the company is exploiting workers by not paying the benefits of employment. The sharing economy, some of them say, is doomed to further enhance inequality in the United States. Uber would appear to be another example of how the average worker in America, particularly the unskilled one, can no longer make a living wage or even get a real job.Uber and its supporters, however, contend that its drivers want this system. Uber is a technology service for matching drivers and customers and therefore is a middleman no different from, say, eBay or Etsy.With Uber, drivers are independent contractors who pay 20 percent of the fare to the company. The drivers pay all their expenses and receive no benefits, like health insurance or unemployment benefits. But in exchange, they don\u2019t need to show up if they don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t have set hours and are basically their own bosses. From this perspective, Uber is empowering drivers, allowing them to earn money on the side or more money than their other job without the inconvenience of a boss.Who is right?Well, this is not the old story of labor versus capital that drove a push for workers\u2019 rights for many years. In that narrative, capital exploited less powerful workers to its benefit, so worker protections were necessary. Laws were passed and workers organized unions to ensure that there was a balance of power. In the system that has been built up from this old conflict, the benefits of employment go largely to full-time workers.Yet if you are Uber\u2019s chief executive, you wake up every day not knowing if your work force will even show up.In the traditional economy, workers need to quit one job to take another \u2014 and there are significant costs to that.In Uber world, however, Uber drivers can work for other services like Lyft seamlessly. Many do drive for both, taking the best offer each time. It doesn\u2019t seem like exploitation when Uber needs to pay a rate that is better than a competitor\u2019s to attract drivers (of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that the competition is so great, just that Uber is better).In addition, some Uber drivers are working to pick up extra money. One of my recent Uber drivers was trying to make enough extra money to take her daughter to Disneyland.Uber is something new in employee-employer relations.The sharing economy has created a work force for Uber of up to 200,000 drivers in the United States alone in the space of a few years. And it appears to be a service that people like better and can more easily use than taxis. You can take an Uber ride and see why \u2014 it is easy, convenient and almost always there (most taxis outside Manhattan don\u2019t live up to that principle as much, to put it politely).Now the courts are trying to figure out whether Uber\u2019s drivers are contractors or employers from a standard rooted in 19th-century labor law. It\u2019s a standard that has many variations as the law tries to separate workers who need protection from independent contractors who can fend for themselves.To help carry out the test, the court has enumerated 13 more factors that indicate whether a person is an employee or contractor, such as whether there is \u201cskill\u201d required in the occupation.Do they really want to have less flexibility about who they work for? Do they want the inability to work for other people or to preselect their rides? And ultimately, given their ability to quit at any time and go to a competitor or even start their own service, do they need protection? Maybe, but probably not.So we are stuck with a complicated test that produces a result that doesn\u2019t work with the shared economy.The case is headed for trial after a judge refused to dismiss it this summer and certified it as a class-action suit. Uber is going to have to hope the jury decides that California law just doesn\u2019t apply here.And the case covers only California drivers. The potential claim for damages will matter little to a $50 billion company.This litigation is not going to force Uber to change its practices. That is because Uber doesn\u2019t really work unless its drivers have the flexibility that employees do not have. So Uber is likely to fight this battle in the other states where it has a better chance of winning.Uber could also restructure its relationship \u2014 going through companies that hire workers or contractors. It\u2019s hard to see Uber simply hiring people to drive full time. That would ruin the attraction of the service, not just for Uber but for the drivers themselves.This case truly highlights the outdated nature of workers\u2019 laws in America, not just around what it means to work for someone, but also what benefits and protections American workers need whether they are a contractor, employee or provider of services.Unfortunately, it\u2019s yet another Internet issue that the courts can\u2019t solve and the legislatures have yet to tackle.Advertisement"}

It was particularly vexing for Ms. Ciancio, a 34-year-old San Francisco resident, because she had been planning to take a four-day road trip to Fern Canyon, Calif., over the long July 4 weekend, and the idea of making the eight-hour drive without music was depressing.Ms. Ciancio is among a growing number of people who are using mobile apps to find, borrow or rent items as diverse as power drills and drones from people living nearby. It is an extension of the successful Airbnb, Uber and Lyft model, but for household items.Want to try out an iPad before buying one? Got it. Need a bike while visiting another city? No problem. Want a power drill to help you hang those blinds? It\u2019s just a mouse click away.A flurry of websites has appeared to tap the trend, with Peerby.com a front-runner. Since its beginning in Amsterdam in 2012, Peerby has expanded to 20 cities in Europe, including London and Paris, and it is doing pilot projects in 10 American cities, including New York. It expects to have a network of owners and renters in all major American cities by 2017.It has processed more than 100,000 transactions, has more than $1 billion worth of items in its database and expects to have 500,000 members signed up by the end of 2015, according to its founder, Daan Weddepohl.It all sounds promising. However, its future as a viable moneymaking business is far from certain. The road to profitability is littered with the carcasses of early start-ups that went belly-up in this niche: CrowdRent, Share Some Sugar, Bid & Borrow, Ecomodo, ThingLoop, OhSoWe and Hey Neighbor!, which started between 2007 and 2010, all folded. Can Peerby truly succeed where others have failed?Some experts claim it is all about timing: The failed start-ups hit the scene before mobile apps and the sharing economy trend really took off. Others blame poor business models.On the surface, it seems like a no-brainer. Who hasn\u2019t amassed a stockpile of household items, unwanted Christmas gifts and even clothing collecting dust in a basement or storage unit?Advocates are betting that people would willingly share those items if a neighbor asked for them. The 2008 recession and the ubiquity of the smartphone app seemed to trigger the \u201csharing economy\u201d revolution, said Rachel Botsman, author of \u201cWhat\u2019s Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption.\u201dPeople sought out creative ways to raise extra cash, and there was a shift toward renting and sharing items, rather than buying them. \u201cWe\u2019re shifting from an ownership society to an access society,\u201d with much of it happening through the smartphone, said Simon Rothman, a partner at Greylock Partners, whose firm was an early investor in such companies as Airbnb and Facebook.\u201cPeople are used to the idea of renting a car or getting a taxi ride just by using an app,\u201d and sharing household items is just an extension of that, said Michael Bj\u00f6rn, the report\u2019s author.Sure, there could be \u201ctrust\u201d issues: What happens if a friendly neighbor returns an item broken or doesn\u2019t return it at all? Or predators use the site to lure people to their homes?\u201cIf it isn\u2019t a trust issue to have a stranger spend the night in your house, then it won\u2019t be a trust issue to have a stranger rent your lawn mower,\u201d Mr. Rothman said, contrasting Peerby\u2019s business model with that of Airbnb.Even if one bad apple makes huge headlines, it is unlikely to kill the trend. \u201cThe Craigslist killer didn\u2019t actually kill Craigslist,\u201d noted Ms. Miura-Ko.Philip Markoff, a medical student, was charged with murder and assault in 2009 after targeting victims he found through ads on Craigslist. He killed himself in jail in 2010 while awaiting trial.Mr. Weddepohl of Peerby was born in Rotterdam in 1980 and developed a passion for computers and programming at a young age. \u201cI asked for a compiler for my 13th birthday,\u201d he said.He pored over books and joined online bulletin boards to hone his programming skills. His parents, both psychiatrists, encouraged his entrepreneurial spirit and interest in technology. But it was a fire that ignited the Peerby dream.In February 2009, fire ripped through Mr. Weddepohl\u2019s apartment building, forcing him and his girlfriend to scramble frantically to escape the thick black smoke rushing into his fourth-floor unit. Firefighters ultimately rescued the two. However, most of Mr. Weddepohl\u2019s belongings were destroyed by fire, water or smoke.He was devastated. But in the months after, Mr. Weddepohl watched in amazement as friends \u2014 and even strangers \u2014 offered furniture, tools and other items to help him get back on his feet. It was a revelation. \u201cI discovered that the people around me were so much more important than the stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople love to help other people out \u2014 we\u2019re wired to help others.\u201dWith 25,000 euros (about $28,700) in his pocket, which he inherited from his mother, he set out to build a website and app that could cash in on the sharing concept. He entered Amsterdam\u2019s The Founder Institute, which showed him the entrepreneurial ropes and introduced him to potential angel investors. In September 2012, Peerby was born. (The name combines \u201cpeer 2 peer\u201d with \u201cnearby.\u201d)Mr. Weddepohl analyzed the companies that had failed. \u201cI knew I had to do it in a different way,\u201d he said.He reversed the business model to focus on the renter rather than the supplier. Instead of posting long lists of classified ads, he focused on demand. He developed an algorithm of questions to create a network of potential suppliers among the site\u2019s registered members. When a member requests an item, a push notification is sent to nearby members based on the algorithm. The site took off, catching the attention of investors. He raised about $3 million from investors and from prize money from such entities as the Postcode Lottery Green Challenge, which is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.Herman Kienhuis, investment director at SanomaVentures, became the company\u2019s first and largest investor. \u201cPeerby is indeed exploring a market with limited proven models yet,\u201d he said. However, he was impressed with Mr. Weddepohl\u2019s team, business model and early results in Amsterdam.Another investor, Jon Bradford, managing director of Techstars\u2019 London office, admits his colleagues were a little nervous about investing in the niche, given the companies that failed in the past. \u201cI had a lot of criticism when I did the investment,\u201d Mr. Bradford said. \u201cBut Daan demonstrated that he was getting real traction from people not just talking about doing this, but actually doing it in Amsterdam.\u201dBuilding a successful active network is critically important, said Mr. Weddepohl. For this reason, Peerby didn\u2019t collect any revenue from transactions until this year. Recently, Peerby rolled out its \u201cPeerby Go\u201d model, which takes a commission on each transaction by offering insurance and delivery of the item. So far, the transition has been smooth, and the company says at least 60 percent of requesters are connected with a potential supplier within 30 minutes.Are investors concerned about Peerby\u2019s long-term moneymaking prospects? Mr. Bradford looks at it like Facebook, which initially made no money.If the business model works, then the money will follow, he said. \u201cWhen you can create engagement with a product, there are always ways to find money around it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investment Strategies Meant as Buffers to Volatility May Have Deepened It ", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wall Street, a cure is proving to be nearly as bad as the disease.Investment strategies that promise to insulate investors from risk are being seen as actually having contributed to the wild market swings in recent weeks.That seemingly upside-down outcome follows an explosion in investments aimed at avoiding pratfalls in the market, as opposed to making direct bets on a company, asset class or theme, and has become an investment rage in recent years.Their popularity boomed after global central banks pumped trillions of dollars into asset markets in a bid to spur economic growth.Analysts estimate that there is currently around $4 trillion tied up in these investment strategies. The fear is that as their returns continue to suffer, a wave of investor selling will start a wider market rout as managers struggle to unload high-yield, high-return bonds and equities alike.\u201cThe professional investment community is very worried about this,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research firm based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investment themes.Mr. Brigden contends that this latest flurry of sophisticated investment vehicles produced by Wall Street has created a false impression of robust investment returns with minimal downside risks.\u201cIt\u2019s this constant striving by the Street to satiate investor demand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you keep seeing these leveraged risk-parity funds and power E.T.Fs.\u201dRisk-parity funds, for example, have used leverage to reduce the exposure that portfolios have to stocks (which tend to be more volatile investments) by loading up on emerging-market and high-yield bonds. The idea is to give investors equitylike returns without the volatility and concentration risk that comes from making a big bet on stocks.Then there are exchange-traded funds, investment vehicles that track an index linked to an investment style (stocks, bonds or commodities to name a few), but trade on exchanges and promise the investor instant liquidity and transparency.Trading in E.T.F.s now accounts for close to 20 percent of total volume for stocks in the United States. While many investors in some of the larger funds, like the $169 billion SPDR fund, which tracks the Standard Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, are in it for the long term, there is a lot of short-term-oriented buying and selling that goes on within the fund.Over the last month, however, China\u2019s decision to let its currency weaken has set off a new wave of market turmoil. Bonds that were supposed to provide stability to investor portfolios have declined in value along with stocks.Making matters worse is that central banks in China and other Asian countries, which for years have been large buyers of United States Treasury securities, have started to sell out of these positions to defend their weakening currencies.With many of these bonds being core holdings in E.T.F. and risk-parity portfolios, the downward pressure on markets has been amplified.Last month, for example, Mr. Dalio\u2019s All Weather hedge fund was down 4 percent, quite a sharp decrease for a fund that aims to insulate investors from precisely these types of sharp market movements. For the year, All Weather has lost 4.1 percent.Of course, Mr. Dalio\u2019s risk-parity strategy has had a long record of success. Its All Weather fund has returned 8 percent since its inception in 1996. Last year, the fund was up 7.5 percent.Defenders of risk-parity investing say that these investment styles are not set in stone and that portfolios can be recalibrated on fairly short notice to make them less vulnerable.As for E.T.F.s, practitioners say that the funds to date have held their own despite some concerns over how portfolios were being valued during the very sharp market sell-off late last month.Some of the more exotic E.T.F.s that rely on leverage to juice investment returns could in some instances be the \u201ctail that wags the dog,\u201d said Steven Schoenfeld, an early pioneer in E.T.F. investing and founder of BlueStar Global Investors.\u201cBut the fundamental advantage of E.T.F.s \u2014 transparency, liquidity and variety \u2014 that remains,\u201d he said.What remains unclear, however, is how an investing community that has become accustomed to churning out safe and steady returns in a low interest rate, low volatility environment adapts to the new reality of wild market swings.Such sharp ups and downs in the market are expected to become more frequent as the time approaches for the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher.People might as well get used to them, says Nicolas Just, a portfolio manager at Natixis Asset Management, a French fund company that oversees $904 billion in assets.\u201cThese types of sudden market swings will become more and more frequent,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you have to be prepared for them at any time.\u201dTo survive such bouts of volatility, Mr. Just and his team of number-crunchers do not waste time trying to predict the growth rate of the Chinese economy or whether the Fed will go forward with its stated plan to raise rates sometime in the near future.Instead, they use a computer model that selects stocks from all over the world that do not shoot sharply up and down along with the broader stock market.If you pick a basket of stocks that are not volatile and not correlated with each other, Mr. Just argues, you can lock in safe and steady gains on the upside and suffer less than the broader market on the downside.To date, Mr. Just says that his portfolio has suffered less than the broader market. This year, Mr. Just\u2019s global minimum variance fund is up 7.8 percentOn a broader scale though, Mr. Brigden, the investment adviser, thinks that the shakeout of the last month will continue as investors come to realize that the days of low volatility investing are over.\u201cWe have had this long backdrop of suppressed volatility with equities doing well and an utter lack of bond risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWith central banks no longer buying bonds, that virtuous circle is becoming vicious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iowans Question G.O.P. Talk on Illegal Immigration", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUSCATINE, Iowa \u2014 Like many voters in Iowa, Ben Hoopes has been listening closely to all the tough talk about illegal immigration coming from the Republican presidential candidates who have crisscrossed his state every week.Mr. Hoopes, 33, a salesman and Republican voter in Muscatine, believes something needs to be done about unauthorized workers in Iowa, so he welcomes the attention to the issue. But he worries: Are the candidates telling the crowds only what they want to hear? Is a complicated issue becoming oversimplified?\u201cIt\u2019s just a show right now,\u201d Mr. Hoopes said, pausing from his job at a carpet store downtown. \u201cI heard today that Scott Walker might want to build a wall on the Canadian border. I didn\u2019t realize illegal Canadian immigration was such a big problem.\u201dPerhaps more than in many parts of this region, residents in Muscatine County, in eastern Iowa, have developed a nuanced view of the immigration issue, informed by time, proximity and experience. Well over a thousand miles from the Mexican border, Muscatine County\u2019s farms, factories and meat-processing plants have long been a draw for immigrants, causing the foreign-born population in the county to more than double since 1990.In more than two dozen interviews here this week, Republican voters said they agreed with candidates that illegal immigration might be costing too much in taxpayer money for schools, health care and welfare. But they also said that Latino immigrants can boost the economy by taking grueling jobs that many Americans do not want, such as detasseling corn and processing meat in factories throughout Iowa.\u201cI\u2019m as prejudiced as the day is long,\u201d said Chuck Coghill, who runs a sign company in the rural town of Blue Grass with his wife, Michelle. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad thing that all these illegal Mexicans are here.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut they\u2019re hard workers. They\u2019re doing jobs that lazy Americans won\u2019t do.\u201dSome voters said that many Latinos they know, regardless of immigration status, were as Iowan as anybody, having raised families and attended schools and churches in their communities.DeWayne M. Hopkins, the mayor of Muscatine, said that many migrant workers came to the area generations ago, in the 1950s, to work in the tomato fields, then stayed to raise their families. White people make up about 81 percent of the population in Muscatine County, compared with 89 percent statewide, and Latinos account for about 16 percent. Eight percent of county residents indicated that they were both white and Hispanic, according to census data.\u201cIf you see a young middle-school Latino lad on the street, he probably doesn\u2019t even speak Spanish,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said.Carolyn Lamp, the owner of a secondhand furniture store in the town of West Liberty, where more than half the residents are Latino, said she was impressed after hearing Mr. Jindal talk about immigration on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. But she also worried that he was taking a narrow view of the problem.\u201cHe\u2019s basically proposing to shut down the borders,\u201d she said, sitting in her shop on a humid afternoon this week. \u201cThat\u2019s fine to say. But I think there\u2019s a lot more to it than that. It\u2019s not a cut-and-dried issue.\u201d\u201cThe neighbors would call us tacos, and my mom would say, \u2018You just go back out and call them hamburgers,\u2019\u201d Ms. Avalos recalled. These days, \u201cthere\u2019s way more Hispanics than there ever has been,\u201d but she still overhears occasional racist remarks.Ms. Avalos said she has found the discussion of immigration policy from Mr. Trump frustrating, though she has voted Republican in the past.\u201cThere\u2019s just too much negativity,\u201d Ms. Avalos said. \u201cDonald Trump was on the news the other day and started in on it, and I just turned it off.\u201dAnthony Pestle, 23, a warehouse driver who was born in Iowa but whose grandparents came from Mexico, said he had read about the Republicans\u2019 immigration comments on social media, though he has not decided which party he will support in 2016. The way Republicans talk about Latinos bothered him, though.\u201cIf it keeps going this way,\u201d he said, \u201cit would probably make me lean toward the Democrats.\u201dPeople who live here say that in the span of two or three decades, their communities have been transformed. Beyond the proliferation of Mexican restaurants and supermarkets founded by immigrants and their descendants, some white-owned businesses have tried to cater to Latinos, tacking on \u201cSe Habla Espa\u00f1ol\u201d to their newspaper ads if they have even a single Spanish-speaking employee on staff. Schools have adopted dual-language programs in Spanish and English. Whites and Hispanics, once deeply distrustful of each other, have slowly become more integrated.\u201cIt\u2019s changed,\u201d said Michelle Coghill, who praised Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cradically different\u201d views. \u201cI think there is less prejudice now that more of the Hispanics have come into the job market, the schools, and everything.\u201dJeff Hunt, a manager of Neal\u2019s Vacuum and Sewing Center in downtown Muscatine, said that Latino immigrants have recently been joined by people from Liberia. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten more culturally diverse,\u201d he said, adding that he tries to make conversation in Spanish with Hispanic customers, even if it\u2019s only a simple \u201cHola.\u201d \u201cYou learn to work with everybody.\u201dBut resentments over the presence of unauthorized immigrants in Iowa still bubble to the surface. At the top of many white residents\u2019 concerns is a suspicion that some immigrants who came here illegally are committing crimes and using public schools, food stamps and welfare. Some residents in towns throughout Muscatine County have blamed Latinos when they see homes that have fallen into disrepair and front lawns that are not kept tidy.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.Some Iowans said that the responsibility should lie with employers to screen workers, reducing the incentive for people to come into the United States illegally.\u201cIt\u2019s twofold: you\u2019ve got people here who want to work and employers who want to employ them,\u201d said Cyndi Hammes from Wilton, a town of 2,800 people, as she left the post office on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cEmployers want to hire a lower-cost work force in order to cut their bottom line. They should be held accountable.\u201d\u201cThey talk a really good game, but what about the logistics of implementing it?\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a plan to carry it out. Actually, I think immigrants should be helped through the process of becoming legal citizens.\u201dKenny Lincoln, 71, a retired bricklayer and registered independent, said that if he had to vote today, he would vote for Mr. Trump. But he also said that he did not like the Republican oratory on immigration: he knew people who had entered the country illegally and he could not in good conscience favor sending them back to Mexico, as Mr. Trump and other Republicans have suggested.\u201cThere are some good people who are here from Mexico,\u201d Mr. Lincoln said. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame these people for coming over from there. I know an immigrant and he\u2019s not asking for a thing. They\u2019re integrated here. It\u2019s a small community and everybody gets along.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China to Announce Cap-and-Trade Program to Limit Emissions", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJoining forces on the issue even as they are bitterly divided on others, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi will spotlight the shared determination of the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest economies to forge a climate change accord in Paris in December that commits every country to curbing its emissions.Mr. Xi\u2019s pledge underscores China\u2019s intention to act quickly and upends what has long been a potent argument among Republicans against acting on climate change: that the United States\u2019 most powerful economic competitor has not done so. But it is not clear whether China will be able to enact and enforce a program that substantially limits emissions.China\u2019s economy depends heavily on cheap coal-fired electricity, and the country has a history of balking at outside reviews of its industries. China has also been plagued by major corruption cases, particularly among coal companies.But the agreement, which American officials said had been in the works since April, is China\u2019s first commitment to a specific plan to carry out what have so far been general ambitions.Domestic and external pressures have driven the Chinese government to take firmer action to curb emissions from fossil fuels, especially coal. Growing public anger about the noxious air that often envelops Beijing and many other Chinese cities has prompted the government to introduce restrictions on coal and other sources of smog, with the side benefit of reducing carbon dioxide pollution. The authorities also see economic benefits in reducing fossil fuel use. The cap-and-trade initiative builds on a deal that Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi reached last year in Beijing, where both set steep emissions-reduction targets as a precursor to the global climate accord. Mr. Obama, who has made climate change a signature issue of his presidency, announced the centerpiece of his plan this year. With his announcement on Friday, Mr. Xi will outline how he will halt the growth of China\u2019s emissions by 2030.\u201cIt increases our probability of succeeding, and it increases the likelihood that we will have a more robust agreement\u201d in Paris, one senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to preview the agreement.Lu Kang, the spokesman for the Chinese delegation during Mr. Xi\u2019s state visit, declined to confirm the climate initiative. He said only that the two presidents could \u201cmake further progress\u201d in demonstrating that they were committed to dealing with global warming.The climate deal will be a substantial, if rare, bright spot in a wide-ranging summit meeting that is expected to be dominated by potential sources of friction between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi. The two leaders began meeting on Thursday night with a two-and-a-half-hour working dinner at Blair House, across from the White House.The president plans to raise a number of contentious topics on Friday, White House aides said, including cyberattacks on American companies and government agencies, China\u2019s increasingly aggressive reclamation of islands and atolls in disputed areas of the South China Sea, and Mr. Xi\u2019s clampdown on dissidents and lawyers in China.Under a cap-and-trade system, a concept created by American economists, governments place a cap on the amount of carbon pollution that may be emitted annually. Companies can then buy and sell permits to pollute. Western economists have long backed the idea as a market-driven way to push industry to cleaner forms of energy, by making polluting energy more expensive.Mr. Xi will pledge to put in place a \u201cgreen dispatch\u201d program intended to create a price incentive for generating power from low-carbon sources, officials said. He will agree to help provide financing to poorer countries to help them pay for projects that reduce harmful emissions. And China, one of the world\u2019s largest financiers of infrastructure projects, will agree to \u201cstrictly limit\u201d the amount of public financing that goes toward high-carbon projects, another official said, in line with a 2013 commitment by the United States Treasury Department to cease public financing for new coal-fired power plants.In his first term, Mr. Obama tried to push a similar cap-and-trade program through Congress. But the measure died in the Senate, in part because lawmakers from both parties feared that a serious climate change policy could threaten economic competition with China. Now, however, China appears poised to enact the same climate change policy that Mr. Obama failed to move through Congress.China has been developing and carrying out smaller cap-and-trade programs for at least three years. In 2012, it started pilot programs in seven provinces, intended to serve as tests for a national program.Last week, Chinese officials met in Los Angeles with top environmental officials from California, which has enacted an aggressive cap-and-trade program. People who attended the talks said they were meant to pave the way for a possible linkage of the Chinese and California cap-and-trade systems.The Chinese announcement comes less than two months after Mr. Obama unveiled his signature climate change policy, a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations that would force power plants to curb carbon emissions. The rules could shut down hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired plants. They have drawn fire from Republicans and coal-state lawmakers, but international negotiators say Mr. Obama\u2019s regulations have helped break a long deadlock between the United States and China on climate change.Yet the two nations are still deeply divided on other issues. American and Chinese officials have been in negotiations over cyberattacks over the past several weeks, an area where they are bitterly at odds after several major intrusions believed to have emanated from China, including a hacking at the Office of Personnel Management that allowed the theft of 22 million security dossiers and 5.6 million fingerprints.They are working to strike a deal that would reopen a high-level dialogue over cyberissues and set minimum standards, such as a mutual commitment not to attack each other\u2019s critical infrastructure during peacetime. But they are not expected to reach any mutual understanding on cybertheft of intellectual property or personal information, one of the thorniest areas.Similarly, the two presidents are unlikely to come to terms on the South China Sea, where Chinese moves to build runways on artificial islands in disputed areas have raised American fears of a confrontation in a critically important waterway. The two presidents are expected to strike a deal on rules governing episodes involving Chinese and American military aircraft, building on past agreements that sought to avoid accidents or episodes that could escalate into confrontations.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sharp Drop in Currency Adds to Growing List of Woes in Brazil", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Since it was created in 1994, the Brazilian currency, the real, has been synonymous with the country\u2019s return to financial stability and its subsequent ascent as an economic power.But a stunning decline in the value of the currency \u2014 dropping to a record low against the dollar this week \u2014 is now the latest blow to Brazilian businesses struggling with recession.The weakness in the real is causing companies to delay plans and deals, and the market for initial public offerings has been effectively frozen.\u201cThe level of uncertainty and volatility we are facing is making pricing assets a significant challenge to anyone,\u201d said Daniel Wainstein, who heads operations in Brazil for the investment bank Greenhill & Company.Brazil is one of the emerging-market economies \u2014 Turkey, Mexico and South Africa are among the most prominent others \u2014 whose currencies have tumbled of late as global investors withdraw as fears of a broader slowdown in economic growth spread. The retreat has been spurred by a slide in commodity prices, a stronger dollar and by China\u2019s devaluation last month.\u201cThe Brazilian real is the most vulnerable link in the current emerging market crisis,\u201d said Bernd Berg, director of emerging market strategy at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.So far this year, the real has fallen 33 percent against the dollar.On Tuesday, it broke the psychologically important level of 4 reais to the dollar for the first time. After weakening to 4.1034 reais on Wednesday, the currency strengthened a bit on Thursday, when Alexandre Tombini, the president of Brazil\u2019s central bank, indicated that foreign reserves could be used to bolster the currency.Still, some are pessimistic about the currency\u2019s outlook.\u201cIn an extreme scenario with the political crisis getting out of control, I see the possibility that the BRL overshoots to a level of 5.00,\u201d Mr. Berg of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale wrote in an email on Thursday, referring to the currency by its abbreviation.Other estimates are not as high but also expect a deterioration. Credit Suisse has the real reaching 4.25 by the end of this year and 4.50 next year.\u201cUnfortunately, there is no obvious bottom in sight,\u201d said Alberto M. Ramos, co-head of the Latin America economic research team at Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe macro and political reality continue to deteriorate, and the currency is just reflecting that,\u201d he said.A falling real, in theory, should make companies and assets cheaper here for foreign buyers. And that may be a silver lining, as a number of struggling Brazilian companies seek to sell assets and businesses.But investment firms that made investments here early this year are already underwater because of the sharp slide in the value of the real. And it is difficult to evaluate the projected earnings of companies being considered for acquisition because of the uncertainty.Petrobras, which has an aggressive program between now and 2017 to sell nonessential assets, said this week that it was in \u201cfinal negotiations\u201d with Mitsui of Japan to sell natural gas distribution assets. So far this year, the number of deals, 501, is only slightly fewer than the 505 announced over the same period last year, according to Dealogic. In terms of dollar volume, however, Brazil has had $27.71 billion in mergers and acquisitions this year, down from $41.97 billion over the same period last year. It is the country\u2019s lowest volume at this point since 2005, when there were $6.5 billion in deals. Its peak was 2010, when there were $122.16 billion in deals over the same period.For foreign investors, Brazil still has factors in its favor, including strong institutions and an independent judiciary.Some companies, like Fibria and Suzano in the pulp and paper sector, both of whose revenues are in dollars, have performed well.In addition, a boom in entrepreneurship continues, according to Edson Rigonatti, founding partner at Astella Investimentos, a respected early-stage start-up investor.\u201cThe quality of deal-flow is improving significantly,\u201d he said.The current difficulties started early in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s first term, as global commodity prices began to fall and economic growth decreased from the second term of her predecessor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.The continued aggressive use of state public banks and interventionist economic policies, combined with a failure to tackle structural reforms like the country\u2019s costly pension system, drove up government spending. The government also upset investors by continually offering more rosy economic forecasts than what materialized. Then there are the woes affecting Petrobras, currently involved in a widening corruptions scandal. The overall result was deteriorating fiscal accounts, and so Ms. Rousseff is now trying to enact fiscal austerity measures.The situation worsened this month when S.&P. stripped Brazil of its investment grade rating. Many investors are worried that a second ratings agency may follow suit. Fitch visited the country\u2019s capital, Brasilia, this week and met with the finance minister, Joaquim Levy, and his team.\u201cI think that this crisis is going to take longer than the other ones,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Olympio Pereira, the chief executive of Credit Suisse in Brazil, said in a recent interview, adding that Brazil continues to improve every 10 years.\u201cI think that the big frustration for all of us is that even though we\u2019re better every 10 years than we were 10 years before, we could have been miles ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Boehner\u2019s October Miracle?", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialJohn Boehner\u2019s looming departure from the House leadership stems from his frustration at leading his Republican caucus, particularly its implacable obstructionists who refused to be led. Farewell tributes have highlighted Mr. Boehner\u2019s folksy decency and bought into his self-description as the grown-up in a legislative playpen. By this account, he was undone by Tea Party toddlers who were endlessly willing to be stupid or destructive to get their way or make a point.Intimidated by the awesome power of no, Mr. Boehner gave up.What would have happened if reform had passed? It was the best chance in a generation to modernize a collapsed immigration system, to put the country\u2019s future on a sounder footing, to finally resolve the status of 11 million people whose potential as taxpaying citizens is bottled up by fear and hopelessness. It would have been a boon for the economy, and for Mr. Boehner\u2019s party. It would have averted Mr. Obama\u2019s controversial executive actions on immigration, which he took as a last resort in the face of congressional abdication.It would have made the country a better place, a place more welcoming and sensible about immigrants, and truer to its values of assimilation and integration.Prodding dead legislation to life in a period of great fractiousness \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s moment has not passed \u2014 with only a few weeks to act, is a lot to ask for.

{"Headline": "Extreme Weather and Food Shocks", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRecent events highlight concerns about the risks to global food security posed by changing patterns of extreme weather affecting the world\u2019s \u201cbreadbasket\u201d regions such as the American Midwest, South America\u2019s southern cone, the Black Sea and the Yangtze River valley. In 2012, the worst drought to hit the U.S. Midwest in half a century sent international maize and soybean prices to record levels. In 2011, wheat prices nearly doubled after an unprecedented heat wave devastated the Russian harvest. The global food price crisis of 2007-8 had its roots in a run of poor harvests in previous years.Global food security largely depends on the production of a few \u201cmega-crops\u201d in the breadbasket regions: maize, wheat, rice and soybeans. On the whole, the system works well. International trade provides a global market for these specialized production centers, reducing the cost of food for billions of people by allowing agriculture to flourish where it can be most efficient. Trade also allows countries to meet unforeseen production shortfalls through imports, as Britain did in the summer of 2013 after floods spoiled the winter wheat harvest. But when extreme weather ruins the harvest in a breadbasket region, that\u2019s not just a problem in the country affected, it\u2019s a problem for all importing countries.Of course the risk to the world\u2019s food security doesn\u2019t arise simply from bouts of bad weather. Weather\u2019s impact can be compounded by the actions of governments and markets. Governments can make things much worse when, for example, they try to shore up domestic food supplies by banning or limiting agricultural exports, further pushing up international prices. The 2007-8 crisis saw over 30 governments impose export restrictions in a spiral of rising prices and collapsing market confidence; the 2011 wheat spike was amplified when Russia turned off exports.Likewise it is becoming clear that severe weather shocks rippling through the food system can ignite wider instability. During the 2007-8 crisis, protests erupted in 61 countries and turned violent in 23. In the wake of the Russian heat wave, the price of bread was one of several grievances behind the Arab Spring. Once shocks to the food system spill over into other areas, they can cascade through economic and political systems with sometimes devastating consequences.Amid these pressures, the global food system is coming under increasing strain, as highlighted in a recent report that we wrote in conjunction with other British and American experts for the U.K.-led Global Food Security program. Rising incomes and changing dietary preferences mean demand for food is growing faster than cereal yields. Water scarcity and soil depletion present challenges for agriculture, which faces sharper competition for resources from urbanization and energy production. A precarious supply-and-demand balance means the system is easily unbalanced.The stability of the global food system faces risks from the increasingly frequent extreme weather that is being driven by climate change. For example, in the United States there were more than four times more weather events causing damage in excess of $1 billion (in 2011 prices) in 2007-11 than in 1980-85. Drought is a particularly powerful driver of global food shocks. Two episodes stand out: in 1988-9, when maize and soybean were seriously affected in the U.S. Midwest, and in 2002-3, when rice and wheat were hit in Eastern Europe and Western Asia.Were these two events to happen in the same year \u2014 a multiple breadbasket failure \u2014 it would result in the loss of between 5 and 10 percent of the production of these major crops, more than enough to supply the basic calorie needs of the United States for a year. Until recently, such a calamity would have been expected every 100 to 200 years, but this number is shrinking rapidly due to climate change. An initial analysis of recent data suggests that the risk of a 1-in-100-year event during the second half of the last century is likely to increase to 1-in-30 years by 2040 \u2014 and perhaps even 1-in-15 years in the decades after 2050.A multiple failure in the world\u2019s breadbaskets in the same year is, in our view, a plausible worst-case scenario for today. In fact, by the end of the century such an event may occur every few years unless we reduce emissions overall, and we change what we grow, and how we grow it, to adapt to the changing climate. Such a crisis would almost certainly be compounded by export restrictions, panic buying and hoarding, driving food prices to new heights.This would be particularly serious for the food-importing countries of the developing world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. The shock would come at the economic level, in the form of inflation, balance-of-payment difficulties and budgetary pressures, and it would strike at the human level in increasing poverty; in the developed economies, consumers would feel the pinch as grocery prices climbed. Of even more concern, however, would be the spread of the crisis from food markets to political systems in the world\u2019s geopolitical hotspots; fragile countries could be destabilized, especially the major grain importers of the Middle East and North Africa.Given these predictions and warnings, what needs to be done?Agriculture must of course be adapted to a dramatically changing climate: We need to reverse declines in yield growth. This requires significantly more research and development investment to increase maximum attainable yields and to expand agricultural extension services. Additional investment is needed to reduce the environmental impact of farming and to bolster its ability to withstand climate change.In addition, vulnerable countries can shore up their food security through policy measures to insulate their populations from market shocks. Such efforts include holding strategic stocks, raising national production to reduce import dependency and improve self-sufficiency, and \u201cbuying forward\u201d to lock in future import prices.The greatest challenge will be to make the global food system far more resilient. Rules limiting the use of export barriers will become vital if a functional trading system is to be maintained. Biofuel policies will also need to be reformed by making mandates flexible, so that biofuel use falls when food prices rise, or by limiting the use of staple food crops in biofuel production when food demand outstrips supply.Recent multilateral efforts to improve the quality and availability of key market data, such as food stock levels, can help governments anticipate crises and avoid panic. But improved climate and economic modeling is needed to understand the risks and assess how best to manage them. Armed with this knowledge, governments, international organizations and businesses could engage in contingency planning, set up early-warning systems, and coordinate the management of strategic stocks.International food shocks exacerbated by extreme weather events can affect millions of people in countries around the world. Taking smart and practical steps to ease the impact of our changing climate on our food supplies is vital if we are to ride out the droughts and storms that will impact our food prices.Tim Benton is the academic director of the Global Security Program and a professor of population ecology at the University of Leeds.

Before President Rafael Correa\u2019s election in 2007, Ecuador had eight presidents in just 10 years. Mr. Correa has brought political stability and greater equity to our society. Incidentally, there were not \u201cthousands\u201d but hundreds of indigenous peoples who protested in opposition to government policies last month. This is not strange, but rather a sign of our democracy, where citizens are free to openly voice their opinions.The privately owned newspaper Mr. Pallares worked for is itself a well-known and open critic of the president\u2019s policies. Despite believing its sale and ownership were not transparent, Mr. Pallares apparently had no moral issue continuing to work for this newspaper, only reporting his concerns after he was dismissed for repeatedly violating company rules regarding personal social media. These violations were found by his employer to compromise his journalistic independence and the editorial integrity of the newspaper and were cause for dismissal. Mr. Pallares\u2019s efforts to now scapegoat Ecuador\u2019s government for his personal and professional situation overflow with vitriol.Francisco Borja Cevallos Washington The writer is the Ecuadorean ambassador to the United States.The Maldives respects the lawRe \u201cA Maldives leader unjustly jailed\u201d (Sept. 12): Your editorial addressing the current legal dispute in the Maldives misinterprets the fundamentals of the legal process against former President Mohamed Nasheed as well as wider political developments within our country. Mr. Nasheed is serving a sentence because he broke the law by ordering the arrest of a judge for releasing one of his political critics from jail. That he was responsible for ordering the army to detain the judge Mr. Nasheed confirmed in an opinion article in your newspaper on Feb. 10, 2012. This makes the case not unjust, as you suggest, but based on fact.The editorial\u2019s assertion that Mr. Nasheed\u2019s \u201cchances of successfully appealing his conviction may well depend on international pressure\u201d is not the case. The former president had the opportunity to legally appeal his conviction but chose not to. In this regard no obstruction was put in his way by the government or the courts. In all countries, there should be a respect for the letter of the law and the process of the law. In this instance former President Nasheed and his legal advisers have respected neither.Dunya Maumoon, Mal\u00e9, MaldivesThe writer is the foreign affairs minister of the Maldives.Letting art heal war\u2019s woundsRe \u201cCalifornia dreaming\u201d (Aug. 21): I was deeply touched by the eyewitness account Roger Cohen quoted from his uncle of the horrific destruction of Italy\u2019s Monte Cassino monastery, executed in large part by American bombs. Irreplaceable paintings, sculpture, books and manuscripts \u2014 detailing all that is good in human nature by countless great artists and writers \u2014 went up in flames that winter of 1944. Nearly one third of the paintings of Francesco de Mura (1696-1782), a brilliant Neapolitan Baroque artist, lay in ashes. To atone for this loss, four American museums are mounting a historic exhibition, \u201cIn the Light of Naples: The Art of Francesco de Mura\u201d to be on view from September 2016 to November 2017. Many surviving oil sketches of the magnificent works lost at Monte Cassino are included. Organized by the Cornell Fine Arts Museum at Rollins College, with loans from major Italian museums, the exhibition travels to the Chazen Museum of Art at the University of Wisconsin; Vassar College\u2019s Frances Loeb Art Center; and Notre Dame\u2019s Snite Museum of Art. In the 1950s, Monte Cassino was meticulously rebuilt. As guest curator of the De Mura exhibition, I hope our effort, in some small measure, will help heal this terrible cultural wound.Arthur R. Blumenthal Winter Park, Fla. The writer is a director emeritus and guest curator of the Cornell Fine Arts Museum at Rollins College.Advertisement"}

Not only did stocks steadily climb \u2014 giving investors far better returns than they could get from their bank accounts \u2014 the ride up was smooth.Then August broke the calm.Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, tumbled 6.3 percent in August, finishing the month on Monday with a decline of 16.69 points, or 0.8 percent, for the day. It was the worst monthly performance for the benchmark in over three years. The decline wiped more than $1 trillion off the value of stocks.Crucially, the turbulence interrupted an unusually long period of tranquillity for investors.On five trading days in August, the S.&P. 500 moved up or down by more than 2 percent. Moves of that magnitude have been relatively rare in recent years.\u201cWe were in a bull market in complacency,\u201d said Douglas Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management, a hedge fund firm. \u201cI think that the spike in volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the last 10 days is the precursor to further spikes.\u201dIn recent days, investors sold heavily as they grappled with new and old concerns.On Aug. 24, the Dow Jones industrial average was down over 1,000 points at one point during the day, before recovering somewhat. For the month, the Dow was down 6.6 percent, after losing 114.98 points, or 0.7 percent, on Monday.The main source of worry continues to be China\u2019s $10 trillion economy, which appears to be slowing more than analysts had originally thought. The slowdown has raised fears that the country will now buy fewer goods and services from other countries, weighing on a global economy that has consistently struggled to gain traction since the financial crisis of 2008.China\u2019s leaders surprised financial markets with a surprise devaluation of the country\u2019s currency on Aug. 11. And their efforts to shore up the stock market with interventions seemed to erode, rather than build, confidence.But over the weekend, other Fed officials at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., indicated that an increase could still take place in September. If a raise were to happen, it would most likely be announced after Fed meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.Still, as August ended, some analysts found reasons to believe that the markets may have found a bottom.\u201cI think we got the summer flu,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States market strategist at RBC Capital Markets, \u201cand this is behind us.\u201dOne potentially bullish indicator is the price of oil. The benchmark New York crude contract has soared 26 percent from its low last week, to $48.32 a barrel on Monday. Oil had slumped this year, suggesting that demand for the commodity was falling as economies around the world slowed.The latest bounce indicates that investors are betting that demand for oil will not weaken further.\u201cThis is at least a sign that we\u2019re not having an economic collapse,\u201d Mr. Golub said.Stocks are no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for when a market declines by more than 10 percent from its highs. The S.&P. 500 is now 7.5 percent below its all-time nominal high, reached in May. At its low last week, it was more than 12 percent lower.At the end of trading on Monday, the Dow was 9.7 percent below its peak. The technology-heavy Nasdaq is now down 8.5 percent from its high. Unlike the other two market measures, however, it is up since the start of the year, by 0.9 percent.Worries about the Fed and China came at a time when valuations on United States stocks \u2014 the yardsticks investors apply to stocks to decide if they are worth buying \u2014 were starting to look expensive. A big debate on Wall Street now is whether corporate earnings are strong enough to make stocks resilient if faced with further shocks from overseas and uncertainty about monetary policy.Some analysts still see enough strength to sustain the bull market for United States stocks that started back in 2009.\u201cWhat we do is fall back on our process and our models,\u201d said Mark H. Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS\u2019s wealth management arm. \u201cThe crucial factor for us is the economic data \u2014 and the U.S. economy is doing well.\u201dAccording to Mr. Golub, United States corporations have been consistently squeezing out higher profits each year. Companies have achieved this, he says, by increasing revenue, cutting costs and buying back stock, which increases earnings on a per-share basis, a number that investors carefully track. \u201cIt\u2019s more sustainable than people think,\u201d Mr. Golub said.But some analysts remain cautious. In a world characterized by low economic growth, corporate earnings are vulnerable. Stock valuations, the analysts say, may need to move down to reflect the risk that profits growth may wane.\u201cThe fundamentals around the world are still wobbly,\u201d Mr. Kass, the hedge fund manager, said. \u201cAnd valuations are still elevated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watches: Made in China", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosHONG KONG \u2014 Despite the recent turmoil in the Chinese economy, the sheer scale of the country\u2019s rapidly expanding wealthy elite and its vast, aspirational middle class bode well for recent Chinese entrants in the luxury watch industry \u2014 many of which already produce, or plan to produce, their own movements and complications. Now all they have to do is build their brands.\u201cEven in the country where they\u2019re produced, Chinese watches aren\u2019t well known,\u201d said Ariel Adams, the founder of A Blog to Watch. \u201cThere seems to be a consensus that there\u2019s an uphill challenge.\u201dHistorically, the Chinese have always been interested in timepieces \u2014 from the water-driven clock tower invented in 1088, said to be the first true mechanical clock, to the European models made by Jesuit missionaries in the 17th century as luxurious gifts to the emperors. From the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949 to the introduction of economic reforms in the late 1970s, Communist disdain for luxury goods made simply owning an expensive watch a potentially punishable offense. Manufacturing high-end watches was simply out of the question. But as a new, wealthy class emerged, domestic watchmakers also began to see opportunities at the high end of the market. Today, the company\u2019s high-end models, like the Playing Dragon and Phoenix in platinum, run from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of renminbi, Mr. Miao said. And its market is growing. \u201cClients with the purchasing power to afford high-end watches have already expanded slowly from successful people in every sector to the middle class,\u201d Mr. Miao said. \u201cEveryone is paying more attention to high-end watches, and now clients are coming from different classes and sectors.\u201dThere are more than 200 watch brands available in China, about 60 of which are imported, according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. And, the market research company Euromonitor says the country\u2019s 2014 watch purchases totaled around 65 billion renminbi, or about $10.2 billion. Swiss watchmakers are still ahead of their Chinese counterparts in both technology and branding, but there are two niche markets that Mr. Adams said offered good prospects for Chinese luxury manufacturers. One market is watch aficionados around the world who are interested in watch technology but at a low price. Some Chinese-made watches, Mr. Adams said, are as much as 80 or 90 percent less expensive than comparable Swiss offerings.And the other, he continued, are Chinese residents and ethnic Chinese in other countries who seek Chinese-made items with a distinctive cultural identity. \u201cWhat I\u2019d really like to see is more home-grown Chinese design and flavor in the watches, which I\u2019m starting to see,\u201d Mr. Adams said.Mi Changhong, its general manager and chief designer, a native of Liaoning Province in northeast China, founded the company in 1996. Its sales last year exceeded 30 million renminbi, or $4.7 million, he said.Since 2009, the company has been producing Mr. Mi\u2019s original designs, including Mythos, a gold and white jade tourbillon watch. It sold in 2011 for 2.7 million euros (about $3.06 million at current exchange rates) at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco.\u201cChinese watchmakers need to innovate, and one way to do that is by making watches that draw upon our intangible heritage,\u201d Mr. Mi said. Traditional Chinese decorative materials are the focus of Longio\u2019s Mi Time Art, a subsidiary brand. For example, the images on the dials in one collection were created by heating and processing fine wheat straw fibers to yield an array of 45 rustic hues. Other models are decorated with eggshell inlays or lacquer made from tree sap. Its founder and designer, Gary Ching, a former wedding photographer, said the company\u2019s goal was to provide a personalized luxury watch for everyone. \u201cWe can go from design to the client\u2019s wrist in one week,\u201d he said. Mr. Ching\u2019s designs often go heavy on gold and gemstones, which are supplied by Anpassa\u2019s jewelry subsidiary. Its tourbillon watches start at 21,000 Hong Kong dollars, or about $2,700, and can reach 10 times that price, depending on the whims of the client, most of whom are ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. One of Mr. Ching\u2019s more eye-catching designs is the Dragon and Phoenix watch, part of Anpassa\u2019s Happy Wedding series. The timepiece, which has an almost solid-gold tourbillon movement, is mounted on a heavy gold bracelet and has a cover featuring the mythological dragon and phoenix, symbolizing the groom and bride, respectively. Its skeletonized dial includes the double happiness character for marital bliss, and can include the couple\u2019s names at 11 o\u2019clock and 1 o\u2019clock. The model is priced at $5,000.Since its founding in 2014, Anpassa has sold more than 250 watches, Mr. Ching said, adding that it plans to open an in-house movement factory in Hong Kong next year. The company produces only tourbillon watches with in-house movements, some of which reflect Chinese cultural influences while others have classic Western designs. Mr. Shum said Memorigin used raw materials from Germany, Swiss machinery and dials from Taiwan, with models generally priced at $2,500 to $5,000. One of the company\u2019s marketing advantages have been regular tie-ins with Hollywood studios. The company has produced Batman and Superman tourbillon watches for Warner Bros. and Transformers watches for Hasbro. This year, Memorigin teamed up with Marvel to produce Avengers watches, including the Iron Man watch, which features a tourbillon in the superhero\u2019s chest and sells for $6,300.\u201cMost Hongkongers between the ages of 30 and 50 like superheroes, because we grew up with many of them, and they represent justice,\u201d Mr. Shum said. \u201cAnd because they always win\u201dSuperpowers could be helpful for watch companies in coming months. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a Chinese company or Western company, the high-end watch market is not so great at the moment,\u201d said Mr. Mi, of Longio. \u201cThe most important thing right now is to persevere.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Car Scandal Shoves Berlin Off High Ground", "Date": "2015-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From GermanyBERLIN \u2014 As Germany has emerged as the dominant actor in Europe, it has lectured Greece and other debtor nations on the virtues of thrift and lately wagged its finger at countries that balk at receiving a share of refugees from the killing fields of Syria. Its right to lead, based on a narrative of self-sacrifice and obedience to rules, was generally acknowledged.Further, the timing puts Germany in an awkward spot ahead of the global climate conference in Paris in December, where it had hoped to hold out its transformation as an industrial power reliant on a lower-carbon energy system as a model to the world.In the immediate aftermath, Germany\u2019s leaders scrambled to distance themselves from the scandal and to mitigate the damage to the auto industry, which accounts for one in seven German jobs.\u201cThe damage that a few people have caused for the firm and its workers is huge,\u201d said Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and economy minister, as he toured the annual auto show in Frankfurt on Wednesday. But, \u201cwe must take care that doesn\u2019t unleash a whole debate about the auto industry in Germany or the German economy,\u201d he continued.In fact, it may be too late for that. Germany is very closely aligned with its auto industry. Indeed, the state of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is headquartered in Wolfsburg, owns about 20 percent of the company. Any governor of that state is deeply involved in the company\u2019s affairs.\u201cThe saying is, when Wolfsburg has a sniffle, the whole state gets sick,\u201d said Rebecca Harms, a prominent deputy for the Greens in the European Parliament, who grew up in Lower Saxony. Now \u201cits reputation is really damaged. This is a catastrophe, not just for Lower Saxony but for a global enterprise\u201d with 600,000 employees, she said.So far, there is no evidence the government knew about the deception, though it was aware there could be deviations between emissions on the road and in the laboratory. But the matter is not just about jobs, market share or corporate and bureaucratic reputations.The scandal captures Germany at a moment when it has been trying to hold on to values it always saw as defining, but that have become increasingly difficult to maintain as it becomes drawn into the messy problems of Europe and the world.The Volkswagen blow came after months in which Germany seemed to go out of its way to bolster devotion to rules and order by imposing austerity and other measures on Greece, as a condition for a third bailout from its financial crisis. Berlin insisted that European partners stick to what it said were the rules of the euro currency union, that there could be no transfer of debt from one member nation to the 18 others in the eurozone.Yet no sooner was it gaining a reputation in Greece and in other southern European nations as, at best, a strict task master and, at worst, a heartless bully, than Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel, were transformed.The chairman of Lufthansa, Germanwings\u2019 parent company, initially insisted that the company had done everything right, and that there was no way that it could have foreseen the suicidal tendencies of the co-pilot.But after it became clear that the pilot had been given a leave during training to deal with psychological issues, Lufthansa\u2019s chairman, Carsten Spohr, backed down and apologized. \u201cThat this happened precisely to us, we are very sorry for,\u201d he said.And Ms. Merkel\u2019s hugs and assurances that Germany would accommodate all those worthy of asylum proved a step too far. With systems taxed and chaos advancing on its borders, Germany reimposed border checks this month, further scrambling Europe\u2019s policies on asylum and free movement.Perhaps even more harmful in the long run, the Volkswagen scandal also comes at a time when Germany is trying to set an example for the rest of the world on lowering carbon emissions. Its ambitious policy of shifting away from carbon-based fuels to alternative energy like wind and solar has driven up costs for German business and consumers. Yet Germany has stayed its course.As the immediate shock has subsided, Germans have sought a way to explain the Volkswagen chapter.\u201cThe biggest problem of VW is that this giant concern has become ungovernable,\u201d S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the German newspaper, said Wednesday. \u201cVW is led centrally from Wolfsburg. Just a few people have a say \u2014 everyone else just receives orders. Doubts, or even resistance, are unwanted.\u201dDaniela Schwarzer, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund, said the lesson was that \u201cwhile Germany wants a rules-driven approach to almost anything, politics happens.\u201dMs. Harms, who has campaigned for years on environmental issues, said that Volkswagen could easily have complied with the standards imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States. \u201cWhy they decided instead to bet on manipulation\u201d is incomprehensible, she said.But the very fact that Germany\u2019s leaders in politics and industry felt compelled to try to control the damage indicated the depth of the wound to the nation\u2019s pride and standing.\u201cTrust is part of the lust for innovation in a country,\u201d said Volker Kauder, a prominent member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. Its loss, he said, \u201ccould really cause us economic problems.\u201d Fiddling with software or sensors, he went on, \u201cis not the kind of innovation we need.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the Serbian Foreign Ministry was apparently unmoved, writing in a protest note to the Croatian Embassy in Belgrade that the actions against holders of Serbian travel documents were unprecedented \u201cin the civilized world.\u201d\u201cIn their discriminatory character, they can only be compared with measures taken in the past, during the Fascist independent Croatia,\u201d the letter said, invoking the racial policies of the Ustashe, the Fascist movement that ruled Croatia during World War II.Serbia said on Thursday that at midnight, the police had begun to enforce a ban on Croatian goods and cargo vehicles entering the country in what Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said was retaliation against Croatia for closing its borders, a measure Serbia said immediately affected its economy.The Serbian Chamber of Commerce told the broadcaster B92 that Serbian companies were considering a lawsuit against the Croatian government for economic losses incurred by the closing.Mr. Stefanovic said Croatia had not responded to Serbia\u2019s request to open its borders, and he accused the country of engaging in a form of \u201ceconomic aggression.\u201d\u201cSerbia has been forced to take these measures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not satisfied or happy; we are only protecting our country.\u201dThe Serbian response prompted a stern rebuke from Croatia, which accused Belgrade of aggravating tensions.\u201cWe had planned to open the border today, but now we have to react to this,\u201d Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic of Croatia said on Wednesday, referring to Serbia\u2019s actions.\u201cThere will be no war or violence, everything will be calm, but this is not normal behavior\u201d by Serbia, he said, according to Reuters.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.Serbia and Croatia are accusing each other of mismanaging the migration crisis, and diplomatic relations have slid to one of the lowest points since the aftermath of the bloody Balkan wars of the 1990s.The crisis was bound to pose an economic challenge in the Balkan region, where countries with already strained welfare states and high unemployment are not equipped to deal with the sudden influx of people.Now it threatens to revive old enmities. Historical wounds remain in Serbia and Croatia, which were both part of Yugoslavia before it was violently ripped apart during the wars.People in both countries still bitterly recall the 1991-95 war, which erupted after Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands of Croats and Serbs died, and hundreds of thousands fled their homes. After the war, thousands of Serbian refugees left Croatia, and many sold their homes.The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.Now, however, the migration crisis threatens to undermine progress.Jelena Milic, director of the Center for Euro-Atlantic Studies, a policy research institute in Belgrade, said unresolved bilateral issues would now almost certainly become more complicated by the migration crisis. Such issues include the property rights of Serbs expelled from Croatia and the rights of the Serbian minority to use the Cyrillic alphabet in Croatia. Cooperation between war crimes prosecutors in the two countries may become more problematic, she said. Tanya Staric, a political commentator from Slovenia, said that unhealed wounds from recent wars and lingering territorial disputes were not enough to explain why countries in the region were erecting barriers. Rather, she said, the countries were simply losing control because their capacities were so strained.\u201cCroatia started off nicely with the refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were welcomed and nicely received, with a humanitarian approach, food and water on offer.\u201d\u201cBut they ran out of food quickly and the reception centers remained empty because these people want to go on, to Austria, Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cIt quickly turned ugly.\u201dA reporting credit was omitted from an earlier version of this article.

{"Headline": "Health Insurers Seeking Mergers Play Down Antitrust Concerns", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The chief executives of two of the nation\u2019s largest health insurance companies told skeptical senators on Tuesday that consumers would benefit if the federal government approved their plans to acquire two other big insurers.But Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group, expressed doubts about the deals, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, objected to the mergers, saying they could cause harm by reducing competition.\u201cI am deeply concerned about these mergers because of the potential impact on competition and the concentration of power in fewer hands,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, who as the attorney general of Connecticut joined a sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft in 1998.In testimony before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee, Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, and Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, said the transactions would improve care and cut costs for consumers.Mr. Bertolini said his company\u2019s proposed merger with Humana \u201cwill enhance competition\u201d by giving consumers a strong alternative to Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which have the largest share of the market in many states.Aetna and Humana offer insurance on the public insurance exchanges in 24 states, but overlap in only eight, Mr. Bertolini said. And in those eight states, he said, other insurers also do business, so \u201cthere will be no material change to the competitiveness of the commercial health insurance market as a result of our transaction.\u201dIn a recent report, the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group, said, \u201cIf the deal between Aetna and Humana proceeds, the consolidated firm would provide coverage to more than one-quarter \u2014 26 percent \u2014 of all Medicare Advantage enrollees nationwide, making it the leading Medicare Advantage insurer.\u201dBut Mr. Bertolini analyzed the deal in different terms. \u201cThe combined company will have 4.4 million Medicare members, representing only 8 percent of the 54 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare,\u201d he said.The private Medicare Advantage plans compete not only with one another but also against the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program, through which two-thirds of beneficiaries still receive care, Mr. Bertolini said.One of the more remarkable moments of the hearing came when Mr. Blumenthal criticized the mergers, even though Aetna, which was founded in Hartford in the 1850s and still has its headquarters there, is a pillar of the state\u2019s economy.Mr. Blumenthal said he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by evidence suggesting that consumers and health care providers would not benefit from the insurance company mergers. He rejected arguments by Mr. Bertolini and Mr. Swedish that new insurance companies were entering the market and creating new competition.In fact, Mr. Blumenthal said, \u201cthere are powerful barriers to entry\u201d for new insurers.After the hearing, Mr. Blumenthal said that Aetna was \u201ca part of Connecticut\u2019s economic DNA,\u201d a source of jobs and corporate philanthropy. But, he said, \u201cthe antitrust analysis is separate and apart\u201d from the company\u2019s role as an employer in Connecticut. He said the merger could adversely affect consumers in Connecticut and other states.Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who called the hearing as chairman of the antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, said he was determined to find out why \u201cthe insurance industry is rapidly consolidating.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, said she wanted to know \u201cwhether the claims of consumer benefits, corporate efficiency and lower costs are realistic.\u201dMr. Swedish said his company\u2019s merger with Cigna would \u201cuniquely benefit consumers\u201d by expanding access to care through a more extensive network of doctors and hospitals.He said that the combined company would face \u201crobust competition\u201d in many geographic markets and product lines, including health insurance for individuals and small and midsize employers, and administrative services for big businesses that insure themselves.\u201cThere are strong indicators, to us, that these mergers could create too much concentration, in too many markets, and cause too much harm to consumer choice,\u201d Mr. Slover said. For example, he said, a dominant insurer could force doctors and hospitals to cut costs so much that the quality of care might suffer.The Justice Department is reviewing the deals to see if they would violate the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which generally prohibits mergers and acquisitions if the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition.\u201d\u201cAt this point,\u201d Mr. Slover said, \u201cwe have a hard time seeing how these mergers could pass muster under the Clayton Act. And the stakes for consumers are high.\u201dMoreover, Professor Dafny said, \u201cthere is no research showing that larger insurers are likelier to innovate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, Student Borrowers Don\u2019t Need to Worry About Loan Market Turmoil", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDegrees of DebtIn short, no. But a fuller answer requires a brief history of how Wall Street has an impact on student loans.Until 2010, banks provided capital for federal student loans, through the Federal Family Education Loan (F.F.E.L.) program. The government set the terms and guaranteed the loans, while banks put up the dollars.After students received their money, banks frequently packaged similar loans and sold them in a secondary market, a process known as securitization. There is a similar secondary market for mortgages; these became big news during the economic meltdown in 2007 that preceded the Great Recession.Investors happily snapped up student loans in the secondary market, in part because they were guaranteed by the federal government. If a student borrower defaulted, Uncle Sam was on the hook to pay off the loan.Securitization is generally considered good for the economy because it gives banks ready cash, what economists call liquidity, to make more loans. There are potential downsides, however: In both the mortgage and student-loan markets, some struggling borrowers have had difficulty determining who owns their loan and has authority to modify its terms.In 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ousted banks from the federal student loan program. This legislation was, in part, a response to a liquidity crisis in the student-loan market. As a consequence of the global financial crisis, capital dried up and lenders lacked cash to make new student loans. Students in several states faced delays and uncertainty as lenders struggled to find capital. The federal government finally stepped in with an injection of liquidity to get the market moving again.Since then, the Department of Education has provided all federal student loans through the Direct Loan program. No loans are being made through the old system, though billions in outstanding loans are still being paid off \u2014 and traded on the secondary market.This is what has led to speculation about another liquidity crisis: If lenders can\u2019t sell the old loans, they will lack capital to make new loans. So won\u2019t students suffer?The catch is that the private banks trying to sell their loans no longer make federal loans to students. The Direct Loan program makes all new loans, and they are funded (like all federal programs) by tax revenues and Treasury bonds. Tumult in the secondary market has zero impact on the availability of federal student loans.There is a relatively small market squeezed by low demand for securitized student loans. Private banks still market a product called student loans, but they differ in important ways from federal student loans. Federal student loans are given out based on need, rather than ability to pay. Private student loans require that a borrower have a strong credit record or a co-signer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Dive as Worries About Asia Reverberate", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeep the seatbelts on.Stock markets around the world tumbled Tuesday, dashing hopes that financial markets would calm down after two weeks of turbulence.Investors appear to be growing more nervous about the strength of the global economy. China released a weak report on manufacturing on Tuesday, and an influential international policy maker sounded a downbeat note on the outlook for Asian economies. In early trading on Wednesday, Chinese stocks again fell sharply, leaving the Shanghai composite index 40 percent lower than its recent peak. The price of contracts for the future delivery of oil, an indicator of the course of economic activity, also continued to drop in Asian trading.In the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index slid 58.33 points, or 2.96 percent on Tuesday. The benchmark is now 10.2 percent below its nominal high, putting it back in a correction \u2014 the Wall Street term for a decline of more than 10 percent from a peak level. The S.&P. 500 index is still 2.48 percent above the low it closed at last week.But the underlying ugliness of the action \u2014 only three stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose \u2014 suggested that the market could have further to drop.The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular market barometer, lost 469.68 points, or 2.84 percent, on Tuesday, to close at 16,058.35. The index is more than 12 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent on the day, and is down 11 percent from its recent high.Investors are now scouring the horizon for events that drive the markets up or down.Looming at the end of this week is the release of the United States jobs numbers. If the government figures on Friday show that employment growth has remained strong, investors may be encouraged that developments overseas will not do too much harm to the American economy. On the other hand, a robust jobs number may also lead investors to conclude that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month, rather than wait longer.\u201cThe jobs numbers on Friday will be really important,\u201d said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. \u201cIt will determine Fed policy one way or another.\u201d If the Fed decides to raise rates this month, it will most likely announce the move after monetary policy meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.The prospect of a September rise in interest rates has worried many economists and investors. In particular, they assert that the low level of inflation in the United States is a sign that the economy is still quite vulnerable to a slowdown.\u201cGiven the low wage and price inflation data seen to date, and increased uncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary-policy makers to closely monitor and depend on incoming data,\u201d he said.Even if the Fed decides not to increase rates this month, further problems in China and elsewhere could make investors reluctant to jump back into the stock market.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Both outcomes, however, could affect countries with economies that rely heavily on exports. As a result, such countries may decide to further devalue their currencies to regain competitiveness with China. The high stakes of such rivalries were made clear on Tuesday when South Korea reported export figures for August that were well below expectations. In contrast with past periods of turbulence, this one has not so far spurred a fierce rally in the 10-year Treasury note, a safe-haven investment. Its yield fell slightly to 2.16 percent on Tuesday from 2.21 percent on Monday. Adding to the nervousness on Tuesday, the price of oil fell after a strong rally in recent days. The benchmark crude contract in New York declined $3.79, or 7.7 percent, to $45.41. Over time, a lower price might signal less demand for oil as economies slow.The Vix index, a measure of volatility in the S.&P. 500 that is often called Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, jumped 10 percent, but it is still well below last week\u2019s high.The major European indexes all closed the day 2 to 3 percent lower. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 3 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 2.4 percent. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Race Relations Out at Republican Debates", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was both fascinating and disappointing that race relations in America were not directly addressed during the marathon Wednesday night Republican debate, the second round, this time at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.This is particularly baffling at this moment in the nation\u2019s history, as issues of race consume the news and water-cooler conversations.\u201cAmericans rate black-white relations much more negatively today than they have at any point in the past 15 years. Currently, 47 percent say relations between blacks and whites are \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018somewhat good,\u2019 a steep decline from 70 percent in 2013.\u201dAnd yet, nothing specific at the debates. Sure, they hinted at the issue of race, broadly speaking, but a hint is not a hit.Senator Rand Paul spoke about the disparate treatment received by children of \u201ckids who had privilege\u201d and \u201cpoor kids in our inner cities\u201d when it comes to drug arrests, prosecutions and jail time. Paul said:\u201cThere is at least one prominent example on the stage of someone who says they smoked pot in high school, and yet the people going to \u2014 to jail for this are poor people, often African-Americans and often Hispanics, and yet the rich kids who use drugs aren\u2019t.\u201dPaul was referring to Jeb Bush, who responded, \u201cHe was talking about me.\u201d Bush continued:\u201cSo, 40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it. I\u2019m sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My mom\u2019s not happy that I just did.\u201dThe comment drew laughter. But Paul\u2019s point still stood. This unequal treatment is not a laughing matter. Bush even went on to turn away from the racial disparity that negatively affects young black and brown people to a drug issue that particularly affects young white people in New Hampshire: heroin.Ben Carson said, \u201cI see us allowing people to divide us, when in fact our strength is in our unity.\u201d This idea of him as the addresser of division, particularly racial division, and the antidote to it has become a bedrock of his candidacy. Just this week, the Carson campaign sent out a fund-raising letter that included \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d as one of what he called the \u201cphrases of the purveyors of division, who seek every day to pit one group of Americans against the other.\u201dDuring the undercard debate, the doomed Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal repeated his catchphrase \u201cimmigration without assimilation is invasion.\u201dJindal spoke of his parents immigrating to the United States: \u201cThey didn\u2019t come here to be hyphenated Americans.\u201dThere was Rick Santorum\u2019s misguided invocation of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in defense of Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who has refused on religious grounds to issue licenses to same-sex couples.And finally, when asked during the main debate what woman each candidate would like to see on the $10 bill, Rosa Parks was a favorite among those who actually chose a historical figure instead of making a platitudinous nod to a family member.Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz chose Parks, although Cruz said that he would put her on the $20 bill, not the $10. He wants to keep Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill. Rubio, the first to mention Parks, didn\u2019t even specify her contribution to the racial history, going instead for the more oblique \u201can everyday American that changed the course of history.\u201dEven the Republican front-runner chose Parks. (No, I\u2019m still not using his name because I\u2019m still smarting over the obscenely disproportionate and undeserved media coverage he has received.)Jeb Bush, however, did not choose Parks. Inexplicably, he did not even choose an American. He chose Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister. Seriously, Jeb? You couldn\u2019t think of a single American woman worthy of going on an American currency?That\u2019s just sloppy.There is no excuse for the omission of race relations from this debate. None. They should have been asked directly and should have been given time to answer sufficiently.As it stood, even after 15 Republican candidates filled the stage, race remained the largest elephant in the room.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Backs Spending Measure to Avert Shutdown", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a brief trading of angry recriminations, Senate Republicans and Democrats voted Monday to advance a temporary spending measure that would avert a shutdown of the federal government on Wednesday night but also signals a battle in the weeks ahead.The measure, which still requires final approval by the Senate and by the House, where some rank-and-file Republicans had pledged to block it, would keep agencies operating roughly at last year\u2019s spending levels through Dec. 11.The bill must be adopted before the fiscal year ends at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday or many federal agencies will be forced to shut down on Thursday.Mr. McConnell said that Senate Democrats had stopped all 12 regular appropriations bills \u201cin the hopes of provoking a crisis Democrats might exploit to grow the I.R.S. and the D.C. bureaucracy.\u201d Mr. McConnell expressed particular outrage that Democrats had blocked the military spending measure that would pay for troops serving overseas.\u201cThis leaves the funding legislation before us as the only viable way forward in the short term,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t represent my first, second, third, or 23rd choice when it comes to funding the government, but it will keep the government open through the fall.\u201d\u201cThe measure is really shortsighted,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cDec. 11 \u2014 that means within the coming weeks we will again be negotiating with the Republicans to avoid another shutdown, we\u2019ll also have to find a way to pay our bills.\u201dMr. Reid warned about the unpredictability in the Republican-controlled House.\u201cLast week the Republican House showed that it can depose a speaker,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they elect some sensible leaders. I\u2019m deeply concerned. Come Nov. 1, we have no idea what House Republicans will do. This is after their election to replace Congressman Boehner. They want to go off the cliff or do they want to wreck the global economy? Maybe both.\u201dEven as the Republican and Democratic leaders traded barbs, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, accused Mr. McConnell and Mr. Reid of using identical tactics to prevent a full and fair debate. Mr. Cruz said the \u201cmajority leader has taken a page out of Harry Reid\u2019s playbook.\u201d In a speech on the Senate floor after the vote, he raged against the temporary spending measure, saying it included financing not only for Planned Parenthood but also for the Affordable Care Act and \u201call of President Obama\u2019s priorities.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound clean to me,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, referring to a \u201cclean\u201d bill lacking extraneous provisions. \u201cThat actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill.\u201d The temporary measure would finance the government at a rate roughly equivalent to $1.017 trillion annually, complying with discretionary spending limits for 2016 that were previously agreed to by Republicans and Democrats. It includes several adjustments for new or emergency programs, including $700 million for fighting wildfires and financing to ease a backlog of disability claims by veterans. The measure also includes provisions to address increased demand for federal loans to private businesses through the Small Business Administration, and to prevent any delay in the launch of the Joint Polar Satellite, a project of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labour Party\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn May Help Tories in Next British Elections", "Date": "2015-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisJeremy Corbyn, the new leader of the opposition Labour Party, has stopped wearing T-shirts in public and now favors blue shirts and darker jackets. But even with his more prime ministerial attire, it is difficult to imagine a British electorate that just handed Conservatives a parliamentary majority turning to a party that has lurched so far to the left.Instead, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s resounding victory in his party\u2019s leadership election makes it highly likely that Britain\u2019s next prime minister will be the Conservative politician George Osborne, 44, the chancellor of the Exchequer and second in command to Prime Minister David Cameron.Mr. Cameron, having just won another five-year term, has confirmed that he will not run for a third term and intends to step down before this one ends. In the unsentimental Conservative Party, that means the maneuvering to succeed him has already begun, with a change expected sometime after Britain votes in a referendum on whether to remain in the European Union.That vote must happen before the end of 2017, but may take place sooner. With the British economy going well, and assuming that the Conservatives do not self-destruct over internal disputes on European Union membership, Mr. Osborne is considered the person most likely to lead the party into the 2020 elections.His main rival, Mayor Boris Johnson of London, is engaging and popular with the public, but less so with his fellow members of Parliament. And with the Labour Party now leaving the center of politics wide open, it may be much easier for Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne to move Tories closer to that aspirational center, arguing that they have created jobs and pared down the budget deficit, and are a safer set of hands than an \u201cold-style\u201d Labour socialist. Mr. Corbyn, 66, is consistent and sincere, a professed man of the \u201chard left\u201d who believes that the Labour Party must return to its roots in the working class and fight inequality in all its forms. He is a sharp critic of American foreign policy and of Israel; he wants Britain to abandon its nuclear deterrent and has favored quitting NATO. But as UKIP shows, strong minority parties do not produce many legislators in Britain\u2019s electoral system, and the Labour Party was already, under Ed Miliband, considered too left-wing and too unreliable to get the seats in southern England that it needed for victory, even if propped up by the Scottish National Party. Those concerns will be only more entrenched now.Mr. Corbyn is also going to have a very difficult time keeping Labour together. Already, the two leadership candidates of the center, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, have said they will not serve in his shadow cabinet because of strong policy differences. Mr. Corbyn, who has made his career since he was elected in 1983 by voting against his party\u2019s orders, is also opposed by most of Labour\u2019s 232 members of Parliament. Even to get the 35 nominations he needed to run in this leadership election was a struggle, and some of those who nominated him did so simply to broaden the debate, with no idea that Mr. Corbyn would end up their leader. Mr. Corbyn needs to appoint a shadow cabinet \u2014 members of Parliament who would be ministers if the party were in power and speak for the party on all issues \u2014 of 26 legislators, with another 60 or more shadow junior ministers. It is not clear how easy that is going to be.For the moment, talk of any breakaway party is muted \u2014 after all, when the Social Democrats broke away from Labour in 1981, they were well-known moderates with government experience who were considered the new center of British politics. In the end, the Social Democrats effectively dissolved just seven years later, joining with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats. And the Liberal Democrats were just trounced in May for the sin of sharing power in a coalition government with the Conservatives.Still, once elected, Mr. Corbyn may be hard to dislodge before the next general elections. And he may be very useful in poking holes in Conservative positions and at skewering Mr. Cameron during weekly prime minister\u2019s questions in Parliament, on issues ranging from refugees and foreign policy to social inequality.The Conservatives are hardly immune. Their party is deeply divided over Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, and Mr. Cameron has a majority of only 12 seats, which he must manage carefully. If the Conservative Party does split over Europe, it is not inconceivable to imagine a new party of the center.And today, that is no more inconceivable than the prospect of Mr. Corbyn becoming Labour leader was even three months ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Farmers Demand Aid as Produce Prices Sag", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Thousands of farmers snarled traffic and pelted the police with eggs on Monday in a protest to demand emergency aid to offset falling prices for milk, pork and other agricultural products.Dutch police in full-body riot gear reinforced their Belgian counterparts, who closed off entrances to the conference site with barbed-wire barricades. Farmers responded by sounding their tractor horns and building a vast bonfire that billowed acrid black smoke.One reason for the protests is a disruption in Europe\u2019s produce markets, which are oversupplied with milk in particular. Many dairy farmers blamed a decision by the European Union earlier this year to end a quota system that had helped buoy prices.But geopolitical and macroeconomic factors have also had an impact. Europe has imposed sanctions on broad sections of the Russian economy in response to President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Mr. Putin has responded by banning imports of European produce, curbing demand for cheese and meat.A falloff in demand from China, as its economy slows, is also a factor in the declining prices of European agricultural products.At the same time, hot and dry conditions in certain European countries have reduced crop yields and raised the prices farmers pay for animal fodder.\u201cThis situation is not our fault, yet it is our sector that is being hit the most,\u201d Albert Jan Maat, president of COPA, the main European farmers federation, said in a statement. \u201cPrices are below production costs in many countries and farmers\u2019 incomes half the average level, forcing some out of business.\u201dIn the case of the dairy sector, strong increases in production by farmers in countries like the United States and New Zealand have contributed to oversupply.On Monday, dairy farmers stopped short of calling for a reinstatement of production quotas across Europe, but insisted that some limits had to be put in place again. The quota system had helped support prices but was ended in March as part of efforts to make the European Union\u2019s farm subsidy program, which costs \u20ac50 billion a year, more responsive to market forces.\u201cIf the politicians refuse to reduce the E.U. volume, it is the duty of us all to take to the streets and force political changes,\u201d Romuald Schaber, president of the European Milk Board, which represents about 100,000 milk producers, said in a statement. Mr. Schaber said farmers who voluntarily cut production should receive bonus payments.Some protesters said incomes in rural communities across the European Union were being badly squeezed.\u201cI\u2019m young,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment Lambillotte, 25, who drove his tractor from Goz\u00e9e, Belgium, where he has 450 beef and milk cattle. \u201cI just took over my parents\u2019 farm. But by the end of the year, there\u2019s almost no money left in the accounts because of these falling prices.\u201dMr. Lambillotte, who was driving his tractor up Rue Belliard, one of the main thoroughfares that crisscross Brussels, said Russia\u2019s import ban \u201cmay have aggravated the situation, but it\u2019s not the main problem.\u201dArnaud Sauvage, 27, who drove his tractor from Filot, Belgium, where his mother and father run a farm with 90 cows, said there was \u201cso much milk on the market that we are selling for less than it costs.\u201dMr. Sauvage was driving his tractor in a noisy convoy through Square Ambiorix, a well-heeled Brussels neighborhood dotted with grand townhouses built at the turn of the last century.Agriculture ministers gathered on Monday to consider proposals by the European Commission to relieve the situation. The goal was to get \u201cupward pressure on price,\u201d Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s minister of agriculture, told reporters. But there were no expectations of price increases until next year, he added.Jyrki Katainen, a vice president of the European Commission, said the plan would help farmers with cash-flow difficulties by providing new funding to national governments and by making advance payments from existing subsidy programs. He also said the plan was intended to halt price decreases by temporarily removing from the market quantities of products like skimmed milk, butter, cheese and pork, and putting them into storage.Mr. Katainen said he would increase the amount of money set aside to promote European farm products in China and other export markets.Advertisement"}

When the deal was made public, Ms. Massenet was given the title of executive chairwoman of the new group, overseeing editorial content and advertising strategy, while Federico Marchetti, founder and chief executive of Yoox, was made the new group\u2019s chief executive.But in recent months, speculation emerged that Ms. Massenet was unhappy at the valuation given Net-a-Porter by Richemont before the deal. There was also word of disagreements between Ms. Massenet and Mr. Marchetti, who made it clear in subsequent interviews and statements to the media that he was taking control of the new group.\u201cI do not think they ever got along very well,\u201d said Mr. Solca, who noted that Ms. Massenet was not on the conference call announcing the merger. \u201cIt always seemed like a matter of time.\u201dNeither Ms. Massenet nor representatives of Net-a-Porter returned calls seeking comment on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lesbos Turns From Vacation Island to \u2018Main Point of Entry\u2019 for Migrants", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMYTILENE, Greece \u2014 On this vacation island ringed by the clear Aegean Sea, it is now the tourists who are the rarity.Arabic has surpassed Greek as the dominant language on the streets of Mytilene, the main port town. The beaches are festooned with orange life jackets and deflated rafts abandoned by migrants who are choosing to take their first steps into Europe here, in ever-increasing numbers.As the authorities elsewhere in Europe are shutting their borders and struggling to deal with the migration crisis, Lesbos has been overwhelmed by an increasing flow of migrants who have arrived by boat from Turkey.\u201cThis is the main point of entry for Europe,\u201d said Antonios Sofiadelis, of the Hellenic Coast Guard on Lesbos.After sunrise on Wednesday, Safa Salem, a refugee from eastern Syria, stepped from a rubber raft stuffed with dozens of passengers and stood in Europe for the first time.\u201cI know I am in Greece, but I have no idea where,\u201d he said, smiling.The prime role of Lesbos as a migration route is largely an accident of geography. Turkey is so close that migrants have to cross as few as six miles of water to reach the island. And nearby Turkish shores are sparsely inhabited, making them ideal places for human traffickers to gather migrants and launch them in flimsy inflatable rafts.While other Greek islands, like Kos and Khios, are also close to Turkey, the waters around Lesbos are relatively calm, making the crossing easier. And the maritime authorities in Turkey have cracked down on human smuggling farther south, according to Syrian smugglers in Turkey.That crackdown has not been as strict near Lesbos, where arrivals have skyrocketed to more than 50,000 last month from 737 in January, Mr. Sofiadelis said.Between 2,000 and 3,500 migrants now reach the island daily, riding on about 100 inflatable rafts. That is too many for the island\u2019s 180 coast guard officers to handle, and many now work double shifts and carry out rescue operations when rafts pop or motors malfunction, stranding the migrants at sea.For most migrants, who are coming from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, Lesbos is a mere way station on the way to mainland Greece and farther afield in Europe, although the island\u2019s isolation has at times hindered that journey.Earlier this month, a rise in arrivals and slow registrations led to a backup of more than 20,000 migrants on the island, nearly a quarter of its native population. The migrants protested the lack of services, blocking traffic and clashing with the police.The Greek government has since streamlined registration and hired extra passenger ferries to get migrants to the mainland, said Djamal Zamzoum of the United Nations refugee agency on Lesbos.Sitting in his office on this city\u2019s U-shaped harbor, Spyros Galinos, the mayor of Lesbos, said he felt the island had been occupied by migrants.Smoking both an e-cigarette and a real one, he called their arrival a humanitarian crisis but said he considered it unethical to view it in economic terms. Still, he said, the migrants had taxed municipal resources, causing 1 million euros, or about $1.1 million, in damages to infrastructure and exhausting the municipality\u2019s yearly sanitation budget four months early.The impact of the migrants is clear around town.During the day, the streets are full of migrants speaking a variety of languages, lugging large backpacks and charging their phones for a fee at impromptu charging stations in cafes. Long lines form outside shops selling cheap gyros and in front of ferry company offices.Since most of the new arrivals are Muslims, the bars are suffering, while vendors of cigarettes and SIM cards are doing swift business. One recent morning, the central offices of two major cellphone companies ran out of SIM cards after selling them to migrants using smartphones to plot journeys across Europe.At night, those with money return to hotels that are booked to capacity, while others bed down on sheets of cardboard on the sidewalk that rings the harbor.The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.Many Lesbos residents sympathize with the migrants even while suffering from the lack of tourism income that their presence has caused. Many tour operators have canceled stops in Lesbos, adding to the economy\u2019s already dire state.Ignatios Psouhlos, 52, a Lesbos native who waits tables at a waterfront fish restaurant, said that business this summer had been about 40 percent lower than the year before, hurting many locals.It angered him to see the arrivals clashing with the police, he said, and the presence of so many Muslims made him nervous.\u201cI see their women are covered, and then they want to come here and have rights,\u201d he said.But each day brings more.Mr. Salem, the Syrian who scrambled ashore on Wednesday, said he had fled his hometown after it was taken over by the jihadists of the Islamic State. He then worked in construction in Turkey for nine months, earning poor wages. So he decided to leave and paid a smuggler to get him on a raft to Lesbos.His goal was to get to Austria, where he said he had friends.\u201cI have friends in America, too, but that is hard in a raft,\u201d he said.Others come with more resources. At an upscale restaurant in town, a group of young Syrian men drank cola and played cards, killing time before the ferry that was to take them to Athens that night. One of them, who gave only his first name, Fayez, said he had earned his dentistry degree in the Syrian city of Aleppo last year and had begun working but then decided to flee because the city was so dangerous.He hoped to get to France and continue his career.\u201cIt is a journey, a kind of tourism, but we do it illegally,\u201d he said with a laugh.Amid the migrants on the street outside passed two tourists in shorts and sandals, riding bicycles. They had flown in from London and were meeting friends to go sailing but wanted to explore town first, said one, Marek Mroziewicz, an architect.He said seeing the migrants in Lesbos affected him in a way that seeing them on television hadn\u2019t.\u201cThe sad part is that there is no solution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they are still coming.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

The mantra became \u201cdo more with less\u201d until a series of mishaps led to a rethinking of priorities.NASA is not simply a factory cranking out space missions. It is the nerve center for the country\u2019s nonmilitary and nonmedical research efforts. Its shuttle and Spacelab programs, for instance, worked closely with university research teams across the country to conduct space-based research across virtually every scientific and engineering discipline.A whole host of independent contractors (as I had been) are also dependent upon NASA for a range of services that only it can provide, like project management and funding, setting performance standards and so on.Constantly starving NASA to meet short-term budgeting goals is bad for our economy over the long haul because it is crippling our lead in scientific and engineering research. That is no way to run an agency that has been the pride of America for all these years.PAUL CROUSERChatham, Ill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama\u2019s Speech to the United Nations General Assembly 2015", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe following speech was delivered by President Obama at the United Nations General Assembly as transcribed and released by the White House.Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations, it is worth reflecting on what, together, the members of this body have helped to achieve.Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in this Assembly to prevent a third world war \u2014 by forging alliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people instead of any foreign power; and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.That is the work of seven decades. That is the ideal that this body, at its best, has pursued. Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of these ideals. Over seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims. But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent.It is this international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. It is this collective endeavor that\u2019s brought about diplomatic cooperation between the world\u2019s major powers, and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty. It is these international principles that helped constrain bigger countries from imposing our will on smaller ones, and advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent.This progress is real. It can be documented in lives saved, and agreements forged, and diseases conquered, and in mouths fed. And yet, we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete; that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.Today, we see the collapse of strongmen and fragile states breeding conflict, and driving innocent men, women and children across borders on an epic scale. Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum. Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation, or suppress dissent, or radicalize our youth. Global capital flows have powered growth and investment, but also increased risk of contagion, weakened the bargaining power of workers, and accelerated inequality.How should we respond to these trends? There are those who argue that the ideals enshrined in the U.N. charter are unachievable or out of date \u2014 a legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own. Effectively, they argue for a return to the rules that applied for most of human history and that pre-date this institution: the belief that power is a zero-sum game; that might makes right; that strong states must impose their will on weaker ones; that the rights of individuals don\u2019t matter; and that in a time of rapid change, order must be imposed by force.On this basis, we see some major powers assert themselves in ways that contravene international law. We see an erosion of the democratic principles and human rights that are fundamental to this institution\u2019s mission; information is strictly controlled, the space for civil society restricted. We\u2019re told that such retrenchment is required to beat back disorder; that it\u2019s the only way to stamp out terrorism, or prevent foreign meddling. In accordance with this logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar al-Assad, who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent children, because the alternative is surely worse.The increasing skepticism of our international order can also be found in the most advanced democracies. We see greater polarization, more frequent gridlock; movements on the far right, and sometimes the left, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates to other nations, calling for the building of walls to keep out immigrants. Most ominously, we see the fears of ordinary people being exploited through appeals to sectarianism, or tribalism, or racism, or anti-Semitism; appeals to a glorious past before the body politic was infected by those who look different, or worship God differently; a politics of us versus them.The United States is not immune from this. Even as our economy is growing and our troops have largely returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our debates about America\u2019s role in the world a notion of strength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, perceived adversaries, a rising China, or a resurgent Russia; a revolutionary Iran, or an Islam that is incompatible with peace. We see an argument made that the only strength that matters for the United States is bellicose words and shows of military force; that cooperation and diplomacy will not work.As President of the United States, I am mindful of the dangers that we face; they cross my desk every morning. I lead the strongest military that the world has ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my country or our allies, unilaterally and by force where necessary.But I stand before you today believing in my core that we, the nations of the world, cannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. We cannot look backwards. We live in an integrated world \u2014 one in which we all have a stake in each other\u2019s success. We cannot turn those forces of integration. No nation in this Assembly can insulate itself from the threat of terrorism, or the risk of financial contagion; the flow of migrants, or the danger of a warming planet. The disorder we see is not driven solely by competition between nations or any single ideology. And if we cannot work together more effectively, we will all suffer the consequences. That is true for the United States, as well.No matter how powerful our military, how strong our economy, we understand the United States cannot solve the world\u2019s problems alone. In Iraq, the United States learned the hard lesson that even hundreds of thousands of brave, effective troops, trillions of dollars from our Treasury, cannot by itself impose stability on a foreign land. Unless we work with other nations under the mantle of international norms and principles and law that offer legitimacy to our efforts, we will not succeed. And unless we work together to defeat the ideas that drive different communities in a country like Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can impose will be temporary.Just as force alone cannot impose order internationally, I believe in my core that repression cannot forge the social cohesion for nations to succeed. The history of the last two decades proves that in today\u2019s world, dictatorships are unstable. The strongmen of today become the spark of revolution tomorrow. You can jail your opponents, but you can\u2019t imprison ideas. You can try to control access to information, but you cannot turn a lie into truth. It is not a conspiracy of U.S.-backed NGOs that expose corruption and raise the expectations of people around the globe; it\u2019s technology, social media, and the irreducible desire of people everywhere to make their own choices about how they are governed.Indeed, I believe that in today\u2019s world, the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory. Lasting prosperity does not come solely from the ability to access and extract raw materials. The strength of nations depends on the success of their people \u2014 their knowledge, their innovation, their imagination, their creativity, their drive, their opportunity \u2014 and that, in turn, depends upon individual rights and good governance and personal security. Internal repression and foreign aggression are both symptoms of the failure to provide this foundation.A politics and solidarity that depend on demonizing others, that draws on religious sectarianism or narrow tribalism or jingoism may at times look like strength in the moment, but over time its weakness will be exposed. And history tells us that the dark forces unleashed by this type of politics surely makes all of us less secure. Our world has been there before. We gain nothing from going back.Instead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit of our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time. We must give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest fears. This institution was founded because men and women who came before us had the foresight to know that our nations are more secure when we uphold basic laws and basic norms, and pursue a path of cooperation over conflict. And strong nations, above all, have a responsibility to uphold this international order.Let me give you a concrete example. After I took office, I made clear that one of the principal achievements of this body \u2014 the nuclear non-proliferation regime \u2014 was endangered by Iran\u2019s violation of the NPT. On that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions on the Iranian government, and many nations joined us to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and agreements mean something.But we also understood that the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran. Our objective was to test whether Iran could change course, accept constraints, and allow the world to verify that its nuclear program will be peaceful. For two years, the United States and our partners \u2014 including Russia, including China \u2014 stuck together in complex negotiations. The result is a lasting, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, while allowing it to access peaceful energy. And if this deal is fully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons is strengthened, a potential war is averted, our world is safer. That is the strength of the international system when it works the way it should.That same fidelity to international order guides our responses to other challenges around the world. Consider Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and further aggression in eastern Ukraine. America has few economic interests in Ukraine. We recognize the deep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine. But we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated. If that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it could happen to any nation gathered here today. That\u2019s the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners impose on Russia. It\u2019s not a desire to return to a Cold War.Now, within Russia, state-controlled media may describe these events as an example of a resurgent Russia \u2014 a view shared, by the way, by a number of U.S. politicians and commentators who have always been deeply skeptical of Russia, and seem to be convinced a new Cold War is, in fact, upon us. And yet, look at the results. The Ukrainian people are more interested than ever in aligning with Europe instead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital flight, a contracting economy, a fallen ruble, and the emigration of more educated Russians.Imagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in true diplomacy, and worked with Ukraine and the international community to ensure its interests were protected. That would be better for Ukraine, but also better for Russia, and better for the world \u2014 which is why we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in a way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to determine its future and control its territory. Not because we want to isolate Russia \u2014 we don\u2019t \u2014 but because we want a strong Russia that\u2019s invested in working with us to strengthen the international system as a whole.Similarly, in the South China Sea, the United States makes no claim on territory there. We don\u2019t adjudicate claims. But like every nation gathered here, we have an interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce, and in resolving disputes through international law, not the law of force. So we will defend these principles, while encouraging China and other claimants to resolve their differences peacefully.I say this, recognizing that diplomacy is hard; that the outcomes are sometimes unsatisfying; that it\u2019s rarely politically popular. But I believe that leaders of large nations, in particular, have an obligation to take these risks \u2014 precisely because we are strong enough to protect our interests if, and when, diplomacy fails.I also believe that to move forward in this new era, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge when what you\u2019re doing is not working. For 50 years, the United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to improve the lives of the Cuban people. We changed that. We continue to have differences with the Cuban government. We will continue to stand up for human rights. But we address these issues through diplomatic relations, and increased commerce, and people-to-people ties. As these contacts yield progress, I\u2019m confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore. (Applause.) Change won\u2019t come overnight to Cuba, but I\u2019m confident that openness, not coercion, will support the reforms and better the life the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that Cuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with other nations.Now, if it\u2019s in the interest of major powers to uphold international standards, it is even more true for the rest of the community of nations. Look around the world. From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, the facts shows that nations succeed when they pursue an inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders, and work cooperatively with countries beyond their borders.That path is now available to a nation like Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests. These efforts may appear to give Iran leverage in disputes with neighbors, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region, and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce. The Iranian people have a proud history, and are filled with extraordinary potential. But chanting \u201cDeath to America\u201d does not create jobs, or make Iran more secure. If Iran chose a different path, that would be good for the security of the region, good for the Iranian people, and good for the world.Of course, around the globe, we will continue to be confronted with nations who reject these lessons of history, places where civil strife, border disputes, and sectarian wars bring about terrorist enclaves and humanitarian disasters. Where order has completely broken down, we must act, but we will be stronger when we act together.In such efforts, the United States will always do our part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the past \u2014 not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example of Libya, where we joined an international coalition under a U.N. mandate to prevent a slaughter. Even as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the reign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind. We\u2019re grateful to the United Nations for its efforts to forge a unity government. We will help any legitimate Libyan government as it works to bring the country together. But we also have to recognize that we must work more effectively in the future, as an international community, to build capacity for states that are in distress, before they collapse.And that\u2019s why we should celebrate the fact that later today the United States will join with more than 50 countries to enlist new capabilities \u2014 infantry, intelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of thousands of troops \u2014 to strengthen United Nations peacekeeping. (Applause.) These new capabilities can prevent mass killing, and ensure that peace agreements are more than words on paper. But we have to do it together. Together, we must strengthen our collective capacity to establish security where order has broken down, and to support those who seek a just and lasting peace.Nowhere is our commitment to international order more tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters tens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a matter of one nation\u2019s internal affairs \u2014 it breeds human suffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all. Likewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, slaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that\u2019s not a single nation\u2019s national security problem \u2014 that is an assault on all humanity.I\u2019ve said before and I will repeat: There is no room for accommodating an apocalyptic cult like ISIL, and the United States makes no apologies for using our military, as part of a broad coalition, to go after them. We do so with a determination to ensure that there will never be a safe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes. And we have demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless pursuit of al Qaeda, we will not be outlasted by extremists.But while military power is necessary, it is not sufficient to resolve the situation in Syria. Lasting stability can only take hold when the people of Syria forge an agreement to live together peacefully. The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.Let\u2019s remember how this started. Assad reacted to peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing that, in turn, created the environment for the current strife. And so Assad and his allies cannot simply pacify the broad majority of a population who have been brutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate bombing. Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and ultimately stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Assad and to a new leader, and an inclusive government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to rebuild.We know that ISIL \u2014 which emerged out of the chaos of Iraq and Syria \u2014 depends on perpetual war to survive. But we also know that they gain adherents because of a poisonous ideology. So part of our job, together, is to work to reject such extremism that infects too many of our young people. Part of that effort must be a continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort Islam to preach intolerance and promote violence, and it must also a rejection by non-Muslims of the ignorance that equates Islam with terror. (Applause.)This work will take time. There are no easy answers to Syria. And there are no simple answers to the changes that are taking place in much of the Middle East and North Africa. But so many families need help right now; they don\u2019t have time. And that\u2019s why the United States is increasing the number of refugees who we welcome within our borders. That\u2019s why we will continue to be the largest donor of assistance to support those refugees. And today we are launching new efforts to ensure that our people and our businesses, our universities and our NGOs can help as well \u2014 because in the faces of suffering families, our nation of immigrants sees ourselves.Of course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight of the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of the marginalized did not matter. They were on the periphery of the world\u2019s concerns. Today, our concern for them is driven not just by conscience, but should also be drive by self-interest. For helping people who have been pushed to the margins of our world is not mere charity, it is a matter of collective security. And the purpose of this institution is not merely to avoid conflict, it is to galvanize the collective action that makes life better on this planet.The commitments we\u2019ve made to the Sustainable Development Goals speak to this truth. I believe that capitalism has been the greatest creator of wealth and opportunity that the world has ever known. But from big cities to rural villages around the world, we also know that prosperity is still cruelly out of reach for too many. As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, we are stronger when we value the least among these, and see them as equal in dignity to ourselves and our sons and our daughters.We can roll back preventable disease and end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We can stamp out pandemics that recognize no borders. That work may not be on television right now, but as we demonstrated in reversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives than anything else we can do.Together, we can eradicate extreme poverty and erase barriers to opportunity. But this requires a sustained commitment to our people \u2014 so farmers can feed more people; so entrepreneurs can start a business without paying a bribe; so young people have the skills they need to succeed in this modern, knowledge-based economy.We can promote growth through trade that meets a higher standard. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing through the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 a trade agreement that encompasses nearly 40 percent of the global economy; an agreement that will open markets, while protecting the rights of workers and protecting the environment that enables development to be sustained.We can roll back the pollution that we put in our skies, and help economies lift people out of poverty without condemning our children to the ravages of an ever-warming climate. The same ingenuity that produced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age allows us to harness the potential of clean energy. No country can escape the ravages of climate change. And there is no stronger sign of leadership than putting future generations first. The United States will work with every nation that is willing to do its part so that we can come together in Paris to decisively confront this challenge.And finally, our vision for the future of this Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather than backwards, requires us to defend the democratic principles that allow societies to succeed. Let me start from a simple premise: Catastrophes, like what we are seeing in Syria, do not take place in countries where there is genuine democracy and respect for the universal values this institution is supposed to defend. (Applause.)I recognize that democracy is going to take different forms in different parts of the world. The very idea of a people governing themselves depends upon government giving expression to their unique culture, their unique history, their unique experiences. But some universal truths are self-evident. No person wants to be imprisoned for peaceful worship. No woman should ever be abused with impunity, or a girl barred from going to school. The freedom to peacefully petition those in power without fear of arbitrary laws \u2014 these are not ideas of one country or one culture. They are fundamental to human progress. They are a cornerstone of this institution.I realize that in many parts of the world there is a different view \u2014 a belief that strong leadership must tolerate no dissent. I hear it not only from America\u2019s adversaries, but privately at least I also hear it from some of our friends. I disagree. I believe a government that suppresses peaceful dissent is not showing strength; it is showing weakness and it is showing fear. (Applause.) History shows that regimes who fear their own people will eventually crumble, but strong institutions built on the consent of the governed endure long after any one individual is gone.That\u2019s why our strongest leaders \u2014 from George Washington to Nelson Mandela \u2014 have elevated the importance of building strong, democratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual power. Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in office only acknowledge that they failed to build a successful country for their people \u2014 because none of us last forever. It tells us that power is something they cling to for its own sake, rather than for the betterment of those they purport to serve.I understand democracy is frustrating. Democracy in the United States is certainly imperfect. At times, it can even be dysfunctional. But democracy \u2014 the constant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, to give more people a voice \u2014 is what allowed us to become the most powerful nation in the world. (Applause.)It\u2019s not simply a matter of principle; it\u2019s not an abstraction. Democracy \u2014 inclusive democracy \u2014 makes countries stronger. When opposition parties can seek power peacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon new ideas. When a free media can inform the public, corruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted out. When civil society thrives, communities can solve problems that governments cannot necessarily solve alone. When immigrants are welcomed, countries are more productive and more vibrant. When girls can go to school, and get a job, and pursue unlimited opportunity, that\u2019s when a country realizes its full potential. (Applause.)That is what I believe is America\u2019s greatest strength. Not everybody in America agrees with me. That\u2019s part of democracy. I believe that the fact that you can walk the streets of this city right now and pass churches and synagogues and temples and mosques, where people worship freely; the fact that our nation of immigrants mirrors the diversity of the world \u2014 you can find everybody from everywhere here in New York City \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the fact that, in this country, everybody can contribute, everybody can participate no matter who they are, or what they look like, or who they love \u2014 that\u2019s what makes us strong.And I believe that what is true for America is true for virtually all mature democracies. And that is no accident. We can be proud of our nations without defining ourselves in opposition to some other group. We can be patriotic without demonizing someone else. We can cherish our own identities \u2014 our religion, our ethnicity, our traditions \u2014 without putting others down. Our systems are premised on the notion that absolute power will corrupt, but that people \u2014 ordinary people \u2014 are fundamentally good; that they value family and friendship, faith and the dignity of hard work; and that with appropriate checks and balances, governments can reflect this goodness.I believe that\u2019s the future we must seek together. To believe in the dignity of every individual, to believe we can bridge our differences, and choose cooperation over conflict \u2014 that is not weakness, that is strength. (Applause.) It is a practical necessity in this interconnected world.And our people understand this. Think of the Liberian doctor who went door-to-door to search for Ebola cases, and to tell families what to do if they show symptoms. Think of the Iranian shopkeeper who said, after the nuclear deal, \u201cGod willing, now we\u2019ll be able to offer many more goods at better prices.\u201d Think of the Americans who lowered the flag over our embassy in Havana in 1961 \u2014 the year I was born \u2014 and returned this summer to raise that flag back up. (Applause.) One of these men said of the Cuban people, \u201cWe could do things for them, and they could do things for us. We loved them.\u201d For 50 years, we ignored that fact.Think of the families leaving everything they\u2019ve known behind, risking barren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter; just to save their children. One Syrian refugee who was greeted in Hamburg with warm greetings and shelter, said, \u201cWe feel there are still some people who love other people.\u201dThe people of our United Nations are not as different as they are told. They can be made to fear; they can be taught to hate \u2014 but they can also respond to hope. History is littered with the failure of false prophets and fallen empires who believed that might always makes right, and that will continue to be the case. You can count on that. But we are called upon to offer a different type of leadership \u2014 leadership strong enough to recognize that nations share common interests and people share a common humanity, and, yes, there are certain ideas and principles that are universal.That\u2019s what those who shaped the United Nations 70 years ago understood. Let us carry forward that faith into the future \u2014 for it is the only way we can assure that future will be brighter for my children, and for yours.Thank you very much. (Applause.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here Comes Another Greek Election", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe line between disillusionment and despair is a fine one, and it\u2019s not easy to tell where Greeks fall as they prepare for their third bout of voting in less than eight months to choose what could be, if Alexis Tsipras is not returned to office, their seventh prime minister since the Greek debt crisis erupted in 2009.Unlike the usual street circus of European elections, there are hardly any posters in the streets and campaign rallies are not drawing crowds. The election was called on short notice, the parties are strapped for cash, and Greeks don\u2019t normally hold elections in summer. And after the dramatic shift to the left-wing Syriza in January\u2019s election, followed by the impassioned vote against austerity in a referendum in July \u2014 all with no reduction in austerity and little progress on reform \u2014 voters are distinctly disenchanted with politics. A Communist Party rally on the central Syntagma Square on Wednesday evening featured earsplitting loudspeakers and blocked traffic, but only a piddling crowd.Besides, there\u2019s now a bigger and far more dramatic crisis out there as wave after wave of Syrian refugees overwhelm Greek islands off the Turkish coast, for many the point of entry into a Europe that has no idea what to do with them. With as many as 1,500 refugees landing every day on the tiny island of Leros, for example, the deputy mayor, Yiannis Konstantinides, confessed to the BBC that nobody had even realized there\u2019s an election on Sunday.Apathy, however, does not necessarily translate into despair. After almost six years of falling incomes and lost jobs, living with crisis is nothing new, and there are a few bits of heartening news. The summer tourist season was good, and the government reported on Thursday that the jobless rate slipped from 26.6 percent in the first quarter of 2015 to 24.6 in the second. That is still eye-popping, but then a year earlier it was 27.8 percent. And a good many people think the crisis has hit bottom. The election is the latest bid by Mr. Tsipras, the fiery head of the Syriza party, to use voting to get out of a political corner. Mr. Tsipras, a peripheral political force before the crisis, rode popular fury at the austerity imposed on Greece by outside creditors to overthrow the center-right New Democratic government in elections in January.But despite dramatic brinkmanship in negotiations with Germany and other lenders, despite showy gestures like suggesting he would get funding from Russia or China, and despite a desperate referendum in July in which a large majority voted against accepting the austerity conditions for another bailout, he failed to sway the lenders and ended up signing on their dotted line. The alternatives \u2014 national bankruptcy and an exit from Europe\u2019s common currency \u2014 were too frightening even for Mr. Tsipras. Hard-line members of Syriza defected, so two months after his referendum, Mr. Tsipras called a quick election, hoping to forge a new power base.Polls, which have been notoriously off the mark in recent elections, have Syriza neck-and-neck with New Democracy, with neither likely to form a government without coalition partners. Who would partner with whom is one unknown.In any case, whoever emerges at the helm will be bound by the bailout deal Mr. Tsipras signed with creditors, including the troika of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. New Democracy voted for the deal, and would not be in a position to disown it. So however the election comes off, the next government will be locked into more austerity and more grappling with creditors.The most important question is whether the next government will be prepared to tackle the reforms Greece needs, and that so far have been halfhearted or nonexistent: deregulation, liberalization of the economy, a turn away from tax evasion and clientelism.Over the years of crisis, popular reactions have gone from fury to illusions that the austerity can be lifted without fundamental reform. The latest and most dramatic such fantasy was Mr. Tsipras.\u201cThe crisis, according to many analysts, \u2018devours\u2019 one government after another since 2009,\u201d George Kaminis, the popular, politically independent mayor of Athens, told the Athens Democracy Forum organized this past week by The International New York Times. \u201cI do not disagree, but I will add that in digesting governments, the crisis also dissolves the illusions that successive party leaders cultivate to seize power or to keep it.\u201dBy that measure, the best result on Sunday would be a convincing display of disillusionment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burning Man Ends, and an Event for Law Enforcement Begins", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for some revelers, the party does not recede into the dust: Scores of law enforcement officers meted out more than 600 citations and arrested dozens of people \u2014 nearly all of them for possession of controlled substances, like the hallucinogenic drugs that can make frolicking in scanty costumes in the desert seem like a kaleidoscopic adventure.In other words, the party may have ended, but for the local courts, lawyers and busted participants, the headache begins.More than 40 of the revelers, known as Burners, were arrested, according to the sheriff\u2019s office of Pershing County, the rural pocket of northwest Nevada where the festival takes place. The citation fines range from $100 to $500, said Rudy Evenson, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency that shares policing responsibilities for the event with the sheriff\u2019s office. Misdeeds ranged from environmental ones, like improper dumping, to drug use and possession.Organizers of the festival, which drew an estimated 70,000 people to a dry lake area here known as a playa, were pleased to note that the number of arrests was relatively low; they had feared a serious crackdown by the new Pershing County sheriff, Jerry Allen. Sheriff Allen had taken a markedly harsher tone toward the rave in his backyard than had his predecessor.\u201cYou have these individuals go there to go to this experience, and they will sometimes partake in illegal narcotics, hallucinogens, as part of their rite of passage,\u201d Mr. Routsis said. \u201cNow there is a great consequence to that action, where there wasn\u2019t beforehand.\u201dLately, the arrests have been handled locally rather than by the federal government, which is not good news for the Burners: In Nevada, there are lengthy mandatory jail sentences for even small amounts of drugs. Even so, evidence from past years suggests that judges seldom throw the book at the celebrators.One of Mr. Routsis\u2019 clients is Pamela Jenkins, 35, the owner of a cupcake shop in Las Vegas. She was arrested at the start of the festival after a sniffing dog set off an alert on her car at a traffic stop in Washoe County, just to the west of the event site. Ms. Jenkins faces several charges, including drug possession and Level 3 drug trafficking, a felony that carries a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. One charge is related to her having her 7-year-old in the car with the drugs, which the sheriff\u2019s office described as \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of psilocybin \u2014 found in magic mushrooms \u2014 and dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, another psychedelic.Through Mr. Routsis, Ms. Jenkins expressed dismay at the charges. \u201cMy family, friends and I go to Burning Man to awaken our consciousness and to become better human beings,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.\u201cI spend the night in Lovelock,\u201d the parent said, referring to a Pershing Country prison, \u201cand paid $885 to a bail bondsman on a $5,600 bond.\u201dBut many of those who come from far and wide for the festival are unable to return to courts in places like Reno, about three hours from Burning Man; they do not bother fighting the citations and simply pay up. A common refrain on the playa is that the festival, which also pays hefty sums to use the land, is the region\u2019s cash cow.But by most accounts, law enforcement officials used a light touch this year. In the past, nearby Mono County, which many Burners drive through on the way to the playa, was springloaded to catch any wayward behavior, employing scores of extra police officers to patrol the roads for the duration of the festival. The new Mono County sheriff, Ingrid Braun, has done away with the practice.\u201cWe treat the Burning Man travelers the same as all of our other visitors, and I did not see a need to increase our enforcement efforts during Burning Man,\u201d Sheriff Braun wrote in an email. \u201cAll vacationers are valuable to our county, as we rely on tourism to fuel our economy.\u201dThe festival musters a team of 700, nicknamed \u201crangers,\u201d to patrol Black Rock City, as the temporary encampment is called. \u201cBlack Rock City does abide by all local state and federal laws,\u201d said Jim Graham, the festival spokesman. Participants are warned: \u201cAct accordingly.\u201dBurning Man ended last weekend, culminating, as every year, with the dramatic bonfire of a giant effigy of a man. Patrolling the playa were more than 120 law enforcement officers, including agents from the United States Forest Service and the United States Park Police, as well as local deputies, moving in clusters of uniforms. They wove among the strangely clad Burners, including elderly men wearing silver paint and nothing else, offering safety tips or issuing warnings to intoxicated bike riders. They were under orders to, well, be cool.\u201cIf people invite you into their theme camp, accept their invitation,\u201d said Mr. Evenson, the Bureau of Land Management spokesman. \u201cIf it\u2019s appropriate to the uniform, we participate in their activities.\u201dOne officer, he said, even joined a piece of performance art featuring a bad advice booth. He spent his shift telling customers to do drugs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJanet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, described the decision as a close call and said the central bank still expected to raise interest rates later this year. The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate close to zero since late 2008, when the nation\u2019s economy was at the depths of crisis.\u201cThe recovery from the Great Recession has advanced sufficiently far and domestic spending has been sufficiently robust that an argument can be made for a rise in interest rates at this time,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a news conference.But, she said, \u201cheightened uncertainties abroad,\u201d including the Chinese economy\u2019s weakness, had persuaded the bank to wait at least a few more weeks for fresh data that might \u201cbolster its confidence\u201d in continued growth.The Fed\u2019s decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, had been widely expected by investors in recent weeks. Fed officials spent most of the summer suggesting that they wanted to raise rates in September, only to lose confidence as signs of slowing global growth weighed on markets.The 10-year Treasury note yield fell 0.11 percentage points to 2.189 percent. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 0.26 percent to 1,990.20.There were signs, however, that the Fed might hesitate only briefly. It separately released economic projections showing 13 of the 17 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee still expected to raise the benchmark rate this year.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.The Fed has said it is moving toward raising rates because it expects economic growth to continue, reducing unemployment and eventually raising inflation; on Thursday, Ms. Yellen said that outlook had not changed.\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency among some to think that they\u2019re always going to get cold feet, and I thought Yellen really as much as possible discouraged that kind of thinking,\u201d said John L. Bellows, a portfolio manager at Western Asset Management.The policy-making committee still has scheduled meetings in October and December, and Ms. Yellen said a rate increase was possible at either meeting.One official, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in Virginia, voted to raise rates at the September meeting, the first dissent this year. The economic projections suggest that Ms. Yellen faces more disagreements at the Fed\u2019s October meeting, given that six officials predicted the Fed would raise rates at least two times this year, while four said that they expected no increases.The latest postponement was welcomed by liberal activists and economists who argue that the recovery remains incomplete. Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, introduced legislation on Thursday directing the Fed to push the unemployment rate below 4 percent. While the bill has no chance of winning approval in the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Conyers addressed a rally organized by the Center for Popular Democracy outside an office building where Ms. Yellen spoke, joining in a chant of \u201cDon\u2019t raise interest rates.\u201dCritics expressed concern that the Fed has adopted increasingly ambitious goals for its stimulus campaign. \u201cThere is always a reason to chicken out,\u201d said Dean Croushore, a professor of economics at the University of Richmond. \u201cThe Fed will lose credibility over time, as it fails to follow its own prior announcements about when it will increase rates.\u201dMs. Yellen, asked about the efforts to put public pressure on the Fed, which have mounted in recent months, dryly observed, \u201cWe have been receiving advice from a large number of economists and interested groups.\u201dShe denied that outside pressure had influenced the Fed\u2019s decision. She also said it had not been influenced by concerns about a potential government shutdown, which could disrupt growth, though she said that it \u201cwould be more than unfortunate.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.The Fed\u2019s decision is probably a \u201cmixed blessing\u201d for the global economy,\u201d Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell, said in an email. Instead of new pressures, investors must deal with continued uncertainty.A Fed increase, for example, might have prompted investors to pull money out of countries like Turkey or Brazil, damaging their economies, and reduced demand for imports from Europe and other developed countries. But the decision to stand pat also could weigh on Europe in the short term if it causes the euro to rise against the dollar, making things harder for exporters.The American economy is outpacing the rest of the world, and Ms. Yellen said on Thursday that the Fed did not yet see evidence that growth was slowing.Fed officials say they believe that labor market conditions have nearly returned to normal. In the new round of economic projections, officials estimated unemployment would stabilize next year at 4.8 percent, just below the August level of 5.1 percent.Officials also remain confident that inflation will rebound, although perhaps a little slowly because of the recent downturn in the prices of oil and other commodities. Since the financial crisis, inflation has remained consistently below the central bank\u2019s 2 percent annual target, lately rising just 0.3 percent over the previous year.Fed officials argue that a tighter labor market will lead to higher inflation as employers are finally prodded to pay higher wages. But, Ms. Yellen said on Thursday, that will happen more slowly than the unemployment rate might suggest, because people not counted among the unemployed \u2014 like those who have stopped looking for work or have taken part-time jobs \u2014 may start looking again as conditions improve.James A. Wilcox, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said that it was difficult to find evidence for a strong connection between inflation and employment, particularly over the last decade. Inflation fell less than expected during the recession, and it has increased less than expected in the aftermath.\u201cThe events of the last 10 years have caused a lot of rethinking and stomach acid within the Federal Reserve and the research community,\u201d Dr. Wilcox said.Recent history has reinforced the more basic point that it takes a lot to change the underlying pace of inflation. That stability has allowed the Fed to press its stimulus campaign, but Dr. Wilcox said it also provided a good reason for the Fed to be wary of allowing inflation to climb, because reversing the trend could be very painful.\u201cIf the heat builds slowly, and it can only be turned down slowly, then you have to move ahead of time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s sympathy for the idea of starting to raise rates relatively soon.\u201dGiven the weakness of economic growth, however, Ms. Yellen reiterated on Thursday that the Fed planned to raise rates more slowly than its past practice. Fed officials expect the benchmark rate to reach 2.6 percent by the end of 2017. In June, they predicted the rate would reach 2.9 percent. Officials also expect the rate to reach a new plateau of about 3.5 percent, less than the June prediction of 3.8 percent and significantly below the level once regarded as normal. Such a low plateau would limit the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to economic downturns.The Fed has already held its benchmark rate near zero much longer than it once expected. It announced in 2012 that it would keep rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent. That threshold was crossed in April 2014. Last winter, when the Fed ended its bond-buying campaign, officials pointed to June as the most likely moment for \u201cliftoff\u201d from the so-called zero bound.Some officials have made clear they are not inclined to wait much longer. Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in late August that officials would not be able to postpone a decision until all doubts were resolved. \u201cWhen the case is overwhelming,\u201d he said, \u201cif you wait that long, then you\u2019ve waited too long.\u201dMs. Yellen echoed that warning on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait until we\u2019ve fully met both of our objectives to tighten monetary policy,\u201d she said.The Fed\u2019s hesitation on Thursday echoed events of two years ago, when investors expected the central bank to announce at its September 2013 meeting that it was tapering its bond purchases. The Fed demurred, citing uncertainty about economic conditions.Instead of September, it acted in December.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Wild Day That Wasn\u2019t: Fed Avoids Tumult but Prolongs Uncertainty", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThursday could easily have been a wild day on Wall Street. If the Federal Reserve, at a long-anticipated meeting, had decided to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a steep sell-off in the stock market was possible. Conversely, if the Fed kept rates at their ultralow levels, investors might have cheered its commitment to easy money and gone on a buying spree.In the end, the Fed chose not to raise rates. Unexpectedly, the market closed slightly lower. The muted reaction may be welcome after the turbulence that roiled stock markets last month. And since investors were betting in certain markets that the Fed would not raise rates, it made some sense that they did not react strongly when they got what they expected.But the stock market\u2019s apparent meekness on such a big day may not be as encouraging as it looks. The Fed\u2019s decision not to raise rates, combined with statements made by Fed officials on Thursday, may have deepened investors\u2019 fears about the strength of the global economy \u2014 and raised new questions about the Fed\u2019s ability to respond to weakness around the world.\u201cWhat was problematic is that the Fed introduced a greater measure of concern about global issues,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS. \u201cThe markets might be saying, \u2018What does the Fed know that we don\u2019t know?\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index finished the day down just 5.11 points, or 0.26 percent, at 1,990.20. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up as much as 194 points on Thursday afternoon, closed down 65.21 points, at 16,674.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended the day on a higher note, up 0.1 percent, to 4,893.95.Investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.217 percent, from 2.3 percent. The yield on the two-year Treasury plunged to 0.68 percent, from 0.81 percent.Expectations about Fed policy have long driven investors\u2019 decisions. But the influence of the Fed grew after the central bank introduced an enormous stimulus program after the financial crisis to lift the economy. Even though the economy did not bounce back strongly, investors were encouraged that the Fed would keep printing money until it got the results it was looking for. And with the Fed holding rates at their lows on Thursday, investors would seem to have reason to believe that stocks will keep moving higher as the Fed keeps its foot on the pedal.Inflation is well below the Fed\u2019s target in the United States, giving it some reason to delay raising rates \u2014 maybe even into next year, although it will have two more opportunities before this year ends. Whatever the precise timing, the Fed also appears to believe that with large developing countries like China flashing signs of weakness, it should keep rates at low levels to try to ease global financial conditions and insulate the United States economy from trouble overseas. One part of the statement released by the Fed\u2019s monetary policy committee in particular indicated that higher rates might be a long time coming. \u201cThe committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term,\u201d the statement said.But the Fed\u2019s decision to hold off could be self-defeating. It might stoke fears rather than allay them, according to some analysts. And investors may start to believe that the Fed is in effect trying to set monetary policy for both the economies of the United States and China. That might be hard to pull off.\u201cChina is now the Fed\u2019s reaction function,\u201d Mr. Mariscal said. \u201cIt\u2019s another source of uncertainty.\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, on Thursday appeared well aware of the difficulty of reacting to many different forces in the world economy and in global markets. She emphasized the existence of \u201ccrosscurrents\u201d in a press briefing. Some Fed watchers in the markets said that the Fed should have raised interest rates on Thursday \u2014 to dispel the uncertainty that they believe the central bank has started to create in the markets. Because it chose not to raise rates on Thursday, investors will be fretting for months about when the big day will actually arrive. \u201cIt leaves you no different than you were one minute before the announcement,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \u201cMy countdown clock just restarted for 30 days.\u201dBut raising rates could have created far greater uncertainty, by roiling markets and hammering developing countries when they are vulnerable. Or, as Ms. Yellen put it, \u201cGiven the significant economic and financial interconnections between the United States and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYALL ACROSS THE GLOBE, companies, governments and society are scrambling to harness the energy and meet the needs of an aging global population. Consider a few of the ways the world is preparing for this longevity revolution:In the U.S., according to the Global Coalition on Aging,\u00b9 a drugstore chain noticed that aging customers, the core of its clientele and crucial for the company's profitability, tended to seek out older employees for assistance. To encourage would-be retirees to keep working, the chain offered those who spent their winters in warmer climes the opportunity to split their time between store locations and to work flexible hours.Also according to the Global Coalition on Aging,\u00b2 at a car plant in Bavaria, managers surveyed workers and consulted physical therapists and ergonomics experts about how to accommodate older employees. Keeping them happy and on the job was a necessity in Germany, which, according to The Guardian, has long been plagued by the lowest birth rate in Europe and has a dire shortage of younger workers. The changes the factory made weren't dramatic or futuristic\u2014softer wooden floors and chairs for breaks, adjustable worktables and orthopedic shoes\u2014but they had the intended effect. Absenteeism at the plant plummeted and productivity soared.The World Health Organization's honor roll of 210 Global Age-Friendly Cities and Communities\u00b3 includes Portland, Ore., and New York City. These cities meet a long list of criteria ranging from having plenty of public transportation to offering job opportunities, accessible spaces and socially inclusive policies for older residents. These attributes \"also make them better places for everyone to live,\" says Michael Hodin, executive director of the Global Coalition on Aging.In the U.S., that economy within an economy revolves around the 78 million people of the baby boom generation who are now surging into their retirement years. \"Boomers are the largest demographic force we have, in terms of volume, wealth, consumer spending and jobs,\" says Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer,\u00a0Bank of America Corporation's Global Wealth and Investment Management. \"And as they age, they're likely to spend more to maintain their active lifestyles than any previous generation in history.\"That spending, in the U.S. and around the globe, is expected to create a range of opportunities for investors, with stocks of forward-looking companies likely to emerge as appealing long-term investments. At the same time, all of us, across the generations, will need to come to grips with how this demographic megashift will affect our personal lives and finances.For example, if you are nearing retirement or are already there, you will need to think how to spend the extra years you can now expect to live\u201430 years more than in 1900\u2014and how to deploy your resources to finance them. Meanwhile, younger generations will want to start planning for lives that may be remarkably different from those of their parents. Careers that extend over five or six decades may require multiple phases of education and training, and paying for health care into old age will necessitate new financial solutions and sustainable models of care, says Hodin.\"History has never before experienced such a demographic shift, and no one is untouched by it,\" Hodin says. \"The aging of countries will literally transform how we, our children and our children's children live in the 21st century; everything will change.\"There have been worries that this demographic groundswell may change society for the worse, as a shrinking cohort of younger workers is called upon to carry the tax burden and other costs of supporting older generations. Yet older Americans are emerging as a tremendous economic asset. They are working longer, buying more goods and generally propelling economic growth. \"This generation has redefined industry after industry,\" says Lorna Sabbia, head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"They have reinvented how we work and play, and they have no plans to slow down.\"And, says Coughlin, \"the real premium will be on sectors and companies that help us live how we want to live, even as we age. Previous generations were expected to age politely and cope with the aches and pains that defined retirement. Boomers are saying, 'I will not just live longer, I will live better.'\"Coughlin calls this \"stealth aging,\" with boomers seeking products and technologies that can minimize impairments associated with advancing years. \"They may no longer be young, but they perceive themselves to be perennially youthful,\" he says. \"Any product that is defined as being for an old person, generally speaking, is rejected.\" Looking for companies that get it right, providing products and services that benefit older Americans without seeming to, could be part of an effective investment strategy.Longevity has not only increased life spans but has also granted many more years of good health. Forty-two percent of people age 65 to 69 and 33% age 75 to 79 say they are in excellent or very good health, according to a study published in the November 17, 2013, issue of the Journals of Gerontology. And 56% of Americans 85 and older say they have no limitations on their ability to work or to live their lives. At the same time, however, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and debilitating conditions such as Huntington's disease is rising as the population ages, and two-thirds of people past age 65 say they must cope with multiple chronic illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Transcript of videoThose apparently conflicting trends\u2014of a population that still feels young yet is also beginning to suffer inevitable consequences of getting older\u2014hint at the enormous diversity of the boomer generation and at the breadth of products and services being developed to serve its needs.Coughlin expects many in this demographic group to spend their later years in \"smart\" homes in which technology will control everything from appliances and sprinkler systems to bathrooms that serve as \"centers of health and well-being\" equipped with mirrors that analyze skin conditions and devices that remind you to take your medications. Service robots, already in use in Japan, will do the housework and other chores and even provide \"companionship\" for a generation increasingly able to \"age in place,\" according to Larry Polivka, director of the Claude Pepper Center at Florida State University. Pioneering companies offering advanced technological solutions could profit.Meanwhile, anti-aging treatments, biotechnology start-ups focused on regenerative medicine, and telemedicine applications that let physicians and families monitor health data from older people living independently at home all are areas of rapid development. The medical device industry is likely to flourish as ever more intricate technology helps the country compensate for an expected shortage of doctors, says Christopher J. Wolfe, chief investment officer, Portfolio Solutions, Private Banking and Investment Group \u00a0and Institutional at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. \"Devices will send blood pressure readings and other data to physicians in real time, greatly reducing the need for office visits and waiting rooms,\" he says. \"Technology is going to change the definition of what's normal in health care practice.\"Other companies are altering products to fit the needs of older consumers, and then finding that the broader market also welcomes changes that vary from the futuristic to the seemingly mundane\u2014ranging not only from cars that warn of impending collisions and park themselves but also to hotels undergoing renovations to accommodate older travelers with disabilities. The most promising stocks in the travel and leisure industries, for example, will come from companies offering this demographic group unique adventures and educational opportunities, adds Wolfe.The need for home health workers and assisted-living facilities is also expected to\u00a0mushroom, helping people to live independently for many years. The number of people in nursing homes is already declining, says Polivka, who predicts dramatic changes in those facilities as they are replaced by what he describes as the \"greenhouse model.\" \"People will live in units of four to 10 beds that provide a more normal and much less regimented environment,\" Polivka says. Due to baby boomers' demands for respect and control over their lives, large chains that meet this mandate could separate themselves from their peers. This could create a sector that should provide increasing investment opportunities as the longevity revolution gains momentum.As robust and multifaceted as the longevity economy is already proving to be, the challenges of today's shifting demographic reality are complex and daunting. Consider, for example, the older generation's inclination to stay on the job.According to a 2013 Merrill Lynch retirement study, 71% of pre-retirees expect to work during their retirement years and hope to find jobs that offer flexible hours. Entrepreneurism among older people is also projected to rise; already, people in their 50s and 60s start nearly twice the number of companies as those launched by twentysomethings, according to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which studies American entrepreneurism.The longer older Americans keep working, however, the larger the roadblock they may put in the way of younger workers trying to move up to senior positions in their fields. \"Older workers have one of the lowest unemployment rates of any group, which is good for them,\" Wolfe says. But for workers in their twenties, thirties and forties, the delay in reaching upper pay levels may complicate their ability to prepare for their own longevity bonus.Others believe such worries may be mitigated by other parts of the longevity economy. \"There was a time when people feared that having women in the workforce would take jobs away from men,\" says Hodin. \"That didn't happen, and female workers instead added trillions of dollars to the economy. The same thing has to happen with older Americans\"\u2014that is, they need to continue to fuel economic growth \u2014 \"or our social-insurance programs will become fiscally unsustainable.\"What will happen to Social Security and Medicare as the flood of baby boomers collects benefits? \"The mathematics are that the number of people leaving the workforce will be greater than the number of young people coming into it,\" says Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. \"Thus, the tax base will shrink while government spending is expanding, which in the absence of fiscal reform could create a certain amount of 'social insecurity.'\"Indeed, in 1935, when the U.S. established 65 as the minimum age for drawing Social Security benefits, the average life expectancy was 65 for women and only 62 for men, says Woody Carlson, the Charles B. Nam Professor in Sociology of Population at Florida State University's Center for Demography and Population Health. \"Today, it's pushing 80,\" Carlson says. \"If the retirement age increased along with life expectancy, people would now retire at 75.\"Still, raising the age at which people can begin receiving Social Security benefits by even a year or two would be politically dicey, and in the short term, the U.S. will face the challenge of not having enough workers from the much smaller Generation X to support the millions of baby boomers moving into retirement. \"But the U.S. has what no other country in the world has\u2014a new generation that is even larger than the boomer generation,\" says Carlson. There are approximately 90 million people born between 1983 and 2001 who are living in the U.S.\u2014 children of the boomers and of immigrants\u2014compared with 78 million baby boomers. \"In Germany, this cohort is called the 'disappearing generation,' and that country is closing schools and laying off teachers because there are no kids,\" says Carlson. \"The U.S. has plenty of kids, and once they enter the labor force, they will be very good for the economy.\"Until then, reforms of Social Security and Medicare and the dynamism and adaptability of the American economy will see the country through the graying of the baby boomers. \"Our economy is flexible and movable, and we have a diverse labor force and steady immigration,\" says Hyzy. In the end, moreover, ruminations about whether the longevity miracle and having a fifth of the U.S. population over age 65 by 2050 will have a positive or negative impact are almost beside the point. The wave is upon us already, and it is changing the world. \"Today is not only the first day of the rest of our lives,\" says Coughlin. \"It's also the first day of the future.\"Longevity isn't just reshaping the whole world. It's changing individual retirement needs.Statistically speaking, people who are in or nearing traditional \"retirement age\" can expect to live longer than any previous generation. Whereas earlier generations could rely on savings, company pensions and Social Security, you now must plan virtually every aspect of your own retirement.\"Longevity is a miracle, but it's also people's biggest fear,\" says Lorna Sabbia, head of Retirement and Personal Wealth Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"It's on their shoulders to put all this together.\"Just aiming to reach a certain savings figure can't begin to meet all of the needs and desires that together will comprise a fulfilling retirement\u2014including providing for health security, making key decisions on where to live and how best to provide a legacy for one's family and for charitable causes. With specific goals in mind, it is possible to determine appropriate strategies for each of them.Investments will be essential, but so will other kinds of assets. Starting a new career or fulfilling an entrepreneurial dream, for example, could provide new income to augment one's savings. \"Matching your assets against your goals reveals choices and possible trade-offs.\" Could a more modest retirement home than the one you previously envisioned help fulfill a goal of seeing the world?

{"Headline": "How the Pope Might Renew the Church", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSacramento \u2014 I AM a Catholic, born in 1921 of Italian and Irish families and raised in California seminaries. After decades of work as a priest, I was astonished that Pope Paul VI appointed me a bishop in San Francisco. I love my church, and every night I pray that I might die in her warm, loving arms.Yet I worry about my church\u2019s future. Basic doctrines will not change. But the church may change policies and practices after doing serious study.So, as we await Pope Francis\u2019 visit to America, I offer a peaceful contribution to the controversies that convulse the church today.American Catholics are divided, primarily, by three internal church conflicts.The first is over priestly celibacy. Observers within and outside the church point to mandatory celibacy as a principal factor driving down the number of American priests.A celibate life is admirable for a priest who personally chooses it. For 1,000 years, great good has been accomplished because priests could fully devote their lives to their ministry.Nevertheless, in recent years married clergy of other Christian churches have been accepted into service in the Catholic Church. So far, the ministry of these married priests has appeared successful.The church should start relieving the desperate shortage of clergy members by also accepting for ordination men of mature age, of proven character and in stable marriages.Optional celibacy allows a choice between an abstinent life, totally free for ministry, or a married life that enables better understanding of the lives of parishioners.American Catholics are also divided over the ordination of women as priests.Recent popes have said publicly that priesthood for women cannot be considered because the gospel and other documents state that Christ ordained men only.Yet women have shown great qualities of leadership: strength, intelligence, prayerfulness, wisdom, practicality, sensitivity and knowledge of theology and sacred Scripture.Might the teaching church one day, taking account of changing circumstances, be inspired by the Holy Spirit to study and reinterpret this biblical tradition?Finally, why is a divorced Catholic who has remarried denied the Eucharist? Such people are considered living in an irregular union.Valid marriages remain indissoluble. However, in confession a priest, after reviewing the circumstances with a remarried penitent, already can assist that person to develop a clear conscience with God and resume receiving the Eucharist.Last month, Pope Francis stated that divorced and remarried Catholics were \u201cnot excommunicated,\u201d perhaps suggesting that prohibition of the Eucharist is under review.In surveys today, the question \u201cto what church do you belong?\u201d increasingly prompts the answer \u201cnone.\u201d Polls show that many high school and college students have gradually come to believe that what they learned as children about the nature of God can be erased as readily as Santa Claus and the tooth fairy.The culture that surrounds them focuses on science, growing out of the long history of Copernicus, Darwin, Freud, Einstein and Hawking. Still, most young people become not atheistic but agnostic, still searching even as they entertain doubts about God.Pope Francis prefers the simple title \u201cbishop of Rome.\u201d So I ask my brother bishop: Should we not convene a third Vatican Council just as ethical and paradigm-shifting as Vatican Council II of the 1960s?A Vatican Council III would bring together the world\u2019s bishops under the unifying guidance of Peter. It would include representative major theologians, scholars of sacred Scripture, scientists and appropriate academics, lay people of all ages, clergy members and parishioners, and officials of other faiths.In addition to the three issues dividing the church, this council and future councils would explore the morality of world economies, spiritual life, human sexuality, peace and war, and the poor and suffering.Such a council might slow or reverse the flow of the faithful out of the church. It would also stimulate a new conversation about God, one that shows young people that God is not an old man with a long white beard. God is infinite and unlimited.This is not easy to grasp. God is incomprehensible to our finite minds. We surmise that God is spirit, straddling the universe and parallel universes. At the same time God is intimate to each of us. We cannot prove existence by reason, nor can science disprove God\u2019s existence.Moreover, faith and science are not in conflict.Many of the young say they relate to God personally and do not need a church. We applaud this personal relationship, but it is also truly human to do things in community: We party together, we play sports together, we enjoy meals together. The three generations of my own nieces and nephews are just as moral as I am, if not more so. Could it be that they know more clearly what Pope Francis has been asking of us for the past two years \u2014 to be more loving and accepting?What caused much of the church over the centuries to underestimate the gospel\u2019s core message, which is love? After the emperors Constantine and Theodosius embraced Christianity in the fourth century, one strain in the church developed a spirit of power and dominance, seen most clearly in the Crusades and the Inquisition. Many, including Pope Gregory VII, tried heroically, but unsuccessfully, to stop this trend.Therefore, the main challenge facing the church today is not simply to resolve questions like celibacy, but to relearn how to communicate a deeper, more intelligent, more relevant religion that leads to a life of acceptance and love.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Officials to Testify on Debt Crisis Before Senate Panel ", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rican officials will appear before a skeptical United States Senate panel on Tuesday to explain why the island may need federal assistance by the end of the year and how lawmakers preoccupied with the federal debt might help without setting an unwelcome precedent.Officials on the island recently warned that their government would, in effect, run out of cash in November, even though it owes big payments to creditors in December and early January. Puerto Rico has not issued audited financial statements for the last two years, and some members of the Senate Finance Committee say that before the federal government commits funds to help tide it over its crisis, they need to know more about the federal money the island has already received and how it was used.\u201cIt would be extremely difficult to ask Congress to make important decisions, and appropriately allocate resources, without first understanding what the facts are and what problems need to be fixed,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is chairman of the finance committee.Mr. Hatch said that Puerto Rico had suffered for years with high unemployment and a shrinking economy, and had used borrowed money to provide some semblance of normalcy for the island\u2019s residents. In light of the outcome, he said, it made sense to consider whether Puerto Rico might hold lessons for other American jurisdictions.\u201cDespite some recent declines, our federal deficits under current law will soon rise again,\u201d he said. \u201cFederal debt will grow, as it has in Puerto Rico, to beyond 100 percent of the size of our economy.\u201dMr. Hatch said it was not hard to imagine Americans on the mainland struggling with \u201cthe devastating effects from unsustainable debt that are now being felt by Americans living and trying to work in Puerto Rico.\u201dThe hearing will be the first on Puerto Rico\u2019s troubles since Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla announced in June that the debt was \u201cunpayable\u201d and called for a negotiated moratorium.Since then, a working group of top Puerto Rican officials has been drafting a five-year plan that is meant to restore economic growth on the island and provide the means for making debt payments in the future. The working group has called for reductions in Puerto Rico\u2019s debt payments while reforms are being carried out. But how that would be accomplished was unclear.Last week, Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank released a statement saying it hoped to negotiate a broad debt exchange, in which creditors would hand in the shaky bonds they now hold and receive new, more reliable bonds in return. The bank\u2019s summary did not reveal how large the difference in value between the two groups of bonds was expected to be, but it said that the \u201ctransaction will be structured to take into account the priorities of the debt that creditors hold.\u201dThat seemed to suggest that Puerto Rico would follow its existing laws for deciding which types of bonds would get priority. The island has issued many different kinds of bonds, and some investors have worried that in the process of restructuring the debt, Puerto Rico might change some of the existing priorities.Puerto Rico also sought last week to allay investors\u2019 concerns that it might have miscalculated the total concessions it would seek from investors when the negotiations begin in mid-October.On Friday, the working group issued a statement saying that it had reviewed a recent client presentation to that effect by Morgan Stanley, and found \u201ca number of unstated, unsupported and erroneous assumptions that have significantly misled the market.\u201dThe statement went on to list the places where its members believed Morgan Stanley had misinterpreted the five-year plan. Morgan Stanley declined to comment because the presentation was not intended for public circulation. One member of the working group, Melba Acosta Febo, will be among those to testify on Tuesday.While concerns about the ranking of Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors may surface at the hearing, the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s primary jurisdiction is over fiscal affairs. Senator Hatch said he had already requested information on federal tax policies regarding Puerto Rico from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, as well as several reports from the Congressional Budget Office on health policy on the island.For example, dedicated taxes do not pay for the entire Medicare and Medicaid programs; a significant portion of the cost is also covered by personal income taxes. Since Puerto Ricans who live on the island are not required to pay federal income taxes, the senators were trying to learn whether that explains why they have been getting the lesser benefits.\u201cQuestions of funding and resource allocation are always difficult,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as simple as just deciding to give more health funds to Puerto Rico, because doing so would necessarily mean reduced funding for other priorities, increased taxes, or even more federal debt.\u201dIn July, the senator wrote to the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, asking for information about federal tax programs that affect Puerto Rico. He also asked whether the Obama administration was considering any rule changes that could increase \u201cthe flow of transfers from the general fund of the Treasury to Puerto Rico\u201d by executive order.In his response, Mr. Lew did not cite any coming changes in federal transfers to Puerto Rico, focusing instead on the separate question of whether Puerto Rico should be permitted to use Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy to solve its problems. The current federal bankruptcy code specifically excludes it, and Mr. Lew said he believed Puerto Rico needed some sort of tested legal framework.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fading Coal Industry in China May Offer Chance to Aid Climate", "Date": "2015-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDATONG, China \u2014 Across China\u2019s grimy coal heartland, mines have fallen silent, reduced production or shut down. Miners, owners and officials here wonder whether boom times will return for the \u201cblack gold\u201d that has fed the nation\u2019s craving for cheap but dirty energy.\u201cI think it\u2019s finished,\u201d said Wang Jinwang, a longtime miner whose salary has been cut by one-fifth.China\u2019s coal consumption weakened last year and through the first half of this year, largely because of a slowing economy, according to statistics from China\u2019s largest coal industry analysis group.\u201cThey really need to make sure they\u2019re clarifying for the rest of the world that, hey, we\u2019ve got some serious difficulties to work out on cyber and other issues, and we\u2019re not going to step back from that, but that doesn\u2019t mean that our climate partnership is any less strong,\u201d said Melanie Hart, the director of China policy at the Center for American Progress and an energy and climate change scholar.If current trends in coal use continue, some experts say, that goal could be moved up to 2025, which the Americans favor. Speeding up the timeline would also require new policies to motivate industries to harness cleaner sources of energy and make the economy more energy-efficient, experts say.But some officials argue that robust coal use is still needed to keep the economy from slowing too much and too quickly and that sharp cuts to coal use could imperil jobs and prove too costly.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of political will \u2014 of whether China can carry through on its current thinking, of whether there\u2019s enough strong political will to refrain from going back to the old mentality,\u201d said Ranping Song, who monitors the emissions-cutting efforts of China and other developing nations for the World Resources Institute.China consumes as much coal as the rest of the world combined and is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, so its decisions will have global import.Some researchers at the Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission, the state agency overseeing economic planning and climate change policy, say the change is permanent.\u201cMy team has done a model that says coal use has reached its peak,\u201d said Jiang Kejun, a senior researcher at the institute. \u201cThe structure of the economy is changing.\u201dLikewise, Zeng Hao, an industry analyst here in Shanxi Province, said, \u201cIndustry people don\u2019t see any reason why coal demand will pick up again.\u201dOthers see the downturn as a blip that will be reversed in coming years.Both judgments are speculative, and it has been difficult to come up with even an accepted measure of how much coal use has already fallen.Even so, a peak in coal use does not correlate directly with a peak in emissions. Though most carbon dioxide emissions come from coal burning, China\u2019s use of oil and gas is rising, primarily because of rising car ownership, which will continue to push up emissions. More thorough combustion of higher-carbon coal could also add to the carbon output.In fact, even as coal use apparently slowed, carbon dioxide emissions in the country probably rose slightly last year, said Glen Peters, an expert on greenhouse gases at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo.Capitalizing on the drop in coal demand to slow emissions growth will require a major push from Beijing. Among the steps required to reach an emissions peak much before 2030, researchers say, are enforcing and expanding air pollution controls that limit coal use, shifting the economy away from a reliance on building infrastructure, developing more efficient industrial technology, enforcing energy-efficient building codes and vastly increasing the amount of energy from nonfossil-fuel sources.\u201cThe complexity of the policy changes needed should not be underestimated,\u201d said Wang Yi, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing who specializes in environmental policy.One way is to establish a national carbon emissions trading market, which China plans to do. For two years, officials have been experimenting with seven local carbon emissions markets that encourage firms to buy and sell the right to emit. Dabo Guan, a professor of climate change economics who is now a visiting scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said a successful trading market was essential for China to achieve even the goal of reaching an emissions peak in 2030.\u201cWe can\u2019t let emissions trading fail in China,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a hope that the government can do it properly.\u201dOfficials have spoken of establishing a national carbon market by 2017. It would be the largest in the world. But building one that operates smoothly and effectively will not be easy, scholars say. Challenges include ensuring that a large number of companies take part in the market and having enough employees and regulatory overseers to operate it.Such pitfalls became apparent at the trial markets, said Chai Qimin, a senior director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.\u201cCompanies are not very active in the market,\u201d he said, noting that a total of only $177 million changed hands at the trial markets from mid-2013 until late July.Given the challenges facing a national market, some experts and advisers argue that a direct carbon tax on fossil fuels makes more sense. Damien Ma, a senior fellow at the Paulson Institute in Chicago, favors a tax, which he said \u201chas potential fiscal benefits and is possibly easier to implement.\u201dSuch decisions will be critical, even as the economy slows and demand for coal declines. And political and economic worries could still trump environmental ones.\u201cIf the economy is in trouble,\u201d Mr. Nielsen said, \u201cthe government may be tempted to return to infrastructure investment to try to stimulate growth. This is a particularly emissions-intensive way to goose the economy.\u201dAn article last Tuesday about the possibility that a decline in China\u2019s coal industry could benefit worldwide efforts to slow global warming misstated the job title of Chris P. Nielsen, who said he believed that a recent drop in demand would be reversed in coming years. He is a researcher at Harvard University, not a professor.Edward Wong reported from Datong, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

Even so, there was hope the agreement would lead to an expedited resolution of the case of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post reporter who has been unjustly held at Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison since July 2014.The espionage charges against him are absurd and he should be released now. Freeing him and two other detained Americans would be an easy way for Iran to show some humanitarian spirit and good will as it tries to improve its international reputation.Earlier this month, the speaker of Iran\u2019s Parliament, Ali Larijani, made a similar suggestion. But the deputy foreign minister, Hassan Qashqavi, was quoted by the Iranian news media as saying that the Iranian authorities were not considering such a move. There has been speculation that the Americans may be caught up in internal Iranian politics between the relative moderates who support Mr. Rouhani and the hard-liners who oppose the nuclear agreement and any gestures toward the West.Many countries are eager to resume business with Iran, but Western companies are unlikely to invest in Iran\u2019s atrophied economy if journalists and others can be arrested on bogus charges and thrown into a black-hole penal system. World leaders should make that point to Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif during their meetings in New York and press them to free the Americans without further delay.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bold Plan to Remake Camden\u2019s Waterfront", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetCAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 Plans for a major mixed-use waterfront development represent the latest step in efforts to rehabilitate this city that not long ago was rated as America\u2019s most dangerous.The development of offices, apartments and retail space, totaling 1.7 million square feet, would be built along the Delaware River starting in the fall of 2016, according to plans announced by Camden\u2019s mayor, Dana L. Redd, and the developer Liberty Property Trust last week. The project, estimated to cost about $1 billion, would be the biggest private sector investment in the city\u2019s history, and the latest in a series of corporate developments and relocations that are beginning to create jobs and drive down the city\u2019s notoriously high rates of crime and poverty.The development, scheduled for completion in 2019, will occupy 16 acres directly south of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia, in an area that is now a parking lot and adjoined by a minor-league baseball stadium and a public aquarium.The plans include replacing Camden\u2019s current low-rise profile from the Philadelphia side of the river with four office towers, 325 residential units, a 120-room hotel, 27,000 square feet of retail space and parking garages for 5,000 cars, city and company officials said.William P. Hankowsky, chief executive of Liberty Property Trust, predicted that investors would be attracted to the development because of recent declines in crime and poverty, the closure of failing public schools and several corporate relocations.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to create a sense of place that will allow companies to attract a future work force,\u201d Mr. Hankowsky told about 300 guests at the project\u2019s announcement.Coming arrivals in Camden include Holtec International, a processor of spent nuclear fuel, and the Philadelphia 76ers basketball franchise\u2019s practice facility, both scheduled to open in 2016.City officials say such moves, under the second-term Mayor Redd, are beginning to turn around a city that has been a national symbol for economic decline and urban blight.According to official statistics, violent crime is down 7 percent so far this year after double-digit declines in the last two years, while the poverty rate, though still high, dropped to 36.5 percent in 2014 from 42.6 percent in 2013. Robert Corrales, the city\u2019s business administrator, attributed the lower crime rate to more police officers on the street and an emphasis on community policing under a new county-run force.The city\u2019s renewal program includes the continuing demolition of about 600 vacant or derelict buildings that have scarred neighborhoods and attracted drug dealers. The demolition has been paid for by $7 million in proceeds from a bond sale that was enabled by the city\u2019s first investment-grade rating \u2014 BBB+ from Standard & Poor\u2019s \u2014 for 15 years, Mr. Corrales said.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said the changes were allowing Camden to turn its back on a grim reputation. \u201cCamden is no longer America\u2019s most dangerous city,\u201d he said at the announcement event. \u201cIt\u2019s where families can come to live and work and do business.\u201dMitchell Marcus, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate investment company, said the new development would help the local economy and would effectively expand Philadelphia\u2019s central business district across the river into New Jersey.Mr. Marcus said the project, named simply The Camden Waterfront, would be helped by its large scale, which will attract major corporations, and by its proximity to highways and public transit in the form of the Patco rail line that connects Camden with Philadelphia and suburban communities in southern New Jersey.\u201cIt\u2019s a boost for the region. It supports new quality inventory coming in. It brings scale,\u201d he said.With its offices and accompanying retail and restaurant space, the development will provide the \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cplay\u201d components of the \u201clive-work-play\u201d formula commonly sought by developers. But it is less certain that it will meet the \u201clive\u201d requirement because of continuing challenges in Camden\u2019s public schools, Mr. Marcus said.Still, the new development can succeed even if the schools don\u2019t turn around, he said. \u201cIf you get the retail to follow the employment base, I think that would be sufficient to support it. I\u2019m not sure the school system plays into that.\u201dThe city\u2019s turnaround has been spurred by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, a state agency that provides tax incentives for companies to relocate to, or remain in, economically challenged locations.The tax incentives, equivalent to a project\u2019s capital cost, are payable over 10 years, and they are dependent on capital investment and job creation. Since its inception in 2013, the program has stimulated investment of about $1 billion and created or retained 7,600 jobs in Camden, the economic development authority said.The incentives are also expected to be available to tenants in the waterfront development, said Timothy J. Lizura, president of the agency.Mr. Lizura said the project showed that the city was finally turning the corner after decades of economic pain.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a new day in Camden,\u201d he said. \u201cFor 20 years, we\u2019ve tried to redevelop that city, and we finally have the traction between a very competent mayor\u2019s office, the county police force, all the educational reforms going on, and now the corporate interest. It really is the right ingredient for changing a paradigm which has been a wreck.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toyota Fashions a Bolder Image for the Practical Prius", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The Toyota Prius gas-electric hybrid did not need cutting-edge styling to become the best-selling alternative-fuel car in the world. If anything, its sensible design struck a chord with consumers more interested in fuel economy than fashion.But with new electric cars from Tesla, BMW and others taking glamour to the market, the Prius is getting a makeover.On Tuesday night, Toyota unveiled the next-generation Prius in spectacular fashion by hoisting a car high above a crowd outside a hotel in Las Vegas. The stunt called attention to what Toyota hopes is a bolder image for the vehicle, which has been losing sales because of declining gas prices and an onslaught of competitors.The new Prius, which goes on sale next year, is longer and sleeker than the current egg-shaped model, and it comes with striking new headlamps and a prominent rear spoiler.Toyota said the fuel economy of the new version would improve by at least 10 percent over the existing model, which gets 51 miles per gallon in city driving.The car also has a revamped suspension to make it more agile, as well as a raft of safety features, including lane-departure alerts, steering assistance and automatic precollision braking.But it is the new design that will most likely determine whether the Prius can recapture the iconic status it has enjoyed since it first went on sale in Japan in 1997.With more than 3.5 million sold globally since its introduction, the Prius is by far the most popular hybrid vehicle in history. And Toyota has beefed up the brand in recent years by adding a variety of models in different sizes and prices. But the hybrid market has not been growing at the rate of the overall industry in the United States. Moreover, the introduction of all-electric cars from Nissan, Tesla and other manufacturers has somewhat overshadowed hybrids, which are powered by both a battery and a gasoline engine.Sales of the Prius lineup dropped by 17 percent, to 125,000 vehicles, during the first eight months of the year in the United States.A top Toyota executive said on Tuesday that the Prius needed to be reinvented.The new model is the first vehicle to use Toyota\u2019s \u201cnew global architecture,\u201d which allows components to be shared among a variety of vehicles. The system is expected to save development costs, which can instead be used on new technologies.Analysts said the design changes on the Prius were overdue. \u201cThe Prius look is dated and a bit quirky,\u201d Mr. Anand said.Toyota did not announce prices for the next Prius models. The current base model costs about $25,000, but analysts do not expect the company to seek significant increases, mostly because of competition from small, gasoline-powered cars that can get up to 40 miles per gallon.Mr. Fay said the exterior redesign of the vehicle would lure new customers to the hybrid category. \u201cPrius set the global benchmark for hybrids but now is breaking its own boundaries with a more engaging style,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Other People\u2019s Dollars, and Their Place in Global Economics", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySydney, Australia \u2014 Soon after arriving here, I stopped at an A.T.M.; I needed some dollars, and all I had were dollars.O.K., weak joke. What I needed were Australian dollars \u2014 Aussies \u2014 not U.S. greenbacks. There are actually four English-speaking countries with dollars of their own; the others are the Canadian loonie and the New Zealand kiwi. And you can learn a lot about the global economy, busting some popular monetary myths, by comparing those currencies and how they serve their economies.All four dollar nations are, if you take the long view, highly successful economies. True, America is still recovering from its worst slump since the Great Depression, Canada is being hit hard by plunging oil prices and Australia is feeling nervous as its markets in China wobble. But we\u2019re all wealthy nations that have weathered economic storms better than most of the rest of the world.While the dollar nations have all done well, however, they occupy very different positions in the world economy. In part, I mean that quite literally: Australia and New Zealand are a long way from everyplace, while Canada, most of whose people live near its southern border, is effectively closer to the United States than it is to itself. And the U.S. is, of course, an economic giant around whose gravity smaller economies revolve.So what can we learn from these dollar success stories? What myths can we bust?First, we learn that even relatively small countries closely linked to big neighbors can maintain monetary independence.In Europe, you often hear the claim that opting out of the euro, choosing either to retain or to restore one\u2019s national currency, would be disastrous. A dozen years ago, when Swedish voters rejected the euro, they did so despite overwhelming insistence by the elite that doing so would be a terrible mistake. But the elite were wrong, and that should have been made obvious by the example of Canada, which has done fine, and retained a lot of monetary autonomy, despite its close ties to the superpower next door.Second, we learn that what right-wingers call currency \u201cdebasement\u201d \u2014 a decline in a currency\u2019s value in terms of other currencies \u2014 can be a very good thing. Canada was able to combine spending cuts with strong growth in the 1990s because exports were raised by the depreciation of the loonie. Australia rode through the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 with little damage thanks largely to a falling Aussie. In both cases times would have been much tougher if the countries had been using U.S. dollars, or worse yet been on the gold standard.Third, we learn that people pay far too much attention to the role national currencies play in the international monetary system.It\u2019s true that the U.S. dollar is special: It\u2019s a reserve currency that other countries accumulate; it\u2019s the currency in which many international contracts are priced. And you often hear assertions that the widespread use of U.S. dollars outside our national jurisdiction has big implications, for better or worse.But a glance at Australia shows that both positive and negative claims about the international role of the dollar are wildly exaggerated. The Aussie dollar plays no special role in the world monetary system, yet Australia has consistently attracted bigger inflows of capital relative to the size of its economy \u2014 and run proportionately bigger trade deficits \u2014 than the United States.What\u2019s important for both capital and trade, it turns out, is whether your economy offers good investment opportunities under an umbrella of legal and political stability. Whether you control an international currency is a trivial concern by comparison.So we can learn a lot by following the dollars \u2014 all the dollars, not just those bearing portraits of dead presidents. And what we learn in particular is that monetary economics should be approached pragmatically, not in terms of mystical notions of value.Take it from those who share our language, but not our currency: There are many ways to make money work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Whitney Taps Frank Stella for an Inaugural Retrospective at Its New Home", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s an accident,\u201d Mr. Stella said recently, when asked about his show, which opens at the Whitney on Oct. 30 and was organized with the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. \u201cI\u2019m old. I\u2019m not controversial anymore.\u201d Mr. Stella has done more than any other living artist to carry abstract art, the house style of modernism, into the postmodern era. Yet his passion for form, for contemplating weight and balance, has made him an outlier in an age of nutty auction prices and art that adopts the global economy as its very subject. By his own admission, Mr. Stella does not keep up with the current scene. \u201cIn all honesty,\u201d he said, \u201cI never got beyond Julian Schnabel and that generation. He was the \u201980s, right?\u201d What does he think of Jeff Koons, whose shiny balloon dogs and other pop trophies made up the most recent retrospective at the Whitney? \u201cYou know what I always thought he was like? The Franklin Mint. He\u2019s from Pennsylvania, and he outdid them. He outshone them! It\u2019s for very wealthy people with no taste.\u201dMr. Stella does confess to admiring at least one midcareer artist, Kara Walker, whose monumental sculpture of a sphinx-like deity was displayed to great acclaim in a former sugar factory in Brooklyn last year. \u201cI saw it on YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was interesting.\u201d It was a weekday morning, and we were in his Volkswagen, zipping along an empty stretch of highway en route to his studio in the Hudson Valley. He lives in a townhouse in Greenwich Village and keeps an office there but commutes on weekdays to his studio in Rock Tavern, N.Y., about 60 miles north of the city. As he explained in his raspy, intense voice, \u201cI was born to drive.\u201dIn those days, Mr. Stella\u2019s much-publicized driving violations helped foster an image of him as a kind of artist-racer whose every gesture seemed accelerated. He was only 23 when he arrived in New York, straight out of Princeton, and produced his now-historic \u201cBlack Paintings,\u201d a series of large-scale, austerely monastic canvases divided into right-angled patterns of horizontal and vertical stripes. They garnered enormous attention, much of it negative. As objects, the paintings were flat and screen-like, and critics saw them as a calculated affront to the sensual paint handling of Willem de Kooning, the Abstract Expressionist who was then the senior figure of the New York School.Later, in art history textbooks, Mr. Stella would be acknowledged as a pioneering figure who pushed Abstract Expressionism into the shade and inaugurated the Minimalist movement of the \u201960s. But as the years progressed and gallerygoers became accustomed to stumbling upon plexiglass boxes and stacks of red bricks by his colleagues, Mr. Stella went in the opposite direction. His goal, he declared, was to imbue abstract art with the depth and density of old master paintings. He became the Master of the Shaped Canvas, abandoning the stable form of the rectangle to push the contours of his canvases into funky asymmetry. Each new phase of his work seemed to introduce an added quotient of pictorial drama, from the eye-warming \u201cCopper Paintings\u201d to the lopsided \u201cIrregular Polygons\u201d to the \u201cExotic Birds\u201d of the mid-\u201970s, which pursued the exuberant gesture as assiduously as his early work renounced it.Departing from his usual role, Adam D. Weinberg, the director of the Whitney, will install the Stella retrospective in New York. He and Mr. Stella have been friends at least since the days when Mr. Weinberg was the director of the Addison Gallery of American Art, where Mr. Stella is an involved alumnus. \u201cWe have a very good relationship,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said. \u201cHe pushes me, and I try to push him back.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Weinberg pushed very hard to persuade Mr. Stella that the show should cover his entire career. He won. The exhibition will go back to 1958, opening with paintings such as \u201cEast Broadway\u201d and \u201cAstoria,\u201d sweet abstractions with fuzzy-edged stripes of yellow and black. They betray the influence of Jasper Johns\u2019s paintings of American flags, which Mr. Stella saw at the Castelli Gallery when he was still at Princeton. \u201cAll of the painterly intensity was in the service of an organized geometry,\u201d Mr. Stella said of Mr. Johns\u2019s flags. \u201cThat made a big impression on me. The painterliness was already pre-ordered.\u201d By then we had arrived at his Rock Tavern studio, a massive, 40,000-square-foot warehouse that can fairly be described as underfurnished. There\u2019s almost nowhere to sit, except for a battered lawn chair that serves as Mr. Stella\u2019s throne. As he chomped on his Cuban cigar, he paid no attention to a bird that flew in, perhaps through a skylight.The studio is in the same building as the Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry, conveniently so. Photographs of Mr. Stella in an orange construction hat attest to his long, fertile history with the foundry; in the \u201980s and \u201990s, he turned out a body of shimmering, scrappy, jumbo-size abstract sculptures in aluminum and stainless steel. Some are too big to fit in his studio and are kept on a grassy field across the street, looming up like giant, silvery spacecraft that have landed in the middle of nowhere. The studio is packed with works spanning all phases of his career, and as we walked around, I was struck by the preponderance of undulating wave shapes lodged in his abstract forms. There were billowing sails turned upside down and inside out, and masts tilting at sharp angles. It seemed, for a moment, that the ocean was everywhere. Significantly, Mr. Stella, who always works in series, was consumed for years by his \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d series. He named each piece for one of the 135 chapters in Melville\u2019s novel, which was panned by critics when it came out.Wondering whether nautical references in his work have any basis in biography, I asked Mr. Stella if he enjoys the ocean. \u201cWe had a family house in Ipswich,\u201d he replied, referring to a town north of Boston where he spent the summers of his childhood. \u201cIpswich is a real water place.\u201d He grew up in a relatively well-to-do Italian-American family, in Malden, Mass. His father was a gynecologist, and his mother was an artistically inclined housewife who attended fashion school and later took up landscape painting. She signed her pictures Constance Stella and exhibited at the Malden Public Library. \u201cThey\u2019re not bad,\u201d Mr. Stella said of her landscapes. \u201cShe said she could do abstracts, too.\u201d His mother died in 2006, at 92. \u201cI still own my mother\u2019s house,\u201d he said in a quieter voice. \u201cIt\u2019s getting a little dilapidated.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to give it up.\u201dHe added brightly that his son Michael \u201cis interested in it, and I think I am going to fix it up for him.\u201d Michael, a radiologist living in Boston, is among Mr. Stella\u2019s five children and the product of his first marriage to Barbara Rose, a prominent critic and art historian. Mr. Stella\u2019s current wife, Harriet McGurk, is a pediatrician. Looking back on his sometimes chaotic personal life, he appeared relieved at how his children turned out. \u201cI think it\u2019s not a bad testament to the art world,\u201d he said. Lately, Mr. Stella has been making spindly and surprisingly lightweight sculptures, which will close the Whitney show. His Scarlatti pieces, shown last November at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in Chelsea, are named for Domenico Scarlatti, the 18th-century Italian composer who wrote sonatas for the harpsichord. Despite the musical titles, the sculptures can feel impressively gritty, like a bouquet of flowers run over by a car. The Scarlatti pieces rely on the latest advances in digital fabrication. \u201cI prepare the geometry and send it to the people with the machinery,\u201d Mr. Stella said matter-of-factly. His assistants do the initial work on a desktop computer in his New York home office, with Mr. Stella directing from a chair. He has, at his disposal, an online library of ready-made shapes \u2014 the famous waves and smoke rings, the spiraling hat shape, the geometric star, all of which are lifted from his earlier work. You can see his process as a form of efficient recycling. He emails his sketches to a 3-D printing company. The assorted parts come back to him in a bone-white, plasticlike resin.A studio assistant is responsible for painting Mr. Stella\u2019s work, though it has nothing to do with brushes. \u201cThe paint goes in a gun with a compressor,\u201d Mr. Stella said, adding that he favors automotive paint of the kind used on racecars. Mr. Stella\u2019s penchant for computer design allies him with the hands-off strategies of many younger artists. Yet this subject does not interest Mr. Stella, who swears that computers have had no effect on the look or the formal content of his art. Rather, he uses computers for the sake of convenience, he said. They allow him to sustain his inventiveness as he nears 80 and his physical strength diminishes. During the past six years, he said, both of his knees were exchanged for titanium implants. He has also had a hip replacement and \u201ca couple of back operations.\u201d Asked when he last picked up a paintbrush, he said it was probably in 2000, and explained: \u201cIt\u2019s all about your body balance. I would fall over now trying to paint.\u201dIs something lost when the hand is subtracted from the process of art? Mr. Stella protested vigorously. \u201cYeah, but my hands are all over it!\u201dIt was a puzzling comment. Perhaps he meant it metaphorically \u2014 hands as a symbol of the powers of the imagination. But I suspected he meant it literally. Even if he no longer paints, he uses his hands to help manipulate the coiling armatures of his sculptures. Moreover, he is still recycling shapes he drew by hand however many years ago, shapes that swim through his work like so many insistent memories. Memories of water, memories of de Kooning\u2019s swooping, slipping brush strokes. Mr. Stella could have been talking about himself when he told me, \u201cDe Kooning was once asked how he felt about celestial space\u201d \u2014 the heavens, the stars, and all that. \u201cHe said he was only interested in the space he could reach with his hands.\u201d Browse museum & gallery listings for the fall season and beyond.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Minimum Wage: Getting to $15", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe debate over the federal minimum wage in the nascent presidential campaign is really two debates: one among Democrats and one among Republicans.Fifteen dollars, phased in gradually, is the better option. It would be adequate and feasible, assuming that policy makers also take steps to raise middle-class wages, which would include tough enforcement of updated laws on overtime, scheduling, worker classification and other labor issues.If there were no federal minimum, states would be free to perpetuate poverty level wages. Under the law in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, there is no state minimum wage; in Georgia and Wyoming, the state minimums are $5.15 an hour.Markets do reliably establish the prices of goods and services when businesses have to compete. When businesses compete for workers, for example, wages rise because employees gain a modicum of bargaining power. The law has long recognized, however, that low-wage workers seldom have bargaining power. An adequate federal minimum wage effectively substitutes for that lack.The job of economic leaders is to help ensure not only rising profits but also rising wages at all pay levels. The Democratic candidates get that a robust minimum wage is vital to that challenge. The Republicans do not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Price of Crude Oil Tumbles After Soaring for 3 Days", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 After three days of spiking oil prices, a barrel of crude tumbled back nearly 8 percent on Tuesday, renewing despair in the oil patch. At the same time, ConocoPhillips announced it was cutting its global work force by 10 percent.The two events were not directly linked, but they combined to reinforce the widespread notion around the oil fields and corporate headquarters in cities like Houston and Oklahoma City that the declining fortunes of the industry will not reverse anytime soon.\u201cOur industry is undergoing a dramatic downturn,\u201d Daren Beaudo, a ConocoPhillips spokesman, said in an email statement. \u201cAs we have assessed the implications of lower prices on our business, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision that work force reductions will be necessary.\u201dThe company will cut 1,800 employees, most of them in North America. More than 500 of ConocoPhillips\u2019s 3,750 employees in Houston, the company\u2019s base, will be cut, and another 400 will lose their jobs in Canada. The company had already cut 1,000 jobs this year. The job cuts are part of a general restructuring that includes reductions in future deepwater exploration.Before the ConocoPhillips announcement, at least 176,000 oil workers had lost their jobs globally since 2014, according to Swift Worldwide Resources, an oil and gas recruitment agency.There have been a scattering of bankruptcies in the industry, and a growing number of companies have already suspended their dividends or sold off assets at bargain-basement prices to pay interest on their debts.Oil markets have been whipsawed in recent days by contradictory reports.On Monday, a commentary accompanying an OPEC market report suggested that the cartel was willing to sit down with non-OPEC producers to shore up prices. With Venezuela already talking to Russia about how to stabilize the market, some traders concluded that perhaps Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were rethinking their strategy of pumping more oil even as prices were falling.At the same time, data released by the Energy Department this week showed that domestic oil production may have peaked at 9.6 million barrels a day in April and has since fallen by more than 300,000 barrels a day. If that trend were to continue, a drop of as much as a million barrels a day of American production could come off the global market by late next year, relieving the current glut.Wall Street analysts treated the recent spike in oil prices \u2014 which surpassed 20 percent over the three trading days from last Thursday through Monday \u2014 with caution if not derision.Several warned that there was no sign that Saudi Arabia was about to cut production, and said that traders were being motivated more by fear than reasonable analysis.\u201cSharp gains over the past three trading sessions were driven by a combination of short covering and chart readers again looking to call a bottom falsely,\u201d according to a Citi Research investment note this week.The American benchmark price for oil dropped 7.7 percent, to $45.41 a barrel on Tuesday. The global benchmark fell 8.5 percent, to $49.56 a barrel. Both are less than half the levels of last summer.Many analysts say that the price of crude could drop another $10 in the short term, especially if the Chinese economy continues to slow. That would be good for consumers, who could see the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline decline to $2 in many parts of the country over the next few months.But at current prices, the glut is probably not sustainable. Much of the oil produced around the world is no longer profitable \u2014 particularly in the Canadian oil sands and deepwater fields around the Western Hemisphere and Africa.Already, companies are dropping their investments in long-range projects, and recent auctions for offshore fields held in Mexico and the United States have attracted little interest.A sharp drop in drilling in American shale fields has not led to a significant reduction in production. But that is likely to change in the coming months, since the productivity of the typical shale oil well declines by more than 60 percent after its first year in production.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "Francis in AmericaFrancis, the first Latin American pope, has drawn from his life in Argentina to try to create a humbler papacy, albeit one with lofty ambitions. His push for change has stirred hope and anxiety.Supported byThis Mass was offered in the small chapel of the Vatican guesthouse where Francis had chosen to live \u2014 not, as in years past, at the ornate Apostolic Palace. His audience was not the cardinals of the Roman Curia, but gardeners, janitors and Vatican office workers. And Francis was not merely presiding, as had Pope John Paul II. He was preaching, without notes, as if he were a simple parish priest.If one with a big message.\u201cThe church asks all of us to change certain things,\u201d Francis said during one of his morning homilies, as he invoked a Scripture reading from St. Paul. \u201cShe asks us to let go of decadent structures \u2014 they are useless.\u201dThe symbolism of the morning services, which Francis now holds four times a week, is clear: a humbler papacy, where the pope is foremost a pastor to the flock, not a king. But a humbler papacy hardly means humbler papal ambitions. Francis is not just trying to change the Roman Catholic Church. He seems determined to change the world.His humble persona has made him immensely popular, a smiling figure plunging into crowds at St. Peter\u2019s Square. He speaks in deeply personal terms about people discarded by the global economy, whether refugees drowned at sea or women forced into prostitution. His blistering critiques of environmental destruction have seized the world\u2019s attention.But he is also an inscrutable tactician whose push to change the church has stirred anxiety and hope \u2014 and some skepticism. Many conservatives project their fears onto him. Many liberals assume he is a kindred spirit. Others argue that Francis is less concerned about left or right than he is about reversing the church\u2019s declining popularity in Latin America and beyond.\u201cFrancis is a great showman,\u201d said Rub\u00e9n Rufino Dri, a longtime critic of Francis and an emeritus professor of the sociology of religion at the University of Buenos Aires. He added, \u201cHis repositioning of the church is paternalistic. It is not a strategy for empowering its followers. This is by no means a revolution.\u201dFrancis has not fully revealed his hand. But already his spiritual mission to place the poor at the center of the church has enabled him to thrust it to the center of the global debate on issues such as climate change, migration and the post-2008 rethinking of capitalist economics.To some degree, the question of how Francis will change the church \u2014 and its role in society \u2014 misses the point that much change has already occurred. Doctrine is the same, but Francis has changed its emphasis, projecting a merciful, welcoming tone in a church that had been shattered by clerical sexual abuse scandals and identified with theological rigidity. He has emphasized its historic connection to the destitute while sidelining culture war issues. In turn, his geopolitical influence, and that of the church, has risen.\u201cHe does have a good deal of soft power, and it is not only among Catholics,\u201d said Joseph S. Nye Jr., a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cMany of the popes have certainly said the words about poverty. But what Francis has been able to do is put a focus on it that isn\u2019t blurred or distracted by other things.\u201dHis visit to the United States will pose a critical test. His papacy has firmly emphasized the \u201cperipheries\u201d \u2014 both existentially and geographically \u2014 as he has pointedly visited smaller countries like Albania, Sri Lanka, Bosnia, the Philippines, Ecuador and Bolivia. By heading to Washington from Cuba, Francis is repeating his point that the peripheries are connected to the centers of power \u2014 and no country more represents elite economic and political power than the United States.Through gestures and words, Francis has repeatedly challenged elites, inside the church and out. He has attacked an insular Catholic hierarchy for focusing too much on dogma and \u201cspiritual worldliness,\u201d and too little on ordinary people. He has attacked prevailing global economic orthodoxy \u2014 the belief that markets and the pursuit of wealth will lift all boats \u2014 as a false ideology, inadequate for fully addressing the needs of the poor.In the United States, Francis\u2019 biting critiques of the excesses of capitalism \u2014 if ringing true to many people \u2014 have caused discomfort even among some sympathizers and outright disdain from critics, who have called him a Marxist or a Communist. Those who have known Francis for years laugh at those labels, yet they agree that he can be elusive, having refused to be placed neatly inside an ideological box since his early days as a young Jesuit leader in Argentina.\u201cHe delights in confounding categorizations,\u201d said Austen Ivereigh, author of the biography \u201cThe Great Reformer: Francis and the Making of a Radical Pope.\u201d \u201cThere is a sense in which the elites always want to own him, and he\u2019s always eluding them.\u201dFrom the moment he stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and greeted the masses after his unexpected election in March 2013, Francis made history as the first Latin American pope. He even told a joke that night about how \u201chis fellow cardinals\u201d had gone to the \u201cend of the world\u201d to find a pope.It was a lighthearted reminder of the great distance to his native Argentina from the Vatican. But what now seems clear is that Francis was not only telling a joke. The \u201cend of the world\u201d was a metaphor for the slums, and the worldview of the Latin American church that he was bringing to the Vatican.So to better understand the pope of gardeners and janitors and the poor, it is best to start in Argentina, where the man who would become Francis was named Jorge Mario Bergoglio.The Archbishop of the SlumsFor many Argentines, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (pronounced Ber-GOAL-io) was a mystery. When he became archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998, he converted the official residence into a hostel for priests and moved into the downtown diocesan office building. He took a small bedroom with a portable heater that he switched on when the building\u2019s heating system automatically shut down on weekends. He often cooked himself meals in a small kitchen.He avoided the limelight, rarely speaking to the media, and spent little time in the affluent parts of the capital. His predecessor as archbishop had courted Argentina\u2019s political elites (which led to a later corruption scandal), but Archbishop Bergoglio erected a divide. His focus was Argentina\u2019s poor. He created a cadre of priests who worked and lived in the slums of Buenos Aires, and he made regular visits, leading religious processions or saying Mass. Before every Easter, he visited prison inmates or AIDS patients or the elderly.\u201cHis papacy is a clear continuity, above all, in his focus on the poor,\u201d said Father Augusto Zampini Davies, who once worked in the Buenos Aires slum of Bajo Boulogne. \u201cThe church \u2014 those that appointed him \u2014 wanted a change. And they wanted a change from the periphery. But perhaps what some did not predict is that when somebody starts to see the world from the viewpoint of the poorest, he undergoes a profound transformation.\u201dAs a 16-year-old, Jorge was going to meet friends when he was overcome by an urge to detour into a local basilica in Buenos Aires. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know what happened next,\u201d Cardinal Bergoglio said during a 2012 radio interview with a community station in a Buenos Aires slum. \u201cI felt like someone grabbed me from inside and took me to the confessional.\u201dThe teenager stepped out of the confessional convinced that he would become a priest. And even though his family was deeply Catholic, his mother, Regina, opposed her oldest child entering the priesthood, relenting years later after his Jesuit ordination, when she knelt and asked for his blessing.Among Catholics, Jesuits are famous as missionaries, intellectuals and educators \u2014 and for often being stubbornly independent, skeptical and politically adept. They helped create modern Argentina but were temporarily dissolved in 1773 by Pope Clement XIV in a pivotal moment in Latin American history: Clement sided with European monarchs trying divvy up South America, while the Jesuits sided with the indigenous populations living in independent communities known as reductions.For Francis, the transformative event of his early priesthood was the Second Vatican Council, the meetings from 1962 to 1965, which stirred sharp internal debates and ended with the church adopting a new openness. Mass could now be celebrated in native languages, not just Latin, and the church resolved to open unprecedented dialogue with members other faiths, including Jews.But for many Catholics, the council proved deeply unsettling and politically divisive. By the 1970s, the Jesuits were divided, partly over different interpretations on how to achieve social justice, and the number of new priests dropped sharply. In Argentina, several Jesuits had embraced a Marxist-influenced strain of liberation theology, a Latin American movement calling for structural change to help the poor.At only 36, Father Bergoglio was placed in charge of Argentina\u2019s Jesuits. He would later acknowledge his immaturity for such a position \u2014 and his lack of preparation. But he won a loyal following and was praised for replenishing the numbers of new priests.However, his hard-nosed style also brought him enemies. He would be dogged for decades by accusations that he failed to protect two priests who were kidnapped and tortured by the brutal military government ruling Argentina during the 1970s \u2014 allegations that have been challenged by biographers and were later refuted by one of the two priests. Among some Jesuits, he was considered an archconservative.It would not be the last time someone tried to put him into an ideological box.\u2018Dung of the Devil\u2019On a Tuesday morning this June, Pope Francis stood inside the chapel of the Santa Marta guesthouse and spoke about poverty and the Gospel. There was a four-month waiting list to attend one of his morning services. And Francis still reserves the service mostly for ordinary people, or missionaries, priests and nuns, but Vatican Radio is allowed to transmit excerpts from his message globally.His message, not surprisingly, often comes back to poverty. Poverty, Francis noted on June 16, is \u201ca word that always embarrasses.\u201d He said it was common to hear complaints that \u201cthis priest talks too much about poverty, this bishop speaks of poverty, this Christian, this nun talks about poverty,\u201d adding, \u201cAren\u2019t they a little Communist, right?\u201d\u201cOnce capital becomes an idol and guides people\u2019s decisions, once greed for money presides over the entire socioeconomic system, it ruins society, it condemns and enslaves men and women, it destroys human fraternity, it sets people against one another and, as we clearly see, it even puts at risk our common home,\u201d one of Francis\u2019 speeches in Bolivia asserted.To some conservatives in the United States, the Argentine pope seems to be making a frontal assault on the American way. Rush Limbaugh blasted him as a Marxist. Others labeled him a communist or socialist. Some affluent Catholic donors withdrew pledges or expressed discomfort.\u201cI hope I\u2019m not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don\u2019t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope,\u201d Jeb Bush, a Republican presidential candidate and a Catholic, said in response to the environmental encyclical.The labels rang false to many who knew Francis in Argentina. In Buenos Aires, Francis sharply criticized Marxism, especially as some priests sought to intermingle the dialectics of violent class struggle with the social justice goals of Catholic teaching. Later, he sharply criticized the neo-liberal belief that market economics were a cure-all for the poor.\u201cHe is very critical of ideology because ideologies come from intellectuals and politicians who want to manipulate the hearts of the people,\u201d said Guzm\u00e1n Carriquiry Lecour, secretary of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and a longtime friend of the pope. \u201cFor him, ideologies hide and defame reality.\u201dDuring the 1970s, Francis instead embraced an Argentine derivation of liberation theology, which was known as the theology of the people. It focused on native culture and Argentine traditions, an implicit rejection of the colonialist legacy. Faith derived from the poor, the theology argued, and the poor were central to Christianity. Unlike systems contrived by elites or intellectuals, the Gospel was for everyone.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to use liberal or Marxist lenses, so they looked for another type of theory to explain Latin American and Argentine society by looking to our history,\u201d said Father Juan Carlos Scannone, an Argentine Jesuit and prominent proponent of the theology. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that Francis is a people\u2019s theologian, but he has certainly been strongly influenced by it.\u201dEconomic upheaval has convulsed Argentina for much of the past century. As a child, Francis grew up knowing that his grandparents and other relatives in Argentina had been deeply affected by the global ripples of the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression. During Francis\u2019 childhood in the 1940s, Argentina\u2019s Catholic Church was nationalistic and closely identified with the political movement known as Per\u00f3nism, after Gen. Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n.Over decades, Per\u00f3nism would mutate, blending populism, authoritarianism and nationalism, with Per\u00f3n ultimately splitting from the Catholic Church. As a young priest during the military dictatorship in 1971, Francis ministered to the Iron Guard, a worker-based social justice group working for the return of Per\u00f3n, who had been exiled to Spain.Mr. Ivereigh, the biographer, argues that Francis eventually rejected political ideologies and focused on the pueblo fiel \u2014 the faithful \u2014 while becoming increasingly outspoken against politicians, whom he thought did too little for the poor. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis mobilized the church in response to Argentina\u2019s economic crisis of 2001-02, expanding the number of priests assigned to the slums, opening food kitchens and opening schools, clinics and drug rehab centers as state services receded.He also castigated Argentina\u2019s political leaders during the traditional Te Deum service, often with the president in attendance. (The service coincides with Argentina\u2019s anniversary of the May Revolution, a precursor to national independence.)His rebukes would infuriate different leaders, including former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner. His critics argued that he was interfering in secular affairs and playing his own political games.\u201cHe takes risks,\u201d said Rabbi Abraham Skorka, a Jewish leader in Buenos Aires and a close friend to the pope. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t stay in a comfortable position.\u201dArchbishop Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, an Argentine who has served in the Vatican for more than 40 years, said Francis is not condemning capitalism in total, but he is criticizing the indifference it fosters toward the poor.\u201cThe pope, of course, doesn\u2019t have a solution \u2014 the economic solution,\u201d said Monsignor S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, who is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. \u201cBut the pope is like a light on the street to say: \u2018This is not the way. This way sacrifices many people and leaves many people excluded.\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cThe pope is concerned that the plutocracy is destroying democracy.\u201dKen Hackett, the United States ambassador to the Holy See, argues that Francis\u2019 economic views have been wrongly simplified and scoffs at the suggestion that the pope is a socialist as \u201ca na\u00efve characterization.\u201dMr. Hackett added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he hates capitalism. I think he hates the excesses.\u201dTo a degree, Francis seems to be lashing out against the contemporary primacy of economics over faith. He believes the answers are found with the Gospel, not with Adam Smith or Karl Marx.\u2018Europe Was Over\u2019Francis sat on a white chair on a raised burgundy dais, while a Capuchin monk offered a homily on the environment. As tourists pointed cellphones at the altar, the ritual, grandeur and continuity of the service \u2014 and the sheer weight of gold leaf and marble in the basilica \u2014 seemed to make a mockery of Francis\u2019 goal to create \u201ca poor church of the poor.\u201dSince then, Francis has devolved some powers outside the Vatican to a de facto cabinet of nine cardinals from around the world, known as the C9. He has appointed the blunt-spoken Australian George Pell to lead a new economy secretariat charged with putting Vatican finances in order. He has created a new commission to address the clerical sexual abuse crisis. Another panel has helped formulate the recent reforms to Catholic rules on marriage annulments. And still another commission has been charged with modernizing and consolidating the Vatican\u2019s sprawling communications operations.However, Francis\u2019 reforms are incomplete, and many advocates for sex-abuse victims say he has still failed to fully confront the crisis. But the change he speaks about most often is the one stirring the most resistance: reshaping the pastoral approach of the church and the application of church doctrine.\u201cThe doctrine has to evolve over time, or it is not doctrine,\u201d said Father Humberto Miguel Ya\u00f1ez, a Jesuit moral theologian at Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and a former Bergoglio prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Argentina. \u201cThe doctrine is the transmission of the Gospel. To transmit the Gospel, you have to get in touch with contemporary culture. Every era has its own problems. Things don\u2019t stay the same.\u201dInternal church warfare hews to a language of its own, and many reformers hope that Francis\u2019 repeated emphasis of themes like \u201cmercy\u201d and \u201copenness\u201d signals that he is preparing to redirect Catholic teaching on gays, the divorced and remarried, unmarried couples and other divisive social issues.This year, Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller, who is the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal enforcer as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, told a French Catholic newspaper that his office would expand its writ \u201cto provide theological structure\u201d to the papacy because Francis was more a pastor than a theologian. Many interpreted his comments not only as patronizing, but also as an open attempt to rein in the Argentine pope.\u201cThose who might have considered themselves insiders in the previous regime don\u2019t know how the new one is functioning,\u201d said one senior Vatican official who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cFor the pope, it is a way of keeping his own autonomy. People just don\u2019t know where he\u2019s coming from, or who his closest advisers are.\u201dAfter Benedict\u2019s resignation, many pundits predicted the election of a pope from Latin America, home to 40 percent of the world\u2019s Catholics. But doing so has meant more than checking a demographic box. Francis arrived bearing the worldview of a Latin American church that, over recent decades, had developed its own brand of Catholicism.That vision was expressed most clearly in 2007, when Latin American bishops met at a Marian shrine in Aparecida, Brazil. There, they produced an agenda to evangelize in the streets; to prioritize migrants, the poor, the sick and those on society\u2019s margins; to embrace popular religion, or how ordinary people worship; and to promote environmental protection.The chief editor of the document? Francis. He would take the \u201cAparecida Document\u201d with him to Rome as a blueprint for his papacy.\u201cEurope was over,\u201d said Vincenzo Paglia, head of the Pontifical Council for the Family. \u201cIt had no more energy, not even to produce a pope. That is why the pope could only come from Latin America. Not from Africa, not from Asia \u2014 they weren\u2019t ready yet.\u201dThe Mona LisaFrancis is practicing his English. Friends, diplomats and others say he has written his address to Congress and is concentrating on the delivery. He speaks native Spanish, fluent Italian and is conversant in German and French, but friends say he is uncomfortable speaking English. Yet he does not want his pronunciation to interfere with his message, so he is practicing.\u201cHe is aware of the importance of this trip,\u201d Monsignor Paglia said. \u201cHe is getting ready, with an extreme zeal.\u201dThe United States is preparing, too. Activist groups promoting different social causes have been going to Philadelphia in advance of Francis\u2019 appearance. Panels have been convened in Washington and elsewhere to plumb the Francis agenda, the Francis psyche, the \u201cFrancis Effect.\u201dIn Argentina, some people still struggle to recognize the joyous Francis at St. Peter\u2019s Square as the same seemingly dour man who once led the church in Buenos Aires. There, he kept a deliberately low profile and avoided the news media, other than a handful of trusted journalists. As a young Jesuit, Archbishop Bergoglio was known for his \u201cpious long face,\u201d according to Mr. Ivereigh\u2019s biography. He was sometimes called \u201cLa Gioconda,\u201d after the Mona Lisa and her enigmatic smile.\u201cIn some ways, such as his relationship with the media, or his smile, he has changed a bit,\u201d said Father Ya\u00f1ez, the moral theologian. \u201cBut I see the same person and the same coherence.\u201dFrancis has blamed himself for some past conflicts in Argentina, especially with his fellow Jesuits (with whom he has reconciled as pope). In a lengthy 2013 interview with Father Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit, Francis said his \u201cauthoritarian and quick manner of making decisions\u201d as a young Jesuit led him to being wrongly labeled an ultraconservative. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a right-winger,\u201d he added, in the interview that was published in Jesuit magazines around the world.But he is hardly a left-winger, either \u2014 at least in the political context of the United States. Even as some of his social and economic views have inspired the American left, he strongly opposes abortion and believes marriage should be between a man and a woman.\u201cPeople project their aspirations onto him,\u201d the senior Vatican official said. \u201cSome people might have hopes raised that are not going to be fully realized. For some people, there might be an expectation that there might be a lot of institutional change on things like gay marriage or ordination of women.\u201dFrancis does not seem to mind the contradictions, or even regard them as such. He has encouraged open discussion \u2014 even criticism \u2014 in advance of the synod in October. He seems determined to open up the church, yet he has not disclosed the exact path he wants the church to follow.But everyone who knows him agrees that Francis, ultimately, will make a decision. Then the popular, enigmatic pope will show his hand.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Vatican City, and Jonathan Gilbert from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s U.N. Envoy Defends Crackdown Along Border With Colombia", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ambassador, Rafael Ram\u00edrez, a former foreign minister, energy minister and head of the national oil company, said the action was a response to what he called increasingly brazen acts by Colombian smugglers and other criminals, as well as acquiescence by Colombia\u2019s government.He said smugglers had been sending 100,000 barrels of inexpensive Venezuelan gasoline and diesel fuel over the border every day and selling it at enormous profits.\u201cThey smuggle 35 percent of our national production, which has taken a tremendous toll on our economy,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said, punctuating his point with photographs on his laptop of what he described as hoarded smuggler contraband, including trucks and boats piled high with barrels of fuel.Mr. Ram\u00edrez also rejected accusations of an anti-Colombian purge and human rights abuses committed by Venezuela. He noted that his country had long taken in Colombian immigrants and refugees from that country\u2019s legacy of guerrilla war, paramilitary violence, mayhem and economic uncertainty.\u201cIt\u2019s very important to know that Venezuela has welcomed over five and a half million Colombians,\u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez said.He spoke after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro moved to expand the border crackdown, closing a major crossing with Colombia near Maracaibo, Venezuela\u2019s second-largest city, in the northwest corner of the country.Mr. Maduro also declared a state of emergency in parts of the area, which gives added powers to the police and military authorities and restricts some civil liberties, such as the right to protest or hold public gatherings.Venezuela has deported more than 1,000 Colombians as part of the border crackdown, which began Aug. 19. Many more who were living on the Venezuelan side of the border have returned to Colombia out of fear of being targeted.While Mr. Maduro and other Venezuelan officials have blamed paramilitaries and criminals for the smuggling, many economists say it is largely a result of government policies that maintain low prices on gasoline and staple goods, creating an incentive for smugglers who can sell them for much more across the border. The plummeting value of the Venezuelan currency, the bol\u00edvar, has further fueled the illicit trade, since it makes Venezuelan products that much cheaper by comparison.Mr. Ram\u00edrez was responding to what the Venezuelan government has described as one-sided news coverage about the Venezuelan crackdown, which was ordered by Mr. Maduro after three Venezuelan soldiers in a border city were shot and wounded by what he said were Colombian paramilitaries bent on destabilizing Venezuela.Mr. Ram\u00edrez called the smuggling along the border, which stretches more than 1,360 miles, an issue that had been \u201cdeveloping for many years.\"At first, Mr. Maduro shut down a section of the border in the state of T\u00e1chira, closing two important bridges and deporting more than 1,000 Colombian immigrants.He also threatened to tear down the houses in a border neighborhood that he said was home to paramilitaries and smugglers.Mr. Maduro announced the expanded border closing in a television appearance late Monday night.The crackdown has strained relations between Venezuela and Colombia and provoked sharp exchanges between Mr. Maduro and Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos, who has accused Venezuela of mistreating Colombians.Contacted by telephone on Tuesday, a resident along the northern border said that military jets had been flying over the area since Monday and that soldiers had established checkpoints on roads, stopping trucks from approaching the border and allowing only smaller vehicles.The northern border, on both sides, is home to the Wayuu indigenous group. The Wayuu usually move freely across the border, often saying that they do not recognize the distinction between countries.Many Wayuu have long relied on smuggling to earn a living. They have periodically clashed with the authorities cracking down on smuggling, often accusing the military and government officials of engaging in the same activities while targeting the ethnic group.Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and William Neuman from Car\u00e1cas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama and Putin Play Diplomatic Poker Over Syria", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The leaders of the United States and Russia traded blunt criticisms on Monday at the United Nations, essentially blaming each other for the catastrophic war in Syria and the refugee crisis it helped to spawn.The speeches of President Obama, followed more than an hour later by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, dominated the opening of the annual General Assembly of world leaders.Mr. Obama made a forceful defense of diplomacy but also castigated Russia by name multiple times in his speech for its defense of the Syrian government, its takeover of Crimea and its actions supporting Ukrainian rebels.\u201cDangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Those currents include major powers that want to ignore international rules and impose order through force of military power, he said.\u201cIn accordance with this logic, we should support tyrants like Bashar al-Assad who drops barrel bombs to massacre innocent civilians because the alternative is surely worse,\u201d he said in comments that seemed to be aimed directly at Mr. Putin.In what amounted to a basic rebuttal of Mr. Obama, the Russian leader extolled the Syrian leader, saying that he represented stability and that his forces needed support to fight the Islamic State extremists now threatening the region \u2014 even though Mr. Assad\u2019s forces are for the most part fighting rebel groups dedicated to his ouster, not the Islamic State militants.\u201cWe think it\u2019s an enormous mistake to refuse to cooperate with the Syrian government and its armed forces who are valiantly fighting terrorism face to face,\u201d Mr. Putin said.But Mr. Putin, in what appeared to be a step to outmaneuver Mr. Obama on Syria, also spoke of creating \u201ca genuinely broad international coalition\u201d to fight the Islamic State, including a Security Council resolution to \u201ccoordinate\u201d military action.How the United States and its allies will respond to such an idea is unclear. But President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, speaking to reporters later, welcomed the idea of a \u201cbroad coalition\u201d and even a Security Council resolution as long as two conditions were met: a stop to the bombings and a \u201cpolitical transition with departure of Assad.\u201d Mr. Hollande did not elaborate on exactly when Mr. Assad would have to leave.In remarks about foreign Islamic State fighters that seemed clearly aimed at stoking fears in Europe, Mr. Putin said: \u201cWe cannot allow these criminals who have already felt the smell of blood to return back home and continue their evil doings. No one wants this to happen, does he?\u201dMr. Putin did not hear Mr. Obama speak \u2014 the Russian leader had just arrived in New York from Moscow. But the tensions between the two are well known. In a deft bit of diplomacy, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sat in between them during a lunch he hosted for a number of top leaders.Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin clinked glasses after Mr. Ban\u2019s toast.In his own toast, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Ban and said \u201cWe are facing extraordinary challenges today, ones that test our capacity to work together.\u201dLater in the afternoon Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin posed for photographers before a long-awaited private meeting between the two, which lasted for 95 minutes. They shook hands at the start but made no comments, and the details of their discussions were not immediately disclosed.In his earlier speech, Mr. Obama also chided China for its expansions in the South China Sea and Iran for its support of Mr. Assad, as well as the broader anti-American messages that emanate from the Iranians.\u201cChanting \u2018Death to America\u2019 does not create jobs, or make Iran more secure,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Mr. Obama said that he was realistic, but he said realism had to take into account the brutality of the Assad government in Syria, where war has raged for more than four years.\u201cLet\u2019s remember how this started,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Syria conflict. \u201cAssad reacted to peaceful protest by escalating repression and killing and in turn created the environment for the current strife.\u201dSuch violence makes it impossible for the vast majority of Syria\u2019s population to accept Mr. Assad as their leader, Mr. Obama said.Similarly, Mr. Obama said, a fidelity to international rules required that the United States respond forcefully to Russia\u2019s intervention in Crimea and Ukraine. He said that the United States had few economic interests in the region and understood the long history that Russia had with Crimea and Ukraine.\u201cBut we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation is flagrantly violated.\u201d He added: \u201cThat\u2019s the basis of the sanctions that the United States and our partners imposed on Russia. It\u2019s not a desire to return to the Cold War.\u201dMr. Obama told the international body that he commands the most powerful military force on the planet. But no matter how powerful its military or strong its economy, the United States could not solve the world\u2019s problems on its own, he said.He pointed to the war in Iraq where, despite sending more than 100,000 troops and spending trillions of dollars, the United States was unsuccessful in stabilizing the country.Mr. Obama extolled the diplomatic course in which the United States and other world powers had successfully negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran. And, in one of the first lines to yield cheers, he said that the United States had finally acknowledged that its posture toward Cuba had been wrong and that under his watch, diplomatic relations had been restored.\u201cAs these contacts yield progress, I\u2019m confident that our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that should not be in place anymore,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cChange won\u2019t come overnight to Cuba but I\u2019m confident that openness not coercion will support the reforms and better the life that the Cuban people deserve.\u201dMr. Obama made a forceful case for democracy and pointed out that \u201cdictatorships are unstable.\u201d\u201cYou can jail your opponents but you can\u2019t imprison ideas,\u201d he said.President Xi Jinping of China, speaking later in the day, reiterated what he called the Chinese priority of peace and stability for its economic development. He also demonstrated China\u2019s enormous financial influence by announcing a $1 billion fund for the United Nations, and said his country would create a permanent standby peacekeeping contingent of 8,000 police and troops in case it is needed by the world body.Despite a swooning Russian economy and Western condemnation of Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine, Mr. Putin seems to have surprised the Obama administration with an intelligence-sharing alliance with Iraq, Syria and Iran about the Islamic State militant group that occupies parts of Syria and Iraq.The Russians and Americans even squabbled in recent days over who asked whom for the meeting between the two presidents.Mr. Putin has said that Mr. Assad is a vital bulwark against the Islamic State; Mr. Obama has said that Mr. Assad must leave before the conflict in Syria can be resolved.President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, in his speech, offered to help to \u201cbring about democracy\u201d in the two conflicts where it has influence, in Syria and Iran, even as he signaled his support for the Russian notion of a Security Council resolution.\u201cWe propose that the fight against terrorism be incorporated into a binding international document and no country be allowed to use terrorism for the purpose of intervention in the affairs of other countries,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.Mr. Obama was the first in a line of speakers from the big powers scheduled to speak at the 70th annual session of the United Nations General Assembly, where the Syria conflict and its consequences \u2014 the spread of Islamic State jihadism and the surge of refugees into Europe \u2014 were dominant themes.In opening the General Assembly, Mr. Ban struck a somber tone, asserting that: \u201cInequality is growing, trust is fading, and impatience with leadership can be seen and felt far and wide.\u201dThe remarks by Mr. Ban, who is approaching his last year as the secretary general, were unusually pointed.He called to leaders to not stay in power beyond their constitutional terms in office, pressed permanent members of the Security Council to put aside their divisions, called explicitly for an \u201cend to bombings\u201d in Yemen, and named the five countries that, as he said, \u201chold the key\u201d to peace in Syria: Russia, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Turkey.Mr. Ban said 100 million civilians are in need of aid, for which the United Nations has pleaded for $20 billion. He rebuked the rich for not giving more, giving examples: One third of what the organization needs for Syria and Iraq has been received and for Gambia, whose children are among the hungriest in the world, nothing has come in.He stepped up his criticism of countries that shut their borders to refugees. \u201cI urge Europe to do more,\u201d reminding the Continent\u2019s leaders that \u201cafter the Second World War it was Europeans seeking assistance.\u201dHe marked two pieces of good news. He praised the nuclear pact that the world powers reached with Iran. And with some relief, he noted that the world had come together to stop the Ebola virus from spreading.President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, who was the first to speak, scolded those countries that have tried to prohibit refugees fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, pointing out that Brazil hosts Syrians and Haitians now as it opened the doors to Europeans and Asians a century ago. \u201cIn a world where goods, capital, data and ideas flow freely, it is absurd to impede the free flow of people,\u201d she said.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Exodus of Syrians Highlights Political Failure of the West", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe migrant crisis in Europe is essentially self-inflicted,\u201d said Lina Khatib, a research associate at the University of London and until recently the head of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. \u201cHad European countries sought serious solutions to political conflicts like the one in Syria, and dedicated enough time and resources to humanitarian assistance abroad, Europe would not be in this position today.\u201dSome of these people had thought they would stick it out in Syria, and they are different from earlier refugees, who tended to be poor and vulnerable, or wanted by the government, or from areas hard-hit early in the civil war. Now those departing include more middle-class or wealthy people, more supporters of the government, and more residents of areas that were initially safe.As the numbers of displaced Syrians mounted to 11 million today from a trickle in 2011, efforts to reach a political solution gained little traction. The United States and Russia bickered in the Security Council while Syrian government warplanes continued indiscriminate barrel bombing, the Islamic State took over new areas, other insurgent groups battled government forces and one another, and Syria\u2019s economy collapsed.\u201cThis is the price of political failure,\u201d he said in Beirut in March.European Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.For neighboring countries alone, just $1.67 billion of the needed $4.5 billion for 2015 has been received. For those displaced in Syria, $908 million has been given of $2.89 billion needed. This week, World Food Program benefits were canceled for 229,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan. Few refugees have been accepted by the regional and global players that have supported combatants in the conflict. The Gulf Arab states and, to a lesser extent, the United States have armed and trained rebel groups, while Russia and Iran have armed and financed the Assad government, but those powers have devoted much less to humanitarian aid. At a recent donors\u2019 meeting in Kuwait, Mr. El Hillo said on Wednesday, he emphasized that \u201cmore can be done, not just by traditional donors but by new donors, chiefly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, to support humanitarian efforts inside Syria.\u201dTalk in the Syrian capital, Damascus, among supporters and opponents of the government alike, has turned to plans for getting overseas, especially to Europe. It is a route taken by everyone from the wealthy, whose money cannot always buy them visas, to the poor, who often sell everything to finance the trip. While rich and poor alike risk an illegal boat ride to Greece from Turkey, those with money can fly or ride on other legs of the journey while the poor walk for days.There are signs everywhere that not all those taking the boats are economically destitute. On flights from Beirut to the Turkish city of Adana, costing hundreds of dollars, flight attendants plead with passengers over the intercom not to take the life jackets. Tourist ferry boats from Greek islands to Athens, with tickets that can cost $100, are full of Syrians.Lebanon is giving transit visas to Syrians who take buses from the border to the Port of Tripoli, and commercial ferries from there to Turkey. Traveling on one recently was Jamal, a government supporter who fled after Islamic State fighters took over Palmyra, where he owned a cafe. Like the other Syrians interviewed, he asked that only his first name be used to avoid jeopardizing his bid for asylum.At first he had moved from place to place inside Syria, living \u201clike a hobo,\u201d he said, but with \u201cno job, no money, no house,\u201d he decided to head to Turkey to work in a cafe.Recently, boats to Greece from Turkey have carried numerous college-educated activists and insurgents who fought both the government and the Islamic State but have given up for now, seeking new lives abroad. Ahmed, 36, an agronomist, said the government office where he worked in Damascus was down to seven employees from 23, after the draft-age men left the country, mostly for Europe.Even wealthy Sunni merchants of Damascus are making plans, including some who, while not big supporters of Mr. Assad, long put business over revolution, helping him hang on until now.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.Abu Moaz, 45, and his two brothers own a cookie factory just outside Damascus, and persevered when government forces occupied the area around it and demanded more and more bribes. They moved the operation to the Midan neighborhood of the capital, but still government militiamen kept stopping their delivery trucks for bribes.\u201cNow we are just working for the checkpoints,\u201d Abu Moaz said just before leaving. \u201cIt is better to start a new life in Germany.\u201dHe spent $3,500 per person for him, his wife and two sons to take the deluxe route \u2014 by ferry from Lebanon to Izmir, Turkey; to Greece in an inflatable smuggler\u2019s boat; and to Germany in a refrigerated truck \u2014 rather than walking for a month.On arrival in Germany, he reported good news: Some of his friends had new ventures that were already thriving. \u201cOne of my friends opened a Damascene restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other opened a sweets shop.\u201dThe boy\u2019s father, Abdullah Kurdi, said in an interview that the family had fled first from Damascus and later from their ancestral home, the Kurdish town of Kobani that has been attacked repeatedly by the Islamic State. They were trying to emigrate to Canada, but could not get permission to travel legally. His son Ghalib, 5, and his wife, Rehan, also drowned.Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, Hwaida Saad from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Vote Said to Be Near on Repeal of Oil Export Ban", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe oil industry has started a major lobbying campaign to generate support in Washington for the repeal of the ban, first imposed during the 1970s oil crisis, a legislative effort that will face tougher opposition in the Senate.\u201cIf there was ever a time to lift the oil export ban, it\u2019s now,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a copy provided by his office of a speech that was given Tuesday in Houston. \u201cLifting the oil export ban will not only help our economy, it will also bolster our geopolitical standing.\u201dSeveral refiners oppose lifting the ban because they fear the action will raise the price of domestic oil.On the Senate side, where at least 60 votes are needed to move most legislation, it remains unclear if supporters of similar legislation that has been introduced separately can attract enough Democrats to pass it. Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, an opponent of the repeal, said he would be working with environmental groups against the repeal effort.Reinstating the export of crude oil, Mr. Markey said, would send the wrong message to political leaders worldwide as the United States pushes them to agree to reduce carbon emissions caused by fossil fuels. He said it would also mean profits for oil companies, perhaps at the cost of higher prices for consumers. The oil industry rejects those arguments.The White House made clear on Tuesday that it did not support the House legislation, saying that the administration, through the Commerce Department, already has the authority to make adjustments in the policy. While not an explicit veto threat, the statement may make it more difficult for supporters of the measure to gather Democratic votes.\u201dThis is a policy decision that is made over at the Commerce Department, and for that reason, we wouldn\u2019t support legislation like the one that\u2019s been put forward by Republicans,\u201d the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said at a briefing.Mr. Earnest then leveled some criticism at Mr. McCarthy, who was giving his speech to a crowd that included oil industry executives, saying that the House leader should instead have used the opportunity to call for cuts in oil industry tax subsidies.\u201cIt is pretty clear once again where Republicans in Congress and their political benefactors stand when it comes to their energy policy priorities,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Superyachts Ride the Waves in Style", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Maxi Yacht Rolex CupIn 1981, the American real estate mogul Jim Kilroy was at the top of the yacht racing world. At the age of 59, he had just won the second Maxi Yacht World Championships in his sleek, white 80-footer, Kialoa IV, in the sparkling waters of the Mediterranean at the fledgling, modern Yacht Club Costa Smeralda in Porto Cervo, Sardinia. Only America\u2019s Cup winners were on a higher pedestal.The maxi yachts had extruded aluminum masts and the interiors were a maze of aluminum and fiberglass frames. Designed to the International Offshore Rule, or I.O.R., they all looked similarly boxy with flush decks and they were all were flat-out racers at the limit of technology.At the time, Irvine Laidlaw, a young Scottish businessman 20 years Kilroy\u2019s junior, was cutting his racing teeth on a diminutive 34-foot sloop named Highland Fling. More than three decades later, 35 of today\u2019s top maxis gather starting Sunday for the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup, the reincarnation of the Maxi Worlds, at Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, and the maxis of the 1980s are relics of the past. But Laidlaw, now 71 and a successful investor, philanthropist and yachtsman, won\u2019t be there: He is building a 115-foot superyacht of carbon fiber with a luxurious cruising interior to race among a fleet of other extravagant craft next year in the 2016 Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup.Laidlaw\u2019s boat is being built by the venerable Finnish yard Nautor\u2019s Swan and was designed by Germ\u00e1n Frers of Argentina, considered by many to be the best yacht designer today.The Scot is missing his first Rolex Cup in many years while waiting for his new Highland Fling. But he said the races this year would showcase the most competitive superyacht racing ever.\u201cThe class has become more and more active in racing,\u201d Laidlaw said by Skype from his home in Sardinia. \u201cThere are several boats being built in this size right now specifically to do more racing. Almost every boat gets more of a racing boat treatment than cruising now.\u201dThe average length of a boat in this year\u2019s fleet is well over 100 feet, or 30 meters, with the largest, the emerald-green ketch Hetairos, coming in at just over 200 feet. In the smaller Maxi 72 division, also called the Mini Maxis, there will be six boats competing for the world championship. These boats are designed to a rule, much like the I.O.R.But there is no rule in the Maxi Yacht division for the Rolex Cup. And only Jim Clark\u2019s Comanche fits as the modern version of Kilroy\u2019s Kialoa. At 100 feet, the ultra-light yacht launched in 2014 to break transoceanic records is all race boat, with nothing but carbon frames and pipe berths below.It is a diverse fleet that has come to Porto Cervo to continue the tradition of maxi yacht racing on the Mediterranean. Only the jagged outcroppings and clear waters have remained the same since the inaugural event in 1980. The boats are given handicaps, much like in golf, to allow yachts of different sizes to compete. Design rules over the years made racing boats homogenous, and smaller, until the 1990s, when the maxis faded away completely from the racing circuit.Superyachts, loosely defined as private sailboats more than 100 feet long, shun rating rules. They are designed for the pure physical and aesthetic pleasure of their owners, who take them, in style and speed, to the great deep harbors of the world.These yachts, many costing tens of millions of dollars, are commissioned by some of the world\u2019s wealthiest businessmen and women. At the Rolex Cup, the owners Larry Ellison of Oracle and Hasso Plattner of SAP, former victors, tended to take a low profile and let their yacht performances speak for them.The 35-year evolution of the Rolex Cup fleet from thoroughbred racers to luxury superyachts taking a break from their global tours for an annual race in Sardinia has surprised even the most seasoned professionals in the sport.\u201cThe I.M.S. rule produced smaller boats and there was no place for big-boat racing,\u201d said Mike Toppa of the sailmaking company North Sails, referring to the International Measurement System, which has replaced the I.O.R. \u201cAs the world economy grew, people began to build more luxury yachts.\u201dOther developments helped drive the trend to bigger racing yachts.\u201cThe tools and materials were only recently developed to build a 150-foot mast of carbon that wouldn\u2019t fall down,\u201d Toppa said. \u201cDesign tools to model dynamic loads and strains on boats and masts have given us the ability to build bigger and bigger boats.\u201dAccording to Comanche\u2019s skipper, the America\u2019s Cup and Volvo Ocean race helmsman Ken Read, the trend toward larger boats is driven by the owners.\u201cThere weren\u2019t 100- and 200-foot racing yachts 10, 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one said, \u2018Let\u2019s stop racing I.O.R. maxis.\u2019 It has always been, \u2018Let\u2019s get the biggest, coolest yachts around and race them.\u201d\u2019The exception in this year\u2019s Rolex Cup fleet is the 1933 J-class yacht Velsheda. Designed as an America\u2019s Cup racer, the boat epitomizes the large yachts raced in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Toppa said that the evolution of the Rolex Cup and a growing calendar of superyacht events in the Mediterranean, Caribbean and in the Atlantic off New England has spurred the restoration and replication of more J-class boats and even classic 100-foot schooners joining the modern superyachts.Nautor\u2019s Swan and Italy\u2019s Wally Yachts have been at the forefront of superyacht design and construction. Boats from both share key trademarks: sleek, nearly flat sheer lines, lounging areas recessed into flowing teak decks, and towering, powerful carbon masts.Down below, master suites, salons and kitchens are all laid out and furnished with exotic materials by top interior designers from both inside and outside of the marine industry.Laidlaw believes that 115 feet will be a \u201csweet spot\u201d in this new form of racing, with the fleet in Porto Cervo each year starting to gain more and more resemblance to the original Maxi World Championships, albeit with much more bling. So prevalent is the recent demand for racier superyachts that Swan offers the 115-footer as a semi-custom production boat, rather than as a custom one-off like most boats of its size.\u201cAny person who can afford a superyacht is incredibly competitive,\u201d said Read, who was also skipper of Clark\u2019s first racing yacht, Hanuman, a replica of a 1930s J-class boat. \u201cSuperyacht racing is really amazing, we just happen to be bringing a race boat. Part of me wants our rating to be bad so we don\u2019t beat all these wonderful boats. But I do want to win everything.\u201dClark, according to Read, brings friends aboard for the racing experience. \u201cHe finds jobs onboard for four to six of his good friends,\u201d Read said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a baseball fantasy camp. This is a Grand Prix sailing camp. He puts them to work on the coolest racing boat in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Lessons of Matt Harvey Dilemma Go Beyond Mets", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkplace CultureThe controversy that has seized the attention of baseball fans, over how the Mets should handle Matt Harvey, may seem to be a debate over money, ego and the integrity of the ligaments in his pitching elbow.It is about all those things. But it\u2019s also a window into one of the most important, but under-discussed, elements of how employers and employees relate to each other in the modern economy. The choices that the Mets, and Mr. Harvey, will make in the weeks ahead are just an unusually public version of the choices every company must make about how it treats its workers, and how those workers react to those choices.The Mets are in first place in the National League East with a month left in the season, on track for their first playoff appearance since 2006 and with a credible chance to play for a championship. Particularly if they have Mr. Harvey pitching. Which will be hard to manage unless they blow through the 180-innings limit.This pits two imperatives against each other: the desire to win now versus the risk of endangering the career of a brilliant young athlete just entering his prime years. Mr. Harvey is making a mere $614,000 this year, but could be on track for a long-term contract on the scale of the $200 million-plus deals received by elite pitchers like Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer. If, of course, he stays healthy.But it\u2019s worth flipping this logic on its head for a bit. The Mets are sending a signal of their own if they pressure a player to exceed his doctor\u2019s recommendation for returning from an injury \u2014 about how they view their employees\u2019 long-term well-being versus the immediate business goals of the organization. And that\u2019s where the similarity with industries far afield from professional baseball comes in.A company\u2019s reputation in how it treats people is a piece of what recruiters call the \u201cemployer brand,\u201d meaning how job-seekers view a firm where they might go to work. That can include having a great cafeteria and nice office space, and more substantive things like good pay and benefits.But those are the easy parts of an employer\u2019s reputation for a prospective worker to evaluate. More important \u2014 but harder to measure \u2014 is whether an employer takes a long-term view or a short-term view toward its workers\u2019 well-being.An employer at one extreme \u2014 taking the long-term view and putting the well-being of its workers as a high priority \u2014 might give employees a light-duty assignment while they are dealing with an illness in their family, or avoid layoffs at the expense of lower profits when the business experiences a downturn, or pay for training to help develop a new skill.At the opposite extreme, other employers focus on their bottom line above all, and might, in those same situations, show no tolerance for a worker who needs a lighter workload for personal reasons, lay people off whenever business conditions warrant it, or leave you on your own to pay for that training class.One challenge for workers searching for a job is that it is hard to know from the outside \u2014 and even sometimes from the inside \u2014 where an employer falls on that spectrum. In theory at least, a reputation for being a quality employer can pay off if employees show greater loyalty or are willing to accept lower pay than what is on offer at more short-term-oriented competitors.In practice, information about where an employer falls on the short-term vs. long-term continuum can be hard to come by. In a vacuum, it might be worth going with an employer that has a long-term view toward its workers even if the salary is 10 percent less than what is offered by another firm with a short-term view. But it can be hard to know which is which until you\u2019re in the door.In sports, though, the situation is different. Mr. Harvey\u2019s agent is Scott Boras, who has represented many of the top ballplayers of the last generation. Other players and their agents are watching carefully.It is a safe bet that if Mr. Boras believes the Mets have risked Mr. Harvey\u2019s future to help their chance at winning a couple of extra games in 2015, it will shape his advice to future free agents and young draftees, and the thinking of other agents and their players, too.In the corporate world, it may be hard to tell which employers put their workers\u2019 long-term well-being first. In the sports world, where it\u2019s all on the field and well-paid agents are constantly collecting information, it\u2019s easier to see.That\u2019s the dilemma for the Mets: If they push Mr. Harvey too hard, it might help their prospects in 2015, but they may find it that much harder to put together winning teams in the future.Advertisement"}

I would argue that all of the G.O.P. candidates are calling for policies that would be deeply destructive at home, abroad, or both. But even if you like the broad thrust of modern Republican policies, it should worry you that the men and woman on that stage are clearly living in a world of fantasies and fictions. And some seem willing to advance their ambitions with outright lies.Let\u2019s start at the shallow end, with the fantasy economics of the establishment candidates.You\u2019re probably tired of hearing this, but modern G.O.P. economic discourse is completely dominated by an economic doctrine \u2014 the sovereign importance of low taxes on the rich \u2014 that has failed completely and utterly in practice over the past generation.Think about it. Bill Clinton\u2019s tax hike was followed by a huge economic boom, the George W. Bush tax cuts by a weak recovery that ended in financial collapse. The tax increase of 2013 and the coming of Obamacare in 2014 were associated with the best job growth since the 1990s. Jerry Brown\u2019s tax-raising, environmentally conscious California is growing fast; Sam Brownback\u2019s tax- and spending-slashing Kansas isn\u2019t.Yet the hold of this failed dogma on Republican politics is stronger than ever, with no skeptics allowed. On Wednesday Jeb Bush claimed, once again, that his voodoo economics would double America\u2019s growth rate, while Marco Rubio insisted that a tax on carbon emissions would \u201cdestroy the economy.\u201dThe only candidate talking sense about economics was, yes, Donald Trump, who declared that \u201cwe\u2019ve had a graduated tax system for many years, so it\u2019s not a socialistic thing.\u201dIf the discussion of economics was alarming, the discussion of foreign policy was practically demented. Almost all the candidates seem to believe that American military strength can shock-and-awe other countries into doing what we want without any need for negotiations, and that we shouldn\u2019t even talk with foreign leaders we don\u2019t like. No dinners for Xi Jinping! And, of course, no deal with Iran, because resorting to force in Iraq went so well.Indeed, the only candidate who seemed remotely sensible on national security issues was Rand Paul, which is almost as disturbing as the spectacle of Mr. Trump being the only voice of economic reason.The real revelation on Wednesday, however, was the way some of the candidates went beyond expounding bad analysis and peddling bad history to making outright false assertions, and probably doing so knowingly, which turns those false assertions into what are technically known as \u201clies.\u201dMr. Christie\u2019s mendacity pales, however, in comparison to that of Carly Fiorina, who was widely hailed as the \u201cwinner\u201d of the debate.So is Mrs. Fiorina so deep inside the bubble that she can\u2019t tell the difference between facts and agitprop? Or is she deliberately spreading a lie? And most important, does it matter?Now we have presidential candidates who make Mr. Bush look like Abe Lincoln. But who will tell the people?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Influx May Give Europe\u2019s Far Right a Lift", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As Europe basks in good feelings over its generosity to thousands of migrants and asylum seekers last weekend, critical voices from the political right and far right are poised to become among the biggest beneficiaries of the continuing flow.Parties that have been growing in opposition to immigration, the influence of Islam and the European Union seized on the decision by Austria and Germany to welcome the migrants, pointing out the difficulty of now shutting the migrant tap.\u201cGermany, Sweden, and Austria deserve great credit for their willingness to accept refugees, but elsewhere on the Continent the reaction ranges from passivity to outright hostility,\u201d said Michael Haltzel, a visiting senior fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs who advised Joseph R. Biden Jr., now vice president, when he served in the Senate. \u201cThere is a considerable danger of overload. And I fear that the political beneficiaries in many countries will be right-wing ultranationalists.\u201dCarl Bildt, Sweden\u2019s former foreign minister, expressed some of the anxiety felt by governing parties when he said that \u201cat the end of the day, every country is nervous\u201d about this large group of new migrants, \u201cthough some pretend not to be.\u201dRight now \u201cthere is a tendency to blame everyone else,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this will be a challenge to every country.\u201dThe process of integration into a Western society is difficult and takes time, Mr. Bildt said. \u201cIt\u2019s far more than providing the first tent.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous breakthrough for us,\u201d Tommy Nilsson, party manager for southern Sweden, told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cThere\u2019s too much immigration and too many beggars from Eastern Europe. People are starting to realize that this is a serious problem for Sweden.\u201dThe new rightist government in Denmark has taken out advertisements in the Lebanese press warning refugees not to come, that the government has toughened immigration laws and cut benefits.In France, in a speech on Sunday to her National Front party, which warns about Islam, immigration and a powerful German-dominated Brussels, Marine Le Pen accused Germany of opening its doors to refugees to exploit them for cheap labor, while imposing its immigration policies on its neighbors.\u201cGermany seeks not only to rule our economy, it wants to force us to accept hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers,\u201d she said in Marseille.Europe cannot take them all.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced something close to pride on Monday that Germany is now seen as a desirable and welcoming destination for refugees. \u201cThat is something very valuable, if you look at our history,\u201d she said.But many fear a backlash. There have been more than 200 attacks on asylum seekers or their shelters this year in Germany. In the pretty south German town of Rottenburg am Neckar, officials are investigating as possible arson a fire that broke out at 2 a.m. Monday, injuring six people, in a facility housing 84.A day earlier, even the partners in Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc, the Christian Social Union, openly criticized her for allowing in tens of thousands of migrants from Hungary and Austria. That \u201csends the wrong signal to individual countries,\u201d said Gerda Hasselfeldt, the party\u2019s leader in the federal Parliament.The C.S.U. welcomed a government decision late Sunday to reduce cash allowances for refugees as a victory for their harder line. \u201cThere will be less incentive in the future for unfounded applications for asylum,\u201d said the party\u2019s general secretary, Andreas Scheuer.Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats and vice chancellor, acknowledged that beyond the cheers and handouts of chocolates and toys, there were what he called very real worries, fears and conflicts.European Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.\u201cWe have to be realistic about this from the start to avoid disappointments,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage to take in 800,000 this year, accommodate and integrate them, too. But it is also clear for everyone that that cannot repeat every year.\u201dIn Austria, arson attacks are rare. But a strong populist party, the right-wing Freedom Party, has made noticeable gains in the months of refugee crisis.Austria expects the same proportion of asylum applications, 1 percent of the population, as Germany. In bellwether elections in Vienna in October, the Freedom Party now threatens to outperform the Social Democrats, making inroads particularly among lower classes with strident anti-Muslim rhetoric.Some observers believe the sympathy shown to refugees may have tipped the scales away from the rightists.\u201cThese feelings are transitory, of course, but they won\u2019t fade without leaving some trace,\u201d said Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for the center-left weekly Profil.Austrians have traditionally welcomed migrants and felt good doing so this weekend, particularly since almost none of the arriving thousands planned to stay, he said. \u201cFor us, this feeling of doing good has come almost for free \u2014 at least for the time being.\u201dThe issue is sensitive in Britain, too, which last year had net immigration of 330,000 people and where Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure from his own party and from the U.K. Independence Party to bring down the numbers or withdraw from the European Union.Under public pressure, Mr. Cameron has now agreed to take up to 20,000 Syrian refugees from camps in the region over the next five years as a humanitarian gesture, and will increase to 1 billion pounds a year humanitarian aid to Syria.Mr. Cameron has promised a referendum on continued British membership in the European Union by the end of 2017, but possibly to take place next autumn. But what appears to be a European mess and more immigration has been a boon for those opposed to continued British membership.Mr. Bildt, of Sweden, says that in the long run, the European Union will come up with some better solutions. \u201cBut we have to find a coherent European response. Controlling the outer border of Schengen is vital to the system,\u201d he said, referring to the passport-free zone within Europe. \u201cIt is uncomfortable but necessary, and it needs to be done.\u201dAn article on Sept. 8 about a possible boost to right-wing, anti-immigration European political parties from the continuing influx of migrants overstated what was known about a fire in the town of Rottenburg am Neckar, Germany, a country where there have been more than 200 attacks on asylum seekers or their shelters this year. The fire was being investigated as possible arson; it had not been determined to be arson. (As of this week, the cause of the blaze remains unclear, the German police said.)

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Decision on Rates Rattles Some Global Markets", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Global markets were largely down on Friday after the United States Federal Reserve signaled fresh concerns over slowing growth in China and other emerging markets.The Fed\u2019s decision weighed on global markets Friday, and Wall Street opened lower as well after edging down modestly the day before.Stocks in Japan closed 2 percent lower, ending a three-day rally. Shanghai stocks see-sawed between small gains and losses, closing up 0.4 percent after a week of more volatile swings.Markets in Europe had fallen sharply by early afternoon, with the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of eurozone blue-chip stocks, off about 3.2 percent. In London, the FTSE 100 was down 1.8 percent, while the CAC 40 index in Paris had slipped 3.12. The DAX index in Frankfurt was also down 3.3 percent.In early trading in New York, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-share index was 1.1 percent lower, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4 percent, and Nasdaq composite lost 0.9 percent.The slowing growth in China, along with the weakness in emerging market economies like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, has created a rout in global commodity prices, as demand for raw materials like oil, industrial metals and iron ore have slumped. This has tempered inflation around the world, as well as in the United States.\u201cThese developments may restrain U.S. economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term,\u201d Ms. Yellen added.Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong, said that the Fed postponed a rate increase largely because \u201cjitters\u201d from China had \u201cspread far and wide.\u201d\u201cUltimately, the drags from China\u2019s slowdown will only delay rate hikes by the Fed, rather than prevent the Fed tightening its stance altogether,\u201d Mr. Neumann said.The troubled outlook for emerging market nations has been a sharp contrast to the building strength of the American economy. And while ultralow interest rates have been blamed in recent years for adding froth to bubbly markets, the recovery in the six years since the global financial crisis has been tangible for the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s not just fantasy money coming from the Fed \u2014 there are real jobs and profits being created, there\u2019s real economic growth,\u201d said Robert P. Browne, the chief investment officer at Northern Trust, a Chicago-based investment firm.\u201cThis is not just the drug of monetary easing making the patient better \u2014 the patient is getting better through real rehabilitation,\u201d he added.At the other end of the spectrum is China, where the economy is expected to grow this year at its slowest pace in a quarter-century. The economy is sputtering because of a sharp downturn in manufacturing and housing construction, previously key engines of growth. Chinese officials have responded in recent months with a flurry of interest rate cuts and billions of dollars in investment in new infrastructure, but the economy continues to decelerate.The effects are being felt in places like Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. Such countries rode the commodities boom as they fed demand from China for materials like iron ore, coal and edible oils.The situation has reversed sharply in the past year. And the diminished growth prospects have led to rising outflows of funds and falling exchange rates in many emerging markets.A weaker currency tends to lift a country\u2019s exports, making overseas shipments cheaper in dollar terms. But it provides little advantage when it becomes the general trend.In Asia, for example, many countries that rely on exports \u201cform part of the same cross-border supply chain, making different parts or components of one final product that\u2019s shipped out of China a couple of months later,\u201d said Christian de Guzman, a senior analyst in the sovereign risk group at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in Singapore.For these countries, he added, \u201cit\u2019s hard to gain advantage from a depreciated local currency because they\u2019ve all depreciated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gloomy Republican Campaigns Leave Behind Reagan Cheer", "Date": "2015-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo listen to the way some Republicans tell it, America is a pretty awful place these days.These dark diagnoses of the country\u2019s condition have become an especially powerful part of the message sounded by several Republicans seeking their party\u2019s nomination for presidency this election cycle. Their damning assessments \u2014 that the country is diminished and unrecognizable, imperiled by forces foreign and domestic \u2014 seem to resonate with voters already feeling angry, alienated and under threat.Appeals to voters\u2019 insecurities and anxieties have always been part of politics. But what is striking about the current dynamic inside the Republican Party is how pervasive the sense has become that the country is slipping, and maybe irretrievably so.\u201cYou\u2019ve got elements of all the different branches of the Republican Party that see darkness now,\u201d said David Gergen, a former adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. \u201cSocial conservatives have been at the forefront of that for a long time. But now the foreign policy and economic types feel like we face serious risk of decline.\u201dThe mood of the country is certainly grim. About two-thirds of Americans believe the country is adrift, according to recent public opinion surveys from a variety of news organizations and independent firms. That sentiment has remained stubbornly high for most of the Obama presidency, with strong majorities of Americans consistently saying the country is on the wrong track for the last five years, according to polling by The New York Times and CBS News.After years of slow economic growth, stagnant incomes, political dysfunction and worsening threats from abroad, many Republican pollsters and analysts are asking themselves whether there has been a fundamental change in how Americans, historically an optimistic people, now see themselves. And they are wondering whether, as a consequence, 2016 will be a year when voters turn to someone whose message is mainly focused on what is wrong with the country.\u201cToday, conservatism is much more meanspirited, angry, not optimistic and much more viscerally divisive,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, a former top strategist for President George W. Bush.The dark imagery emanating from Mr. Trump and others collides with the long-held Republican conviction that a message of optimism and uplift is essential to winning elections and leading the country. That belief also aligns with their view of America as a special and divinely inspired nation, always capable of renewal.\u201cI believe we\u2019re on the verge of the greatest time to be alive,\u201d says Jeb Bush, the candidate who always boasts about the \u201cjoy\u201d that infuses his campaign and whose slogan, \u201cRight to Rise,\u201d implies an upward trajectory for the American people.Optimism and a sunny spirit came to define Reagan, and in this race, Mr. Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio are trying to channel some of that same brightness.Mr. Rubio often asks people what nation on earth they would trade places with. After the answer comes back an emphatic \u201cNo one!\u201d as it did at a casino in northern Nevada he visited earlier this month, he offers his own cheerful explanation. \u201cOurs is the story of 230-some-odd years of perpetual improvement, of a nation where each generation did what they needed to do to leave the next better off.\u201dMr. Kasich repudiates \u201cmad as hell\u201d politics when he talks to voters. \u201cIf it takes angry and mean, count me out,\u201d he said recently in New Hampshire.Despite the country\u2019s challenges, there are signs of improvement: Job growth is up, unemployment is down, and the economy is in vastly better shape than it was eight years ago. Some Republicans worry that a strategy of telling voters, in effect, that things are much worse than they thought is a losing one. They point to how candidates like George W. Bush, who ran in 2000 as the amiable \u201ccompassionate conservative,\u201d were almost always upbeat.\u201cAmericans like optimistic brands. We like brands that lead us into the future,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican messaging strategist who has offered informal advice to several of the candidates running for president this year. Quoting something he said George W. Bush had once told him, Mr. Castellanos added, \u201cNobody ever bought a product that made them feel worse.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.After the 2014 midterm elections, Mr. Castellanos commissioned research for a project he is leading on reinventing his party\u2019s brand called \u201cNew Republican.\u201d It looked at three states where Republicans took Senate seats from Democrats and one where they lost. In the three winning states \u2014 Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina \u2014 voters said they thought the Republican was the more optimistic candidate. Only in the state Republicans lost, New Hampshire, did voters say they felt the Republican, Scott Brown, was the more pessimistic candidate. Still, some Republicans question the power of optimism, noting that voters picked the candidate of hope and change in 2008 and that many are unhappy with the results.\u201cI know, everyone should be optimistic, everyone should be sunny and cheerful,\u201d said Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something weird and wrong if you\u2019re not. But really? Is the country on the right track or the wrong track?\u201d\u201cWe should all be joyous?\u201d he added.Indeed, some Republicans are now debating how great the country is (or isn\u2019t), whether it needs to be made great again and who can best do that. And like many debates among Republicans, this one returns to the legacy of Reagan.But Mr. Rubio has taken to criticizing Mr. Trump for using Reagan\u2019s words to imply the country is not great. \u201cI would remind everyone America is great,\u201d he told a crowd in Nevada recently. \u201cThe issue is not that we\u2019re not great. The issue is whether we will remain great.\u201dSome of Reagan\u2019s former aides echo Mr. Rubio\u2019s concern. While Mr. Reagan was not na\u00efve about the threats facing the United States domestically and abroad, he was never dour about it, they say. \u201cTo appropriate Ronald Reagan\u2019s language and suggest that America is going to hell, those are contradictory impulses,\u201d said Peter Robinson, a Reagan speechwriter who is now with the Hoover Institution.Looking at the presidents that most Americans would consider great leaders, Mr. Castellanos, the Republican brand strategist, said they all shared one theme: an optimistic vision for where the country was headed. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal; John F. Kennedy, the New Frontier; Reagan, the \u201crendezvous with destiny\u201d; Bill Clinton, \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThere are different ways to win the nomination,\u201d Mr. Castellanos added. \u201cOne is to go small and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to take up this aggrieved section of the party and cobble it together with this other angry section of the party.\u201d\u201cBut the risk of that,\u201d he continued, \u201cis you make yourself dark and too small to be president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Jobs Satisfying", "Date": "2015-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersWhat makes workers happy? Pay, meaningful work, flexible hours, personal responsibility.I work for one of those firms that consistently make the best-places-to-work list, and I feel that is due in large part to the amount of flexibility provided. Being able to work from home on occasion has enabled me to spend an amazing amount of time with my young family, which my father never had. That flexibility has also enabled me to volunteer time to my village board, the local Boy Scout troop and other altruistic endeavors that enable me to give back to society, even if in only a small way.My job is challenging, at times frustrating, and on occasion offers true satisfaction, but what I am able to do with the time my firm provides through flexibility is consistently rewarding, and makes me a happier and more productive employee.CHARLES CORSOBayville, N.Y.To the Editor: I am a sociologist who informally explores the world of work. By roaming supermarkets I talk with workers informally, seeking a product that I say I cannot locate and then watching the eagerness with which they lead me to the correct shelf. And I note the satisfaction they show \u2014 with a smile, with shoulders that sit squarely back when I thank them for their help.Some stores have happy workers, and I often ask them if they are pleased with their jobs and if so why. First they tell me that they are well paid, but second that they are treated well by management. This is the kind of shop I love to visit. The happiness of the workers rubs off on the customers as well. It\u2019s so simple: Upbeat workers lead to upbeat customers lead to more customers. So a humane work environment is good for business as well. Anybody listening?JOAN GOLDSTEINPrinceton, N.J.To the Editor: Barry Schwartz gives a psychological explanation, the self-fulfilling prophecy, in arguing that dashed expectations create cynicism and lower the prospects for making work meaningful. But there is also an institutional explanation. A century ago, Chester Barnard, the organization theorist and president of New Jersey Bell Telephone, distinguished between independent businessmen and organizational employees. He observed that the former exercise personal responsibility but the latter do not. He concluded that the rise of the corporate form has led to a decreased sense of personal responsibility. Ironically, cooperation on a grand scale diminished the prospects for the individual. The challenge of modern enterprise remains as Barnard stated: to integrate the independent individual and formal, large-scale organization.ELLEN S. O\u2019CONNORSanta Rosa, Calif.To the Editor: Barry Schwartz is correct that workers are looking for something more than wages. From a human development perspective, work is broader than jobs and includes creative pursuits, voluntary and domestic work, as well as paid employment. To focus only on jobs that are remunerated misses the huge contribution of unpaid work, or as Katrine Mar\u00e7al\u2019s book asked: \u201cWho Cooked Adam Smith\u2019s Dinner?\u201d (Spoiler alert: his mother, for love not wages.) An analysis for the next Human Development Report suggests that of work that is unpaid, domestic and voluntary, women perform three times more than men.In the United States, the chief executive-to-worker compensation ratio (including stock options) has risen steeply: In 1965 it was 20 to 1; by 2013 it was 296 to 1. It raises fundamental questions on how work is valued. Globalization, technological change, waning union membership and a shrinking welfare state have contributed to the decline of share in labor income.We don\u2019t need to submit to Adam Smith\u2019s gloomy prophecy of disengaged workers with no creative outlet. Instead we can seize opportunities created by global changes to rethink work to improve people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.SELIM JAHANNew YorkThe writer is director of the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Program.To the Editor: Adam Smith did not view workers as inherently lazy and interested only in pay incentives. Smith\u2019s comment on men wanting to live at ease was made in specific reference to university professors on fixed salaries. Smith, himself a former professor, firmly believed that \u201crivalship and emulation\u201d motivated workers, in addition to money. That said, Barry Schwartz\u2019s main point is valid, that productive workers want more than a paycheck, lest Smith\u2019s powerful assertion prove true, with division of labor making people \u201cstupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.\u201dWILLIAM FARINAEvanston, Ill.The writer is the author of \u201cThe Afterlife of Adam Smith.\u201dTo the Editor: Human behavior and motivations are varied and complex. To say that all workers want \u201cmeaningful work\u201d denies this reality. Some workers only want extrinsic rewards (money, recognition), while others are intrinsically motivated (the knowledge that they did their personal best). Some workers meet their personal needs outside of work and just use work to pay the bills. Others hide from family obligations at work. The Gallup survey that Barry Schwartz cites notes only worker dissatisfaction, not its causes. Who is to say that all the respondents were dissatisfied for the same reason?JOHN MIRAGLIAOld Bridge, N.J.To the Editor: \u201cRethinking Work\u201d could more aptly be titled \u201cRethinking Hiring.\u201d Commonly, this issue is analyzed from the perspective of the workers, including the choices they make and how they conceive of themselves in the workplace. The root of the problem, however, likely sits with employers and their fear of taking chances on hiring someone with an unconventional background. More than ever, in order to get a good job, the candidate needs a graduate degree in that field, with work experience or an internship to back it up. Changing fields beyond a certain age is very difficult in our economy.Imagine if Barry Schwartz himself decided to vacate his college position for a job in graphic design or finance. He is probably intelligent enough to learn the ropes in a short time and do excellent work in those fields. But would the establishment think creatively enough to take a chance on him? We live in a society in which so many people dream of becoming Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to build an empire. Unfortunately, the reality of today\u2019s marketplace is that he probably would have never hired himself.MARC A. ROSNERHastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Workers Organize, but Don\u2019t Unionize, to Get Protection Under Labor Law", "Date": "2015-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 Jorge Porras used to report to his carwash job here most mornings at 8:15 a.m., but he said that his boss often did not let him clock in until 11, when customers frequently began streaming in. Many days he was paid for just six hours, he said, even though he worked nine and a half hours.One day, when the heavy chain that pulled cars forward got stuck, Mr. Porras tried to fix it, but it suddenly lurched forward and cut off the top of his right ring finger. The injury caused him to miss work for the next two weeks, he said, but he received no pay or workers\u2019 compensation for the forced time off.Mr. Porras and nine co-workers became so fed up that they took an unusual step. They formed a workers committee (not a labor union) and sent a certified letter to the owner of the carwash. In it, they complained about being \u201cinsulted and humiliated\u201d in \u201cfront of our co-workers and customers\u201d and protested being required to work off the clock and not being given goggles or gloves even though they worked with toxic chemicals.An advocacy group for immigrant workers, Somos Un Pueblo Unido, advised Squeaky Clean\u2019s workers to set up such a committee because the National Labor Relations Act \u2014 enacted under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1935 \u2014 prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for engaging in \u201cconcerted\u201d activity to improve their wages and conditions, even when they are not trying to unionize.In an era when the traditional labor unions envisioned by Depression-era supporters of that law have weakened steadily, many advocates now see work site committees as an alternative way to strengthen workers\u2019 clout and protections.Simon Brackley, president of the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce, said Somos had exaggerated the prevalence of wage violations and had been too quick to pounce on employers. But Somos is not backing down, and many worker groups are now copying its work site committee idea, which has been adopted at about 35 restaurants, hotels and other companies in Santa Fe.\u201cA lot of workers don\u2019t know about labor unions, and a lot are scared of retaliation if they try to form one,\u201d said Marcela Diaz, the executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido (We are a United People). \u201cSo we have to find ways to protect workers when there isn\u2019t a union.\u201dSanta Fe may be a famously artsy, liberal community, Ms. Diaz said, but many businesses too readily take advantage of their immigrant employees.Luis Mu\u00f1oz, a co-worker at the Squeaky Clean Car Wash, said their boss frequently humiliated workers, sometimes shouting, \u201cYou\u2019re good for nothing.\u201d One winter day, Mr. Mu\u00f1oz said, the boss \u2014 complaining that cars were not being washed faster \u2014 soaked him with bone-chilling water from a hose.\u201cWe knew we\u2019d have little protection if we acted alone,\u201d Mr. Porras, an immigrant from Guatemala, said in Spanish. \u201cBut we knew that if we formed a committee, we\u2019d be protected.\u201dUltimately, the labor board ordered Squeaky Clean to reinstate the workers and pay $6,000 in back wages. The carwash agreed separately to pay $60,000 to settle claims for minimum wage and overtime violations.The workers say that, in response to the worker committee\u2019s pressure, the carwash has improved conditions for those who complained (but not necessarily for the rest of the crew) \u2014 paying them for their full eight hours and giving a one-hour lunch break and one-week paid vacation. Jay Ritter, Squeaky Clean\u2019s owner, did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment.These newfangled worker committees have been accumulating victories. In recent years, workers at 12 New Mexico companies have complained to the N.L.R.B. that they were fired for pushing to improve conditions. In 11 of those cases, the labor board\u2019s Phoenix office found that the firings had been unlawful and pressed for the workers\u2019 reinstatement.\u201cA lot of people thought the National Labor Relations Act could be used only during unionization campaigns,\u201d said Andrew Schrank, a labor relations specialist who recently became a professor at Brown University after teaching at the University of New Mexico. \u201cThey\u2019re finding that the National Labor Relations Act is much more expansive than many people thought.\u201dRichard F. Griffin Jr., the labor board\u2019s general counsel, said a 1962 Supreme Court case \u2014 involving a spontaneous walkout because a factory was so cold \u2014 makes clear that the National Labor Relations Act protects nonunion workers, too.\u201cIt\u2019s important that people understand that the law applies to all private sector workplaces and protects activity outside the context of union activity,\u201d Mr. Griffin said.Somos\u2019s success has impressed officials at many of the nation\u2019s 230 immigrant worker centers.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at taking some of these steps,\u201d said Adam Kader, director of the Arise Chicago Worker Center. \u201cWe urge workers to form committees with as many people as possible. We know three people out of 20 at a workplace is much better than one out of 20.\u201dTo the relief of business, labor specialists say these committees will rarely if ever be as effective as traditional unions, which are larger and engage in collective bargaining.Somos, a 20-year-old immigrants\u2019 advocacy group, originally focused on persuading New Mexico lawmakers to let immigrants without legal papers obtain driver\u2019s licenses. That effort succeeded. The group has since found a fresh calling, fighting for immigrants who face workplace problems, sometimes by staging raucous protests after workers filed claims alleging wage theft or illegal firings.\u201cWe feel that the group\u2019s tactics are over the top,\u201d said Carol Wight, chief executive of the New Mexico Restaurant Association. \u201cI think there are nicer, more effective ways of getting what you want \u2014 achieving justice for workers.\u201d She said most restaurants tried to comply with labor laws, but New Mexico has various overlapping minimum wage laws that can make compliance difficult.Glenn Spencer, executive director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Workforce Freedom Initiative, voiced concern that some immigrant worker groups like Somos were fronts for unions and were being used to help rebuild the labor movement.Ms. Diaz said Somos was not fronting for unions, adding that they had shown scant interest in organizing low-wage immigrant workers in New Mexico.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to form unions,\u201d acknowledged Mike Archuleta, immediate past president of the Northern New Mexico Central Labor Council. \u201cIf these workers could join a union, I would prefer that. But as far as protecting their own rights, these worker committees are the next best thing.\u201dFour hotel housekeepers at the Holiday Inn Express in Los Alamos were fired after forming a workers committee and complaining to management about harsh treatment, favoritism and unfair punishments. A federal judge ordered them reinstated with $11,375 in back pay. A receptionist at the hotel said there was no one to discuss the case.One of the first cases involved 19 janitors for the Santa Fe school system who formed a workers committee in 2008 because they were upset that a supervisor was repeatedly harassing female workers, they said. The committee contacted the cleaning contractor that employed them, Merchants Building Maintenance, and pressed it to take action.That supervisor soon retired, but the next year, the contractor refused to rehire the committee\u2019s 19 members, while rehiring almost everyone else. After extensive litigation, a labor board judge ordered that the employees be reinstated, and the janitors received $130,000 in back pay. The janitors were never rehired because the company lost its contract with the school system. Merchants Building Maintenance did not respond to inquiries.Three workers at Posa\u2019s El Merendero restaurant here said they were fired after sending a letter asking management to discuss their concerns: not being paid for attending a 5 a.m. monthly meeting, not being paid when they worked through lunch, and often not being paid time and a half for overtime.\u201cIf I were to do this on my own, they would just fire me and that would have been the end of it,\u201d said Mayt\u00e9 Flores, a cook who lost her job. \u201cWhen we wrote the letter together, we were able to protect ourselves.\u201dThe N.L.R.B. ordered the restaurant to rehire the workers.Jeff Posa, the restaurant\u2019s co-owner, criticized Somos and defended his actions.Mr. Porras, the carwash worker, said the campaign was having ripple effects across the city. \u201cI\u2019m helping other workers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in Santa Fe are less willing to abuse workers because they see workers are standing up for their rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In 1974, the median American family earned just under $13,000 a year. A new home could be had for $36,000, an average new car for $4,400. Attending a four-year private college cost around $2,000 a year: affordable, with some scrimping, to even median earners. As for public university, it was a bargain at $510 a year. To put these figures in current dollars, we\u2019re talking about median family income of $62,000, a house for $174,000 and a sticker price of $21,300 for the car, $10,300 for the private university and $2,500 for the public one.A lot has changed since then. Median family income has risen slightly, to about $64,000, while median home prices have increased by about two-thirds. (Car prices have remained steady.) But the real outlier is higher education. Tuition at a private university is now roughly three times as expensive as it was in 1974, costing an average of $31,000 a year; public tuition, at $9,000, has risen by nearly four times. This is a painful bill for all but the very richest. For the average American household that doesn\u2019t receive a lot of financial aid, higher education is simply out of reach.Tackling this crisis is now a political issue. President Obama has proposed making community college available to nearly every American. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley have all announced plans to increase federal funding for college, if elected. Those on the right are also offering solutions, though they tend to consider government spending part of the problem. Donald Trump says he will cut the Department of Education \u2018\u2018way, way, way down.\u2019\u2019 Scott Walker successfully cut $250 million from Wisconsin\u2019s budget for higher education. Jeb Bush has focused far more attention on primary and secondary education \u2014 opposing tenure for teachers, advocating \u2018\u2018school choice\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but he promotes his cutting back of affirmative action in Florida\u2019s public universities as an example of reducing government\u2019s role in education.Higher education is a fascinating, complex business. Its pricing dynamics ripple throughout the rest of our economy, in effect determining who will thrive and who will fail. What\u2019s more, the product of this particular industry is not just an end in itself. Education can have enormous personal benefits for those who acquire it, but it also has external benefits to the rest of society. Education exerts something of a multiplier effect; it transforms not only the lives of the educated but of those around them as well. Workers with more education are more productive, which makes companies more profitable and the overall economy grow faster. There are also significant noneconomic benefits. Educated populations tend to be healthier, more stable and more engaged in their civic institutions and democratic debate.For young adults from educated, middle-class families \u2014 the people who will find a way to get through college despite the costs \u2014 rising college tuition is a personal challenge. But the great national crisis is the fact that too many other young adults are not going to college or, if they do, don\u2019t graduate, in large part because they can\u2019t afford it. Every American benefits when every other American has access to as much schooling as he or she wants. When accessibility to higher education declines, we all end up paying for it.The next educational marketplace consists of the large regional powerhouses, home to another 20 percent or so of the higher-ed student population. Usually public, with names that often begin with \u2018\u2018University of,\u2019\u2019 these schools have strong reputations in their home states and often among the residents in neighboring states. The best ones are more likely to be found in the South or West. Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, both professors at Harvard and leading scholars of education economics, co-wrote a famous paper a few years ago in which they pointed out that states that had elite private schools in the 1890s are less likely to have developed these strong, upper-\u00adtier public schools. The reason is as obvious as it is depressing: The powerful private schools lobbied politicians to keep public institutions underfunded. That helps explain why the university systems in North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, California and elsewhere outside the Northeast are held in such high regard. (The University of Massachusetts and SUNY systems, by contrast, do not have the same reputations.) Public universities have always been cheaper than their elite private counterparts, but the gap has been closing slowly as states stop funding the schools as generously as they once did.Finally, there are the nonselective public, community and private for-profit colleges that admit nearly every paying applicant. A vast majority of people pursuing postsecondary education will start in these schools. They vary greatly in quality. Some provide a solid education, especially in technical expertise, that can lead to higher-paying, skilled jobs in manufacturing, health care and other fields. Some of these places, especially the private for-profit ones, seem to be little more than a scam, recruiting students, taking their government-funded loans and offering them a degree of minimal worth. Well more than half of all new students at four-year schools in this segment won\u2019t finish. But still they will be burdened with debt or will default, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.If colleges and universities were just another consumer good, like cars or clothes, we wouldn\u2019t worry as much about their cost. The rich pay more for the best stuff; the poor pay less for the worst. That\u2019s the market at work. But higher education is both an individual and a public concern.We know this from historical experience. In 1900, less than 10 percent of the U.S. population had a high-school degree, and many couldn\u2019t have received one if they wanted. There just weren\u2019t enough public high schools. In the beginning of the 20th century, a nationwide effort was undertaken to provide free secondary schooling to every American child. By the end of World War II, half of all young American adults had high-school diplomas; by the 1970s, a vast majority did. The country\u2019s rapid growth during that century \u2014 the rise of industry, the development of technology, the dawn of a vast middle class \u2014 would be hard to explain without acknowledging the spread of education as a cause. From 1900 to 1980, every generation born in the United States had about two more years of schooling than the one before. This transformed a nation of semiliterate farmers into the world\u2019s most-educated country. But progress has slowed since 1980. In the 1970s, the United States ranked first globally for college attainment; today, among people 25 to 34, it ranks 14th, having fallen behind many other industrialized nations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has singled out the United States as being particularly deficient in one measure: the chances are greater than 70 percent that an American will not attend college if his or her parents do not have a college degree.This history was laid out most clearly in the 2008 book \u2018\u2018The Race Between Education and Technology,\u2019\u2019 by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, which transformed how economists think about education, individual success and our collective fortunes. Put simply: Without greater access to higher education, the United States is likely to have even greater income inequality, a huge segment of the population will see its income fall and some of our core assumptions about national identity \u2014 ours as a land of opportunity, a prosperous democracy \u2014 will be at risk.Since the 1980s, most states have decreased their per-student spending on public higher education, some of them quite substantially. Federal aid has risen, but not enough to make up for the state cuts and significant increases in enrollment. Tuition, meanwhile, has gone up far more than inflation. For an explanation why that\u2019s so, it\u2019s helpful to identify analogues in the business world. Like hotels and apartment buildings, for example, colleges and universities own expensive real estate that is parceled out for use by paying customers; this means the overall rise in real estate costs have made running a university more expensive. Like airlines or Starbucks, they have a wide variety of customers with varying ability and willingness to pay. First-class and latte customers can be seduced into paying top dollar, but much of the revenue comes from people who can\u2019t afford the fancy stuff and just want a seat in coach or a cup of coffee. Like sports teams or, for that matter, cigarette companies, schools obsessively tend to their reputations, hoping to build lifelong brand loyalty among their most fervent customers.But probably the single most important factor behind the rise in tuition is one that few other businesses share: Students are not just customers; they are also an integral part of the core product. When considering a school, potential students and their parents often look first at the characteristics of past classes: test scores, grade-point averages, post-college earnings, as well as ethnic and gender mixes. School admissions officers call the process through which they put together their classes the \u2018\u2018shaping\u2019\u2019 of the student body. Kevin Crockett is a consultant with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a firm that helps colleges and universities set prices. He says that the higher the prices that schools charge, the more options they have in recruiting exactly the students they want.\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve got to have enough room under the top-line sticker price,\u2019\u2019 he says. A school that charges $50,000 is able to offer a huge range of inducements to different sorts of students: some could pay $10,000, others $30,000 or $40,000. And a handful can pay the full price.There\u2019s a provocative analogy to be made with how another industry does its pricing. I called Paul Norman, who owns a company that promotes high-end dance clubs in London, and he agrees that his clubs have much the same challenge as colleges and universities. Their appeal to new customers is based, in large part, on the mix of customers who are already there. The biggest spenders are wealthy men from Russia and the Middle East. But they won\u2019t spend a lot of money in a club filled with people just like themselves. Women who have the right look \u2014 posh in Chelsea, a bit more flash in Mayfair \u2014 are admitted free and are offered free drinks, but only if they arrive early in the evening and happily mingle and dance. He said that clubs do their own version of enrollment shaping. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s good for the crowds if you have a mix of ethnicities,\u2019\u2019 Norman told me. On any given night, he said, about a quarter of the clubs\u2019 guests get in free. It\u2019s an odd model: giving your most valuable product away to some and charging a lot to others. But, Norman said, if everybody paid the same price, nobody would want to come, and in a few weeks clubs wouldn\u2019t be able to charge anyone anything.Similarly, if an elite school like Harvard or Princeton insisted on admitting only students willing to pay the full freight, they would soon find they weren\u2019t so elite. Many of the best teachers would rather go elsewhere than stay in a gated, rich community. The most accomplished rich kids could be lured away to other schools by the prospect of studying with the best students and teachers. So, a school with the same high sticker price for everyone would be unlikely to have the attributes \u2014 high test scores, Nobel Prize-winning faculty, a lively culture \u2014 that draw national or international attention.While blue-chip schools charge the most, their economic fundamentals suggest that they are, if anything, underpricing their product. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average bill at the top-tier schools is just over $50,000 a year. Yet these schools spend considerably more than $100,000 a year educating each student, with the difference made up from government funds, grants, alumni gifts and their often-huge endowments. Fewer than half of their students pay even that discounted amount. Most of the top-tier private schools say they won\u2019t factor in an applicant\u2019s ability to pay when considering admission and promise that everyone admitted will be given the financial aid necessary to attend. Generally, parents pay no more than 10 percent of their income. Students whose parents make less than $65,000 (or, at Stanford, $125,000) usually pay no tuition. And there are generous aid packages available to all but the very wealthiest students.The pricing of college and university tuition used to be based on gut feelings, Crockett told me. Until around 1992, administrators would glance at what their peers were charging and come up with a number. Today, the process involves a level of mathematical and statistical rigor that few other industries could match. Crockett uses a team of statisticians and data analysts, the latest in software and data with hundreds of variables on students\u2019 ability and willingness to pay, academic accomplishments, most likely choices of majors, ethnicity and gender, and other attributes. To the public, one number is released: the cost of tuition. But internally the school likely has dozens of price points, each set for a different group of potential students. The tools can determine how valuable a potential student is to the school\u2019s overall reputation: more points for sports and scholarly accomplishment, fewer for the telltale signs of a likely dropout.Because a majority of selective schools have adopted these sophisticated tools for shaping enrollment, there is more competition to attract the students who are most appealing: those with high G.P.A.s and test scores, high likelihood of graduating, the right sort of major \u2014 English majors, for example, effectively subsidize engineering students because engineering is more expensive to teach. Typically, fierce market competition leads to lower prices, but among elite schools, the opposite occurs, paradoxically. They often find that raising prices enables them to offer greater benefits to the most coveted potential students. (It also allows them to take part in the amenities race: nicer dorms, better food, a climbing wall: things that are regarded as essential to attracting those coveted students.)Counterintuitively, the surest way to improve equality of access to elite schools might be to raise the cost of admission even further. Rich students paying the full price would make more aid, in money and educational support, available to be transferred to the best students from poor families and lower-performing schools. For most people who graduate from top-tier schools, debt is easily managed. Their average loan outstanding upon graduation is $23,000, but these students \u2014 no matter what they major in \u2014 get a high wage-premium, making an average of $20,000 a year more than they would have had they not gone to the school. Students entering college today are confronted with far more costs \u2014 the average textbook budget is $1,200 a year now \u2014 and this can be quite shocking to parents for whom college was much more affordable. And there are, no doubt, individual stories of deep hardship. But as a group, students who attend more-selective schools are among the luckiest in our society. In effect, they live in a different economy than the rest of the nation, one with a rich array of career opportunities, steadily rising wages and far less unemployment.The economic thinking behind public-university cuts can be confusing. Studies have shown that cutting support for public education balances budgets only in the short term. In his book \u2018\u2018Higher Learning, Greater Good,\u2019\u2019 Walter W. McMahon, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Illinois, showed that a postsecondary degree has a return on investment of roughly 15 percent a year, meaning that every $100 invested in education brings an additional $15 in income for every year of a person\u2019s working life. This expands a state\u2019s economy and generates enough tax revenue to more than pay back the initial outlay on education. Someone who graduates from a four-year institution earns about $1 million in additional future earnings.Flagship public universities \u2014 like the University of California, Berkeley, or the Universities of Michigan and Virginia \u2014 often behave like elite private schools, using aid to attract the best students, typically the ones who would probably go to a decent school without government support.That means that high-achieving students from educated families receive a disproportionate share of financial assistance, while those at the bottom, struggling students from families ill equipped to support their educations, receive a disproportionately small share. If you add up all the financial aid available from federal, state and local governments and from nonprofit institutions, there is enough money already out there to support everybody\u2019s education. The problem is that aid is distributed unevenly.Nonselective schools, the ones serving our most at-risk and in-need students, are struggling for money. Obama recently proposed making community college free for anyone able to maintain a G.P.A. of 2.5 while in school and whose parents make less than $200,000 a year. The program would be surprisingly cheap, costing around $6 billion annually, a pittance in the federal budget.Still, it doesn\u2019t fully address the crisis confronting our system of community colleges: Lots of people enter, but most won\u2019t graduate. Some four-year schools have truly abysmal records when it comes to graduating their students in six years or less. Medgar Evers College in the CUNY system has a graduation rate of 8 percent as of 2013. Entire state public-university systems with collective graduation rates below 50 percent include Arkansas (39.7 percent), Montana (45.6 percent) and Alaska (30.6 percent). Baum says that among nonselective, four-year, for-profit schools, graduation rates above 50 percent are the exception, and a few, especially online schools, have rates well below 10 percent.Nearly every education expert I spoke to mentioned a remarkable new program that has had the greatest success yet in improving the graduation rate of at-risk college enrollees. The experimental program was introduced at the community colleges of the City University of New York, where the overall graduation rate has been as low as 16 percent. CUNY administrators determined that many of their students don\u2019t just need cheaper tuition. They need support. Coming from families and communities with few, if any, college graduates, they are poor and every day have to calculate the trade-off between investing in their long-term education and paying their short-term bills. CUNY\u2019s Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) offered some common-sense interventions. Students received help paying their tuition and other fees; they even received free passes for public transportation. Most important, perhaps, they received what the school calls \u2018\u2018mandatory and intrusive guidance\u2019\u2019 from counselors who helped them choose classes, get through rough patches and focus on the long-term benefits of finishing school. Three years into the program, an outside education-research firm began an experiment: A group of 900 entering freshmen, all of whom had developmental needs, was randomly assigned to ASAP. They and a comparison group that received no special intervention were monitored for three years. The graduation rate among ASAP students who achieved an associate\u2019s degree in three years was twice as great as that of the comparison group. The overall ASAP graduation rate at CUNY has risen to 52 percent.Henry Levin, an economist at Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College, co-wrote an exhaustive analysis and concluded that, while it costs more upfront \u2014 at $19,000 a student, ASAP isn\u2019t cheap \u2014 the benefits to New York taxpayers were great. Those with associate\u2019s degrees would earn so much more over their lifetimes that they would pay an estimated $165,000 in additional taxes, while saving the state and city more than $40,000 in criminal justice, health and public-assistance costs. Pilot versions of the program are now being tried at several Ohio schools.College aid \u2014 all the federal and state grants and subsidies, the various scholarships and aid packages offered by schools and foundations \u2014 evolved in piecemeal fashion over decades. Considered as a whole, it is a bizarre system. Students who go to private nonprofit schools, disproportionately children of middle-class and wealthy parents with college educations, receive an average of $25,000 a year in aid. Those who go to less-selective public schools receive an average of $13,500 a year. And students who attend public community colleges, who are most likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds and parents without college degrees, receive an average of $8,000 a year. In other words, our system gives three times as much aid to the least needy as it gives to the most.This makes no economic sense: Once students drop out of community college, taxpayers will continue to pay their bills. That\u2019s not called education funding; it\u2019s called welfare or criminal-justice or health care expenditures. The difference is significant. In the language of economics, education funding is an investment; it more than pays back its initial costs over time. The other expenses are known as transfer payments; which means they make society poorer. In an economy that demands and rewards education, those who have it will pay the bills for those who don\u2019t.An article on Sept. 13 about college tuition referred incompletely to the authorship of an analysis of a program at CUNY that helped improve the graduation rates of its community colleges. That analysis was written by Henry Levin and Emma Garc\u00eda, currently an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Levin was not the sole author.An article on Sept. 13 about college tuition referred incorrectly to CUNY when describing a program that helped improve the graduation rates of its community colleges. It is the City University of New York (not Universities). The article also referred incorrectly to a measure of income in a comparison of 1974 income and current income when adjusted for inflation. It is median family income, which has risen to about $64,000 a year from $62,000 in 1974, not median household income. And the article also described incorrectly the change in median family income over the past 40 years. It has risen slightly, not fallen.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money\u201d and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friendship Between Putin and Xi Becomes Strained as Economies Falter", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Putin has enjoyed basking in the stature of Mr. Xi, who leads one of the world\u2019s largest economies. But with the recent stock market turmoil in China and the slowest economic growth in a quarter-century, Beijing will be unable to provide the ballast that Mr. Putin has sought against economic sanctions imposed on Russia by Europe and the United States after its annexation of Crimea, not to mention plummeting oil prices worldwide.\u201cRussia was dependent on China growing and driving the demand for its commodities: oil, gas and minerals,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a Russia specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cChina was an alternative to Europe.\u201dBut the price was never formally announced, and it is possible that with plunging energy prices, the deal will have to be renegotiated, said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the natural gas research program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Britain. The Chinese wanted the gas for its depressed northeast region, and the Russians had started to prepare for its delivery, but there has been only limited drilling, he said.Further complicating that deal is Russia\u2019s inability to pay for the pipelines, and the question of whether China needs the Russian gas badly enough to finance their construction, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cChina will have to pay for the construction, one way or another, given Russia\u2019s financial crunch,\u201d he said.A Chinese expert on Russia, who is usually sanguine about the relationship with Moscow, said that the deal had also run into pricing problems. \u201cThe negotiations face many difficulties due to the plunge in the price of gas,\u201d said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cWe have to recalculate all the costs and try to push for a price cut.\u201dIn Moscow, similarly, optimism about China substantially helping Russia out of its economic problems has faded.\u201cThe big hope that China is going to provide a lifeline to sustain Russia through the sanctions and the falling oil price is not working,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, an analyst of Russian-Chinese relations at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\u201cIt is a symbolic relationship \u2014 with a small, volatile economic base,\u201d he said. The Kremlin elite was \u201cdisappointed that nothing has materialized as quickly as the Russians hoped.\u201dRussian demand for Chinese manufactured goods is down 40 percent, and for clothing 50 percent, from this time last year, Mr. Gabuev said. The volatile ruble has made Chinese investors wary, and attempts to get the countries\u2019 banking sectors to work together have not borne much fruit, he added.Because the goal of $100 billion in trade with China looks impossible to reach in 2015, the $200 billion the countries had projected by 2020 might also prove overly optimistic, Russian officials say.The big energy deals are not the only victim of the economic slowdowns.Their apparent mutual admiration has been all the more noticeable because of the long and rocky relationship during the Cold War between Communist China and the Soviet Union, when the countries were ostensibly on the same side but nearly came to a nuclear showdown in 1969 over a border war. The tenure of Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the helm of the Soviet Union sent shudders through the Chinese Communist Party, and still does.\u201cThere has never been a close relationship until recently,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThe success of China has bred the interest of Russia.\u201d Even though Chinese growth was slowing, China still seemed \u201cbrighter\u201d to the Russians relative to the downswings in Europe and Ukraine and to their own economic problems, she said.The sanctions on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine also pushed the two countries closer.Both leaders boast that they have elevated the ties between their countries to a strategic relationship; Russia and China recently held joint naval exercises in the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan. And they have joined at the United Nations in opposing American initiatives in Libya and Syria, and have held similar views on Iran.But there are limits to their strategic interests. China has been wary of Russia\u2019s moves in Crimea and particularly in Ukraine, where Beijing has commercial and military investments. It also worries that Crimea\u2019s secession from Ukraine might set a precedent for Chinese territories such as Tibet or Xinjiang or for the world to recognize Taiwan\u2019s de facto independence.In Central Asia, they are more competitors than cooperative friends, especially as China buys energy from countries that have been in Russia\u2019s traditional sphere of influence, energy that China could, if it wanted, purchase from Russia.The Obama administration has responded to the friendship with a certain nonchalance, arguing that Russia will inevitably be a liability to China, particularly in hard economic times.In the words of Douglas H. Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u201cWashington seems to think Putin is more burden than boon to Beijing.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow. Yufan Huang contributed research from Beijing.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin and Obama Have Profound Differences on Syria", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBoth Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin agree that the Islamic State, which is trying to establish a caliphate in Syria and Iraq and has by some accounts grown to tens of thousands of fighters, is a major threat. Beyond that, their two visions are radically at odds, and each used his speech to blame the other for the catastrophic war and the refugee crisis it has unleashed.In theory, at least, there should be grounds for a political compromise. As the American invasion of Iraq showed, destroying state institutions leads to chaos. Every effort should thus be made to ensure that institutions in Syria continue to function once Mr. Assad is moved out of the government. Mr. Obama told the United Nations he was willing to work on Syria with Russia and Iran, which had previously been excluded. But there is little reason to believe that any compromise between the Assad government and the opposition fighters, or Washington and Moscow, will happen soon.In an obvious attempt to seize the initiative from Mr. Obama, Mr. Putin proposed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would create \u201ca genuinely broad international coalition\u201d to fight the Islamic State. That was presumably meant to supplant the American-led coalition that has been bombing Islamic State militants for over a year with one that includes Mr. Assad.Mr. Putin enabled the Assad government early on, and he has no particular strategy to contain the Syrian conflict. With Russia grappling with sanctions, lower oil prices and a weakened economy, it is unclear how much he can afford to invest in a dead-end war in Syria. Mr. Obama, who did not create this catastrophe, doesn\u2019t have the answer, either. Bombing alone won\u2019t defeat the Islamic State, and American attempts to create a proxy force to do the ground fighting have failed.In the meantime, millions of Syrians have been killed, maimed or forced to flee to Europe, and countries of the region are being further destabilized by the endless violence.Advertisement"}

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cWe must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good.\u201dIf his words of unity struck a lofty note, though, his choice of issues effectively fed the very divisions he assailed. He emboldened liberals with a passionate defense of immigration, an endorsement of environmental legislation, a blistering condemnation of the arms trade and a plea to abolish the death penalty.Highlights from Pope Francis\u2019 address to the United States Congress, where he called for dialogue, compassion and shared social responsibility.For their part, conservatives chose to focus on his defense of religious liberty, the traditional family and the sanctity of life at \u201cevery stage of its development.\u201d In the end, both sides could walk away taking vindication from parts of his message. But the liberal references in his speech were explicit and extended while the conservative ones were more veiled and concise.But afterward, he switched to his native Spanish when he appeared on the Speaker\u2019s Balcony of the Capitol to wave and share a prayer with tens of thousands of people who had gathered on the West Lawn to watch his address on jumbo televisions.While he had solemnly looked down at his text during his speech, when he stood on the balcony he beamed and reveled in the cheering crowd.\u201cI ask you all, please, to pray for me,\u201d Francis said through an interpreter, \u201cand if there are among you any who do not believe or cannot pray, I ask you please to send good wishes my way.\u201dHe concluded, in English, with a phrase no one had trouble discerning: \u201cGod bless America.\u201d\u201cWe can find no social or moral justification, no justification whatsoever, for lack of housing,\u201d Francis said. \u201cWe know that Jesus wanted to show solidarity with every person.\u201dHe waded into a crowd of mostly homeless men and women, including felons, mentally ill people, victims of domestic violence and substance abusers. He stopped to lay his hand on the heads of children who had kept quiet for hours of waiting with special pope coloring books.With his speech to lawmakers, Francis became the first pope to address a joint meeting of Congress, a milestone in the journey of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, and it generated enormous interest. Lawmakers, aides and invited guests jammed the historic chamber of the House of Representatives.Sitting behind Francis were Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and House Speaker John A. Boehner, both Catholics. Flanking the aisle at the front were Secretary of State John Kerry and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and not far behind them was Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, all Catholics. Francis, who spoke with Mr. Kerry at the White House on Wednesday, stopped to shake his hand. Mr. Boehner, who invited the pope earlier this year, wept repeatedly.Also on hand were other members of the cabinet, three Supreme Court associate justices, about a half-dozen presidential candidates, a couple of four-star generals and a smattering of bishops, priests and nuns. Lawmakers snapped photographs with smartphones and interrupted the speech about 30 times with applause.Francis devoted the greatest share of his speech at the White House on Wednesday to climate change, but he made immigration the most pronounced part of his remarks to Congress, alluding to his own family\u2019s history of moving from Italy to Argentina.\u201cWe, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants.\u201dPhotographs of the pope\u2019s first trip to the United States, as Catholics and non-Catholics alike will navigate crowds in three cities to catch a glimpse of the \u201cpeople\u2019s pope.\u201d\u201cOn this continent,\u201d he continued, \u201cthousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is that not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation.\u201dHe cited \u201cdo-unto-others\u201d and then added, \u201cThe Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development.\u201dWhile that represented typical code for abortion, Francis segued immediately and at length to a call for the abolition of the death penalty. \u201cEvery life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes,\u201d he said.He also warned of globalization, though in more measured tones than in the past. \u201cI would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cit goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth.\u201d While \u201cbusiness is a noble vocation,\u201d he said, it must be \u201can essential part of its service to the common good.\u201dHe omitted the sharpest phrase in his prepared text: \u201cIf politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance.\u201d A spokesman later said he lost his place and passed over it by accident.He was less restrained in calling for an end to the arms trade. \u201cWhy are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society?\u201d he asked. \u201cSadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money \u2014 money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood.\u201d\u201cI cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened perhaps as never before, from within and without,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.\u201dNot long ago, the prospect of the head of the Catholic Church addressing Congress would have been unthinkable. Catholics in politics were a source of suspicion and a subject of slander for generations. Today, the pendulum has swung. Nearly one in three members of the Congress that Francis addressed are Catholic.In addition to citing Lincoln and King, Francis mentioned two American Catholics to make his points: Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic Worker movement, and Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk who promoted interfaith understanding. Both lived radically simple lives, close to the poor and rejecting ambition \u2014 symbols of the Francis model of humility and devotion.\u201cA nation can be considered great,\u201d he concluded, \u201cwhen it defends liberty as Lincoln did, when it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters as Martin Luther King sought to do, when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work, the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.\u201dLaurie Goodstein contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael D.

But as she told her colleagues why she wasn\u2019t going back to Washington, she was met with a mix of disappointment (you\u2019ve let down the team), pity (too bad those kids dragged you under like millstones) and defensiveness (just because you didn\u2019t want to go five days a week without seeing your kids doesn\u2019t mean all women are such softhearted saps). Absorbing these responses, Slaughter suddenly saw a bigger picture: Other women were running into the same obstacles, often much earlier in their careers, and when they cut back on work to care for children, they paid a price in salary and promotions and the esteem of their colleagues and bosses. Hence, a yawning gender gap at the top of most professions. Meanwhile, successful women like her had been giving grad students \u201cfatuous \u2018You can have it all\u2019\u200a\u201d pep talks that obscured crucial binds of the workplace.But why, Slaughter wondered, is caring for children \u2014 surely a social good and an understandable impulse among people who have them \u2014 so often treated as a nuisance at the office? Why should employees be furtive about their \u00adparent-teacher conferences when so many colleagues and bosses are also parents? Women surged into the professional workplace decades ago. Yet the ideal worker is still imagined as either a single person or someone with a spouse at home to take care of all family matters.Slaughter is often mentioned in the same breath with Sheryl Sandberg. At around the same time, these two \u00adwomen, both conspicuously successful themselves, became the most prominent \u00adfaces of a kind of mainstream, white-collar workplace feminism \u2014 or \u201ctrickle-down feminism,\u201d as critics from the left called it. While Sandberg, in her speeches and her book \u201cLean In,\u201d coaches women to overcome workplace bias and their own internal hesitations, Slaughter has been adamant that it\u2019s the workplace, not women, that has to change. \u201cPlenty of women have leaned in for all they\u2019re worth but still run up against insuperable obstacles created by the combination of unpredictable life circumstances and the rigid inflexibilities of our workplaces, the lack of a public infrastructure of care, and cultural attitudes that devalue them the minute they step out, or even just lean back, from the work force.\u201d Most of Slaughter\u2019s specific suggestions, like flexible hours and paid parental leave, are by now familiar, but she also invites readers to reimagine what a two-career household and a successful career arc look like.Expanding the article into this book, Slaughter addresses some of her critics. Among them were men pointing out that they too feel torn between work and home. Now, instead of talking about work-family tension as a problem for women, she urges readers to see caregiving and paid work as two kinds of vital human activities that can be done by either men or women. Same-sex parents have to negotiate responsibilities without default gender roles, and Slaughter hopes straight couples will do the same. For now, though, whichever partner takes the primary caregiving role unfortunately has to be prepared for some loss in social status. While caregiving and paid work are equally important for families and society, they are not yet equally valued. The example of same-sex couples \u201clays bare another fact and fissure in our society\u201d: Regardless of gender, \u201cthe person in a couple who stays home will be valued less than the person who goes to the office.\u201dAnd if you don\u2019t work in an office? Slaughter\u2019s Atlantic article was criticized by some readers for focusing on a relatively small number of affluent workers, while ignoring the much larger group of working women in retail and service jobs. In \u201cUnfinished Business,\u201d she seeks a conceptual framework for understanding the problems of working women at all wage levels: \u201cWhat unites all women is the struggle to combine competition and care in a system that rewards one and penalizes the other.\u201dThe problem of caregiving certainly concerns women at all income levels, but it doesn\u2019t only unite them \u2014 it brings some of them into economic conflict with others, an obvious point of tension that gets lost in Slaughter\u2019s emphasis on women\u2019s common ground. However much they may be sympathetic to the concerns of domestic workers and day care staff, working women at all wage levels have an obvious financial interest in child-care fees staying low, which results in a group of underpaid workers taking care of other women\u2019s children and elderly relatives. Slaughter would like to see caregiving become a professionalized, middle-class occupation: \u201cWe should think about paid care work, from home health service to therapy to teaching, the same way we think about any other profession, including money management.\u201d But how to get there, given that, in a monetary sense, most workers simply can\u2019t afford to value child care very highly?The last chapter of \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d presents a wish list of public policy changes that would enable parents to meet family responsibilities without jeopardizing their jobs or careers. Slaughter draws on the work of Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, to propose \u201can infrastructure of care\u201d for American workers. At the top of the list is \u201chigh-quality and affordable\u201d child care \u2014 presumably subsidized by either employer or government \u2014 which only a tiny number of American employers (including the military) currently offer. It\u2019s hard to think of anything that would benefit women up and down the wage scale \u2014 including day care workers themselves \u2014 more quickly and effectively than subsidized high-quality day care with a sliding-scale fee system. Once you expand the discussion of workplace policy to include women at all wage levels, the most useful solutions seem to be political ones \u2014 some combination of expanded workers\u2019 rights, workplace regulations, higher minimum-wage levels, incentives for businesses to cover employee benefits, or portable benefits packages untethered to employment \u2014 and one regrets that collective, policy-based solutions are more or less confined to the last chapter of Slaughter\u2019s book. In the rest of \u201cUnfinished Business,\u201d Slaughter\u2019s appeal is often to an unspecified \u201cwe\u201d who \u201cshould\u201d make some sort of change, but the language obscures exactly what is to be changed \u2014 government regulations? the tax code? workplace policies? individual behavior? attitudes? \u2014 how this change might come about and who stands to gain or lose.The idea of winners and losers seems a sticky one for \u201cUnfinished Business.\u201d The workplace landscape Slaughter describes is not obviously a theater of competing economic interests. She cites research of the \u201ceverybody wins\u201d variety showing that shorter, more flexible hours and generous family leaves benefit both companies and employees: \u201cIn general, your boss wants you to be the best employee you can be, and that means making you a happy employee.\u201d Yet while there\u2019s an abundance of evidence suggesting that workers do better in a humane working environment, many companies have clearly been using a wholly different calculus to determine their labor policies, especially at the low-wage end of the spectrum: shedding full-time workers for \u201cindependent contractors\u201d who don\u2019t get benefits; subjecting employees to unpredictable, less-than-full-time schedules; counting every bathroom break or expecting workers to answer emails 24/7; and sending jobs at all skill levels abroad. Slaughter herself mentions several typical cases of punitive working conditions at retail chains, with unpredictable schedules that make finding child care a nightmare and summary firings for missing a single day of work because of illness or school closing.But while there are unhappy workers in \u201cUnfinished Business,\u201d there are no adversaries \u2014 no businesses that have reckoned that it\u2019s in their interest to cut labor costs as much as possible, no political system that has made it permissible for them to do so. Many of Slaughter\u2019s suggestions have long been progressive planks and now have wide public support. It\u2019s nice to see her firmly refer to them as bipartisan, but it\u2019s hard to imagine how we might achieve them given our actual political system and the interests mounted on the opposing side \u2014 and Slaughter doesn\u2019t much try. \u201cWorkers and managers can decide, separately and together, to create an environment that allows everyone to fit care and career together in ways that benefit both.\u201d Can they? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to find ways to make the sharing economy a caring economy, just as workers in the new factories of the Industrial Revolution turned to unions and strikes to claim their fair share of the wealth they were creating.\u201d Perhaps because of Slaughter\u2019s own political ties, \u201cUnfinished Business\u201d can sound like the work of someone running for office \u2014 \u00adoptimistic and strategically vague.Which is too bad, because the power of Slaughter\u2019s Atlantic article came out of a moment of pessimism, or maybe disillusionment, which allowed her to see through some of her professional circle\u2019s oft-repeated cant and to perceive systemic workplace obstacles for what they were. She has more useful observations about workplace culture and gender roles here, but it\u2019s disappointing that in expanding the scope of her inquiry, Slaughter has also introduced some woolliness of her own.UNFINISHED BUSINESSWomen Men Work FamilyBy Anne-Marie Slaughter328 pp. Random House. $28.Elaine Blair is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s iPhone Keeps Going Its Own Way", "Date": "2015-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIt\u2019s time to ease off from the ritualized annual fretting about the iPhone\u2019s future. After several years of uncertainty about the iPhone\u2019s long-term prospects, it\u2019s clear that Apple has maneuvered the device into an enviable position, whatever the merits of its latest features. The iPhone\u2019s continuing dominance may not be a sure thing, but in the tech industry, it\u2019s as sure a thing as you can find right now.If this doesn\u2019t surprise you, it should. In many fundamental ways, the iPhone breaks the rules of business, especially the rules of the tech business. Those rules have more or less always held that hardware devices keep getting cheaper and less profitable over time. That happens because hardware is easy to commoditize; what seems magical today is widely copied and becomes commonplace tomorrow. It happened in personal computers; it happened in servers; it happened in cameras, music players, and \u2014 despite Apple\u2019s best efforts \u2014 it may be happening in tablets.In fact, commoditization has wreaked havoc in the smartphone business \u2014 just not for Apple. In the last half-decade, sales of devices running Google\u2019s Android operating system have far surpassed sales of Apple\u2019s devices, and now account for the vast majority of smartphones in use.None of those predictions came true. While the iPhone\u2019s sales growth slowed in 2013 and 2014, it rebounded to near-record levels later last year, and its profits have remained lofty.You can expect Apple\u2019s proportion to grow. As analysts at Credit Suisse explained in a note last week, only about 30 percent of the world\u2019s 400 million iPhone users have upgraded to the large-screen models Apple introduced last year. Apple is bound to reap more money as the majority of its users inevitably jump to big phones over the next few years. In other words, for the foreseeable future, Apple stands virtually alone: It may be the only company making any money selling phones.What\u2019s driving the iPhone\u2019s escape from the trap of commodity hardware is that it is more than a hardware device. Instead, an iPhone is a tightly integrated mix of hardware, great software, and several pretty good services rolled into a single gadget.Across large swaths of the globe, in other words, the iPhone is a status symbol, which is not to say that it\u2019s frivolous \u2014 unlike a Prada suit, the iPhone is one status symbol that you\u2019ll still find extremely useful.For now, though, it\u2019s difficult to conceive of a particular way in which Apple\u2019s phone could fall to its rivals. Eight years after its introduction, the iPhone has won the biggest game in the world \u2014 and it will keep winning.The State of the Art column on Thursday, about the strength of Apple\u2019s position in smartphones, misstated the business of Canaccord, which analyzed profit share in the smartphone business. It is an investment bank, not a research firm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Law That Banned UberPop Service Survives Legal Challenge", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Constitutional Council in France upheld on Tuesday a law that banned Uber\u2019s low-cost ride-hailing service, a much-awaited decision that underscores how national courts are enforcing limits on the company\u2019s expansion into new markets.The law included a ban on the company\u2019s UberPop ride-booking service, which used drivers who did not have a professional license to pick up paying passengers. UberPop is cheaper than Uber\u2019s standard offering.The council rejected Uber\u2019s argument that the law would have also made ride-sharing illegal, affecting an accepted form of reducing travel costs for many people in France.It is unclear what the practical consequences of Tuesday\u2019s ruling will be. In July, the company suspended its UberPop service in France until the Constitutional Council made its decision.An Uber spokesman, Gareth Mead, said that the company was disappointed by the decision but that it would not have much immediate impact on its current business in France.\u201cWe suspended UberPop in light of the risk of violence to our riders and driver partners and we will maintain this suspension \u2014 the majority of our business continues unaffected,\u201d Mr. Mead said.He added that there were more legal cases and decisions in the pipeline and that while the Constitutional Council had upheld the transportation law, that ruling cleared the way for the other cases against Uber to proceed.The company has been on a recent charm offensive in France after it was caught off-guard by the violent opposition to UberPop, which allows anyone with a car to pick up passengers through the company\u2019s smartphone application.Uber has claimed that the transportation law, which bars drivers who lack professional licenses from picking up passengers, unfairly benefits taxis and should be repealed.Parisian taxi drivers say they must pay as much as $270,000 for a license to operate and argue that Uber has the unfair edge.Its service, which allows people to hail a ride via an app, has expanded to more than 300 cities in over 50 countries.Uber has often continued to offer its services despite legal demands that it stop operating. It also has brought legal challenges against regulators when it believes they are hindering the company\u2019s growth.In recent months, however, Uber executives have contacted many of France\u2019s leading politicians in an attempt to counter claims that some of the company\u2019s services are illegal, though some lawmakers remain skeptical over the company\u2019s aims.\u201cModernity is innovation, the quality of service, the sharing economy,\u201d said Bernard Cazeneuve, France\u2019s interior minister, after the anti-Uber demonstrations in July. \u201cIt is not black-market jobs and clandestine work organized against the rule of law by Uber.\u201dTo counter opposition in France and other European countries, Uber has started to lobby the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to weigh in on whether nations have the right to ban the company\u2019s offerings.A Spanish judge also recently referred a case against Uber to Europe\u2019s highest court, which will now decide whether the company is a transportation service, which would force it to follow existing rules, or a mere digital service, which would give the company greater leeway.As Uber\u2019s legal challenges mount, the company\u2019s executives have stressed their willingness to use European courts to fight against the perceived dominance of the region\u2019s taxi industry.Alissa J.

{"Headline": "Alexis Tsipras Appoints New Greek Cabinet Much Like the Old", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greece\u2019s newly re-elected prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, decided on Tuesday on a new cabinet with few new faces and returned the critical job of finance minister to Euclid Tsakalotos, the low-key economist who made headway with his eurozone peers in bailout negotiations.Under pressure from Greece\u2019s European partners to start work on a barrage of economic reforms underpinning the country\u2019s third bailout, Mr. Tsipras kept his core economic team essentially intact. He promoted Giorgos Houliarakis, an academic who spent much of his time in the previous government in detailed talks with creditors, to oversee the treasury. Mr. Houliarakis, who was finance minister in Greece\u2019s caretaker government during the election campaign, is expected to retain an active role in negotiations with creditors.After a resounding election victory on Sunday, which allowed Mr. Tsipras to re-establish a coalition between his leftist Syriza party and the right-wing Independent Greeks, government officials have a great deal of difficult work ahead of them. Unlocking rescue loans from the 83 billion euro (about $92 billion) bailout program will require them to pass a mountain of legislation in the coming weeks. Much of it \u2014 like further cuts to pensions, higher taxes on farmers and a new privatization program \u2014 is politically contentious.In an apparent bid to hit the ground running, Mr. Tsipras kept most key officials in their posts, including the economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, who was also involved in talks with Greece\u2019s creditors this summer; the foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias; the energy minister, Panos Skourletis; and the deputy prime minister, Yannis Dragasakis. A new department, to be supervised by Mr. Stathakis, will manage the distribution of European Union subsidies in a bid to bolster growth.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s coalition partner, Panos Kammenos, of the Independent Greeks, will be defense minister again, while Elena Kountoura, of the same party, will keep the portfolio for tourism, the only dynamic sector in Greece\u2019s anemic economy. A major change was to the Interior Ministry, which was assumed by the former health minister, Panagiotis Kouroumplis. The education and public order ministries also got new leaders.Tryfon Alexiadis, once vice president of the Greek tax collectors\u2019 union, is to keep the role of deputy finance minister responsible for tax affairs. The ministry for combating corruption will be led by Dimitris Papangelopoulos, a former director of Greece\u2019s intelligence agency. He replaces Panagiotis Nikoloudis, the former head of Greece\u2019s anti-money-laundering agency.The job of deputy immigration minister, part of the Interior Ministry, went to Yiannis Mouzalas, a former surgeon with the aid group Doctors Without Borders who held the post in the caretaker government over the past month, when the influx of migrants into Greece seemed to have peaked.As thousands of people continue to make their way to Europe, often on rickety boats from Turkey to one of Greece\u2019s many Aegean islands, Mr. Tsipras is to meet with other European leaders in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss a response to the crisis.The new cabinet was to be sworn in on Wednesday morning, according to a government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, who announced the names late Tuesday after hours of deliberations among Mr. Tsipras and his aides.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis\u2019 Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. President,Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you for your kind words. Once again, following a tradition by which I feel honored, the Secretary General of the United Nations has invited the Pope to address this distinguished assembly of nations. In my own name, and that of the entire Catholic community, I wish to express to you, Mr Ban Ki-moon, my heartfelt gratitude. I greet the Heads of State and Heads of Government present, as well as the ambassadors, diplomats and political and technical officials accompanying them, the personnel of the United Nations engaged in this 70th Session of the General Assembly, the personnel of the various programs and agencies of the United Nations family, and all those who, in one way or another, take part in this meeting. Through you, I also greet the citizens of all the nations represented in this hall. I thank you, each and all, for your efforts in the service of mankind.This is the fifth time that a Pope has visited the United Nations. I follow in the footsteps of my predecessors Paul VI, in 1965, John Paul II, in 1979 and 1995, and my most recent predecessor, now Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, in 2008. All of them expressed their great esteem for the Organization, which they considered the appropriate juridical and political response to this present moment of history, marked by our technical ability to overcome distances and frontiers and, apparently, to overcome all natural limits to the exercise of power. An essential response, inasmuch as technological power, in the hands of nationalistic or falsely universalist ideologies, is capable of perpetrating tremendous atrocities. I can only reiterate the appreciation expressed by my predecessors, in reaffirming the importance which the Catholic Church attaches to this Institution and the hope which she places in its activities.The United Nations is presently celebrating its seventieth anniversary. The history of this organized community of states is one of important common achievements over a period of unusually fast- paced changes. Without claiming to be exhaustive, we can mention the codification and development of international law, the establishment of international norms regarding human rights, advances in humanitarian law, the resolution of numerous conflicts, operations of peacekeeping and reconciliation, and any number of other accomplishments in every area of international activity and endeavor. All these achievements are lights which help to dispel the darkness of the disorder caused by unrestrained ambitions and collective forms of selfishness. Certainly, many grave problems remain to be resolved, yet it is clear that, without all those interventions on the international level, mankind would not have been able to survive the unchecked use of its own possibilities. Every one of these political, juridical and technical advances is a path towards attaining the ideal of human fraternity and a means for its greater realization.For this reason I pay homage to all those men and women whose loyalty and self-sacrifice have benefited humanity as a whole in these past seventy years. In particular, I would recall today those who gave their lives for peace and reconciliation among peoples, from Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld to the many United Nations officials at every level who have been killed in the course of humanitarian missions, and missions of peace and reconciliation.Beyond these achievements, the experience of the past seventy years has made it clear that reform and adaptation to the times is always necessary in the pursuit of the ultimate goal of granting all countries, without exception, a share in, and a genuine and equitable influence on, decision-making processes. The need for greater equity is especially true in the case of those bodies with effective executive capability, such as the Security Council, the Financial Agencies and the groups or mechanisms specifically created to deal with economic crises. This will help limit every kind of abuse or usury, especially where developing countries are concerned. The International Financial Agencies are should care for the sustainable development of countries and should ensure that they are not subjected to oppressive lending systems which, far from promoting progress, subject people to mechanisms which generate greater poverty, exclusion and dependence.The work of the United Nations, according to the principles set forth in the Preamble and the first Articles of its founding Charter, can be seen as the development and promotion of the rule of law, based on the realization that justice is an essential condition for achieving the ideal of universal fraternity. In this context, it is helpful to recall that the limitation of power is an idea implicit in the concept of law itself. To give to each his own, to cite the classic definition of justice, means that no human individual or group can consider itself absolute, permitted to bypass the dignity and the rights of other individuals or their social groupings. The effective distribution of power (political, economic, defense-related, technological, etc.) among a plurality of subjects, and the creation of a juridical system for regulating claims and interests, are one concrete way of limiting power. Yet today\u2019s world presents us with many false rights and \u2013 at the same time \u2013 broad sectors which are vulnerable, victims of power badly exercised: for example, the natural environment and the vast ranks of the excluded. These sectors are closely interconnected and made increasingly fragile by dominant political and economic relationships. That is why their rights must be forcefully affirmed, by working to protect the environment and by putting an end to exclusion.First, it must be stated that a true \u201cright of the environment\u201d does exist, for two reasons. First, because we human beings are part of the environment. We live in communion with it, since the environment itself entails ethical limits which human activity must acknowledge and respect. Man, for all his remarkable gifts, which \u201care signs of a uniqueness which transcends the spheres of physics and biology\u201d (Laudato Si\u2019, 81), is at the same time a part of these spheres. He possesses a body shaped by physical, chemical and biological elements, and can only survive and develop if the ecological environment is favorable. Any harm done to the environment, therefore, is harm done to humanity. Second, because every creature, particularly a living creature, has an intrinsic value, in its existence, its life, its beauty and its interdependence with other creatures. We Christians, together with the other monotheistic religions, believe that the universe is the fruit of a loving decision by the Creator, who permits man respectfully to use creation for the good of his fellow men and for the glory of the Creator; he is not authorized to abuse it, much less to destroy it. In all religions, the environment is a fundamental good (cf. ibid.).The misuse and destruction of the environment are also accompanied by a relentless process of exclusion. In effect, a selfish and boundless thirst for power and material prosperity leads both to the misuse of available natural resources and to the exclusion of the weak and disadvantaged, either because they are differently abled (handicapped), or because they lack adequate information and technical expertise, or are incapable of decisive political action. Economic and social exclusion is a complete denial of human fraternity and a grave offense against human rights and the environment. The poorest are those who suffer most from such offenses, for three serious reasons: they are cast off by society, forced to live off what is discarded and suffer unjustly from the abuse of the environment. They are part of today\u2019s widespread and quietly growing \u201cculture of waste\u201d.The dramatic reality this whole situation of exclusion and inequality, with its evident effects, has led me, in union with the entire Christian people and many others, to take stock of my grave responsibility in this regard and to speak out, together with all those who are seeking urgently-needed and effective solutions. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the World Summit, which opens today, is an important sign of hope. I am similarly confident that the Paris Conference on Climatic Change will secure fundamental and effective agreements.Solemn commitments, however, are not enough, even though they are a necessary step toward solutions. The classic definition of justice which I mentioned earlier contains as one of its essential elements a constant and perpetual will: Iustitia est constans et perpetua voluntas ius sum cuique tribuendi. Our world demands of all government leaders a will which is effective, practical and constant, concrete steps and immediate measures for preserving and improving the natural environment and thus putting an end as quickly as possible to the phenomenon of social and economic exclusion, with its baneful consequences: human trafficking, the marketing of human organs and tissues, the sexual exploitation of boys and girls, slave labour, including prostitution, the drug and weapons trade, terrorism and international organized crime. Such is the magnitude of these situations and their toll in innocent lives, that we must avoid every temptation to fall into a declarationist nominalism which would assuage our consciences. We need to ensure that our institutions are truly effective in the struggle against all these scourges.The number and complexity of the problems require that we possess technical instruments of verification. But this involves two risks. We can rest content with the bureaucratic exercise of drawing up long lists of good proposals \u2013 goals, objectives and statistical indicators \u2013 or we can think that a single theoretical and aprioristic solution will provide an answer to all the challenges. It must never be forgotten that political and economic activity is only effective when it is understood as a prudential activity, guided by a perennial concept of justice and constantly conscious of the fact that, above and beyond our plans and programmes, we are dealing with real men and women who live, struggle and suffer, and are often forced to live in great poverty, deprived of all rights.To enable these real men and women to escape from extreme poverty, we must allow them to be dignified agents of their own destiny. Integral human development and the full exercise of human dignity cannot be imposed. They must be built up and allowed to unfold for each individual, for every family, in communion with others, and in a right relationship with all those areas in which human social life develops \u2013 friends, communities, towns and cities, schools, businesses and unions, provinces, nations, etc. This presupposes and requires the right to education \u2013 also for girls (excluded in certain places) \u2013 which is ensured first and foremost by respecting and reinforcing the primary right of the family to educate its children, as well as the right of churches and social groups to support and assist families in the education of their children. Education conceived in this way is the basis for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and for reclaiming the environment.At the same time, government leaders must do everything possible to ensure that all can have the minimum spiritual and material means needed to live in dignity and to create and support a family, which is the primary cell of any social development. In practical terms, this absolute minimum has three names: lodging, labour, and land; and one spiritual name: spiritual freedom, which includes religious freedom, the right to education and other civil rights.For all this, the simplest and best measure and indicator of the implementation of the new Agenda for development will be effective, practical and immediate access, on the part of all, to essential material and spiritual goods: housing, dignified and properly remunerated employment, adequate food and drinking water; religious freedom and, more generally, spiritual freedom and education. These pillars of integral human development have a common foundation, which is the right to life and, more generally, what we could call the right to existence of human nature itself.The ecological crisis, and the large-scale destruction of biodiversity, can threaten the very existence of the human species. The baneful consequences of an irresponsible mismanagement of the global economy, guided only by ambition for wealth and power, must serve as a summons to a forthright reflection on man: \u201cman is not only a freedom which he creates for himself. Man does not create himself. He is spirit and will, but also nature\u201d (BENEDICT XVI, Address to the Bundestag, 22 September 2011, cited in Laudato Si\u2019, 6). Creation is compromised \u201cwhere we ourselves have the final word\u2026 The misuse of creation begins when we no longer recognize any instance above ourselves, when we see nothing else but ourselves\u201d (ID. Address to the Clergy of the Diocese of Bolzano-Bressanone, 6 August 2008, cited ibid.). Consequently, the defense of the environment and the fight against exclusion demand that we recognize a moral law written into human nature itself, one which includes the natural difference between man and woman (cf. Laudato Si\u2019, 155), and absolute respect for life in all its stages and dimensions (cf. ibid., 123, 136).Without the recognition of certain incontestable natural ethical limits and without the immediate implementation of those pillars of integral human development, the ideal of \u201csaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d (Charter of the United Nations, Preamble), and \u201cpromoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\u201d (ibid.), risks becoming an unattainable illusion, or, even worse, idle chatter which serves as a cover for all kinds of abuse and corruption, or for carrying out an ideological colonization by the imposition of anomalous models and lifestyles which are alien to people\u2019s identity and, in the end, irresponsible.War is the negation of all rights and a dramatic assault on the environment. If we want true integral human development for all, we must work tirelessly to avoid war between nations and between peoples.To this end, there is a need to ensure the uncontested rule of law and tireless recourse to negotiation, mediation and arbitration, as proposed by the Charter of the United Nations, which constitutes truly a fundamental juridical norm. The experience of these seventy years since the founding of the United Nations in general, and in particular the experience of these first fifteen years of the third millennium, reveal both the effectiveness of the full application of international norms and the ineffectiveness of their lack of enforcement. When the Charter of the United Nations is respected and applied with transparency and sincerity, and without ulterior motives, as an obligatory reference point of justice and not as a means of masking spurious intentions, peaceful results will be obtained. When, on the other hand, the norm is considered simply as an instrument to be used whenever it proves favorable, and to be avoided when it is not, a true Pandora\u2019s box is opened, releasing uncontrollable forces which gravely harm defenseless populations, the cultural milieu and even the biological environment.The Preamble and the first Article of the Charter of the United Nations set forth the foundations of the international juridical framework: peace, the pacific solution of disputes and the development of friendly relations between the nations. Strongly opposed to such statements, and in practice denying them, is the constant tendency to the proliferation of arms, especially weapons of mass distraction, such as nuclear weapons. An ethics and a law based on the threat of mutual destruction \u2013 and possibly the destruction of all mankind \u2013 are self-contradictory and an affront to the entire framework of the United Nations, which would end up as \u201cnations united by fear and distrust\u201d. There is urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons, in full application of the nonproliferation Treaty, in letter and spirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.The recent agreement reached on the nuclear question in a sensitive region of Asia and the Middle East is proof of the potential of political good will and of law, exercised with sincerity, patience and constancy. I express my hope that this agreement will be lasting and efficacious, and bring forth the desired fruits with the cooperation of all the parties involved.In this sense, hard evidence is not lacking of the negative effects of military and political interventions which are not coordinated between members of the international community. For this reason, while regretting to have to do so, I must renew my repeated appeals regarding to the painful situation of the entire Middle East, North Africa and other African countries, where Christians, together with other cultural or ethnic groups, and even members of the majority religion who have no desire to be caught up in hatred and folly, have been forced to witness the destruction of their places of worship, their cultural and religious heritage, their houses and property, and have faced the alternative either of fleeing or of paying for their adhesion to good and to peace by their own lives, or by enslavement.These realities should serve as a grave summons to an examination of conscience on the part of those charged with the conduct of international affairs. Not only in cases of religious or cultural persecution, but in every situation of conflict, as in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Sudan and the Great Lakes region, real human beings take precedence over partisan interests, however legitimate the latter may be. In wars and conflicts there are individual persons, our brothers and sisters, men and women, young and old, boys and girls who weep, suffer and die. Human beings who are easily discarded when our only response is to draw up lists of problems, strategies and disagreements.As I wrote in my letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 9 August 2014, \u201cthe most basic understanding of human dignity compels the international community, particularly through the norms and mechanisms of international law, to do all that it can to stop and to prevent further systematic violence against ethnic and religious minorities\u201d and to protect innocent peoples.The pope made public appearances and shared private moments among the people and the powerful in Washington.Along the same lines I would mention another kind of conflict which is not always so open, yet is silently killing millions of people. Another kind of war experienced by many of our societies as a result of the narcotics trade. A war which is taken for granted and poorly fought. Drug trafficking is by its very nature accompanied by trafficking in persons, money laundering, the arms trade, child exploitation and other forms of corruption. A corruption which has penetrated to different levels of social, political, military, artistic and religious life, and, in many cases, has given rise to a parallel structure which threatens the credibility of our institutions.I began this speech recalling the visits of my predecessors. I would hope that my words will be taken above all as a continuation of the final words of the address of Pope Paul VI; although spoken almost exactly fifty years ago, they remain ever timely. \u201cThe hour has come when a pause, a moment of recollection, reflection, even of prayer, is absolutely needed so that we may think back over our common origin, our history, our common destiny. The appeal to the moral conscience of man has never been as necessary as it is today\u2026 For the danger comes neither from progress nor from science; if these are used well, they can help to solve a great number of the serious problems besetting mankind (Address to the United Nations Organization, 4 October 1965). Among other things, human genius, well applied, will surely help to meet the grave challenges of ecological deterioration and of exclusion. As Paul VI said: \u201cThe real danger comes from man, who has at his disposal ever more powerful instruments that are as well fitted to bring about ruin as they are to achieve lofty conquests\u201d (ibid.).The common home of all men and women must continue to rise on the foundations of a right understanding of universal fraternity and respect for the sacredness of every human life, of every man and every woman, the poor, the elderly, children, the infirm, the unborn, the unemployed, the abandoned, those considered disposable because they are only considered as part of a statistic. This common home of all men and women must also be built on the understanding of a certain sacredness of created nature.Such understanding and respect call for a higher degree of wisdom, one which accepts transcendence, rejects the creation of an all-powerful elite, and recognizes that the full meaning of individual and collective life is found in selfless service to others and in the sage and respectful use of creation for the common good. To repeat the words of Paul VI, \u201cthe edifice of modern civilization has to be built on spiritual principles, for they are the only ones capable not only of supporting it, but of shedding light on it\u201d (ibid.).El Gaucho Mart\u00edn Fierro, a classic of literature in my native land, says: \u201cBrothers should stand by each other, because this is the first law; keep a true bond between you always, at every time \u2013 because if you fight among yourselves, you\u2019ll be devoured by those outside\u201d.The contemporary world, so apparently connected, is experiencing a growing and steady social fragmentation, which places at risk \u201cthe foundations of social life\u201d and consequently leads to \u201cbattles over conflicting interests\u201d (Laudato Si\u2019, 229).The present time invites us to give priority to actions which generate new processes in society, so as to bear fruit in significant and positive historical events (cf. Evangelii Gaudium, 223). We cannot permit ourselves to postpone \u201ccertain agendas\u201d for the future. The future demands of us critical and global decisions in the face of worldwide conflicts which increase the number of the excluded and those in need.The praiseworthy international juridical framework of the United Nations Organization and of all its activities, like any other human endeavor, can be improved, yet it remains necessary; at the same time it can be the pledge of a secure and happy future for future generations. And so it will, if the representatives of the States can set aside partisan and ideological interests, and sincerely strive to serve the common good. I pray to Almighty God that this will be the case, and I assure you of my support and my prayers, and the support and prayers of all the faithful of the Catholic Church, that this Institution, all its member States, and each of its officials, will always render an effective service to mankind, a service respectful of diversity and capable of bringing out, for sake of the common good, the best in each people and in every individual.Upon all of you, and the peoples you represent, I invoke the blessing of the Most High, and all peace and prosperity. Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Patter of Hooves Heralds New Season in Tuscany and Sustains a Tradition", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChiusdino Journal9 PhotosCHIUSDINO, Italy \u2014 As the morning dew faded recently, a group of riders in these Tuscan hills polished their boots and groomed their horses, then swung into the saddle, ready to drive their cows to the nearest pasture.The ritual was part of an ancient tradition, the transumanza, the seasonal moving of cattle from one land to another. For centuries, it has taken place twice a year in Italian regions where it was necessary to move cows and sheep from the cool mountaintops where they spent the summer to warm lowlands as winter approached, and vice versa.\u201cIt\u2019s not nostalgia,\u201d said Ernesto Benini Galeffi, the owner of a construction equipment company and one of the event\u2019s organizers. \u201cWe take to the past to improve our future.\u201dBut they were also joined by horse aficionados who usually work as doctors, accountants or entrepreneurs and volunteered for the drive.\u201cTransmitting the tradition of the transumanza is important to us,\u201d said Marco Mariotti, 37, a third-generation breeder with a doctorate in zootechnical genetics who was an organizer. \u201cWhen you see hasty passers-by who stop to look at animals, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201dToday, some farmers still move their livestock in the seasonal tradition, which dates back centuries. More often than not, though, they transport the animals in vans, which are less expensive and more efficient.This year\u2019s cattle drive \u2014 from the coastal region of Maremma to central Tuscany \u2014 was deliberately intended to straddle epochs. The riders were equipped with both the traditional staffs of herders and cellphones, a concession to modern-day necessities.The event was intended to underline the human aspect of the ride, which passed through countryside and city alike, in what became a spectacle at once timeless and anachronistic.\u201cMarching through nature and cities at the rhythm of the animals changes the point of view on the territory, for those who march and for those who watch,\u201d said Manolo, a French artist who, along with his partner, Camille \u2014 both of whom go by their stage names \u2014 spectacularly led the horses at each stop atop their robust Percheron and Friesian mounts.Many of their fellow riders on the drive, even if amateurs, absorbed the lesson.\u201cHere you see the world through the horse, you pay attention to barking dogs, wild boar crossings, you are inside nature, not just in touch with it,\u201d said Andrea Espositi, 61, a doctor from Rome who started riding horses again 15 years ago.In their week as cowboys, these riders spent their days taking care of their horses, catching reluctant mules that escaped the fences overnight and accompanying to pasture the Maremmana cows \u2014 a local, ancient breed famous for its large bellies and long, lyre-shaped horns.\u201cWhen you are first surrounded by these cows, you can shiver,\u201d said Birgit Neitzke-Danti, 53, a wedding planner with coral-varnished nails, azure eyeliner and blond hair lying on a perfectly ironed white shirt. \u201cBut now having them ahead of me, with those long horns, feels like looking at the sea,\u201d Ms. Neitzke-Danti said. \u201cIt\u2019s relaxing.\u201dYet in Siena, the medieval city famed for its horse race, the Palio, the idea of dozens of men and women on horseback driving loose cattle through streets did not enthuse everyone.Cows were not allowed to enter the city, as opposition politicians feared both the chaos and the dung.Still, the riders were allowed to conduct their trotting foals through the streets, as amused residents and tourists lined the way in a frenzy of flashes from iPads and smartphones.\u201cIt\u2019s a way to promote our lifestyle, which is completely in line with nature,\u201d the mayor of Siena, Bruno Valentini, said serenely while machines hastily cleaned the cobblestones in Piazza del Campo, soon after the cowboys had paid their homage to him and to the local authorities.The transumanza and its tracks once marked most of Italy\u2019s regions because of the country\u2019s conformation with a long mountain chain running through it and beaches all around the boot-shaped peninsula.Shepherds used to help keep the woods clean and check the mountains for erosion or fallen trees. In Tuscany, they also contributed to the area\u2019s economy for centuries, as its grand duke exacted a toll tax from the shepherds at each passage until the late 1770s.As mechanization came about, and cars and vans became more affordable in the 1950s, shepherds started moving their cattle in vehicles, saving time. Residents slowly forgot about the old tracks and the cowboys who once rode those paths.\u201cBut I haven\u2019t forgotten. It\u2019s my tradition, my culture. I want it to continue,\u201d said Giancarlo Cerofolini, who has spent 36 of his 46 years on horseback in Tuscany and the Lazio region or at Disneyland Paris, where he played the cowboy in the Buffalo Bill show for four years.But these days, many farms in Tuscany and the Lazio region struggle to find shepherds on horseback for their cattle. Those who still do the job as in the old days wake up at 4 a.m. and may have to ride for 10 or 11 hours a day, grouping the cattle, vaccinating them or moving them from one pasture to another.\u201cIt\u2019s tiring, but when you are here, with the animals, all your concerns fade away,\u201d said Aldo Novembri, 57, a cowboy who manages about 120 animals in his farm in southern Tuscany and says he has covered more ground on a horse than in a car.\u201cOf course, this is mostly a show to me,\u201d he said dryly, yet romantically, his reins in the left hand and the wooden staff in his right, while his dark brown Maremmano horse agilely trotted near the Cistercian abbey where St. Galgano is said to have planted his sword in the stone, a legend connected to King Arthur of Britain.\u201cBut you can feel the spirit of the transumanza, of brotherhood among people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a family here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Carlos Henriquez Radiates Gratitude in a South Bronx Homecoming", "Date": "2015-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next step is persona, composition, big ideas, the who-are-you and where-are-you-going of music, and Jazz at Lincoln Center is helping him with that. On Saturday night he was the center of \u201cCarlos Henriquez: Back in the Bronx,\u201d a concert at Lehman Center for the Performing Arts. This week his first album, \u201cThe Bronx Pyramid,\u201d will be released by Blue Engine, Jazz at Lincoln Center\u2019s new record label. Jazz at Lincoln Center and its director, Wynton Marsalis, have been careful and serious about presenting the confluence of jazz and Afro-Latin music: breaking it down into isolated parts, expanding it, analyzing the hundred-year relationship. Mr. Henriquez, who grew up in the South Bronx, has been central to those efforts since the late 1990s, when he joined the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra as a teenager. He had already played with Eddie Palmieri, and by the age of 20 he had appeared on two of the great recent records synthesizing jazz and Afro-Latin music, Danilo Perez\u2019s \u201cMotherland\u201d and Gonzalo Rubalcaba\u2019s \u201cSupernova.\u201d Maybe by now he can afford to grandstand. He doesn\u2019t. He waits for his moment, then delivers with concision. Some of Saturday\u2019s performance felt stolid, or just subtle; it all seemed true to Mr. Henriquez\u2019s personality.The concert was the opener of an unusual season for Jazz at Lincoln Center. The public spaces in its home-base theater complex at Columbus Circle are under construction, so its bigger concerts are being held elsewhere for several months. Having Mr. Henriquez\u2019s breakout moment at Lehman, in the Kingsbridge Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, was a good idea, for both hometown-hero and community-outreach reasons. (Jazz at Lincoln Center chartered a bus from Columbus Circle to the Bronx for its subscribers, but this was a local crowd, too. The organization estimated that half the audience members were first-time attendees of a Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra concert.) The band \u2014 18 members on Saturday, including the percussionists Bobby Allende, Carlos Padron and Marc Qui\u00f1ones \u2014 is a tight ship. Pushed to the front, Mr. Henriquez makes it tighter. Saturday\u2019s arrangements all had a sense of proportion, with regular switching-off between Afro-Latin clave rhythm and jazz swing, chord voicings spread across brass and woodwind sections, and short solo sections. A few of those solos took off \u2014 a voluminous one by the trombonist Elliot Mason, and a powerfully organized one by the timbalero Mr. Qui\u00f1ones \u2014 but often they seemed like extensions of Mr. Henriquez\u2019s larger project: managing a grand confluence, keeping equilibrium.The concert\u2019s last song was Mr. Henriquez\u2019s \u201cDescarga Entre Amigos,\u201d a jam-session track from \u201cThe Bronx Pyramid,\u201d and here, finally, Mr. Henriquez seized his moment in a solo. It was short, but strong and present; it rearranged the flow of time a little bit. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For His Unconventional Campaign, Donald Trump Looks to an Unorthodox Manager", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe was a lobbyist who represented one client who sought funds from the federal stimulus program and then another, a group backed by the Koch brothers, who opposed it. He was a political operative who once debated a cardboard cutout of the Democratic governor of New Hampshire to protest tax rates.And he was a congressional aide who was arrested after he brought a gun to work, then sued when he did not get it back.Perhaps not surprisingly, the campaign manager for Donald J. Trump\u2019s unorthodox bid for president, Corey Lewandowski, a 40-year-old New Hampshire resident, does not have a conventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9.In searching for someone to steer his effort, Mr. Trump went not to someone with a depth of experience in national elections, but to someone he appears to see as a kindred spirit: a deeply ambitious, sometimes-mercurial master of self-reinvention (he has also been a New Hampshire state public safety officer and a real estate agent). And, like Mr. Trump, exactly what his political leanings are beyond a belief in small government is uncertain.Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s unconventional background is matched by his unconventional approach to managing a campaign.While some candidates look for a manager who will rein in their impulses, Mr. Lewandowski channels them. He is not interested in telling Mr. Trump what to do or in being a master strategist. His greatest attribute, Mr. Trump said in an interview, is that \u201che knows when to speak up.\u201d\u201cHe leaves me alone, but he knows when to make his presence felt,\u201d Mr. Trump said.At one point, Mr. Lewandowski was part of the fabric of establishment Washington, working for former Representative Bob Ney of Ohio, and, later, with the Republican National Committee.But, said David N. Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United, who helped connect the candidate with his campaign manager, Mr. Lewandowski \u201cis as antiestablishment as Mr. Trump.\u201dHe is also relatively parochial, having spent most of his life in New England.Even now, he tries to get home as much as he can to New Hampshire, where he lives with his family, and where the many Republicans who know him or know of him decline to speak ill of him for the record, even as a few privately question whether he is playing at a level that is over his head.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Mr. Trump, who rarely brings new people into his small circle of advisers, has been content to let Mr. Lewandowski consolidate power after the departure of Roger J. Stone Jr., a long-serving adviser. Mr. Stone has said that he has taken issue with the tone that the campaign had begun to take, but that he still supports Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump told one friend that he liked Mr. Lewandowski \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t get emotional.\u201dBut that is not a view that is universally shared about Mr. Lewandowski, who is known to have a temper and who had a mixed reputation at Americans for Prosperity, the group sponsored by Charles G. and David H. Koch he first represented as a lobbyist and for which he later went to work.He held various jobs in the Kochs\u2019 political world, including as a state director in New Hampshire and, last year, as the head of a national voter registration drive. He promoted the Kochs\u2019 views of small government, which led to his stunt debating a cardboard cutout of Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire on national tax day in 2010.After seven years with Americans for Prosperity, Mr. Lewandowski moved on, leaving behind some fans who found him to be efficient and effective, but also some detractors, who found his abrasiveness off-putting.Mr. Lewandowski is hardly media-shy \u2014 he has been a frequent CNN guest promoting Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2014 but he is not eager to discuss himself. He declined requests for an interview.Two of his former bosses described him as less of an innovator than an executor.A tall, reedy man with the features of a young Robert Duvall in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d with close-cropped hair, pale skin and dark circles under his eyes, Mr. Lewandowski began his political career in his hometown, Lowell, Mass., when he ran unsuccessfully for a state legislative seat in 1994.A few years later, he ended up working for Mr. Ney.\u201cI remember he was doing the interview, and he had a frayed cuff\u201d on his shirt, Mr. Ney recalled. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018That\u2019s just a regular working guy.\u2019 \u201dAfter the election, Mr. Lewandowski went to work in Washington as Mr. Ney\u2019s chief of staff, and made headlines when he brought an unloaded gun into a House office building in the bottom of his laundry bag. He was charged with a misdemeanor. He said it was an accident, and his lawsuit, charging that he had been denied due process when his gun was taken away, was thrown out by a judge.After Mr. Ney was convicted of corruption charges in the Abramoff scandal and forced to resign in 2006, Mr. Lewandowski wrote a letter to the court defending him.\u201cI know the true Bob Ney,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski wrote. Years later, Mr. Ney said, his parents still ask about Mr. Lewandowski, who was seen as a member of their family.In 2002, Mr. Lewandowski managed the re-election effort of Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who had a complicated history with the Republican Party and who had switched his affiliation to independent when he ran for president for a short while in 2000.\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, he had never managed anything at the level of the Senate prior to me,\u201d Mr. Smith said, recalling Mr. Lewandowski. \u201cWe lost, but I don\u2019t blame him for that.\u201dDuring that race, the Smith camp raised questions about Mr. Sununu\u2019s credibility as a supporter of Israel (he has a Lebanese background), criticisms that the congressman\u2019s allies saw as having anti-Arab undertones.After Mr. Smith had lost, and with Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s relationship to the party establishment deeply frayed, he held different jobs, including working with the New Hampshire Department of Public Safety.Another client was Americans for Prosperity, which has criticized the stimulus spending.Mr. Lewandowski worked closely with the group as it tried to establish a foothold in New Hampshire, and eventually went to work for it full time.Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement that Mr. Lewandowski was \u201cvalued\u201d and that \u201che left on good terms.\u201dBut he also had his enemies, who recall some controversies around his tenure, including over his efforts to oversee the group\u2019s national voter registration drive for the 2014 midterm election, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonyity to discuss internal business.Despite Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s connections to the Koch brothers\u2019 world, Mr. Trump, like several other candidates, has not been invited to the group\u2019s recent donor network gatherings.Mr. Trump has told friends he was surprised by the snub, describing the Kochs as \u201cgood friends.\u201dAs for his campaign manager, Mr. Trump insisted that he had to woo Mr. Lewandowski away from Americans for Prosperity. But even then, he suggested, he made clear that he was going to decide for himself how he was going to run.\u201cThis is going to be a different kind of campaign,\u201d he told his new hire.Kitty Bennett and Steve Eder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dispute at Coke Bottling Plant Could Signal Labor Challenges for E.U.", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat, at least according to the company, is the issue at a factory here that reopened its gates by court order on Monday, 18 months after it was closed as part of a cost-cutting plan.But fewer than half of the site\u2019s 220 employees returned to work on Monday, instead demanding that they be given their previous jobs. The trouble is, those jobs involved bottling tasks no longer done at this factory on the outskirts of Madrid. The owner, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners, has converted it to a logistics center that will now mainly store beverages bottled at other plants.As a tense face-off played out at the factory gates on Monday, both sides await a Spanish national court ruling on the case, which might come as soon as this week. That decision could test the conservative government\u2019s effort to give employers greater flexibility as a way to address the country\u2019s high unemployment.The outcome, which either side might choose to appeal to a European Union high court, could also help determine how much leeway Pan-European companies have in doing business within individual member states. And the case is shaping up as a political litmus test ahead of national elections in December that will pit the conservative party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy against mostly left-leaning opponents.\u201cToday is a day of victory for the working class, but tomorrow we continue our fight until we all get back inside and are doing our old jobs,\u201d Juan Carlos Asenjo, a representative of the Workers\u2019 Commissions, the main labor union at this factory, told workers from a platform erected outside the gates.He spoke as a group of employees prepared to take over from their colleagues for the afternoon shift. Even most of those who had agreed to go back to work wore red T-shirts with slogans denouncing the company\u2019s downsizing.The dispute and court ruling are not likely to derail the mega-merger, experts say. But in the view of Mart\u00edn Godino Reyes, a managing partner of Sagardoy, a Madrid law firm that represents Coca-Cola Iberian, the face-off is sending the wrong message to multinational companies looking at Spain.But union leaders say Coca-Cola Iberian is taking unfair advantage of labor reforms pushed through in 2012 by Mr. Rajoy that were meant to reinvigorate Spain\u2019s employment market and make labor rules less rigid, notably by making it easier for employers to hire and fire workers.\u201cThis is a clear case of corporate greed,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Serena, an official from the General Union of Workers, the other main Spanish union. \u201cCompanies can\u2019t be allowed to do whatever they want to boost profits because, in the end, there are not just numbers but people working for them, who have their own problems, families and mortgages.\u201dMr. Rajoy is hoping to convince voters that Spain is now outpacing other European economies, with expected growth of at least 3 percent this year. But left-leaning opposition parties and unions argue that the high jobless rate and the protest by the bottling workers show Spain\u2019s two-speed recovery is increasing inequality.\u201cIf Spain is coming out of the crisis, that must benefit every citizen, and not just the wealthy and a few shareholders who care nothing about workers,\u201d said Mercedes P\u00e9rez Merino, another official from the Workers\u2019 Commissions, who has worked for 32 years at different bottling factories near Madrid.The Fuenlabrada factory, which was opened in 1980 and was formerly one of the biggest Coke bottling plants in Europe, has been the epicenter of the labor conflict. Workers not only went on indefinite strike, but also blocked access to the factory and built a makeshift camp at its gates to ensure management could not surreptitiously dismantle production lines. The workers also tried to promote a boycott of Coke products.Many of Fuenlabrada\u2019s workers are second-generation employees who speak of feeling betrayed, like Lorenzo P\u00e9rez, 44. He wore a T-shirt on which he had crossed out the word \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d and written \u201cTraitor\u201d instead.\u201cI used to have Coke running in my blood, but it\u2019s now almost evaporated,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said. Even if the Spanish bottler isn\u2019t owned by Coca-Cola, he argued, \u201cOf course, such a powerful brand bears some responsibility as it had the means to stop this absurd restructuring plan.\u201dSpain has been struggling with near-record joblessness since 2008, when its construction bubble burst and the country was pushed into recession and a banking crisis. The Rajoy government, arguing that rigid worker protections were impeding a recovery, sought to promote job creation with its labor overhauls.But as highlighted by the Coca-Cola Iberian dispute, the new labor rules resulted in a flurry of court cases. Since 2012, Spanish judges have sided with unions in about half of the 200 cases they have reviewed involving collective layoffs, either forcing changes or blocking the job cuts altogether.\u201cThe labor reform has added flexibility to what was a very rigid labor market, but it\u2019s also given judges a lot more influence and opportunities to make their own interpretations\u201d of what precisely amounts to an improper dismissal, said Jes\u00fas Lahera, a professor of labor law at the Complutense University of Madrid.The dispute at this factory dates from January 2014, when Coca-Cola Iberian announced it would close four of its 11 Spanish factories, including Fuenlabrada. The company said the plants were operating at about half of production capacity. The original plan called for the company to lay off 1,190 of its nearly 4,600 workers in Spain.After street protests and strikes, the company said it would reduce the job cuts to 840 workers. Unions nonetheless took the company to court \u2014 and won. In June 2014, Spain\u2019s national court found that the company had not adequately informed workers of its layoff plans and had illegally circumvented their right to strike by using alternative production and distribution channels.The company appealed to the Spanish Supreme Court, losing again. In April, the Supreme Court ordered Coca-Cola Iberian to rehire any employee who did not accept the company\u2019s layoff package, worth an average 135,000 euros per dismissed worker, according to the Spanish bottler.About 300 workers, including the 220 holdouts in Fuenlabrada, are now hoping that the lower Spanish national court will grant them the right not only to resume work, but also to return to the same jobs that they previously held \u2014 namely, bottling Coke and the company\u2019s other beverages.Legal experts said that it would be unprecedented for a court to force a company to produce a specific product against its will. But the Coca-Cola brand name is being \u201cused as a symbol\u201d by disgruntled workers as part of their broader fight against multinational capitalism, according to Rom\u00e1n Gil Alburquerque, another partner at the Sagardoy law firm.\u201cThis dispute with the unions is no longer about working conditions, but more about achieving a victory over this kind of company,\u201d Mr. Gil Alburquerque said. Should the unions win again and force the bottling of Coke, he warned, \u201cThis will then be creating more uncertainty around the negotiating tables\u201d of other companies trying to downsize.If the high court orders Coca-Cola Iberian to resume its previous bottling activities at Fuenlabrada or the other plants it closed, it is unclear how the company could comply. It has already given up the lease on one of the factories it was renting. Forced resumption of bottling in Fuenlabrada could \u201ckill the whole reorganization plan,\u201d or cause the company to shut other factories, Mr. Gil Alburquerque said.But some workers warned that the Spanish dispute could play out elsewhere in Europe if the bottling merger results in future job cuts. \u201cWhatever happens in Spain,\u201d warned Ms. P\u00e9rez Merino, the union official, \u201cthis is the start of a conflict that will unfortunately spread soon to the rest of Europe \u2014 be sure of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama and Xi Jinping of China Agree to Steps on Cybertheft", "Date": "2015-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China took their first concrete steps on Friday toward reining in the rising threat of cyberattacks between the world\u2019s two largest economies, pledging that their governments would refrain from computer-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain even as Mr. Obama suggested that he might still impose sanctions if rampant Chinese hacking persisted.With Mr. Xi standing beside him at a Rose Garden news conference, Mr. Obama said the two had reached a \u201ccommon understanding\u201d that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions to poach intellectual property, and that they would together seek \u201cinternational rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.\u201dBut Mr. Obama said that he had told the Chinese president during two hours of meetings at the White House that the escalating cycle of cyberattacks against American targets \u201chas to stop,\u201d warning Mr. Xi that the United States would go after and punish perpetrators of those offenses through traditional law enforcement tools and, potentially, with sanctions.\u201cThe question now is, \u2018Are words followed by actions?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Obama said of China\u2019s commitments on cyberthreats. \u201cAnd we will be watching carefully to make an assessment as to whether progress has been made in this area.\u201dIt was the third set of meetings between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi in the last three years, and it came at a potential pivot point in United States-China relations, with the Obama administration determined to find areas where it can cooperate with Beijing but increasingly wary of its behavior. Besides their meeting at the White House, the two presidents spent more than two and a half hours together Thursday night at a private dinner at Blair House, across from the White House.At their news conference, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi made an effort to demonstrate that they had made progress on curbing cyberattacks, even as they skirted direct references to some of the most contentious issues, including the United States\u2019 claim that China was behind the theft of security dossiers on roughly 22 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management.\u201cConfrontation and friction are not the right choice,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cConfrontation will lead to losses on both sides.\u201dThe pledge on cybersecurity \u2014 a hard-fought and not entirely expected bit of progress that was still under negotiation until the final hours before the two presidents met \u2014 came as Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi sought to spotlight their cooperation on the world stage.But there was ample evidence, even as Mr. Obama welcomed Mr. Xi with a 21-gun salute and a state dinner on Friday night, that the two nations remain deeply at odds on key issues.Speaking in the Rose Garden, they clashed over China\u2019s reclamation of islands in the South China Sea, which Mr. Xi defiantly defended, suggesting that China\u2019s buildup on artificial islands in the strategic waterway would move ahead and flatly denying that it was militarizing any territory.Mr. Obama said he told Mr. Xi that he had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over the activities, \u201cwhich makes it harder for countries in the region to resolve disagreements peacefully.\u201d While the United States has no territorial claim in the waters, he added, \u201cwe just want to make sure that the rules of the road are upheld.\u201dThe Chinese president stuck to his guns, bluntly asserting, \u201cWe have the right to uphold our own territorial sovereignty and lawful and legitimate maritime rights and interests.\u201d Mr. Xi said China\u2019s construction activities \u201cdo not target or impact any country, and China does not intend to pursue militarization.\u201dThe exchange underscored the degree to which Mr. Xi has in many ways confounded Mr. Obama\u2019s hopes and expectations.\u201cAs the most powerful leader in China in decades, Mr. Xi presented an opportunity for greater collaboration,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser on Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Instead, he \u201cturned out to be an ultranationalist, bent on achieving the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation even if it meant damaging ties with the U.S. as well as China\u2019s neighbors.\u201dIn another point of friction, Mr. Obama said he had deep concerns over human rights in China, describing what sounded like a lecture he had given to Mr. Xi about the issue.\u201cI expressed in candid terms our strong views that preventing journalists, lawyers, NGOs and civil society groups from operating freely, or closing churches or denying ethnic minorities equal treatment, are all problematic in our view, and actually prevent China and its people from realizing its full potential,\u201d Mr. Obama said, using an acronym for nongovernmental organizations, which face strict restrictions under proposed legislation in China.The stern message elicited only a generic response from Mr. Xi, who said democracy and human rights were \u201cthe common procedure of mankind,\u201d but then added, \u201cWe must recognize that countries have different historical processes and realities, that we need to respect people of all countries in the right to choose their own development independently.\u201dEven the agreement on cybersecurity left room for differences. The United States and China said they would cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes and, according to a White House fact sheet, \u201cmitigate malicious cyberactivity emanating from their territory.\u201d But while Mr. Obama said they had agreed on \u201cthe principle that governments don\u2019t engage in cyberespionage for commercial gain against companies,\u201d Mr. Xi said nothing of computer-enabled spying, speaking only of \u201ccybercrime,\u201d a narrower formulation.The two countries also embraced a United Nations accord, adopted in July, that commits the signatories not to target one another\u2019s critical infrastructure \u2014 such as power plants, cellphone networks and financial transactions \u2014 in peacetime. But that leaves open many questions, since there are many definitions of what constitutes critical infrastructure.The morning began with an elaborate White House welcome, complete with cannons reverberating across the South Lawn as a military band played \u201cMarch of Volunteers,\u201d the anthem of the People\u2019s Republic of China since the 1949 revolution, and \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d The two leaders strolled across the grass reviewing neat rows of troops, then stopped to shake hands with crowds of children waving American and Chinese flags, including some who attend Washington Yu Ying Academy, a Chinese immersion school. Later, they announced a \u201cOne Million Strong\u201d initiative that aims to have a million American students learning Mandarin by 2020.Jane Perlez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Notice: Greece\u2019s Vested Interests", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTINOS, Greece \u2014 One of the few near-certainties about Sunday\u2019s general election in Greece is that it will produce a government committed, at least nominally, to the bailout agreement struck last month with the country\u2019s creditors. Not only is former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras a reluctant convert to the deal, which could make available 86 billion euros in new loans, the main opposition party, New Democracy, is prepared to back it, too.A casual observer may think the bailout condemns Greece to more years of austerity. This is part of the story, but not its main aspect. Greece\u2019s two previous bailouts sought to cut spending and raise taxes; insofar as they tackled special interests, they concentrated on limiting the power of organized labor. The thrust of the latest plan, in contrast, is to combat cheating and sweep away the privileges enjoyed by a wide swath of groups, including farmers, shipping magnates and pharmacists. Some of these are natural supporters of the former conservative-led coalition, which explains why it did not do more to curb their privileges (and why Mr. Tsipras, a leftist, sees some political mileage in doing so).Affected groups may squawk, but the country will benefit. Prices will fall and consumer choice will increase as businesses respond to competition. And if the fight against tax evasion succeeds, honest citizens will no longer have to carry the burden of those who cheat.Take farmers, who enjoy a 13 percent income tax \u2014 half the rate at which Greek businesses, and most Greeks, are taxed. They also receive diesel oil subsidies and cheaper electricity. No wonder thousands of Greeks who may be only tangentially employed in the agriculture sector identify themselves as farmers.With the new agreement, the government will increase the tax rate to 26 percent, phase out subsidized diesel and tighten requirements to ensure that benefits go only to those who genuinely live off the land. The adjustment process will be harsh, but the result will be fairer.Prior to the latest bailout, Greece capped the shelf life of \u201cfresh\u201d pasteurized milk at seven days, well under the 10-day European Union average. This made importing milk impractical: In 2011, the price of fresh milk in Greece was 35 percent above the E.U. average, according to the O.E.C.D. The new agreement abolishes the rule setting the shelf life of fresh milk. The resulting shift to cheaper imports may increase competition for Greek farmers, but should benefit consumers.Now look at medicine. Generally, the standard practice for Greek physicians has been to prescribe expensive patented drugs instead of generics. This, coupled with a large prescription volume, led Greece in 2012 to spend 2.3 percent of its G.D.P. on pharmaceuticals, above the E.U. average of 1.5 percent. The high level of spending is good for pharmacies, but has drained the public purse. Doctors are now being told to prescribe generic drugs, and pharmacists must offer patients cheaper alternatives to pricier brand names. What\u2019s more, nonprescription drugs like aspirin will be sold in supermarkets.Educators are also in the line of fire. According to the O.E.C.D., Greek primary school teachers in 2012 spent only 569 hours in the classroom, about a quarter below the E.U. average. The discrepancy was even greater for secondary school teachers, who spent one-third fewer hours in the classroom compared with their E.U. counterparts. Now the number of classroom hours per teacher must be increased by June 2018, to align Greece with O.E.C.D. best practices.The list continues. Shipping is one of Greece\u2019s most important industries, accounting for about 7 percent of G.D.P. The country\u2019s nationals control some 17 percent of the global merchant fleet. Unsurprisingly, Greece\u2019s billionaire magnates enjoy tax exemptions on profits from their operations and the sale of vessels. Under the new bailout, the tonnage tax on shipping has been increased, and some tax privileges will be phased out.Perhaps the most damaging vested interest is the government itself. For decades, Greek politicians stuffed the civil service with their cronies, leaving it weak and politicized. Greece\u2019s latest deal with its creditors requires senior public administrators, who have been working on a temporary basis since the civil service was reorganized in 2014, to reapply for their jobs by the end of next year. Re-employment will be merit-based, determined according to a system coordinated by the European Commission.It is sometimes hard to distinguish a vested interest from an excessively generous benefit. One case in point is the pension system, which enabled Greeks to start drawing benefits before reaching the country\u2019s official retirement ages. As a result, Greece in 2012 spent 17.5 percent of its G.D.P. on pensions, compared with a 13.2 percent E.U. average. While previous bailouts pushed through some reforms to reduce these expenditures, the latest program goes further, raising the official retirement age to 67 and increasing financial penalties for taking pensions earlier.Greeks haven\u2019t just been creative in dreaming up privileges; they\u2019ve been masterful tax dodgers. To target this problem, the new agreement more broadly defines tax evasion. It also eliminates the 30 percent discount on value-added tax in the Aegean islands, which made it possible for people to buy goods on an island with a lower sales tax and ferry them to the mainland.Greece had to endure a near-death experience before it was prepared to confront its vast array of vested interests. It remains to be seen whether the next government will energetically target these privileges. But if it does, Greece will emerge with a fairer and more efficient economy.Hugo Dixon is the author of \u201cThe In/Out Question: Why Britain Should Stay in the EU and Fight to Make It Better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Leaps for Parental Leave, if Workers Actually Take It", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWork-Life BalanceSome corners of corporate America have a new message for new parents: Put down that laptop and pick up your baby instead.Even as employees are increasingly tethered to the office, a workplace culture that urges new mothers and fathers to hurry back to their cubicles is beginning to shift.In recent weeks, companies like Accenture and Microsoft said they would offer more family-friendly benefits like generous parental leave. The trend may be a sign of a tightening job market, at least for a certain segment of highly skilled performers.Such contradictory signaling from Yahoo, which lengthened its parental leave in 2013, is typical and ambiguous, said Joan Williams, director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings. \u201cThe underlying work culture sends the message that if you\u2019re really committed, you\u2019re here all the time,\u201d she said.These companies are in the vanguard of a movement, some experts believe. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of revolutionary changes in the workplace,\u201d said Stew Friedman, director of the Wharton Work/Life Integration Project at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt will be a 15- to 20-year project, but the competitive pressures in the labor market are pushing toward greater freedom and flexibility.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. may be behind on family-friendly benefits, but I see it\u2019s changing, because we\u2019re all facing a talent war,\u201d said Julie Sweet, Accenture\u2019s chief executive of North America.Tech companies are in a constant battle for star engineers, so their recent announcements might have been promotional as much as anything. Lauren Edelmeier, a senior manager in design research and development at Microsoft, where up to 4 percent of workers are out on parental leave at any one time, is in the middle of her 20-week paid leave with her 3-month-old daughter Vivian.\u201cI feel really fortunate to have this time at home,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to watch her grow, and she knows who I am.\u201dYet office culture heavily influences whether people feel they can take their full leave. The 35-year-old father of a baby in San Francisco was offered 12 weeks of paid leave in his government job, but took half.\u201cIt was phrased like, \u2018Take all the time you need.\u2019 It was not phrased, \u2018We\u2019ll see you in 12 weeks,\u2019 \u201d he said, declining to have his name published because of the sensitivities of the issue in the office. \u201cIt puts it all on the employee, and you want to prove you\u2019re good and valuable.\u201dPerhaps that is why Ms. Mayer, in her post, emphasized that she was committed to both her job and her family, an explanation not typically heard from male executives with children.To address these issues, companies have tried various methods to encourage all employees to use the benefits.Microsoft, which used to pay for just a portion of parental leave, decided to pay for all of it as a symbol of its support.\u201cWe fully expect to have close to 100 percent uptake,\u201d said Fred Thiele, senior director of global benefits at Microsoft.At Accenture, primary caregivers are automatically enrolled in the no-travel policy, instead of opting in.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to think, \u2018What will people think of me if I actually choose to do this?\u2019 \u201d said Ellyn Shook, its chief human resources officer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Economists Forecast Growth Under Jeb Bush? By Guessing", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax PolicyThey say it would add half a percentage point to G.D.P. growth every year for a decade, eventually adding 5 percent to the size of the economy.For decades, faster economic growth has been a key justification offered by Republican candidates promoting tax plans that include large tax cuts for the highest earners and owners of capital. These sorts of tax cuts, their economic advisers say, will produce more jobs, higher wages and better standards of living.The problem is, nobody really knows how tax cuts actually affect jobs and growth \u2014 not even economists.A model built by Alan Auerbach and Laurence Kotlikoff found that abolishing income taxes in favor of a consumption tax would add 9 percent to G.D.P. in the long run. Another model by John Diamond and George Zodrow found that a more modest tax overhaul considered by House Republicans last year, focused on cutting rates and eliminating deductions, would lift G.D.P. by 3 percent. Other proposals fell somewhere in the middle, and so, the Hubbard group thought, would Mr. Bush\u2019s.\u201cThis is four smart people who made an educated guess based on looking at other models,\u201d said Joel Slemrod, a public finance economist at the University of Michigan. \u201cIf I had to pick a number, I would have picked a lower number.\u201dAnd that\u2019s the thing: While most economists agree that tax policy can have significant effects on economic growth, they have a remarkable ability to look at the same body of evidence and disagree wildly on the size of the effects. Asking a handful of economists about how your tax plan will affect the economy is better than throwing darts at a dartboard, but it\u2019s not necessarily that much better.Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Kotlikoff have collaborated since the 1980s on influential models of how taxes affect the economy. Yet they disagree on how to evaluate Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan. Mr. Auerbach said he read the Hubbard group letter and immediately thought the growth estimates were too high, while Mr. Kotlikoff thought they were too low.\u201c0.5 percent a year definitely stuck out when I read it,\u201d said Mr. Auerbach, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cI don\u2019t really think it\u2019s reasonable.\u201d He notes the Bush plan retains significant taxes on investment income, while his model found the largest growth effects from abolishing such taxes. He also thought it would take much longer than 10 years for the positive economic effects of a major tax overhaul to be fully felt.Mr. Kotlikoff, a professor at Boston University, said nearly the opposite: He thought the Bush plan, especially its provision allowing companies to fully and immediately deduct capital expenses from their taxes, would have large and swift economic effects. He said he thought the plan would grow the economy by more than 5 percent, and he thought most of those effects would be felt within the first decade, pointing to Ireland as an example of a country that experienced rapid economic growth after cutting corporate income taxes.This is how the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office deal with the economics profession\u2019s uncertainty about how taxes affect the economy: They provide a range of estimates, often such a broad range that it feels as if the report isn\u2019t telling you anything at all.Douglas Elmendorf, who until recently served as the director of the Congressional Budget Office, told me the main usefulness of these reports is the estimates they rule out: By saying a tax plan might cause a boost to G.D.P. from 0.1 to 1.6 percent, they are saying to ignore an outside report promising it will cause a rise of 4 percent. (Mr. Elmendorf joined several other economists in saying he thought the prediction of 5 percent in the Hubbard group letter was overly rosy.)Mr. Slemrod also urged economists to talk in terms of ranges rather than point estimates when discussing how taxes affect the economy, to reflect the fact that these figures are simply educated guesses. But he understands why they don\u2019t. \u201cWashington wants a number,\u201d he said. \u201cWashington doesn\u2019t like confidence intervals.\u201dIn the case of Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan, using a point estimate is politically desirable because it builds in the economic feedback effects as a key justification for the policy. If the tax cuts really did cause the economy to grow by 5 percent, they would generate a lot of revenue to offset the cost of cutting taxes, and would do a lot to improve living standards even for people who do not benefit much directly from the tax cut.If you instead consider a range of possible economic effects that includes very small ones, you have to be prepared for the possibility that the tax cuts won\u2019t provide those benefits. That means the government will have to borrow much more money and cut more spending than anticipated. Or raise other taxes.The recently enacted tax cut fits naturally into a growth-oriented agenda. Lower taxes reduce fiscal drag on the economy in the short term. Lower marginal tax rates provide longer-term incentives for work, savings, risk-taking and innovation. In this way, the current fiscal policy helps to provide for the future of Social Security.That guess turned out to be both wrong and expensive.Advertisement"}

Do these people have to be sent to the Rio Grande Valley to see how ludicrous a border fence \u2014 over mountains, vast deserts, remote valleys and private property \u2014 would be? And it won\u2019t solve the problem they are railing against, which doesn\u2019t exist anyway. Illegal immigration has fallen essentially to zero.On foreign affairs, there was a lot of talk about not talking with bad people. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said his first act would be to tear up the Iran deal, throwing the nuclear race back to the ayatollahs and rupturing global alliances \u2014 but making a point! Carly Fiorina said: \u201cWhat I would do, immediately, is begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet, I would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in Poland, I would conduct regular, aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States. I\u2019d probably send a few thousand more troops into Germany. Vladimir Putin would get the message.\u201dWe get the message, and it\u2019s scary.Jeb Bush spun a particularly repellent fantasy. Speaking reverently of his brother the president, he said, \u201cHe kept us safe,\u201d and invoked the carnage of 9/11. Wait, what? Did he mean George W. Bush, who was warned about the threat that Al Qaeda would attack? Who then invaded a non sequitur country, Iraq, over a nonexistent threat?When the A-Team got around to science and health, many of them promised to help Americans by killing the program that gives millions of them medical insurance. One candidate said he felt sure that vaccines had caused an autism \u201cepidemic.\u201d The two doctors on the dais did not seriously challenge that persistent, dangerous myth.Let loose by the CNN moderators, the candidates spun their visions freely. Despite an abundance of serious issues to talk about, nobody offered solutions to problems like child poverty, police and gun violence, racial segregation, educational gaps, competition in a global economy and crumbling infrastructure. On looming disasters (the changing climate) and more immediate ones (a possible government shutdown over, of all things, Planned Parenthood), the debate offered no reassurance that grown-ups were at the table, or even in the neighborhood.But we did hear an idea to put Mother Teresa \u2014 Mother Teresa, a penniless nun \u2014 on our money. Think about that.\u201cWe were discussing disease, we were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words. It will just pass on,\u201d one candidate said, wrapping up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say politicians, all talk, no action. But a lot of what we talked about is words and it will be forgotten very quickly.\u201dWhich was the smartest thing Donald Trump has said all year, and an outcome America should dearly hope for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Ryman Prepares His New Exhibition at Paul Kasmin Gallery", "Date": "2015-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recent visit to Will Ryman\u2019s cavernous two-story sculpture studio on Bowery, upstairs from a restaurant supply store, delivered a jolt of drama from the first encounter, when the artist opened the door to a back room.Inside, a life-size tableau recreated the well-publicized 2011 photograph of President Obama and his inner circle of advisers watching from the White House as the covert Navy SEAL operation to kill Osama Bin Laden unfolded on Pakistani soil in real time. The grouping of 14 cast-resin figures were blanketed in black coal dust, making the ominous scene feel timeless and yet instantly recognizable, with the defining detail of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hand concealing her mouth as the action plays out.\u201cWhen I saw that photo, I felt a little manipulated,\u201d said Mr. Ryman. \u201cI knew I wanted to explore this because I was seeing propaganda right in front of me.\u201dMr. Ryman said he had drained \u201cthe nationalism and romance and Shakespearean feel\u201d from what he felt was a strategically released photograph, leaving just the shapes and postures. \u201cThis piece is really about the situation itself, how it\u2019s repeated itself throughout history and is going to continue to repeat itself,\u201d he said.The conflation of theater and visual arts, heightened in choreographed gallery settings, is a hallmark of installations by the 45-year-old artist, who is a son of Robert Ryman, famous in the annals of modernism for his all-white paintings, and Merrill Wagner, a conceptual painter. The younger Ryman initially steered clear of the family business and spent 12 years in the theater writing absurdist plays modeled on those of Samuel Beckett and Eugene Ionesco.\u201cI didn\u2019t think I belonged in the art world because my language and way of seeing things wasn\u2019t what they were doing,\u201d said Mr. Ryman, who retains a puppy-dog boyishness. \u201cI also saw how hard it was on my mother, people using her to get to him.\u201dIn his early 30s, Mr. Ryman returned home, in every way. Visiting his room at his parents\u2019 house in Greenwich Village, he found small monsters he had made as a child from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and was inspired to try sculpting in the basement. He manipulated wire mesh into crude faces and built bodies with PVC pipe that he covered with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and concrete, then painted. These waist-high, alien-looking creatures with big mournful eyes spilled out of him with an ease he had never found in writing. \u201cI ended up making a hundred of them in his basement,\u201d said Mr. Ryman, who acknowledged good-naturedly the loaded psychological dimensions. His parents, he added, \u201cwere surprised.\u201dMr. Ryman moved into the building on Bowery in 2002 (he lives on the top floor) and gave himself a year to focus solely on artmaking. In early 2004, he invited people in to see his figures, some so tall they grazed the ceiling. In the middle of the main studio space, a large minimalist white cube had no door, but stairs crept up along one wall of the cube to a viewing balcony. Inside, viewers discovered 100 creatures with outstretched arms and wailing mouths, creating a startling picture of helplessness and suffering.\u201cWill is haunted by realism,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to wrestle storytelling. He\u2019s trying to make theater sets that don\u2019t need actors. We can be art shrinks and say, well with Ryman as a father and a minimalist conceptual painter mother, maybe he has a reason to move toward images that carry a narrative.\u201dThose narratives have shifted over the years away from his own angst \u2014 it inspired \u201cEveryman,\u201d a 90-foot-long moribund figure cobbled together from found shoes and bottle caps that wrapped around the Kasmin gallery in 2012 \u2014 to critiques of political and economic systems. In the new exhibition, \u201cThe Classroom\u201d features 12 sculpted figures sitting at attention in rows of three. They call to mind the notion of school as assembly line. Each identical figure is cast in a different natural material such as oil, salt, copper, gold and titanium.\u201cThrough the mass production system, humans sort of become commodities, just like these materials,\u201d said Mr. Ryman. \u201cI tried to make them expressionless and lifeless, and trying to do that, I feel I did the opposite, because there\u2019s definitely emotion coming from this grouping.\u201d As the refinement of his work has increased, so has his fluency in art talk. He speaks easily about current influences \u2014 the white tableaux of George Segal, the emotional realism of Auguste Rodin, the theatrical installations of Edward Kienholz.An important turning point for the artist came on the heels of his 2011 installation along Park Avenue, \u201cThe Roses,\u201d with 38 giant cartoonish bulbs cast in industrial materials. The piece was popular. Yet Mr. Ryman felt he had failed to convey his underlying concept of roses as symbols of commercialism and elitism. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Roses\u2019 felt almost like a three-quarters-born baby,\u201d said Mr. Ryman.In a rare conversation about art initiated at the time by his father, Will expressed his heartbreak about the project. \u201cHe said, \u2018I can see what you\u2019re attempting,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Ryman recalled his father telling him. \u201cI\u2019m interested in solving the problems of painting. What you\u2019re doing, I see now, is you\u2019re interested in problems in culture.\u2019 I remember thinking, \u2018Huh. He was right.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAfter that conversation with his father, something became clearer to him \u201con a conscious level,\u201d said Mr. Ryman. In his work, he tried to reduce \u201cproblems in culture\u201d to very elemental parts. Mr. Ryman soon began work on both \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u201d \u2014 a recreation of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s childhood log cabin in gold leaf that was shown at Kasmin in 2013. He lined the walls and floor of the cabin with materials that had contributed to the development of America\u2019s economy \u2014 including arrowheads, slavery shackles, bullets, pills, tobacco, iPhones, arranged in dazzling grids. \u201cI wanted it almost to look like hieroglyphics,\u201d said Mr. Ryman. It was the first time he had pulled off \u201cexactly what I wanted to do,\u201d he said.Musing on the relationship between works by father and son, she added, \u201cOf course their practices are very different, but if you were to compare \u2018America\u2019 to one of Robert Ryman\u2019s white paintings, they are both about allowing the materials to speak for themselves.\u201dMr. Ryman, who has long resisted the inevitable comparisons, told this writer in 2004 that his work was about storytelling whereas his father\u2019s was about ideas and materials. Reminded of the dichotomy he had drawn at the time, he looked startled then apologetic. He is now father to a son, 2-year-old Aiden, who splits his time between the artist and his son\u2019s mother.\u201cIdeas and materials \u2014 that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up a little bit.\u201dBrowse museum & gallery listings for the fall season and beyond.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sense of Instability Settles Over Turkey as Conflict With Kurds Flares", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Nationalist and pro-government throngs filled the streets of Istanbul and Ankara for two nights last week, chanting \u201cGod is great\u201d as they stormed a prominent newspaper and set fire to the offices of a Kurdish political party.The upheaval in major cities has prompted Turks, especially Kurds, to share pictures on social media comparing their own cities to ravaged areas in Syria.\u201cWe\u2019re on the brink of civil war, we have no stable government, the economy is a mess and there are no jobs,\u201d he added.In a cafe in the central Besiktas district of Istanbul, tears trickled down Tuba Kent\u2019s face as she watched televised images of family members clinging to the coffins of soldiers killed in the Sept. 6 bomb attack by Kurdish rebels.\u201cFor now, people in Istanbul are throwing rocks, beating their enemies with sticks and setting buildings on fire,\u201d said Ms. Kent, 36, a manicurist. \u201cBut we are one step away from holding our own funerals.\u201d\u201cAfter hearing about the incident, a lot of friends canceled their entire trip to Turkey,\u201d said Gemma Haighton, a visitor from London waiting outside the palace. \u201cWe were originally a group of 13, but only three of us ended up coming.\u201dThe instability has been costly for Turkey\u2019s tourism industry, with revenue sliding by almost 14 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to government figures.The mounting security concerns come after the collapse in July of the two-year cease-fire between rebels of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party and the Turkish state. Adding to that are increased threats and attacks from the Revolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Party-Front and the Islamic State, the Sunni militant group believed to be responsible for a suicide bombing that killed more than 30 young Kurdish activists in the southern city of Suruc in July.Critics of Mr. Erdogan say the instability may well play to his advantage, however, and allow him to persuade the public to again vote for single-party government. In fact, he is campaigning on it: According to the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah, the party\u2019s slogan for the election will be \u201cVote A.K.P. for stability.\u201dThe party\u2019s loss after more than a decade in power came as the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party gained representation in Parliament, a first for any Kurdish party. Since Mr. Erdogan called for an early election last month, at least 180 buildings belonging to the Kurdish party have been attacked by mobs that have accused the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party of being collaborators with the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party.The escalation in violence has left many wondering whether a credible election can be held in the southeast.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming impossible to hold an election given the security situation in the region,\u201d Selahattin Demirtas, the co-chairman of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, said last week at a news conference in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.Fearing worse violence, some Istanbul residents have started to vary their routines, avoiding crowded places and public transportation at peak times.\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been dragged into the greater regional war, and under such circumstances a large-scale attack on Istanbul is imminent,\u201d said Menekse Tekbas, 48, an accountant who was riding the subway recently.\u201cThis is all I think about when I\u2019m in a crowded spot like this,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m always looking out for suspicious people and packages.\u201dIn the Sultanhamet district, Istanbul\u2019s old city and home to some of its most breathtaking landmarks, many tour operators and businesses complain of a \u201ctourism drought.\u201d\u201cWith every bomb that goes off in the southeast comes an email or a phone call from a client asking for a refund,\u201d said Yusuf Karaca, 52, the owner of Karaca Tur, a tour operator.On a recent day, a friend stormed into his office, lamenting the funeral of fallen soldiers he had just seen on television.\u201cDamn those terrorists, and damn the man who dragged this country into war for his own political agenda,\u201d said the man, Ahmet, who provided only his first name out of fear that he would be punished for insulting the president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low-Income Workers See Biggest Drop in Paychecks", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite steady gains in hiring, a falling unemployment rate and other signs of an improving economy, take-home pay for many American workers has effectively fallen since the economic recovery began in 2009, according to a new study by an advocacy group that is to be released on Thursday.The declines were greatest for the lowest-paid workers in sectors where hiring has been strong \u2014 home health care, food preparation and retailing \u2014 even though wages were already below average to begin with in those service industries.Jasmin Almodovar, a home health care aide in Cleveland, knows all about that.She has worked for the same health care agency since 2003, and for the first four years she received an annual wage increase of 25 cents an hour. But since 2007, her hourly pay has been stuck at $9.50 an hour.\u201cI\u2019ve asked for raises several times and each time I get the runaround,\u201d said Ms. Almodovar, who is licensed by Ohio as a nurse\u2019s assistant. Bills for natural gas, electricity, food and other necessities have gone up since her last raise, she noted, leaving little extra money for her and her 12-year-old son.In many ways, Ms. Almodovar\u2019s predicament encapsulates the contradictions evident each month when the government reports the latest figures on hiring and unemployment.And the report by NELP, a left-leaning research and advocacy group, underscores why so many Americans are still angry about the state of the economy and with what they see as the inability of Democratic and Republican leaders alike in Washington to do anything to improve living standards for many ordinary workers.Labor Department data released on Wednesday indicated that productivity in the American economy in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, the biggest quarterly gain since late 2013 and much better than first estimated.The Labor Department\u2019s next batch of data on hiring and unemployment, for the month of August, is due out on Friday. Economists are looking for a gain of roughly 220,000 jobs, and for the unemployment rate to dip slightly to 5.2 percent.Friday\u2019s jobs report is especially significant because it is the last one before Federal Reserve policy makers meet in mid-September to decide whether to go ahead with or delay their long-telegraphed move to raise short-term interest rates from near zero.The fall in the unemployment rate from a postrecession high of 10 percent is certainly good news, Ms. Tung said, but NELP\u2019s analysis showed that once inflation was taken into account, median wages across all occupations fell by 4 percent between 2009 and 2014.Wage declines in the lowest-paid occupations were much worse, dropping 8.9 percent for restaurant cooks and 6.2 percent for home health aides.Along with stagnant or falling wages, one of the most persistent complaints about the current economic expansion is that many of the jobs created so far have been low-paying ones. That has changed recently, with more hiring in better-paying fields like business and professional services.NELP\u2019s findings come at a time when income inequality and the failure of many workers to gain ground during the recovery are coming to the political fore. Candidates from both parties have sought to address the worries of middle-income Americans, while trying not to be too closely identified with Wall Street and other symbols of corporate America.The past year has been the best for the job market since the end of the recession. Employers have added, on average, 243,000 people to their payrolls each month. That would normally constitute a \u201chot\u201d job market, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.\u201cWhen you see all those jobs being added per month, you think, \u2018Come on, how can this be bad?,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cBut there has been a lot of pain and suffering, and people have been losing their skills or have not been able to re-skill.\u201dThe roots of wage stagnation are deep, according to Mr. Slok.Some of it is linked to what he calls the \u201cglacial changes\u201d wrought by macroeconomic forces like automation, demographics and globalization.Other factors are specific to the American economy, including the real estate boom and bust, consumer debt levels and continuing slack in the labor market because of relatively low demand compared with the still-large numbers of people who are looking for work or would return to the labor force if they had a better chance of finding a worthwhile job.For Ms. Almodovar, 36, acquiring new credentials and skills is a big obstacle.When she talked with her employer\u2019s human resources department about how to increase her long-frozen salary, their advice was to go back to school. Although Ms. Almodovar took the G.E.D. test and earned the equivalent of a high school diploma in her late 20s, taking classes would be a tough proposition now.\u201cI\u2019m living with roommates, and if I don\u2019t go to work, I don\u2019t get paid,\u201d she said. \u201cEven one day makes a big difference.\u201dMany other workers in some low-paid sectors are worse off than they were a couple of decades ago.While attending high school in the mid-1990s, Derrell Odom worked at KFC, earning $5.50 an hour. That\u2019s the equivalent of $8.61 today.After two years of college, two military tours in Iraq and other jobs, he is back working as a cook at an Atlanta location of the fried chicken chain. Two decades after his first stint at KFC, his hourly pay now is only $7.25 an hour.That is barely enough to support himself, let alone his fianc\u00e9e and two sons. \u201cI have leadership skills and led missions in Iraq,\u201d Mr. Odom said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m trying to survive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Law Degree Is No Job Guarantee", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Mr. Harper claims that law schools have not been cutting enrollment sufficiently to reflect the shrinking market for legal jobs. However, as he concedes, approximately 14,000 fewer students began law school in 2014 than in 2010. The 2015 class is likely to be smaller still.Not all of these students will graduate and pass the bar, but those who do will face much less competition for legal jobs even if the legal economy fails to improve. Moreover, there are some desirable jobs that law school graduates perform that do not require a law degree. In addition, collective action to limit enrollment further would likely run afoul of federal antitrust laws.Second, capping graduate school loans will not lead to less demand for law school or other graduate programs. Rather, students will turn to the private loan market, and private lenders will be only too happy to lend because graduate school loans \u2014 and particularly those allocated to law students and medical students \u2014 have historically been very profitable. The likely result would be that profits that are currently flowing to the Treasury to subsidize other programs will instead go to private lenders.The American Bar Association\u2019s approach of disseminating information about employment outcomes and requiring certain bar passage rates is likely to be a far more effective constraint on law school enrollment than student loan reform.MILAN MARKOVICFort WorthThe writer is an associate professor at Texas A&M University School of Law.To the Editor:Steven J. Harper addresses an issue that, to his credit, deserves our attention. A root cause of the gap between the supply of lawyers and the demand is the sheer quantity of non-reputable and for-profit law schools and the industrial speed with which they accept and award degrees to their students.Lumping graduates of nonprofit accredited schools with those from unaccredited institutions in the metrics is misleading.The future outlook of even a top-50 law school graduate may not be as rosy as it was two decades ago, but it is certainly not as bleak as portrayed in this article. For graduates of institutions of lesser repute, however, this article speaks the truth. That distinction should not be omitted.JEFFREY L. VOLPINTESTAStamford, Conn.The writer is a law school student.To the Editor:Steven J. Harper unfairly assesses the number of American law students based on employment statistics rather than on the more salient fact that so many Americans cannot afford legal services. No one would say we had an oversupply of medical students if millions of Americans resorted to self-medication and treatment because they could not pay for a doctor. More of our citizens are representing themselves in court on important matters, like divorce, than at any time in recent memory.Law schools throughout the country are responding with incubator programs aimed at helping law graduates open small law practices to serve clients of modest means. And studies show that a law degree remains a sound investment even if graduates take more time to find a first job or if that first job does not require passing the bar.Perhaps instead of painting with a broad accusatory brush, Mr. Harper should offer his own solutions for expanding legal services to all. That\u2019s the valuable mission of the many law schools he castigates so cavalierly.JEREMY PAULBostonThe writer is dean and a professor at Northeastern University School of Law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Volkswagen Scandal, Europe\u2019s Diesel Habit Could Be Hard to Kick", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A loyal Volkswagen owner for years, Jane Kelley was \u201cshocked,\u201d she says, by recent revelations that the German company had cheated on emissions tests in the United States.Snug in Ms. Kelley\u2019s garage in North London recently was a white 2013 Passat powered by a 2-liter diesel engine. The company says that as many as 11 million of its cars \u2014 Volkswagens, Audis, Skodas and SEATs with diesel engines \u2014 were equipped with software designed to fool emissions testers.But as disturbed as she was to learn that Volkswagen had cheated, Ms. Kelley does not necessarily want anything done about it. \u201cAre they going to take my car away and fiddle with the engine?\u201d she said with a worried tone, as she served tea in her sunlit dining room.As with at least some European diesel drivers, Ms. Kelley is in no hurry to abandon the car just because it may spew more noxious fumes than she originally thought. \u201cI do feel that it is a very safe car,\u201d she said. She also admires the acceleration of the turbocharged diesel, which she credits with helping her recently escape a potential hazard. \u201cThere was a guy weaving, maybe drunk, so I just shot by,\u201d she recalled.Ms. Kelley is one of millions of fans of diesel cars across Europe, where fuel prices and taxes make the cost of filling an automobile\u2019s tank much higher than in the United States. Drawn by diesels\u2019 superior fuel economy over gasoline engines and the lower price of diesel fuel, European consumers have long leaned toward diesel cars \u2014 a collective habit that might be difficult to break, despite the new scrutiny the Volkswagen scandal has given to diesel\u2019s dark side.While diesels have struggled in the United States to overcome a reputation as smoke-belching clunkers \u2014 they represent about 3 percent of the American car market \u2014 they have rolled to dominance across the Atlantic. Diesels accounted for more than half the new cars sold in Western Europe last year, compared with 14 percent in 1990.Europeans\u2019 embrace of diesels has encouraged manufacturers to improve the engines\u2019 performance, and it has motivated governments, especially those of Germany and France, to support their auto industries\u2019 diesel efforts. Although environmentalists have been sounding alarms for years, the forces propelling diesel were so strong that it might explain why drivers, carmakers and regulators have been willing at times to overlook diesels\u2019 tendency to be bigger polluters than gasoline cars.\u201cBan diesels? You can\u2019t be serious,\u201d S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the French environment and energy minister, said recently, responding to a suggestion by a member of the Green Party. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat problems of this gravity with ideological slogans at the expense of French interests,\u201d Ms. Royal said, noting that more than half the cars on French roads were diesels.In fact, the percentage in France is around 64 percent, even higher than in Germany, with French-made Renault, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn diesels joining Volkswagens on the road. There has been no indication that the French automakers cheated on emissions tests.So far, Volkswagen has not said how it plans to deal with the deceptive software problem, although the German government has set an Oct. 7 deadline for the company to propose a solution. Unlike in the United States, where lawyers are already recruiting car owners in hopes of filing class-action lawsuits, there is no similar tradition in Europe that would encourage consumers to collectively demand financial redress.Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would prepare a plan by early October to improve the emissions of affected vehicles. Owners will be notified in the weeks and months after the plan has been approved by authorities, the company said.\u201cIf there is a recall, I would be happy if my car is not included in it,\u201d said Tony Novak, a retired editor for the BBC who lives in Reading, England. In Britain, just over half of new cars sold are diesels.\u201cDiesels used to be terrible \u2014 they used to be dirty and slow,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are brilliant.\u201d Mr. Novak had owned diesel cars previously, but when he bought his 2014 Volkswagen Golf diesel, \u201cI was really surprised by how good it was \u2014 you really notice the difference in acceleration.\u201dThat Volkswagen might have achieved that performance by cheating \u2014 it is still not clear whether the company needed the deceptive software to pass Europe\u2019s emissions tests, which are much less strict than the United States\u2019 \u2014 is not what matters most to Mr. Novak. \u201cI worry that if they tweak the computer, the performance will deteriorate,\u201d he said.About five million of the affected cars are Golfs, Passats and other Volkswagen-brand cars. An additional two million are Audi brand cars, and the rest or Skoda and SEAT brand cars, or light commercial vehicles.Matthias M\u00fcller, a company insider who was appointed chief executive of Volkswagen last week, told top managers late Monday that the deceptive software was activated in only a portion of the 11 million vehicles that have the so-called EA 189 diesel motors. But Volkswagen did not specify how many cars were designed to cheat on emissions tests.Some industry experts say that the Volkswagen scandal could prove a turning point in the diesel love affair, if the new scrutiny of European emissions standards and testing makes it easier for the environmentalists to be heard.The premise of the \u201cclean diesel\u201d notion that Volkswagen promoted was partly based on the fact that on a per-mile basis, diesel engines emit less carbon dioxide \u2014 a big contributor to climate change \u2014 than gasoline engines. But diesel exhausts, unless cleaned in ways that Volkswagen\u2019s software was designed to sidestep, produce larger quantities of other harmful gases \u2014 nitrogen oxides \u2014 along with fine particles that contribute to stubbornly persistent air quality problems in European cities.\u201cThere is a recognition that, fundamentally, it is going to be difficult to control all of the problems with diesel \u2014 smoke production is not going to go away,\u201d said Peter Wells, co-director of the center for automotive industry research at Cardiff Business School. \u201cIn the very long term, diesel has had its day.\u201dAccording to the European Environment Agency, which monitors air quality, 20 to 30 percent of urban residents in Europe are exposed to particle levels \u2014 mainly from diesel exhaust fumes \u2014 above those considered safe by the European Union, while about 10 percent are exposed to unsafe levels of nitrogen oxides.London and Paris have among the highest pollution levels in terms of nitrogen oxides. In March of this year and last, the smog in Paris reached such levels that the authorities were forced to temporarily limit the number of cars on the road each day.Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, which is playing host to the United Nations climate conference in November, is among those who have suggested an eventual ban on diesels in the city.The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, plans to establish an ultralow emissions zone in London by 2020 where older diesels will be penalized. A recent report by the environmental committee of the London Assembly, the city\u2019s legislature, said the mayor should consider banning all diesels from the zone.But environmental efforts must contend with deeply rooted diesel economics. Automotive fuel in Europe costs several times as much as in the United States, mainly because of higher taxes. The average price of gasoline in London in August, for example, was 521 pence, or about $7.92, per gallon. In most of Continental Europe, diesel sells for about 15 percent less than gasoline.Part of that difference is because the taxes that help keep fuel prices high are typically lower on diesel fuel.In Germany, the lower taxes on diesel fuel amount to an annual subsidy of 7 billion euros, or about $7.8 billion, for diesel owners, said Daniel Moser, a transportation analyst for the environmental group Greenpeace.\u201cThese policies are not in accordance with what we would have to do to protect the environment and people\u2019s health,\u201d he said.And then there are vehicle tax breaks that various governments offer to diesel owners, because of the cars\u2019 lower emissions of carbon dioxide.Also, new diesels are often only slightly more expensive than their gasoline counterparts. In Britain, a Volkswagen Golf Match with a 1.4-liter, turbocharged gasoline engine sells for \u00a320,955, or about $31,800, while a similar model with a 1.6-liter diesel engine sells for \u00a321,960, according to Carbuyer, a British website.With all those factors taken into account, owning and operating a diesel car in Europe is the more affordable way to go.In the United States, with much lower gasoline prices, \u201cthere is no point at the margin, buying a diesel,\u201d said Garel Rhys, a professor emeritus at Cardiff University. He said Europeans\u2019 embrace of diesels made perfect sense. \u201cEssentially, growth came because consumers are economically rational individuals,\u201d Professor Rhys said.But a continued yen for diesels may not necessarily translate into an abiding love of Volkswagen, for some Europeans at least.Jon Devereux, who drives a diesel-engine Volkswagen Touareg, manages a hotel in Milford on Sea, in southern England. Each winter, he takes the four-wheel-drive vehicle to his winter home in the French Alps. The Touareg, he said, has \u201cbeen brilliant for 10 years.\u201dBut when it comes time to replace it, his next diesel will not be a Volkswagen. The emissions scandal has soured Mr. Devereux on the carmaker. \u201cWould you buy a VW car or any car in the VW group?\u2019\u2019 he asked.David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Was to Be the Year of Bigger Wage Gains. It\u2019s Not.", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesAdd those together, and it would seem to point to 2015 as the year American workers start seeing substantially larger paychecks. The only problem: There is no real evidence in the economic data that this is happening.Rather, a wide range of economic measures points to the same sluggish pay rises in 2015 that American workers witnessed in 2011 and every year since. The giant question hanging over the United States economy \u2014 for workers hoping to see a raise, employers trying to decide whether to give them one, and the Federal Reserve as it decides when and how much to raise interest rates \u2014 is whether that is poised to change soon.Average hourly earnings for all private-sector workers were up 2.2 percent in August from a year earlier, according to new data released Friday, roughly the same level at which wage growth has been for years. There has been no evidence of acceleration in pay as the year has progressed; in the last three months hourly pay rose at a 2.2 annual rate, below its level earlier in the year. Other data points to the same conclusion. Employment compensation costs \u2014 which includes both wages and the employer\u2019s cost of health care and other benefits \u2014 rose 2 percent in the year ended in June, in line with recent years.Low inflation over the last year, fueled by a late-2014 drop in oil prices, means that real wage growth after accounting for inflation is more solid than it has been in recent years, but that is set to change as the impact of cheaper oil fades from inflation data.The roughly 2 percent annual rise in wages is considerably lower than what has historically been evident when the jobless rate is in its current range (it was 5.1 percent in August). Using data since 1965, the unemployment rate over the last year would predict an annual wage increase for nonmanagerial workers of about 2.5 percent; it has actually been only 1.85 percent.The explanation for the disconnect that best fits the data is also the simplest one. More so than in the past, the United States labor force seems to have large numbers of so-called shadow workers. These people are lurking on the sidelines of the job market but not accounted for in the unemployment rate because they are not actively looking for work.Add in some Americans over age 55 who retired earlier than they would have preferred during the last downturn but who could be coaxed back to work, and you quickly arrive at millions of Americans able and willing to work as employers have gone looking.There has been lots of debate in recent years over whether the people who left the labor force during the recession are gone for good or will return to work amid an improving economy. The answer seems to be that they are coming back to work, just more slowly than one might hope, given that the recession ended more than six years ago.\u201cIf we continue to get good job reports where we\u2019re adding over a couple hundred thousand jobs a month, eventually we\u2019ll see the pace of wage growth accelerate,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cI think that connection remains a viable one. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet because there\u2019s a lot more slack in the job market than the topline numbers suggest.\u201dYou could even imagine a story where the complaints of businesses that it is hard to find good workers, and the voluntary increases of entry-level wages, fit with this story of a large shadow work force that is glacially coming back into the market.When there is a large pool of people who fit the official definition of unemployed \u2014 people actively looking for work \u2014 finding them is relatively easy. It can be a simple matter of picking the most promising applicants and paying a competitive wage.But when the pool of potential workers is heavily tilted toward people who are not actively seeking work, as appears to be the case today, it may be that employers have to work harder to find them. Perhaps employers are paying more for the lowest-paid, entry-level staff, even as they are keeping the lid on pay increases for those at middle levels and are ultimately finding the staff they need after more difficulty than usual.A hiring manager had an easy job between 2009 and a year or two ago, with hordes of unemployed Americans beating down the door in search of work. It\u2019s getting harder to attract and keep good staff, and some companies may be having trouble with the adjustment, said Paul McDonald, a senior executive director at the staffing firm Robert Half International.\u201cIf I\u2019m an employer, I\u2019m asking, \u2018When was the last time I gave my employees, especially my high performers, a bump in compensation?\u2019 \u201d Mr. McDonald said. \u201cI\u2019m asking myself, \u2018What am I doing to retain my workers?\u2019 That\u2019s a wake-up call for some clients.\u201dIn other words, right now companies may be having to work harder to find staff given a low unemployment rate. As more of the shadow work force finds its way back into jobs, employers will most likely have to back their efforts with cold, hard cash, and when that happens higher wage gains should follow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Credo: Never Let Them See You Sweat", "Date": "2015-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLONG ago, at the inception of his rise to power, Vladimir V. Putin recounted a memory of growing up in the late 1950s in a Soviet communal apartment in Leningrad, as St. Petersburg was then known. For kicks, he and his friends would chase rats in the building\u2019s dismal hallways. It was what passed for a game until the time a cornered rat hurled himself at a surprised and frightened young Vladimir, who turned and ran away.The anecdote, vivid as a nightmare, was meant to highlight the hardscrabble roots of Russia\u2019s future president, but in the years since, self-effacing recollections like these have all but disappeared from Mr. Putin\u2019s official biography.Instead, Russians have ingested a regular diet of televised acts of leadership and machismo, from hectoring bureaucrats and oligarchs to excelling at sports, including his latest form of kicks, ice hockey, which he took up with remarkable determination when he was turning 60. It has made him a caricature of the man of action, of the benevolent but remote leader, of the steely patriot delivered by providence to restore Russia to its rightful destiny after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Yet the rat story, and its vanishing, echo a recurring theme in episodes through Mr. Putin\u2019s childhood and his formative years as a minor officer in the K.G.B., during his unexpected ascent to the presidency in the 1990s and his steady consolidation of power since 2000: namely, his insecurity and fear of displaying weakness.Although he liked to portray himself as a young tough raised in Leningrad, he took up martial arts as a slight boy, by his own account, to protect himself from courtyard bullies.His most searing experience in the K.G.B. came in East Germany in 1989 when the sclerotic Soviet state proved, in his mind at least, irresolute in the face of the protests that brought down the Berlin Wall and ultimately the Iron Curtain. When a crowd of protesters reached the K.G.B.\u2019s villa in Dresden, where he was stationed, he confronted them alone and unarmed and, without any orders from Moscow, warned that those inside would open fire. In his recollections the \u201cmob\u201d was terrifying, though it amounted to only a few dozen people.In the wild 1990s, when a convulsion of violence and crime accompanied the advent of capitalism in the newly renamed St. Petersburg, he once sent his daughters out of the country for their safety. During the re-election campaign for his boss in St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, he took to carrying an air pistol \u2014 \u201cIt won\u2019t save me,\u201d he told a friend, \u201cbut it makes me feel calmer.\u201d\u201cWe demonstrated weakness,\u201d Mr. Putin said in another context, \u201cand the weak are beaten.\u201d That was in 2004, following the terrorist siege of a school in the southern Russian town of Beslan, which ended after two and a half days with the deaths of 334 hostages, 186 of them schoolchildren. To him, the attack \u2014 which he insinuated, without evidence, had been orchestrated by Russia\u2019s enemies abroad, not the Chechen terrorists who actually carried it out \u2014 and its aftermath signified neither resilience nor resolve but utter vulnerability.He exploited the horror of the attack to tighten his control of the political system.The fear of displaying weakness has become a shrewd pillar of Mr. Putin\u2019s political identity. And to the dismay of the country\u2019s democrats and world leaders with whom he interacts, it has made him extraordinarily popular and powerful, even though in moments of candor and, of course, in private, officials in Russia acknowledge the overwhelming problems the country faces.On Monday, Mr. Putin will swagger through New York, delivering a speech at the United Nations for the first time in a decade, meeting with an evidently reluctant President Obama and seeking to regain the spot on the world stage he believes he has been unjustly denied by his rivals in the West. In Russia\u2019s sycophantic official media, this is another triumph, of course, but even The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial writers could not resist the schoolyard bravado, saying the Russian leader was \u201cstealing Mr. Obama\u2019s lunch money.\u201dAndrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center recently noted that \u201crising from one\u2019s knees\u201d was a \u201cdistinctively Russian metaphor\u201d for restoring dignity and national pride. And on their knees is where many Russians believe they spent the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 until Mr. Putin single-handedly wrenched them back to their feet.What Mr. Putin has succeeded in doing is persuading Russians that the hardships they now face \u2014 many of them a result of his own decisions \u2014 are evidence of efforts by Russia\u2019s enemies to keep the nation weak.He concluded, as many have, that Mr. Putin\u2019s tactics have been strong \u2014 often compared to his training in judo \u2014 but that he lacked a strategy. A year and a half after the occupation and annexation of Crimea, Mr. Putin has never been as isolated politically and diplomatically. He has few foreign allies and faces a withering economy at home, battered by the low price of oil and economic sanctions imposed in retaliation for the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in the war in eastern Ukraine.And yet as he has always done, he has responded to weakness by daringly ignoring it, even defying it. Throughout his 15 years at the center of Russian politics it has worked.Steven Lee Myers is a Washington correspondent for The New York Times and the author of \u201cThe New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Things I Learned About Donald Trump in \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016When I wrote about \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d for this weekend\u2019s Times issue of Sunday Business, I couldn\u2019t fit all the best nuggets from the book into a single article. So, here are some bonus takeaways from Donald Trump\u2019s 1987 best-seller, the book he calls the second best in the world after the Bible.A prominent businessman who does a lot of business with the Soviet Union calls to keep me posted on a construction project I\u2019m interested in undertaking in Moscow. The idea got off the ground after I sat next to the Soviet ambassador, Yuri Dubinin, at a luncheon... One thing led to another and now I\u2019m talking about building a large luxury hotel, across the street from the Kremlin, in partnership with the Soviet government.At the end of the book, Trump wrote that he did in fact travel to Moscow in 1987: \u201cWe toured half a dozen potential sites for a hotel, including several near Red Square. We stayed in Lenin\u2019s suite at the National Hotel, and I was impressed with the ambition of the Soviet officials to make a deal.\u201dAlas, this deal does not seem to have come to fruition, perhaps because the late 1980s were a less-than-stable time in Moscow\u2019s real estate market.\u201cMy policy was to have all the brass in the atrium polished twice a month,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cWhy, this fellow asked, couldn\u2019t we save some money by polishing once every couple of months?\u201dInstead of cutting back the brass-polishing schedule, Mr. Trump bought out Equitable\u2019s interest in the building.As for his own penthouse apartment in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump said his then-under-construction residence would be \u201cabout as close as you\u2019re going to get, in the twentieth century, to the quality of Versailles,\u201d including 27 hand-carved Italian marble columns in the living room. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he wrote of the columns.But he understands you don\u2019t always have to be over the top. \u201cSometimes \u2014 not often, but sometimes \u2014 less is more,\u201d he wrote, explaining why he went with the simple option of \u201ca huge and magnificent gold wreath\u201d to decorate Trump Tower\u2019s entrance at Christmas. It seems he eventually changed his mind about less ever being more: By Christmas 2011, the gold wreath had been joined by huge gold stars festooning the building\u2019s facade on Fifth Avenue.In the face of a sales drop, most companies cut back on their advertising budgets. But in fact, you need advertising most when people aren\u2019t buying.I wrote a letter to Harry Usher, our new commissioner, suggesting that the cost of Flutie\u2019s contract be shared among all USFL owners \u2014 on the grounds that Flutie\u2019s promotional value was leaguewide. I knew it was highly unlikely that the other owners would go along \u2014 and they didn\u2019t \u2014 but my attitude is that you can\u2019t get hurt asking.His micromanagement of his team\u2019s coach stands somewhat in contrast to his admonition early in the book that \u201cyou\u2019re generally better off sticking with what you know.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Will, because he\u2019s not afraid to challenge fashion,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cMy only regret was that George Will didn\u2019t have a seat on the City Planning Commission.\u201dThe stories that appeared about it invariably started with sentences like \u201cIn order to make way for one of the world\u2019s most luxurious buildings...\u201d Even though the publicity was almost entirely negative, there was a great deal of it, and that drew a tremendous amount of attention to Trump Tower...I learned a lot from that experience: good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.What the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn\u2019t important, I said, so long as they did a lot of it.According to Mr. Trump, this display worked: \u201cThese distinguished corporate leaders looked on, some of them visibly awed. I\u2019ll never forget one of them turning to me, shaking his head, and saying, \u2018You know, it\u2019s great when you\u2019re a private guy, and you can just pull out all the stops.\u2019 \u201dOf all the lessons in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d this may be the one most directly informing Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hunting Ban Saps a Village\u2019s Livelihood", "Date": "2015-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANKUYO, Botswana \u2014 Lions have been coming out of the surrounding bush, prowling around homes and a small health clinic, to snatch goats and donkeys from the heart of this village on the edge of one of Africa\u2019s great inland deltas. Elephants, too, are becoming frequent, unwelcome visitors, gobbling up the beans, maize and watermelons that took farmers months to grow.Since Botswana banned trophy hunting two years ago, remote communities like Sankuyo have been at the mercy of growing numbers of wild animals that are hurting livelihoods and driving terrified villagers into their homes at dusk.The hunting ban has also meant a precipitous drop in income. Over the years, villagers had used money from trophy hunters, mostly Americans, to install toilets and water pipes, build houses for the poorest, and give scholarships to the young and pensions to the old.But in Sankuyo and other rural communities living near the wild animals, many are calling for a return to hunting. African governments have also condemned, some with increasing anger, Western moves to ban trophy hunting.\u201cBefore, when there was hunting, we wanted to protect those animals because we knew we earned something out of them,\u201d said Jimmy Baitsholedi Ntema, a villager in his 60s. \u201cNow we don\u2019t benefit at all from the animals. The elephants and buffaloes leave after destroying our plowing fields during the day. Then, at night, the lions come into our kraals.\u201dIn early 2014, this sparsely populated nation became one of a few African countries with abundant wildlife to put an end to trophy hunting, the practice at the core of conservation efforts in southern Africa. President Seretse Khama Ian Khama of Botswana, a staunch defender of animal rights, stated that hunting was no longer compatible with wildlife conservation and urged communities like Sankuyo to switch to photographic tourism. The decision was cheered by animal welfare groups in the West.But Botswana is an outlier. Government officials and conservationists in most African countries staunchly support trophy hunting, including Zambia, which is going back to hunting after a short-lived suspension.\u201cZambia has always hunted from time immemorial,\u201d Jean Kapata, Zambia\u2019s minister of tourism, said in a phone interview. \u201cZambia is a sovereign nation, and therefore people should respect the rules we have in our country.\u201dBut that brought little income compared to hunting, Ms. Kapata said, while lions increasingly stalked villages for livestock. During the hunting ban, a local councilor was killed by a lion, she said.\u201cWe had a lot of complaints from local communities,\u201d Ms. Kapata said. \u201cIn Africa, a human being is more important than an animal. I don\u2019t know about the Western world,\u201d she added, echoing a complaint in affected parts of Africa that the West seemed more concerned with the welfare of a lion in Zimbabwe than of Africans themselves.In South Africa, the biggest market, hunting occurs on private game ranches. But in the rest of the region, it takes place mostly on communal lands where villages like Sankuyo are supposed to receive a cut of the fees paid by trophy hunters.In 2010, Sankuyo earned nearly $600,000 from the 120 animals \u2014 including 22 elephants, 55 impalas and nine buffaloes \u2014 that it was allowed to offer to trophy hunters that year, said Brian Child, an associate professor at the University of Florida, who is leading a study on the impact of the ban. Botswana\u2019s wildlife officials, who set the annual quotas, last allowed a lion to be hunted in Sankuyo in 2006.Among the benefits to the community, 20 households chosen by lottery received outdoor toilets, all painted in pastel colors that stand out in a village turned brown in the dry season. Standpipes were installed in courtyards, connecting 40 families to running water.\u201cThat\u2019s what made people appreciate conservation,\u201d said Gokgathang Timex Moalosi, 55, Sankuyo\u2019s chief. \u201cWe told them, \u2018That lion or elephant has paid for your toilet or your standpipe.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhere trophy hunting benefits communities, locals are more motivated to protect wild animals as a source of revenue, experts say. But in most places without trophy hunting, they are simply considered a nuisance or danger, and locals are more likely to hunt them for food or to kill them to defend their homes and crops.Dr. Child, an expert on wildlife management in Africa, said trophy hunting had failed to benefit many communities because of mismanagement and corruption. But in the countries where trophy hunting had worked well \u2014 Botswana, until the ban; Namibia; and Zimbabwe, until its economy collapsed in the past decade \u2014 it had accomplished the twin goals of generating income and protecting wild animals.\u201cWhen hunting was introduced, we actually ended up killing less animals,\u201d Dr. Child said. \u201cThat\u2019s the irony.\u201dWith hunting now banned, there are growing signs that more wild animals could be killed, experts say. Lions, which used to feast on the meat of elephants left behind by hunters, are increasingly entering villages looking for livestock. In the past two years here in Sankuyo, villagers have killed two lions that wandered into residential areas.\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing an exponential increase in conflicts between animals and human beings,\u201d said Israel Khura Nato, the head of the Botswana Department of Wildlife\u2019s problem animal control unit in Maun, a town two hours from here.According to the department, such conflicts recorded nationwide rose to 6,770 in 2014 from 4,361 in 2012. Poaching incidents increased to 323 in 2014 from 309 in 2012.\u201cNow they are going back to hating animals,\u201d Dr. Rutina said.Galeyo Kobamelo, 37, said he had lost all 30 goats in the kraal just outside his family compound to lions and hyenas since the hunting ban. Elephants had destroyed his fields of sorghum and maize.With the hunting ban, his family no longer receives the free meat that hunters left behind. His mother, Gomolemo Semalomba, 58, no longer receives a pension, about $100 twice a year.\u201cNow we don\u2019t eat meat anymore,\u201d she said, pointing to a table with plates of cabbage, beans and maize meal.Mr. Moalosi, Sankuyo\u2019s chief, said he hoped to bring back some of the benefits after his village made a successful transition to photographic tourism.\u201cPhotographic tourism is not that viable in those areas,\u201d said Joseph Mbaiwa, the Okavango Research Institute\u2019s acting director.In Sankuyo, William Moalosi is one of dozens of people that the hunting ban has left jobless. Many have left Sankuyo to seek work in Maun.Mr. Moalosi, 40, worked for eight years as a tracker and driver, earning about $100 a month. He used some of the money to replace his old house, made of branches and the mud from a termite mound, with a modern structure. He lost his crops of maize and watermelons to marauding elephants a few months ago.Villagers, including the chief, identified Mr. Moalosi as the man who had shot and killed a lioness last month. The animal had climbed a tree to jump down into a kraal with goats; unable to get out of the enclosure, the lioness posed a danger to the village, which gave the community the right to kill the animal.But sitting outside his house, flanked by neighbors, Mr. Moalosi denied he was the shooter. He said he knew nothing about the circumstances of the animal\u2019s death, a statement that drew knowing smiles from his neighbors.\u201cWe are living in fear since lions and leopards now come into our village,\u201d he said. \u201cElephants cross the village to go to the other side of the bush. The dogs bark at them. We just run into our houses and hide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Old World\u2019s Endangered Formula One Species", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Italian Grand PrixWill it be the end of an era this weekend at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, one of the only Formula One races to have been run every year since the series began in 1950?\u201cWe made a deal with a politician there who was in charge of it two years ago, shook hands, everybody happy, and they forgot to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe contract is still there and if they want to sign it, they can sign it.\u201dWhen asked if he could imagine the series without one of its flagship races, Ecclestone referred to two other traditional Grand Prix that had fallen off the calendar: \u201cWe don\u2019t have Germany. We don\u2019t have France.\u201dThe idea that Monza, known as \u201cThe Temple of Speed,\u201d could drop off the calendar is unimaginable to many fans, especially Ferrari\u2019s tifosi, who constitute the bulk of the spectators making the annual pilgrimage to the circuit.Many Formula One drivers also are not happy with the situation.\u201cMonza is one of the legendary tracks,\u201d said the Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg. \u201cOf course it is important to the F1 calendar, just as the German Grand Prix is important. I, of course, definitely wish that we continue to race there. In front of the tifosi also, the atmosphere is always awesome. So it\u2019s important to F1, that race.\u201dFernando Alonso, a former Ferrari driver and two-time world champion who now drives for McLaren, agreed.\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the best races of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe podium is amazing there, with all the fans on the main straight. It\u2019s the home of Ferrari \u2014 it\u2019s very important for Formula One. But, as Nico said, also the German Grand Prix is very important and it\u2019s not any more this year, so, who knows?\u201dSome of the others were for many years part of the Formula One series, including the U.S. Grand Prix, run on and off for decades but since 2012 held in Texas, and the Mexico City race, back after more than two decades.But of the original six 1950 races \u2014 the Belgian, British, French, Italian, Monaco and Swiss Grands Prix \u2014 four remain on the Formula One calendar today. (There were actually seven races that first year, but one was the Indianapolis 500, which had a different set of regulations.) The Swiss Grand Prix was dropped when the Swiss government banned circuit racing after an accident at the 1955 Le Mans 24 Hours left more than 80 spectators dead. Of the other five from 1950, only the French Grand Prix no longer runs.Meanwhile, the number of races in a season has almost tripled since that inaugural year. There are 19 races this season and 21 are scheduled next year. Moreover, races are now run on every continent except Africa and Antarctica.While some fans may mourn the loss of the race on the Magny-Cours circuit in the French countryside, some of the new venues are in or near many of the world\u2019s great cities and in countries with booming economies, like China and a couple of Persian Gulf states.Ecclestone\u2019s 2003 prediction that European businesses and economies would fall behind Asia and lose prominence has nearly become reality. And it is reflected in the Formula One experience and its new racing venues.\u201cWe\u2019ll probably lose races in Europe,\u201d he said in 2003. \u201cI suspect Europe will have a third-world economy within the next decade, anyhow. I think the European politicians have taken the wrong direction in their thought processes.\u201d\u201cMaybe we won\u2019t have to cut the races,\u201d he added. \u201cMaybe some European Grands Prix will disappear all on their own.\u201dIn 2003, he wasn\u2019t taken seriously. But the series lost the French Grand Prix in 2009 because organizers couldn\u2019t pay the reported $17.3 million fee for rights to stage it and the German Grand Prix was dropped this year because of similar financial issues. The same thing is at issue for Monza.Last year, while embroiled in the talks with the promoters in Italy, Ecclestone said: \u201cIt\u2019s useless to keep on talking. In order to have a Grand Prix, you need money. If the money is there, the race takes place.\u201dBut for many of the new sites, some of that money comes from public subsidies, which is not the case at the older races. In any case, for those with the money, Formula One now offers a race-to-race experience in a truly global environment.An example is the race just outside Shanghai, with its palatial circuit and vibrant nightlife scene, in a country with a growing economy \u2014 even if it has taken a blow recently \u2014 and rising middle class with new leisure pursuits.And the race in Abu Dhabi has brought Formula One to the Middle East and into the world\u2019s leading oil-producing region. That race has spurred interest for more races in the Persian Gulf; there is also a Bahrain Grand Prix and Qatar is hoping to host a race.The older circuit facilities in Europe have fallen behind those at the new sites, where tracks are equipped with the latest technologies.Travel, hotel and restaurant costs are often quadrupled for the European races. Hotels around tracks such as Monza in Italy, Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, Silverstone in England, and Hockenheim in Germany are booked a year in advance by travel agents.At the new venues, though, hotels are modern, cheap and easily booked, and food and other travel costs are not jacked up for the race weekends in cities like Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and Singapore.\u201cIt\u2019s the only circuit where you expect to be driving through flares,\u201d said Daniel Ricciardo, an Australian driver at the Red Bull team. \u201cWe had that on the warm-up last year: a massive cloud of red smoke at the second Lesmo. Pretty different \u2014 but I like that.\u201d\u201cThe Italian fans are passionate \u2014 some might say crazy \u2014 and you\u2019ll really get your fill of atmosphere,\u201d he added. \u201cThe drivers\u2019 parade is special. They\u2019ll all be there with their shirts off, yelling \u2018Forza Ferrari!\u201d\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan a Triumph of Showmanship Over Common Sense", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStandard DeductionA mercurial candidate needs a mercurial tax plan. Donald J. Trump\u2019s proposal to overhaul the tax code fits the bill. But it would hardly raise the revenue needed to pay the nation\u2019s invoices.Mr. Trump is following the advice of the Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman to give the people what they want, just not the way they expect it. His tax plan gives the people the huge tax cut they want, paid for by mere rhetoric.Mr. Trump revealed his tax plan on Monday with flourish and sleight of hand, exaggerating its punitive impact on the rich. In fact, the plan would greatly reduce the taxes of most business owners, bankers, lawyers and other high-income professionals.The plan would reduce just about everyone\u2019s taxes, with perhaps the singular exception of a few investment fund managers who might face a slight increase in taxes.The plan contains a seemingly random borrowing of ideas, some good and some bad, with no partisan pattern.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would exempt 75 million households from the income tax: anyone who makes less than $25,000 annually or married couples who jointly earn less than $50,000.Mr. Trump would lower the top income tax rate to 25 percent from the current top rate of 39.6 percent.Most strikingly, he would reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. And he would extend this rate to businesses that operate in partnership or sole proprietorship form. Lawyers, doctors, accountants and other professionals who often pay tax at marginal rates surpassing 40 percent under current law would see enormous tax savings.The plan would also retain the capital gains preference and repeal the estate tax.The plan relies on the magic of supply-side economics for its claim of revenue neutrality. Mr. Trump picks out a series of mostly sensible ways to help pay for a tax cut, including limitations on itemized deductions, limitations on interest deductions and closing the carried interest loophole. But the revenue raised from these base-broadening proposals would hardly cover the revenue lost from reductions in top rates.His business tax proposal is not quite as crazy at it seems. He proposes a tax rate of 15 percent on both corporate and partnership business income, far below the top rates of 35 percent and 39.6 percent under current law. But the patchwork of available deductions, exemptions, credits and deferral mechanisms results in an average effective tax rate of 25 percent, or lower, for most businesses.Mr. Trump trumpeted the punitive effect his plan would have on fund managers. But just how this low business tax rate would apply to fund managers is a little unclear. Under current law, most fund managers pay tax at the lower capital gains rate of 20 percent on their share of a fund\u2019s profits, known as carried interest. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, fund managers would pay tax at a top rate of 25 percent, a small increase.But fund managers also pay tax on some of their income, such as management fees and short-term gains, at a top rate of 39.6 percent. Because their fee income is earned through a business, that rate would be cut to 15 percent under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. Funds would quickly restructure carried interest from a partnership allocation to an incentive fee to qualify for the low 15 percent rate.Mr. Trump would help pay for the rate cuts with a one-time 10 percent tax on the deferred foreign earnings of United States multinational corporations, and he would end the ability of American businesses to defer income in the future.This approach roughly tracks the most recent budget proposal from the White House. Many Republicans in Congress, on the other hand, would prefer to shift to a territorial system, which exempts foreign income altogether. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to broaden the base and lower the rate makes more sense.Still, the plan relies on vague assertions without evidence that lower tax rates would provide a \u201ctremendous stimulus\u201d for the economy, \u201csignificant\u201d gross domestic growth and a \u201chuge\u201d number of new jobs.Mr. Trump\u2019s plan includes some sensible suggestions to broaden the tax base and reduce rates. If it included more specific loophole closers, or a progressive consumption tax or value added tax to raise revenue, it would be treated as a serious proposal and an act of leadership. Instead, it will be dismissed in tax policy circles as just another exaggerated claim of a carnival barker.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Post-Deal Iran Asks if U.S. Is Still \u2018Great Satan,\u2019 or Something Less", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 A new struggle is unfolding in Iran, where the top leaders have begun to tackle the question of how to deal with the United States after having reached a nuclear agreement with their great enemy.\u201cWe have announced that we will not negotiate with the Americans on any issue other than the nuclear case,\u201d Mr. Khamenei said this month. Speaking to a group of hard-line students recently he was even more explicit, telling them to \u201cprepare for the continuation of the fight against America.\u201dBy contrast, Mr. Rouhani said on Sunday that the nuclear agreement, reached after two years of tortuous negotiations, was \u201cnot the end of the way,\u201d but \u201ca beginning for creating an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation with various countries.\u201dHow the opposing visions are ultimately resolved may be uncertain, but as the nuclear pact is carried out and the sanctions are lifted, Iran\u2019s favorite scapegoat can no longer plausibly be regarded as the root of all evil in the world.\u201cOur Great Satan without sanctions is just not the same anymore,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist and supporter of Mr. Rouhani. \u201cPerhaps we should use \u2018lesser Satan\u2019 now or something like that.\u201dIn a highly controlled society like Iran, the leaders rarely speak spontaneously, so there is a certain premeditated \u201cgood cop, bad cop\u201d aspect to the public posturing about the United States. But the dueling perspectives also reflect the problem of fitting the new, softer image of the United States into Iran\u2019s founding ideological narrative.But other analysts say that misreads the situation, putting a na\u00efvely optimistic spin on the motivations and intentions of an all-powerful supreme leader who, while cautious and calculating, remains a highly conservative force.There are no outward indications that Mr. Khamenei is enthusiastic about rapprochement between Iran and the United States, these other analysts say. On the contrary, since August he has used every public speech to make clear that there will be no such thing, repeating last week that, deal or no deal, the United States remains the \u201cGreat Satan.\u201d\u201cThis deal is a one-off agreement in our interest,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst close to Ayatollah Khamenei. \u201cNot an attempt to mend ties with America.\u201dThere will be no such thing as direct talks over other issues, like Iraq, Syria and Yemen. At best, some analysts say, Ayatollah Khamenei is awaiting what he calls in some speeches \u201cpositive steps\u201d from the United States. He will \u201creview\u201d such actions before considering real relations.Whatever the effect on foreign relations, Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s genuine distrust of the United States is casting an increasingly dark shadow over Mr. Rouhani\u2019s ambitions at home, which are always subject to a veto by the supreme leader, who retains the final word on all matters.Right after the nuclear agreement was signed, for example, some in Tehran called for abolishing the \u201cdeath to America\u201d slogan and predicted the reopening of the United States Embassy. Neither suggestion gained traction.Now, in line with Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s recent remarks, the winds seem to be shifting. Night after night, state television features remarks by American politicians and Republican presidential candidates bashing the deal. Often, these are followed by I-told-you-so clips from Ayatollah Khamenei, saying \u201cAmerica cannot be trusted.\u201dMr. Rouhani\u2019s supporters are taking note. \u201cFirst, I predicted that direct flights between Tehran and New York would start in some weeks,\u201d said Mohammad Javad Mehreghan, a financial expert. \u201cWe were overwhelmed with joy. Now, I realize it will take years. This country won\u2019t change overnight.\u201dBut the president is persevering, promising better relations with the West, a better economy and more personal freedom. To the trained Iranian ear, when Mr. Rouhani talks about more cooperation with \u201cvarious countries,\u201d he means the United States.Despite Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s hard line in public, however, most Iranians and some well-connected analysts say that he is more on Mr. Rouhani\u2019s side than he lets on, and is merely hedging his bets in case something goes wrong. Otherwise, they say, why would he agree to a nuclear deal at all?\u201cIn the end even the supreme leader wants to have better relations with America,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the government. \u201cBut he is angry over the bad remarks coming out of the United States, so he wants to wait if the deal works before he allows relations to get better.\u201dIt was Ayatollah Khamenei himself who drew up the framework for talking to the United States on the nuclear issue. He allowed direct negotiations to take place only through a trusted foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Iran\u2019s original goal for the talks was not to solve problems with the United States, but to get sanctions lifted.Many, perhaps most, Iranians \u2014 having had their hopes for change dashed numerous times in the past, most recently in 2009 \u2014 have few expectations that the nuclear agreement will fundamentally change anything.\u201cThe deal will absolutely happen,\u201d said Mr. Karimi Joni, the journalist. But there will be no opening of embassies, direct flights to New York or American investments here, he predicted. \u201cUnless the supreme leader thinks this is necessary for the continuation of the system. In that case it will happen immediately.\u201dOthers are not so sure, convinced that relations with the United States have been permanently altered, despite the supreme leader\u2019s pronouncements.\u201cWhatever anybody says, America is less of an enemy and less hostile than it was before,\u201d said Ghasem Golbaf, the owner and publisher of several magazines. \u201cThe relation will change for the better. It\u2019s just inevitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conference Aims to Bridge the Divide Between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 The Pentagon will press its effort to build ties with the nation\u2019s scientists and engineers at a three-day conference this week in St. Louis that will highlight a range of future technologies and serve as a forum to promote collaboration across diverse science and technology fields.The event is the brainchild of Arati Prabhakar, a physicist who studied at the California Institute of Technology and a longtime Silicon Valley venture capitalist who has headed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, since 2012. Ashton Carter, the defense secretary, will open the event, which is expected to draw 1,200 innovators, including military contractors, university and corporate engineers, and scientists and entrepreneurs from start-ups.The conference is part of a broader effort by the Pentagon to tap into the ingenuity of Silicon Valley.In August, Secretary Carter, who is also an accomplished physicist, announced a $75 million collaboration with private firms to develop more advanced wearable electronics that might lead to new kinds of sensors for everything from clothing to the hulls of ships and fuselages of aircraft. That followed an announcement in April by the Pentagon that it will create an outpost in Silicon Valley known as \u201cDefense Innovation Unit Experimental.\u201d The effort is being made in part to repair the schism between the federal government and Silicon Valley created by revelations of electronic spying found in the documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, said Andrew McAfee, co-director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy.\u201cI believe it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military people I\u2019ve talked to understand that their culture and history are hemming them and slowing them down. I think there is an appetite on both sides.\u201dThe conference, named \u201cWait, What? A Future Technology Forum,\u201d will include a number of technology demonstrations, such as the agency\u2019s pioneering research in brain-computer interfaces.The research was started to enable soldiers who had been paralyzed or lost limbs to control a prosthetic from the brain. The conference will also present 100-gigabit wireless networks, advances in diagnostic techniques to combat infectious diseases such as Ebola, and research in synthetic biology that holds the promise of \u201cprogramming\u201d matter.In an interview at Darpa headquarters here last week, Dr. Prabhakar said that building a bridge between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley had personal significance.\u201cI think that this is the common ground and it is at the heart of what I certainly treasure about Silicon Valley \u2014 this notion of technology as a force that can change the world and make a better world,\u201d she said. \u201cI think technology is equally core to national security.\u201dSince the agency was founded in 1958, Darpa\u2019s relationship with the Valley has had its ups and downs.During the 1960s and 1970s, the agency underwrote research that led directly to the foundational technologies that helped create Silicon Valley. Research that led to techniques to design the first large-scale computer chips \u2014 known as very large-scale integration, or VLSI \u2014 made the modern semiconductor industry possible. Earlier, the agency also underwrote a series of projects in computing and networking that led directly to the modern personal computer and the Internet.However, in the aftermath of Sept. 11 and during the Iraq war, the director at the time, Tony Tether, steered the agency toward a closer relationship with the classified world of the military contracting establishment.He also started the Total Information Awareness program, which was overseen by the former national security adviser John Poindexter. The program, which was intended to create a giant electronic dragnet to hunt for terrorists, outraged privacy advocates and was canceled by Congress.However, the technologies pioneered by Darpa then drifted into the intelligence community and helped create the program that motivated Mr. Snowden to leak tens of thousands of classified documents to journalists.Today, Dr. Prabhakar is trying to find ways to use technology to square the circle between security and privacy. The challenge remains a controversial issue that still bitterly divides the nation\u2019s technology heartland from parts of the administration.In a plan originally debated in 1992 during the Clinton administration, many in the law enforcement and intelligence community wanted an \u201celectronic backdoor\u201d built into encryption and security software to intercept voice and Internet communications. The United States government\u2019s call for such technology has grown louder since the Snowden revelations.Dr. Prabhakar said she was sympathetic to the views of counterterrorism officials who have called for access to encrypted information.\u201cI think these are incredibly hard problems,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the people who are charged with really preventing terrorist activity live in a world where that\u2019s a burden that they feel, and I think it\u2019s just hard to imagine if you\u2019re not living in it.But she has pushed Darpa to find a technological compromise. In March Darpa began a new program, nicknamed \u201cBrandeis,\u201d after Louis D. Brandeis, the Supreme Court justice who helped develop the concept of the right to privacy.The program aims to give individuals more control over their data while maintaining lawful access.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Francis Sees Both Sides of Business", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaPope Francis has from time to time been accused of communism, socialism, radical leftism. But his carefully sculpted words during his whirlwind visit to the United States suggested a bold, label-defying political philosophy all his own: Francisism.Businesspeople were right to tremble at his arrival. He was coming from Cuba, of all places. He elects to live in a simple Vatican guesthouse, not the official, ornate papal apartments. He has published an encyclical chiding unbridled capitalism.But then, standing before a joint session of the Congress, he called business a \u201cnoble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world.\u201d\u201cThe right use of natural resources,\u201d the pope said, \u201cthe proper application of technology and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive and sustainable.\u201dPerhaps out of relief, the legislators in the room \u2014 many of them millionaires; nearly all of them dependent on millionaires\u2019 and billionaires\u2019 donations \u2014 stood and cheered.That isn\u2019t to say the pope went easy on capitalism on his visit to the place that perhaps best exemplifies it. He criticized \u201ca selfish and boundless thirst for power and material prosperity,\u201d a \u201cquietly growing culture of waste\u201d that blithely discards things and people, and a \u201cgrowing and steady social fragmentation\u201d in a globalized world \u201cso apparently connected.\u201dOver six days, the pope addressed Catholics and non-Catholics alike as he pleaded for environmental stewardship and compassion for immigrants and the poor in the halls of power.Francisism seems, then, to be a curious mix of what we might call pro-business and anticapitalist. Business, in its view, is a necessary human activity, a way of relishing God-given bounties and, above all, a means to an end greater than business. This is what Pope Francis suggested when he said business was especially useful \u201cif it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good.\u201dWhat Francisism takes issue with is not business but capitalism, which it seems to regard as an ideology verging on idolatry, on serving a false god. What upsets the pope is not commerce itself but rather the elevation of commerce above other values \u2014 not merely above the worship of God, but also above democracy, law, fraternity, environmental stewardship.One element of this pro-business, anticapitalist worldview is the pope\u2019s argument that powerful interests err when they seek to eliminate countervailing sources of power: \u201cNo human individual or group can consider itself absolute, permitted to bypass the dignity and the rights of other individuals or their social groupings.\u201d The pope made public appearances and shared private moments among the people and the powerful in Washington.Though it is perhaps expected for the bishop of Rome to warn against the idolatry of money, what is striking is how Francis suggests that not only God but also secular politics must outrank economic imperatives. In lines included in the pope\u2019s prepared remarks before Congress but not uttered out loud, he was to say, \u201cIf politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance.\u201dAt St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, the pope warned of the business mentality seeping into nonbusiness domains: \u201cWe can get caught up in measuring the value of our apostolic works by the standards of efficiency, good management and outward success, which govern the business world.\u201d He added, \u201cThe cross shows us a different way of measuring success.\u201dThe question one is left with is: When does business cross over into this excessive capitalism that the pope describes? When does the vital become the dehumanizing?His words offered hints, if not outright answers. He described the dangerous possibility of the wealthy \u201cbecoming self-enclosed, frozen into elites, clinging to their own security.\u201d Business is an engagement with others. Capitalism, in elevating business as the ultimate good, walls us off and wards off others, giving a \u201cfalse sense of security,\u201d filling us with \u201capathy,\u201d which in turn puts the heart at risk of \u201cgrowing numb, becoming anesthetized.\u201d\u201cLife grows by being given away, and it weakens in isolation and comfort,\u201d the pope said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Surprising Target of Jeb Bush\u2019s Tax Plan: Private Equity", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookEarlier this year, Henry R. Kravis, the private equity investor, held a $100,000 a plate fund-raising dinner for Jeb Bush at his Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan. The guest list was a who\u2019s who of private equity and real estate executives, including Jerry I. Speyer, the billionaire New York property owner. The dinner raised more than $4 million.That\u2019s why Mr. Bush\u2019s tax reform plan \u2014 unveiled last week and a likely topic of discussion at Wednesday night\u2019s Republican debate \u2014 was such a surprise.Mr. Bush\u2019s proposal seems to take a direct shot at the very people who filled the tables that night to support him.In a departure from Republican orthodoxy, his new tax proposal calls for raising taxes \u2014 and closing a longtime loophole \u2014 on carried interest, which represents investment gains largely from private equity and hedge funds. (In this regard, Mr. Bush was following his Republican rival Donald Trump, who has been criticizing the carried-interest provision for weeks.)Even more worthy of attention is Mr. Bush\u2019s plan to eliminate the ability of companies to deduct the cost of interest payments. In other words, Mr. Bush is seeking to destroy an incentive for American companies to borrow money.His policy could have a profound impact on almost every industry, but would especially affect the private equity and real estate industries, which have long relied on debt \u2014 or leverage, in Wall Street parlance \u2014 to increase their profits.L.B.O. stands for leveraged buyout, a transaction that has made fortunes for the likes of Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group. And eliminating the ability to deduct the cost of interest payments would make pursuing a leveraged buyout significantly less attractive.Mr. Bush\u2019s plan could also make big public companies a lot less inclined to borrow money to pursue stock buyback and dividend programs. That would also significantly hamper the tactics of activist hedge fund investors, whose favorite move is to pressure companies to load up on debt to buy back stock.If you believe share buybacks do little more than help chief executives increase their own compensation, or think private equity executives get paid too much, Mr. Bush\u2019s plan has great appeal.With this tax plan, he appears to have bitten the hand that has fed him. It is hard to see how donors like Julian H. Robertson, the prominent hedge fund manager who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Bush in the Hamptons over the summer, or the investor John A. Paulson, who attended a breakfast fund-raiser in Manhattan, could be thrilled about those provisions of his tax plan.Mr. Bush\u2019s plan is particularly striking because he briefly sought a career in private equity just two years ago when he helped start a firm called Britton Hill Holdings, which invested in aviation and energy. (His tax proposal to eliminate the deduction of interest has one large exception: banks.)If you\u2019re wondering why industry isn\u2019t howling, there may be good reason: The tax plan also reduces both individual and corporate rates so much that it\u2019s unclear how disadvantaged the wealthy would be. There\u2019s a sound argument that the other parts of the plan are so tilted toward the wealthy that society\u2019s upper crust may view the entire proposal positively.Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, has described Mr. Bush\u2019s tax policy as \u201cR.R.H.\u201d\u2014 Reverse Robin Hood. He called it \u201ca revenue-eating wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d that \u201cwould engender massive, regressive changes to the federal tax code.\u201dUnder Mr. Bush\u2019s plan, corporate tax rates would drop to 20 percent, from 35 percent. Moreover, his plan allows companies to deduct new capital investment in the first year, an offset of sorts of eliminating the corporate interest deduction. He\u2019s also moving to a territorial tax system to end any attraction to move abroad. On individual tax rates, the top rate is reduced to 28, with the next rate at 25, and then at 10. He\u2019s also expanding the earned-income tax credit while eliminating the death tax and alternative minimum tax.All in all, Mr. Bush\u2019s plan might sound attractive to some, but there\u2019s one big question mark: It requires some huge assumptions to make the numbers add up. Critics contend that the plan is regressive, meaning that it hits lower-income taxpayers harder.Still, the most intriguing part of the plan, which is worth more study, is his proposal to eliminate the tax deductibility of interest. In many ways, it could help address many of the big challenges that our debt-fueled economy has created.The International Monetary Fund has long maintained that companies\u2019 bias toward debt \u201ccreates significant inequities, complexities, and economic distortions,\u201d as it stated in a 2011 report. At the same time, the I.M.F. has acknowledged that abolishing interest deductibility would be very difficult to carry out, and as a result no country has ever moved to eliminate it. Whether Mr. Bush\u2019s tax plan has a chance \u2014 or whether it is too wonky to capture America\u2019s attention at a time when Donald Trump\u2019s one-liners do \u2014 it\u2019s nice to see the candidates wading into substantive issues that will have a real impact on the nation\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reinforcing a Battered European Monetary Union", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeVIENNA \u2014 Overshadowed by Europe\u2019s twin dramas of migrants and Greek debt, debate is bubbling up over how to strengthen the European monetary union after six years of debilitating crisis.On one side are those who believe the 19-nation eurozone needs to take a bold step toward federal integration to survive as a stable currency area. On the other are those who argue that with scant public or political appetite for sharing more sovereignty, Europe just has to keep muddling through with modest, incremental change.The heads of five European Union institutions proposed in June a series of steps over the next two years to reinforce the bloc\u2019s banking union; better integrate its capital, energy and digital markets; foster economic competitiveness; and counter macroeconomic imbalances \u2014 all without changing the European Union treaty.Even those relatively low-key proposals face resistance, notably in Berlin, where opposition to any further sharing of liability at a European level is deeply ingrained.More ambitious ideas are also blossoming in Paris and at the European Central Bank\u2019s headquarters in Frankfurt. Within days of the eurozone\u2019s clinching a deal to keep Greece in the currency area with a third bailout, a French minister and a senior central banker called for creation of a eurozone treasury with its own budget and the power to oversee national economic and fiscal policies.The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said Paris and Berlin would have to shed inhibitions about sovereignty and risk-sharing to \u201creinvent\u201d Europe and make the eurozone work. \u201cFor the French, this means we must carry out reforms that break old habits once and for all. It also means the Germans will have to break taboos,\u201d Mr. Macron told The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cIf the member states are not ready for any form of financial transfer in the monetary union, as is the case today, then you can forget the euro and the eurozone.\u201dMr. Macron, a business-friendly young reformer in the French Socialist government, said a European economic government led by a supercommissioner should be able to borrow on the markets and have a separate budget \u2014 a bigger budget than the European Union now has, at about 1 percent of member states\u2019 gross domestic product.A member of the European Central Bank\u2019s Executive Board, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, has called for the creation of a European finance ministry with oversight by the European Parliament. The ministry would be responsible for preventing economic and fiscal imbalances, managing crises and running a eurozone budget, as well as representing euro area governments in international economic and financial institutions.The response from Germany, the eurozone\u2019s leading economic and political power, has been cautious but not dismissive. Chancellor Angela Merkel said strengthening the euro area was likely to be an incremental process, since few governments were keen to change the European Union\u2019s founding treaty.Berlin and Paris have been working on improving a European banking union, building a capital markets union and developing more effective governance to promote economic competitiveness, she said, and some extra financial resources could be then considered to help countries reform.It remains unclear whether France will be more willing than in the past to pool more sovereignty in fiscal and economic policy and whether Germany would then be willing to share more risk through a common eurozone budget or debt mutualization. For now, Berlin is balking even at a modest proposal for joint reinsurance of national bank deposit insurance programs.The rise of anti-euro populist parties in countries including France makes closer integration of the eurozone more politically risky, though not yet impossible. Working out what to fix is made harder by disagreement among economists and politicians still don\u2019t agree on what caused the crisis.The standard German narrative blames profligate governments and bloated labor costs in southern countries. Hence Berlin\u2019s prescribed solution is austerity to shrink deficits and lower wage costs to restore competitiveness. But many economists say Germany\u2019s export boom and wage restraint opened imbalances in the eurozone, along with a surge of private debt in peripheral countries after a construction boom fueled by low interest rates and reckless lending.In that case, the solution would lie in improving domestic demand in Germany and finding ways to write off or mutualize some of the debt overhang in the crisis-stricken countries.In his first state of the union address last week, the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, acknowledged that eurozone economies had diverged during the debt crisis, with unemployment and inequality rising and growth potential shrinking, fueling public doubts about the currency.Mr. Juncker, one of the architects of the euro, promised to work on creating a eurozone treasury, built on the bloc\u2019s existing bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, to underpin the economy.Such changes, along with making European oversight of economic and fiscal policies more binding, would require changes to the Union\u2019s treaty that neither Germany nor France wants to raise before national elections in 2017.Economists like Paul de Grauwe of the London School of Economics worry that the modest recovery now underway will cause complacency, discouraging the architectural changes needed to correct the design flaws of the monetary union. He advocates pooling existing national debt under a common eurozone fiscal authority to reduce countries\u2019 exposure to market swings, and creating an insurance mechanism to counteract economic shocks within the euro area.Other ideas raised at a conference hosted by the Austrian central bank on completing the monetary union included a common eurozone unemployment insurance program in crisis times, giving Brussels more power to make countries correct macroeconomic imbalances, and even \u2014 heretically \u2014 borrowing from the E.C.B. to fund public investment in infrastructure.The Austrian central bank governor, Ewald Nowotny, who hosted the event, welcomed new ideas to address the institutional flaws of the euro area but warned against \u201calarmism\u201d and \u201cdramatic undertones.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s especially dangerous to say that we have to have radical change, otherwise everything will die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know we will not have radical change in the near future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany Works to Get Migrants Jobs", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosOne afternoon last week, Mr. Jasor, 22, walked with a light step around the cavernous factory floor of ZF Friedrichshafen, a large German industrial company that recently hired him as an apprentice in this small town on the border with Austria that has become a major landing point for migrants.Just a few years earlier, Mr. Jasor faced threats on his life back home in Afghanistan, where Taliban insurgents had threatened to kill him if he did not join the group and stop his computer science studies at the local university.After learning German quickly and proving to be a skilled employee, Mr. Jasor is on track for a permanent job once he completes his apprenticeship in making machine and auto parts. More than any other European country now contending with an influx of migrants and refugees, Germany \u2014 with Europe\u2019s biggest economy, an aging population and more than a half-million unfilled jobs \u2014 sees the migration wave as not only a challenge but an opportunity.\u201cGermany will benefit from people like Nematullah,\u201d said Roland Biebl, Mr. Jasor\u2019s supervisor. \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to integrate them.\u201dAdvocates of fast-tracking employment say that Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, has enough jobs to accommodate the flood of new arrivals \u2014 and in fact is facing the threat of a labor shortage and a growing bill for pensions and health care, as more and more of the country\u2019s aging population reaches retirement. Refugees like Mr. Jasor, as well as many asylum-seekers who have arrived from Syria, are educated and bring employable skills that could help ease the labor squeeze.Last week, big employers including Deutsche Post and the automaker Daimler called for an overhaul of German labor laws to let asylum-seekers get to work quickly. Ms. Merkel, who met with industry leaders, announced that Germany would accelerate the asylum process and make it easier for those allowed to stay to enter the work force. An additional 2 billion euros, or nearly $2.3 billion, will be spent to help people learn German, which is essential for any job.On Monday, Germany\u2019s four main employers\u2019 associations said they supported the government\u2019s decision to temporarily slow the flow of migrants to avoid burdening the asylum system. But in a joint statement, the organizations, which represent hundreds of thousands of companies, renewed the call to give approved migrants faster access to the labor market and to language and skills training.\u201cThat is the best way for permanent integration,\u201d the organizations said in the statement.Some Germans fear that the influx could threaten their own jobs and drive wages down. Recently, Marine Le Pen, the head of the far-right National Front party in France, accused Ms. Merkel of encouraging immigration to \u201crecruit slaves.\u201d But political proponents and many businesses see an opportunity to welcome a wave of motivated, mostly younger people into the German labor force.\u201cThere is something to be said about thinking of refugees not just as victims but as potential contributors to societies and economies in the future,\u201d said Elizabeth Collett, a policy fellow at the Migration Policy Institute Europe, based in Brussels. Analysts said Germans and other European nationals were not filling those jobs because they did not have the right experience or education or, in the case of low-skilled work, because they did not want the jobs.The labor shortage has persisted even after tens of thousands of young people from Greece, Spain and other crisis-hit eurozone economies have flocked to Germany in recent years to find employment.\u201cWe don\u2019t see evidence that refugees will be stealing jobs,\u201d said Alexander Wilhelm, a labor market expert at the Confederation of German Employers\u2019 Associations. \u201cWe have record-high underemployment and record-high job openings. So for the moment, the labor market is capable of giving new opportunities.\u201dMs. Merkel and many German companies say change is possible. They point to the reunification of East and West Germany and Germany\u2019s previous absorption of European migrants during difficult economic circumstances.That has not always worked seamlessly.In the 1960s, \u201cguest worker\u201d programs bringing Turks and others to fill factory labor shortages stoked friction and gave rise to ethnic enclaves.And not everyone has the requisite skills.Of the migrants who settled in Germany from 1985 to 2013, for example, 73 percent of men and 48 percent of women wound up working, compared with 83 percent of men and 73 percent of women in the total German labor force, according to the Cologne Institute of Economic Research.Migrants coming in now from the Middle East may take longer to learn German or adapt to European culture, making the transition more difficult, the institute added. Others may be suffering trauma from war and their harrowing odyssey to Europe.Whether the push to employ asylum-seekers proves more than a token gesture remains to be seen. So far, few German companies have hired more than a handful of migrants.Daimler\u2019s chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, told German news outlets last week that the migrants coming now were the kind of workers the country needed. But his company had taken just four migrants into vocational jobs, a spokesman said, in a work force of nearly 169,000.But that could change, he said, especially with Ms. Merkel leading the charge. \u201cWe see it as a freedom project,\u201d Mr. Hein said. \u201cWe must include refugees in the labor force and not just leave them on the street.\u201dThat view has made Mr. Jasor fall in love with Germany. After fleeing Afghanistan in 2011, he took a perilous route through Iran and then Turkey, where he worked odd jobs and studied German using a Turkish textbook. Later, a smuggler helped get him through Eastern Europe to the border of Germany.\u201cI\u2019ve been through so many countries, and Germany has the best people,\u201d said Mr. Jasor, a sunny, soft-spoken man who teared up as he thought of the parents he had left behind in Afghanistan. \u201cNo one has made me feel like an outsider.\u201dMr. Jasor, who is Muslim, prays regularly, but his German colleagues do not seem to mind, he said. Out of curiosity, he went to Mass one Sunday at a local church, and he has returned several times since to learn more about Christianity and to make friends.After his shift at ZF ended one recent afternoon, Mr. Jasor made his way to the migrant home where he lives on the outskirts of Passau. As an apprentice, he now earns 945 euros a month before taxes, and he pays 208 euros a month to rent a small room, instead of having the government continue to subsidize it for him.On the floor, a thin blue mattress lay next to a black carpet adorned with a red rose. A rickety desk held German language books, which Mr. Jasor studies at night. The verdant, rolling hills flanking the Danube rise into view through his small window.Outside, a cacophony of voices filled the air; 95 migrants from Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria and other countries crowded the other rooms, and rows of strollers and laundry racks lined the hallway. On this day, community volunteers took the migrants for a cruise on the Danube to see the sights, and now they had gathered on the ground floor to discuss the trip in German.Mr. Jasor, one of the few who had a job, could not take the tour. But that was fine with him. \u201cI want to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my dream. I will save money to get my own apartment and have a family.\u201dHe gazed out the window toward the warm, setting sun.\u201cThis is my future,\u201d Mr. Jasor said. \u201cMy future is Germany.\u201dRhea Wessel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The cafe charges an average of $4.50 per bowl of cereal. The Keerys have defended their right to open the business on Brick Lane in Shoreditch, an area of London once famed for hip, artistic grit and now known for skyrocketing rents and amenities.Mr. Keery said that his business, which is family owned, was vandalized while protesters ignored luxury real estate developments and chain businesses.\u201cWe don\u2019t want luxury flats that no one can afford,\u201d the protest description read on Facebook, \u201cwe want genuinely affordable housing.

{"Headline": "The New Romantics in the Computer Age", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust once I\u2019d like to have a college student come up to me and say, \u201cI really wanted to major in accounting, but my parents forced me to major in medieval art.\u201d That probably won\u2019t happen. It always seems to be the parents who are pushing their children in the \u201cpractical\u201d or mercenary direction.These parents are part of the vast apparatus \u2014 college r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, standardized tests, the decline of humanities majors \u2014 that has arisen to make our culture more professional and less poetic.But you see a counterreaction setting in. You see, here and there, signs of a new romanticism.Computers can already go through millions of legal documents and sort them for relevance to an individual case, someday allowing one lawyer to do the work of 500. Computers may soon be able to cruise through troves of data and offer superior financial advice. Computers are not only getting smarter at systems analysis, they are improving at rates no human can match.Colvin argues that improving your cognitive skills is no longer good enough. Simply developing more generic human capital will not help people prosper in the coming economy. You shouldn\u2019t even ask, What jobs can I do that computers can\u2019t do? That\u2019s because they are getting good at so many disparate things. You should instead ask, What are the activities that we humans, driven by our deepest nature or by the realities of daily life, will simply insist be performed by other humans?Those tasks are mostly relational. Being in a position of authority or accountability. Being a caregiver. Being part of a team. Transactional jobs are declining but relational jobs are expanding.Empathy becomes a more important workplace skill, the ability to sense what another human being is feeling or thinking. Diabetes patients of doctors who scored high on empathy tests do better than patients with low-empathy doctors.The ability to function in a group also becomes more important \u2014 to know how to tell stories that convey the important points, how to mix people together.Secure workers will combine technical knowledge with social awareness \u2014 the sort of thing you get from your genes, from growing up in a certain sort of family and by widening your repertoire of emotions through reflection, literature and a capacity for intimacy.But the new romanticism won\u2019t only be built on workplace incentives. It will be driven, too, by the inherent human craving for the transcendent. Through history there have always been moments when eras of pragmatism give way to eras of high idealism.There is the hero of courage, who possesses prowess and risks life and limb for a cause, thus arousing admiration and awe. There is the hero of compassion, like Buddha or Jesus, who puts others before him or herself. Edmundson writes: \u201cThe saint seeks a life full of meaningful compassion. The acquisition of goods, the piling up of wealth, only serves to draw force from his proper pursuit. The saint lives \u2014 or tries to live \u2014 beyond desire. The saint lives for hope.\u201dThere is the hero of serious thought. \u201cEven early on,\u201d Edmundson says, \u201cas they enter the first phase of their lives as thinkers, they\u2019ll have one of the greatest satisfactions a human being can have: They won\u2019t lie. They\u2019ll follow Socrates, and they\u2019ll look out at the world, and with whatever mix of irony and sweetness and exasperation, they will describe it as it is to them. When others trim and sidestep, they will have the satisfaction of voicing honest perceptions.\u201dI could imagine a time when young thinkers discard the strictures of the academic professionalism and try to revive the model of the intellectual as secular sage. I could see other young people tiring of r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building do-goodism and trying to live more radically for the poor. The romantic tries as much as possible to ground his or her life in purer love that transforms \u2014 making him or her more inspired, creative and dedicated, and therefore better able to live as a modern instantiation of some ideal.I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re about to be overrun with waves of Byronic romantics, but we have been living through an unromantic period and there\u2019s bound to be a correction. People eventually want their souls stirred, especially if the stuff regarded as soft and squishy turns out in a relational economy to be hard and practical.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Shaky Grasp on Immigration", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe core constituency of Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner \u2014 white, older voters like him who are more likely to believe that immigrants take Americans\u2019 jobs, housing and health care than accept that they contribute to the economy \u2014 came of age largely at that stage in history, from the 1950s through the early 1970s.\u201cIt was a unique period of rapid economic growth, when the children and grandchildren of Europeans were blending into a homogeneous mass,\u201d said Douglas S. Massey, a Princeton sociologist. \u201cThat world is gone.\u201dThis transformation provides the most convincing explanation of the runaway popularity of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposition to kick out the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States today and close the door to future migrants with a 2,000-mile border wall.To these voters, a country where 13 percent of the population was born abroad and where 17 percent identify as Latino is a scary place. But what is most paradoxical about that belief is that Mr. Trump\u2019s central proposition \u2014 that illegal immigration into the United States remains a critical problem \u2014 is actually wrong. Mr. Trump, as Mr. Massey succinctly put it, \u201cis beating a dead horse.\u201dIllegal immigration could rebound as the American economy recovers further. But Mr. Massey and others argue that a more powerful force is pulling in the other direction: demographics, which has significantly shrunk the population of Mexicans interested in crossing the border.\u201cI don\u2019t see Mexicans coming back in any great number,\u201d said Pia M. Orrenius, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who has studied patterns of illegal immigration. \u201cThe cohorts of working-age men are much diminished, so you don\u2019t have the push.\u201dIndeed, 15- to 24-year-olds, those most likely to consider going north, shrank to 18 percent of the Mexican population in 2015 from 22 percent in 1990. They are expected to drop to 16 percent of the population in 2025.The great migration boom from Mexico from the 1980s through the first half of the last decade was the consequence of \u201ca perfect storm,\u201d said Gordon Hanson, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego.Even as the United States experienced solid growth through what came to be known as the Great Moderation, Mexico suffered three currency crises in 13 years. And while growth in the American-born labor supply slowed after the last of the baby boomers entered the work force, Mexico\u2019s working-age population was still expanding fast.\u201cThis period won\u2019t be repeated,\u201d Professor Hanson said. \u201cThe great Mexican migration wave has crested.\u201dPerhaps the strangest thing about Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal is that his main weapon \u2014 the border wall \u2014 is already well established. It has proved, at best, pretty much irrelevant. At worst, it backfired badly.Mr. Trump, a real estate developer and reality television star, has declared himself a candidate for the Republican nomination for president. Here is a look at what he will need to do if he hopes to win.Border Patrol personnel have doubled since 2004, to more than 21,000. More than 650 miles of fencing has been built, festooned with sensors and backed up by drones.These days, immigration enforcement takes up half the nation\u2019s entire law enforcement budget. The border patrol\u2019s budget alone has increased more than tenfold since 1970, to nearly $4 billion.Recent research by Professor Hanson, Scott Borger of the Department of Homeland Security and Bryan Roberts of Econometrica, based on data from the Department of Homeland Security, suggests that the most recent step-up of border enforcement may have had a bigger effect than previous efforts, accounting for one-third of the downturn in illegal immigration from 2003 to 2010.Yet the expansive border buildup has also had perverse effects, promoting the very pattern it was supposedly intended to curb.\u201cEnforcement increases the cost of crossing the border but also increases the payoff, because it raises the wage of those who get through,\u201d because there are fewer of them, Ms. Orrenius noted. \u201cSo you can return to the market equilibrium that you had.\u201dSoon-to-be-published research by Professor Massey, Karen A. Pren of Princeton and Jorge Durand of the University of Guadalajara in Mexico, based on tens of thousands of interviews with migrants from nearly 150 Mexican communities, concluded that the odds of a prospective immigrant ultimately making it illegally into the United States remained above 95 percent until 2008.The probability declined to 75 percent after 2008, but by then economic and demographic forces had pushed net illegal immigration down to about zero.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.The border buildup did change immigration patterns, Professor Massey argued, but mostly in undesired ways. It didn\u2019t stop immigrants from making it in. But the rising cost of entry to the United States \u2014 the higher smugglers\u2019 fees, the greater odds of dying on the way \u2014 ensured that those who made it stayed in the United States.What was once a pendular flow of Mexican men coming north to do seasonal work in a handful of states and returning to Mexico in the winter became a permanent community of full-fledged families that settled across the 48 contiguous states.Mr. Trump could blame the browning of America at least in part on the wall. In a cheeky bit of counterfactual analysis, the three researchers estimated that the tightening of border enforcement since 1986 actually added four million people to the population of immigrants living illegally in the United States in 2010.Nostalgia, of course, has no place for analysis. Analytical quibbles are unlikely to sway Mr. Trump or his followers.They might even take comfort from examples in history of nearly impregnable walls. East Germany managed to close itself off from the West from 1961 to 1989 with an effectiveness of 95 percent.It was expensive, though. It took nearly 30,000 guards to defend a boundary less than half the length of the Mexico-United States border. Border guards used land mines and shot to kill. They got help from the Stasi, monitoring every aspect of East Germans\u2019 lives.This seems like a high price to pay to stop a trickle of illegal immigrants that is falling on its own to zero.An earlier version of this column misidentified the entity East Germany used 30,000 border guards to defend against along a boundary less than half the length of the Mexico-United States border. It was West Germany, not West Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Raising Rates Too Soon: The Mistake Central Banks Keep Making", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolicy DilemmasCentral banks, to boil their job down to its simplest level, face this perpetual dilemma: Should they push for easier money, to try to support a nation\u2019s economic growth, or for tighter money, to try to head off inflation?History is rife with mistakes in both directions, with either type of error causing its own variety of pain. But since the global financial crisis, when major central banks have erred, it has been overwhelmingly \u2014 perhaps exclusively \u2014 in the direction of excessive fear of inflation and complacency about growth.That is the reality that haunts the Fed as its leaders begin a two-day meeting Wednesday at which they could choose to raise their short-term interest rate target above the near-zero level (where it has rested for nearly seven years). If they elect to move \u2014 futures markets gave it a 28 percent probability as of Tuesday \u2014 it would be a bet that they are getting the timing right, in contrast with international counterparts who have repeatedly moved prematurely and regretted it, or previous moments when the Fed has made hawkish noises prematurely.\u201cI cannot think of any advanced economy central bank that has been too dovish since 2007, except possibly Iceland, and I have not studied Iceland,\u201d said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Fed official.A rate increase would be a signal that Fed leaders are confident the risks facing the United States economy tilt more toward overheating and financial excess, after years in which weak employment and growth have been the nation\u2019s overriding problems.Of course, that is just what many other central banks, including the Fed itself, have thought over the last several years as they looked toward the easy-money exit. Here\u2019s a look at some of those experiences, and the specific lesson they offer for the Fed in 2015.We now know that 2011 was the year that the European economy slumped into a new recession and that the euro currency region very nearly ripped apart. In the earlier part of that year, the European Central Bank acted as if it were blind to those risks. It raised short-term interest rates in April and July.The official reason: Energy prices had spiked, and officials were fearful that those prices might start to pass through to create broader-based inflation. It also doesn\u2019t take a conspiracy theorist to suspect that Jean-Claude Trichet, then the E.C.B. president, may have wanted to signal his inflation-fighting credentials at a time he was under fire by Germans for his efforts to combat the eurozone crisis, including the buying of Greek bonds.Either way, as the severity of the dangers facing Europe\u2019s economy and the power of the deflationary forces at work on the Continent both became clearer, it was evident it had been the wrong move. Mr. Trichet\u2019s successor, Mario Draghi, reversed the rate increases by the end of the year.What these have in common: They are small countries that escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis that began in 2008 and were in a hurry to get their interest rate policies back toward normal shortly after growth returned.They had much stronger economies in 2010 than the United States and Western Europe did. They didn\u2019t face the unwinding of housing bubbles, the near-collapse of their banking systems or crises of confidence in their public debt.What their central bankers missed was the deep interconnections each economy faced with the rest of the world. Their vulnerability to the continued turmoil in the United States and European economies (and in the case of Australia, to a China slowdown) meant that a few quarters of solid growth were not enough. All four of the countries reversed their rate increases soon after as recessions or substantial slowdowns ensued.Worth noting: The governor of the Bank of Israel at the time was Stanley Fischer, now the No. 2 official at the Fed.This might seem an odd choice to include here. After all, the Fed left interest rates safely near zero throughout 2010, and started a controversial program of quantitative easing, $600 billion in bond buying known as Q.E. 2, in November of that year. It didn\u2019t make as blatant a policy error as the E.C.B.\u2019s 2011 rate increases.But what\u2019s easier to forget is how eagerly some Fed officials were looking toward the monetary exits, especially at the start of 2010. The Fed chairman Ben Bernanke gave congressional testimony about the Fed\u2019s \u201cexit strategy\u201d in February of that year. There was a sense of bailout fatigue, creating a focus on how the Fed would end its era of easy money. It would turn out, of course, that that era was only beginning. The tenor of the entire discussion at that point, we now know, was directionally wrong. As the economic recovery proved sorely disappointing, the discussion needed to be on how to try to encourage growth, not how to exit from the Fed\u2019s earlier interventions.Mr. Bernanke was assailed for the Q.E. 2 program at the time for what conservative critics in the United States and abroad considered excessive activism. With hindsight, it appears to have had the opposite problem. It wasn\u2019t until two years later, when the Fed shifted to an open-ended Q.E. 3 program linked to specific economic goals, that the United States economic recovery finally became more robust.The fact that errors by the Fed and other central banks have all pointed the same direction the last several years does not mean that a rate increase this week would be a mistake, of course. At some point it will be time to tighten the spigot of easy money. With the United States unemployment rate at a mere 5.1 percent and economic growth moving along, there is a perfectly solid case that that time is now. But as they consider whether to move, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues can also recall that there are some reasons to be wary from the not-too-distant past.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "United Airlines Customer Dissatisfaction Festers, 5 Years After Merger", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesThe merger of Continental Airlines and United Airlines in 2010 was supposed to combine Continental\u2019s reputation for solid customer service with the broader reach of United\u2019s domestic and international network.Instead, the five-year-old marriage has turned into an exercise in frustration for United fliers, with frequent delays, canceled flights and lost bags. Like many fans of the former Continental, Paul Wigdor, a managing partner at Ascendant Advisors, an investment advisory firm based in Houston, still bemoans the loss of the airline.\u201cContinental was probably the best airline in my opinion that you could travel on pre-United,\u201d said Mr. Wigdor, a New Jersey resident who flies about twice a month to Houston from Newark on United. \u201cI would say United is one of the lowest.\u201dAmong his complaints: poor service, choppy Wi-Fi and \u2014 after United cut back on perks and upgrades \u2014 little appreciation of frequent fliers, like himself, who log tens of thousands of miles a year.\u201cl feel like at 100,000 miles, somebody should care and make me feel like a valued customer,\u201d Mr. Wigdor said. \u201cYou\u2019re treated as just a commodity, and it\u2019s a race to the bottom. They don\u2019t really appreciate me at all.\u201dFlying between two of United\u2019s biggest hubs, Mr. Wigdor does not have much choice in picking an airline. In Newark, United has an overwhelming share \u2014 about 70 percent \u2014 of all traffic. \u201cIf there were other options,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d happily fly other options.\u201dIn large part, the merger is still a work in progress. Labor relations are sour, customer satisfaction is low and the basic measurements of the airline\u2019s operational performance are dismal compared with its main rivals.Steven Chen, a self-described serial entrepreneur and venture investor, said he had noticed that most of his early-morning flights with United out of Washington, where he runs an online security firm, were delayed. Despite having a half-million miles in his account, Mr. Chen said he still uses other airlines about half the time he travels.Like some other passengers, he recalled several nightmarish trips involving missed connections, lengthy waits at airports and generally poor customer support.\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated being with United,\u201d he said.On-time performance is one of the biggest problems for the carrier. In July, for instance, about 25 percent of all United flights did not land on time, ranking the airline ninth among 13 domestic airlines, according to FlightStats. This compared with 18 percent for Delta Air Lines and an industry average of 22 percent. While Delta can boast of going several weeks without canceling a single flight, United had the second-lowest percentage of completed flights after WestJet in July, the last month for which government statistics were available.\u201cIf you\u2019re not getting the fundamentals right, if you don\u2019t have an airline that travelers can trust to depart and arrive on time, if you don\u2019t stick to your schedule, you don\u2019t have the foundations for an airline,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group.But Mr. Harteveldt said United\u2019s problems ran deeper still. The airline needs a new computer reservation system \u2014 the brains of an airline\u2019s operations \u2014 after deciding to use Continental\u2019s Shares system following the merger. The decision cost the airline badly, leading to canceled flights and repeated computer failures.It must also improve its relationship with corporate customers, which complain about United\u2019s lack of flexibility in dealing with big accounts, according to Mr. Harteveldt. Finally, he added, it must improve the internal culture, which has fared badly since the merger.Mr. Smisek had been a key architects of the merger between the airlines. As chief executive of Continental at the time, Mr. Smisek helped orchestrate the shotgun marriage with United after advanced talks between United and US Airways broke down.United had far bigger ambitions when the merger was announced, declaring that the combination would form the world\u2019s biggest airline. Its lead has been squandered. American Airlines, which merged with US Airways, recently signaled that it measured itself against Delta \u2014 not United, its traditional rival.The airline also says that its on-time performance in recent months has improved, and that it has narrowed the gap with its chief rivals. In August, for instance, according to one measure of on-time arrivals, known as A-zero, United was running neck and neck with American and Southwest, though it still trailed Delta.\u201cWe\u2019ve done major investments in our food, in our clubs and in our airports, and we\u2019ve done major investments to improve our operations,\u201d said Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United.Mr. Smisek\u2019s departure is not what was envisioned when he took over the merged airline. \u201cEveryone thought it would be Continental on steroids,\u201d said Vicki Bryan, an analyst with Gimme Credit. \u201cInstead, management has been the main problem for this airline. It\u2019s not just that they\u2019ve underperformed. They squandered what should have been a wonderful opportunity to build a great airline.\u201dMs. Bryan said she was disappointed that the board and Mr. Munoz did not signal a clean break from Mr. Smisek\u2019s past management. The board, she said, should have stepped in much sooner to correct the company\u2019s course.\u201cIt\u2019s not happening for the right reason,\u201d Ms. Bryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big enough sonic boom I wanted to hear to shake up this airline. They have only gone from bad to worst. They have to get their employees back to work.\u201dThe nostalgia for Continental\u2019s glory days can obscure the flaws that airline had as well. Its network was small, its product offering not as sophisticated as that of other airlines (for instance, it had no premium economy option), and its food onboard included a reheated turkey hot dog served in a plastic box, according to Mr. Harteveldt.\u201cContinental wasn\u2019t a great airline,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt was good only in relative performance.\u201dStill, it had a charismatic chief executive in Gordon M. Bethune, who led the airline from 1994 to 2004 and turned its fortunes around by focusing on lifting employee morale, which he said led to better operations and happier passengers. Continental was viewed as an example of a successful corporate turnaround.But even if Mr. Munoz takes a page from Mr. Bethune\u2019s playbook, it might be too late for some customers.Shubber Ali, co-founder and chief executive of a software company based in the Bay Area, who flies about 150,000 miles a year, said he recently moved his business to American Airlines from United. As a frequent flier, he also noticed that once United got bigger, it took away fliers\u2019 benefits and made it harder to earn privileged status with the airline.United has not recovered from the difficulties of the merger, in which stressed-out employees took out their frustration on passengers, Mr. Ali said. \u201cIt created chaos,\u201d he said, \u201cand the passengers were the ones that suffered.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": " Restaurant of the Future? Service With an Impersonal Touch", "Date": "2015-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAutomation7 PhotosThere\u2019s a new quinoa restaurant in San Francisco \u2014 yes, quinoa restaurants are a thing in San Francisco, so that\u2019s not what\u2019s noteworthy. At this restaurant, customers order, pay and receive their food and never interact with a person.For optimists, it\u2019s a way to make restaurant-going more efficient and less expensive. For pessimists, it\u2019s the latest example of how machines are stealing people\u2019s jobs. Either way, it\u2019s like heaven for misanthropes, or those who are in too much of a hurry to chat with a server.Last week, I was in a fast-moving line and browsed on a flat-screen monitor the menu of eight quinoa bowls, each costing $6.95 (burrito bowl, bento bowl, balsamic beet). Then I approached an iPad, where I tapped in my order, customized it and paid. My name, taken from my credit card, appeared on another screen, and when my food was ready, a number showed up next to it.It corresponded to a cubby where my food would soon appear. The cubbies are behind transparent LCD screens that go black when the food is deposited, so no signs of human involvement are visible. With two taps of my finger, my cubby opened and my food was waiting.The quinoa \u2014 stir-fried, with arugula, parsnips and red curry \u2014 tasted quite good.Whether a restaurant that employs few people is good for the economy is another question. Restaurants, especially fast-food restaurants, have traditionally been a place where low-skilled workers can find employment. Most of the workers are not paid much, though in San Francisco employers of a certain size must pay health benefits and in 2018 a minimum wage of $15.Mr. Friedberg said that was not the reason his team automated so many roles. \u201cTechnology allows us to completely rethink how people get their food,\u201d he said.Automation is transforming every industry. Business owners look to substitute machines for human labor. It happened to blue-collar workers in factories and white-collar workers in banks and even law firms. With self-driving vehicles, it may happen in the taxi and trucking industries. Robots and artificial intelligence machines are expected to transform health care.Automation, in rudimentary forms, is already part of many restaurants. Reservations are made online, orders arrive at the kitchen electronically, and bills are paid with a swipe on an iPad. Chains like Chili\u2019s and airport restaurants use tablet computers for ordering and paying, to speed the process and cut personnel costs.It might be a harbinger of a future in which eating out no longer involves waiters. Restaurants with servers could become the novelty, reserved for occasions when you want more ambience and hands-on attention than Eatsa\u2019s \u201cfood delivery system.\u201d\u201cWhat percent of our currently human interactions are going to remain human as technology really advances?\u201d said Andrew McAfee, co-founder of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy and co-author of \u201cThe Second Machine Age.\u201d \u201cI think for a lot of the meals I\u2019m going to want to eat out in five years, if I don\u2019t deal with a person, that\u2019s not going to be a net negative for me at all.\u201dQuinoa \u201cis a much more efficient way to deliver protein to people than animal protein,\u201d he said. He believes that changing consumers\u2019 tastes is a way to change modern corporate agriculture, much of which is focused on feeding animals.\u201cThe objective is over time we want to automate more and more to increase speed and reduce cost, so we create a food product that\u2019s much cheaper and also happens to be healthy,\u201d he said.By not hiring people to work in the front of the restaurant, he said, they save money on payroll and real estate. (There will always be at least one person available to help people navigate the iPads and to clean up.) The kitchen is also automated, though he declined to reveal how, and the company is experimenting with how to further automate food preparation and delivery.He is firmly on the side of the optimists who think automation benefits the whole of society even if it hurts a few. \u201cThere\u2019s rarely been a technology shift where people didn\u2019t complain about technology replacing people\u2019s jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is the economic growth from new technology has always resulted in new economic activity and job descriptions.\u201cWe can sit and debate all day what the implications are for low-wage workers at restaurants, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. If increased productivity means cost savings get passed to consumers, consumers are going to have a lot more to spend on lots of things.\u201dEatsa could also create new jobs, he said, like building automated machines and software systems \u2014 or growing quinoa.An earlier version of a photo caption accompanying this article gave an incorrect time element for a picture of people waiting in line at Eatsa.

{"Headline": "Why Americans Still Think the Economy Is Terrible", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreat StagnationIf your entire understanding of the economy comes from what is going on in financial markets, you would be forgiven for thinking the same. The stock market, its recent dip notwithstanding, is still not far from all-time highs!The median American household in 2014 had a lower income, in inflation-adjusted terms, than it did in 2013. The $53,657 the household in the middle of the income distribution earned last year was down 1.5 percent from the year before, though the census said that shift was not statistically significant.But even if that drop is a statistical blip and you assume that middle-class incomes were really flat, flat isn\u2019t anything to celebrate in the current environment. The 2014 real median income number is 6.5 percent below its 2007, pre-crisis level. It is 7.2 percent below the number in 1999.A drop in the price of oil, though, has created a short-term drop in inflation numbers that may create a temporary bump in inflation-adjusted incomes for 2015 anyway.The depressing data on middle-class wages is true across almost all groups based on race and age. (One exception is a 5.3 percent gain in median wages among Hispanics in 2014, though that is within the statistical margin of error and so may not be meaningful).Stagnant incomes were a problem in 2013. They remained so in 2014. The evidence we have so far suggests nothing about that is changing in 2015. That is the reality shaping the backdrop to the 2016 presidential campaign, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate debates and the dinnertime table conversations about the state of the economies in families across the United States.The latest census numbers may not be surprising, in the sense that they affirm a trend that has been underway for 15 years and counting.

{"Headline": "A Positive Jobs Report Keeps the Fed in a Tricky Spot", "Date": "2015-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportNothing about the latest numbers is likely to tip the balance for the Fed one way or the other. The unemployment rate is now down to 5.1 percent, its lowest since April 2008, when the Great Recession was a mere toddler. The 173,000 payroll jobs added in August were a little below analyst expectations, but revisions to earlier months were positive. Average hourly earnings rose a healthy 0.3 percent.The Fed has emphasized for the last couple of years that it is \u201cdata-dependent,\u201d a convenient defense for when Fed officials are asked a question they don\u2019t want to answer. (Sample question: \u201cWhen are you going to raise interest rates?\u201d Answer: \u201cWhen the data supports it.\u201d)But the data, including the new numbers out Friday, are offering no surprises that might obviously tilt a close decision one way or the other. If there were evidence that job growth and wages were breaking higher, it could make the case for pulling the trigger on rate increases. It isn\u2019t happening; instead we\u2019re getting the same consistent story that has been evident about the economy for months.That means that the data-dependent line doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. Now we\u2019re in the place where the analytical judgments of Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues will have to prevail.\u201cThere are nuggets here for both sides of the Fed debate,\u201d said Krishna Guha, who tracks the central bank for the research firm Evercore I.S.I., in a research note. \u201cBut there is nothing here that would obviously tip the debate one way or the other.\u201dTwo key questions stand out that they must resolve among themselves as they make their decision.The first question: Is the labor market now tight enough that wage inflation is sure to follow, even though there is only spotty evidence for it so far?The 5.1 percent unemployment rate is in the ballpark of what the Fed considers the long-term sustainable rate of joblessness, which means that in its models wages should start rising more soon. But in the last year, average hourly earnings for private sector workers are up only 2.2 percent, hardly a blockbuster pace of increase.Skeptics of rate hikes argue that the low unemployment rate masks millions of workers who are available to be pulled back into the job market. Do you buy that argument, or think that rising wages are right around the corner as the models predict?\u201cThe labor market continued to tighten, which should allow the Fed to feel \u2018reasonably confident\u2019 inflation will eventually turn higher,\u201d wrote economists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in a research note, using a phrase often used by Fed officials to describe the conditions that would prompt rate increases.The second question: How much should the new strains in financial markets and the global economy matter for United States monetary policy?The sharp sell-off in the global stock market in the last three weeks amid an apparent slowing of the Chinese economy is sure to have some impact on the United States economy. A lower stock market means Americans are less wealthy and therefore they might spend less. A sell-off in corporate bonds means borrowing costs are now higher for many United States companies than they were a month ago.In other words, if the Fed was looking to tighten monetary conditions by raising interest rates, global markets may have already done the job for them.On one hand, it is important that the Fed not be led around by the latest fluctuations in financial markets and make decisions based on what is happening in the real economy, not on what is happening on Wall Street. But what happens on Wall Street affects the real economy, so it can\u2019t ignore markets entirely. This is a big moment for Ms. Yellen and her colleagues to decide which of those facts is more important.\u201cThe August jobs report was not the smoking gun the markets were hoping for,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, in a research note.For the Fed, the biggest question in shaping policy is usually \u201cHow is the economy doing?\u201d We know the answer to that, and the new jobs numbers don\u2019t do anything to change our understanding of where the economy stands. In two weeks, we get to learn Ms. Yellen and her colleagues\u2019 answer to these two somewhat more complicated ones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carried-Interest Tax Break Divides Again, After Trump Revives the Issue", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut far from defeated, the proponents of the carried-interest tax break are rallying to its defense \u2014 and counting on the Republican-controlled Congress to have their back.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since people on the right have had to think about this,\u201d said Ryan Ellis, tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform, the group founded by Grover Norquist, the self-appointed arbiter of Republicans\u2019 anti-tax purity. Recently, both men wrote columns supporting lower taxes for carried interest: Mr. Ellis in Forbes magazine (its Trump-like lead paragraph: \u201cTaxing carried interest as ordinary income is a really dumb idea\u201d) and Mr. Norquist in USA Today.\u201cTrump started it,\u201d Mr. Ellis said in an interview. \u201cAnd then what really got it going was the unfortunate decision of the Bush campaign to include it\u201d in Mr. Bush\u2019s new tax plan. \u201cThen it wasn\u2019t just a kooky Trump idea.\u201d\u201cOur concern is that there is a lot of misinformation out there,\u201d Mr. Maloney said.For Mr. Trump, the real estate mogul, and Mr. Bush, who briefly had a career in private equity, their opposition to the tax break for a niche of the wealthiest Americans is perhaps a politically advantageous position in this populist moment, despite its departure from Republican orthodoxy. Many voters are frustrated by years of stagnant wages and growing income inequality, which has been made worse by the tax code\u2019s preferences.For Mr. Bush, in particular, media attention to the populism of his attack on the carried-interest break obscured an important fact: His proposal to eliminate the break is one provision in a broader tax plan that, over all, would cut individual and corporate taxes so deeply that it was uncertain whether people involved in private equity would pay more taxes or less.At issue with carried interest is the tax code\u2019s longstanding favorable treatment of the generous compensation given to hedge fund managers, private equity partners and venture capitalists as their share of the gains on money they invest for others \u2014 institutions as well as wealthy partnerships. That compensation, typically 20 percent of any investment gains (with an additional fee of 2 percent of the sum under management), is taxed as capital gains rather than ordinary income. That means a tax of 23.8 percent \u2014 instead of the up to 39.6 percent for ordinary income \u2014 even though these money managers generally have not put their own money in play. The traditional justification for low capital gains taxes is to reward risk-taking investors.Congressional Democrats have tried in the past to make that compensation taxable at the higher \u201cordinary income\u201d rates paid by wage earners; Mr. Obama has also proposed as much in his budgets. The carried-interest break was an issue in the 2012 election, given its benefit to the Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a founder of the private equity firm Bain Capital. Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign, on the defensive, suggested that as president he would end the break as part of a rewrite of the tax code.Postelection, the issue faded again. Then in late August, Mr. Trump, on the CBS Sunday morning program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said, \u201cThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,\u201d tax-wise. Defying Republican political gravity, after his heresy of proposing a tax increase, Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans rose.Two weeks later on the same program, Mr. Trump doubled down. He claimed the hedge fund industry \u201ctotally controlled\u201d both Mr. Bush and the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton (who opposes the carried-interest break), and added that, under him, hedge fund managers are \u201cgoing to be paying up.\u201dWith their counterattack gearing up this week, carried-interest defenders were resting easier. On Wednesday, Mr. Ellis said that his intelligence gathering suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax proposal would not be as troublesome as the candidate\u2019s rhetoric suggested. Mr. Ellis also predicted that, given Democrats\u2019 rush to join Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to the tax break, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen the last Republican presidential campaign that\u2019s for ending it.\u201dBut hours later, remarks at the Republican presidential debate on CNN suggested that Mr. Ellis\u2019s information was faulty. Before a vast television audience, Mr. Trump said that when he released a comprehensive tax-overhaul plan in two weeks, \u201cthe hedge fund guys won\u2019t like me as much as they like me right now.\u201cI know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax. And I think it\u2019s unfair.\u201dAlso contrary to Mr. Ellis\u2019s prediction, George Pataki, former governor of New York, joined Mr. Trump\u2019s side. \u201cI would not give a special tax break to the Wall Street fat cats,\u201d Mr. Pataki said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say I\u2019m with Donald Trump on anything, but on this issue, I agree with him.\u201dDisagreeing with Mr. Trump were the Republican presidential candidates Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who said he opposed \u201cchanging the incentives for investment and risk-taking,\u201d and Ben Carson, who suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal smacked of socialism.The same day as the debate, Mr. Obama approvingly cited the opposition of Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush to the carried-interest loophole in his remarks to an audience of corporate executives at a Business Roundtable meeting. \u201cKeeping this tax loophole, which leads to folks who are doing very well paying lower rates than their secretaries, is not in any demonstrable way improving our economy,\u201d he said, echoing a theme of the billionaire Warren E. Buffett.On Thursday, Senate Democrats including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, once a behind-the-scenes protector of the tax break, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called on Republicans to support ending it as part of a budget compromise that would allow caps on military and domestic spending to be lifted.Mr. Ellis said the real goal of Democrats was to end tax breaks for capital gains altogether. \u201cThis is the tip of the spear, the camel\u2019s nose under the tent, whatever metaphor you want to use,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a huge problem for conservatives,\u201d many of whom want no taxes on investors\u2019 capital gains.Such defenders of the break, however, could take heart that the Republican chairmen of Congress\u2019s tax-writing committees have no intention of taking up carried interest anytime soon.\u201cThis is an issue that should be considered only in the context of comprehensive tax reform, and until then, nothing is ruled in or out,\u201d said Brendan Buck, spokesman for Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin at the House Ways and Means Committee.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is also holding out for a broad overhaul of the tax code that would end myriad tax breaks so ordinary income tax rates could be lowered. Doing that, he said, \u201cwould be a simpler and more effective way to alleviate concerns that some might have.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a campaign to retain the carried-interest tax break, which benefits mostly hedge fund and private equity executives, misstated the number of lobbyists at the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, which has been lobbying Congress on behalf of the tax break.

Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own economic policies were taking a toll, too, officials concede.Now, an economic crisis is unleashing a withering national exploration of how Brazil squandered its hard-won success.\u201cWe were putting off our date with reality,\u201d Carlos Langoni, a former chief of Brazil\u2019s central bank, told reporters after the downgrade. \u201cNow is the time to do it.\u201d\u201cThe Brazilian model celebrated just a few years ago is turning into a slow-motion train wreck,\u201d said Mansueto Almeida, a prominent commentator on economic policy. \u201cOur political leaders want to point fingers at China or some external villain, but they cannot escape the fact that this self-inflicted crisis was made in Brazil.\u201dBrazil eked out just 0.1 percent growth in 2014. The economy is expected to shrink almost 3 percent this year. For 2016, economists are forecasting no growth at all or yet another recession.As Ms. Rousseff\u2019s administration and the opposition bicker over austerity measures, the crisis is casting attention on striking levels of corruption, flawed decisions and a gargantuan public bureaucracy denounced as wasteful and inept.But the economic crisis is now curbing Brazil\u2019s ambitions at home and abroad, and its leaders are struggling to mend policies that helped expose Latin America\u2019s largest country to its worst slump in decades.Many economists argue that Brazil\u2019s troubles have their origins in a series of policy shifts that Ms. Rousseff pursued once it became clear that the economy was slowing after a burst of 7.6 percent growth in 2010, the fastest rate in more than two decades.Hoping to prevent Brazil from cooling too much after the sizzling boom of the previous decade, Ms. Rousseff, 67, a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured during the military dictatorship in the 1970s and took office in 2011, doubled down on bets that she could stave off a severe slowdown by harnessing a web of government-controlled banks and energy companies.Ms. Rousseff pressured the central bank to reduce interest rates, fueling a credit spree among overstretched consumers who are now struggling to repay loans. She cut taxes for certain domestic industries and imposed price controls on gasoline and electricity, creating huge losses at public energy companies.Going further, she expanded the sway of Brazil\u2019s colossal national development bank, whose lending portfolio already dwarfed that of the World Bank. Drawing funds from the national treasury, the bank, known as the B.N.D.E.S., increased taxpayer-subsidized loans to large corporations at rates that were often significantly lower than those individuals could obtain from their banks.Ms. Rousseff\u2019s critics argue that she also began using funds from giant government banks to cover budget shortfalls as she and her leftist Workers\u2019 Party headed into elections.Some critics contend that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s missteps were not only tactical but also ideological in nature. Like her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, she and the Workers\u2019 Party pursued a model that enhanced the government\u2019s clout in the economy, especially in industries like oil and banking. While the strategy seemed to work for a while, early warnings about its durability went unheeded.\u201cOur leaders wanted to find the formula to increase their power and remain in office, even if this meant intensifying mediocrity in an economy,\u201d said Reinaldo Gon\u00e7alves, an economist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and a former adviser on economic matters to the Workers\u2019 Party.But supporters of Ms. Rousseff contend that Brazil remains on stronger financial footing than in the past, ruling out the need to request emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. Indeed, Brazil remains a net creditor after amassing large holdings of United States Treasury bonds; the central bank guards about $370 billion of foreign currency reserves.Jos\u00e9 Guimar\u00e3es, a congressman from the Workers\u2019 Party, attacked Standard & Poor\u2019s after the downgrade, calling it an \u201cagency from the end of the world.\u201d\u201cThis downgrade won\u2019t diminish the government\u2019s spirit to find solutions for balancing the Brazilian economy,\u201d he said.Still, Ms. Rousseff is facing fierce criticism as she tries to unwind some of the policies she promoted in her first term. While energy prices are falling in much of the world, they are soaring in Brazil as the government loosens its price controls. Residential electricity rates alone have surged more than 40 percent this year as the authorities try to recoup losses at public electricity companies.The economic and political crises swirling around Ms. Rousseff are now feeding one another. A ruling against Ms. Rousseff by the federal accounts court could open the way for the impeachment proceedings her opponents have been pushing for.\u201cWe are paying the price in Brazil for the government\u2019s mistakes over the previous decade,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Nassif, an economist at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, an elite Brazilian university.\u201cEverything is trash today, and I have no idea if I\u2019ll find a job when I graduate,\u201d said Daiane Andrade, 21, a business student in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cUnemployment and inflation are rising. Just when you think it can\u2019t get worse, it does.\u201d\u201cHow can a person who is 52 years old be able to retire with a pension?\u201d Luiz Fernando Figueiredo, a former central bank official, asked reporters. \u201cThese things have to be confronted. If not, the country will become another Greece.\u201dParts of Brazil\u2019s business establishment are in revolt, openly expressing disdain. Exame, a leading business magazine, devotes an entire section called \u201cOnly in Brazil\u201d to documenting problems with the public bureaucracy.\u201cBrazilians kept on dancing even though the music had stopped,\u201d said Norman Gall, director of the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cNow, they are scared.\u201dAn article on Sept. 11 about Brazil\u2019s national reckoning with the missteps that turned an economic boom into a crisis misstated the age of President Dilma Rousseff. She is 67, not 66.Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labour\u2019s Dead Center", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeremy Corbyn, a long-time leftist dissident, has won a stunning victory in the contest for leadership of Britain\u2019s Labour Party. Political pundits say that this means doom for Labour\u2019s electoral prospects; they could be right, although I\u2019m not the only person wondering why commentators who completely failed to predict the Corbyn phenomenon have so much confidence in their analyses of what it means.But I won\u2019t try to get into that game. What I want to do instead is talk about one crucial piece of background to the Corbyn surge \u2014 the implosion of Labour\u2019s moderates. On economic policy, in particular, the striking thing about the leadership contest was that every candidate other than Mr. Corbyn essentially supported the Conservative government\u2019s austerity policies.In the British case, the false accusations against Labour involve fiscal policy, specifically claims that the Labour governments that ruled Britain from 1997 to 2010 spent far beyond their means, creating a deficit and debt crisis that caused the broader economic crisis. The fiscal crisis, in turn, supposedly left no alternative to severe cuts in spending, especially spending that helps the poor.These claims have, one must admit, been picked up and echoed by almost all British news media. It\u2019s not just that the media have failed to subject Conservative claims to hard scrutiny, they have reported them as facts. It has been an amazing thing to watch \u2014 because every piece of this conventional narrative is completely false.In short, the whole narrative about Labour\u2019s culpability for the economic crisis and the urgency of austerity is nonsense. But it is nonsense that was consistently reported by British media as fact. And all of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s rivals for Labour leadership bought fully into that conventional nonsense, in effect accepting the Conservative case that their party did a terrible job of managing the economy, which simply isn\u2019t true. So as I said, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s triumph isn\u2019t that surprising given the determination of moderate Labour politicians to accept false claims about past malfeasance.This still leaves the question of why Labour\u2019s moderates have been so hapless. Consider the contrast with the United States, where deficit scolds dominated Beltway discourse in 2010-2011 but never managed to dictate the terms of political debate, and where mainstream Democrats no longer sound like Republicans-lite. Part of the answer is that the U.S. news media haven\u2019t been as committed to fiscal fantasies, although that just pushes the question back a step.Beyond that, however, Labour\u2019s political establishment seems to lack all conviction, for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand. And this means that the Corbyn upset isn\u2019t about a sudden left turn on the part of Labour supporters. It\u2019s mainly about the strange, sad moral and intellectual collapse of Labour moderates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Venezuelan in Silicon Valley Finds a Niche in Finance", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Jonathan Gheller went from selling teque\u00f1os, a Venezuelan fried, cheese-filled appetizer, in Caracas to building a company that he sold to Facebook. Now, working at its placid Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, he credits mostly one person for his change in fortune.Both feel indebted to Meyer Malka, 41, a Venezuelan known as Micky. In 2012 he formed the venture capital firm Ribbit Capital here. Since then, he has become a rising force in Silicon Valley and one of the few Latin Americans to crack its upper echelon.In March, Mr. Malka said, Ribbit raised its third fund, totaling $226 million, nearly twice the size of its second fund, which closed just one year earlier. In just over three years, Ribbit has secured $446 million, the fourth-largest amount raised among all United States-based venture capital firms started since 2012, according to the research firm Preqin.Among Ribbit\u2019s investors are marquee Silicon Valley names: SVB Capital, Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s fund of funds group; Sequoia Heritage; and Iconiq Capital, the secretive personal wealth management group whose clients include Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Reid Hoffman, a LinkedIn founder. Ribbit\u2019s funds also count individual backers, including David Lawee of Google Capital and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.Mr. Malka\u2019s rise has benefited many Latin American entrepreneurs who have long struggled to gain a foothold here. The explanation for his own ascent is that the fintech sector is now in vogue. Mr. Malka bet on the field when few others did, and in an uncommon way, by dedicating an entire venture capital firm to it. That won him respect from start-up founders, no matter their nationality.\u201cHe\u2019s the first person I call when I need feedback,\u201d said Mr. Lin of Credit Karma.Growing up in Venezuela, Mr. Malka knew few people he could phone for advice. The country\u2019s economy and society, rich and poor, depend heavily on petrodollars. Yet he started thinking about finance and entrepreneurship as a boy, buying shares of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with his bar mitzvah money.At 18, he began attending Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholders meeting in Omaha. Around then, he founded Heptagon Grupo Financiero, a financial brokerage firm. Heptagon was acquired in 1999 by the Argentine start-up Patagon, founded by Wences Casares, who took Mr. Malka on board.In 2000, just before the dot-com crash, Banco Santander acquired Patagon for $750 million and the two men then started other companies together. But Mr. Malka had not yet succeeded in Silicon Valley, so he moved there in 2007 to build another company with Mr. Casares: Bling Nation, a mobile payments company.That would be a devastating time in his life. The day he obtained his visa from the United States Embassy in Caracas, his father was found to have brain cancer. His wife was pregnant at that time, and the couple wanted to leave Venezuela, concerned about the management of the country by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, then the president.After moving, Mr. Malka flew back to Caracas every other week until his father died in 2008. Meanwhile, in Palo Alto, Bling Nation struggled, and in 2011 the partners called it quits. \u201cIt was the first time I had failed,\u201d Mr. Malka recounted. He was emotionally spent.He took a full year to decide what to do next, but becoming a full-time investor made sense. He had already invested in numerous companies over the years.For example, Mr. Gheller started an Internet company, FashMatch, but it almost went bankrupt. That was until he sought advice from Mr. Malka at a Caracas cafe in 2007 and received a check on the spot. One condition was that Mr. Gheller move to Silicon Valley. FashMatch survived; in 2009 it was sold to Like.com, a company based in San Mateo, Calif., and Mr. Malka made money. Google acquired Like.com the following year.When Mr. Gheller founded his next company, Storylane, the one Facebook would acquire in 2013, he had a much easier time, raising a seed round in four days. By then he lived in the Bay Area.Silicon Valley often claims to be a meritocracy drawing the world\u2019s finest, and there is some truth to that. Immigrants from India and China have a rich five-decade-plus history there, having staffed Fairchild Semiconductor and Hewlett-Packard.Latin America, however, has not had such a presence. Among the top 20 United States-based venture capital firms, based on total funds raised in the last 10 years, according to Preqin, not one has a founding partner from the region.Jean Paul Jacob, a Brazilian engineer and respected futurist, joined IBM\u2019s Research Laboratory in San Jose in 1962. More recently, Ariel Poler, born in Venezuela, has been an influential angel investor in San Francisco and was an early backer of Odeo, out of which grew Twitter. That started to change a few years ago, he said. Still, even today, Latin American professionals have not immigrated here in large numbers. Mr. Malka certainly had reasons to pack his bags after Bling Nation failed. \u201cHe became very anxious whether he was doing the right thing,\u201d said Mr. Casares, who remains close to him. Forming a sector-specific fund was risky \u2014 they remain rare in Silicon Valley. But one in fintech made sense to him.Today, his instinct seems to be paying off. Ribbit\u2019s first fund, based on current valuations, would return six and a half times multiples on cash, according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm.The firm has now backed 27 companies, largely in the United States, including Coinbase and LendingHome. But it continues to be bullish on large emerging markets including Brazil, where last month it backed a S\u00e3o Paulo-based start-up, GuiaBolso.Still, it may still be premature to evaluate Ribbit. None of its companies have had exits. The firm is young. It has missed deals, such as one on TransferWise, based in London, which aims to provide a cheaper alternative to transfer money overseas.That was embarrassing, Mr. Malka admitted. He had cited the company as an example of the kind of investments Ribbit would make when he pitched its first fund to investors. But when the financing round happened, \u201cI was too much of a rookie,\u201d he said.\u201cIf he was not disciplined,\u201d said Greg Waldorf, former chief executive of eHarmony and an individual investor in all three Ribbit funds, the first Ribbit fund \u201cwould have become solely the Bitcoin fund, which it was not.\u201dJust four of the 12 companies from that fund are Bitcoin companies. Ribbit has not backed a new Bitcoin company in about 12 months, yet Mr. Malka remains optimistic, citing Bitcoin\u2019s evolution outside the United States, which he believes is more crucial. \u201cFrom a business perspective, I am more encouraged by what has happened over the last 12 months,\u201d he said.Ribbit\u2019s investors over all seem pleased with Mr. Malka. Irwin Gross, chief operating officer of Sequoia Heritage, said that while \u201cit is still early, he has done exactly or pretty close to what he said he would do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Art of \u2018Farecasting\u2019 the Lowest Airfare", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayWhat\u2019s the easiest way to get the lowest airfare?A handful of new and updated websites and apps are trying to perfect the art of what\u2019s known as farecasting \u2014 predicting the best date to buy a ticket. Distinct from flight-booking sites like Hotwire, farecasting tools such as Flyr, Skypicker, Hopper, and Kayak advise travelers on whether to buy now or later. I\u2019m also including Google Flights, which allows travelers to see if they can save money by departing days or weeks later, or by flying into or out of a different airport.The sites and apps are free. And in most cases, users are instructed to book through the airline, or airlines if they decide to buy a \u201chacker fare\u201d (more on that shortly).Google Flights is also my top pick because it makes searching for premium economy, business and first class fares simpler than most of its competitors, thanks to a drop-down menu on its landing page. Enter your dates, click on the fare class menu, and you\u2019ll see the lowest price for each class. A recent search for an October flight from New York to San Francisco showed the lowest economy fare as $337. For premium economy it was $737, and for business and first class it was $982. A \u201ctip\u201d at the top of the page said I could knock $208 off the business-class fare by leaving a day later and returning two days later.A few caveats: Hopper doesn\u2019t turn up flights by American Airlines and US Airways (they don\u2019t share flight data with Hopper), so you can\u2019t one-stop shop. And because the app is focused on the lowest price, it\u2019s not ideal if you primarily search for premium economy, business or first class seats.That said, the app is intuitive to use. I selected my departure and arrival airports and up popped color-coded fare calendars. Green dates had the best deals from New York to San Francisco ($325) and red dates had the most costly fares ($750). A summary noted that good deals for nonstop flights started around $350; flights with stops averaged about $50 less.When I selected my October dates, the app said the lowest round-trip fare was $341. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a great price,\u201d the app noted, \u201cbut you will likely pay more if you wait.\u201d (A price prediction scale said fares were expected to climb at least $195 after Oct. 4.) Under \u201ctips,\u201d the app said that if I changed my return date by one day, I could save $31; or $20 if I flew into Oakland instead of San Francisco International.If you\u2019re not ready to buy, or if the app says the fare is likely to fall, click \u201cwatch this trip\u201d to receive fare alerts. Last month Hopper introduced QuickTap Booking, which allows travelers who use the \u201cwatch this trip\u201d feature to book their flight within the app, something most competitors do not offer. Book this way and you receive a confirmation number to use on the airline\u2019s website or app to manage your frequent flier status, select your seat and purchase upgrades and priority access. If, however, you want to know where you\u2019re sitting before you buy (I do), book directly with the airline.For those who like to get creative, some farecasting tools encourage users to combine flights from different airlines.One thing that distinguishes Flyr is that it allows undecided users to temporarily lock in a fare with no commitment to purchase the ticket (the few bucks you pay to lock in the fare are nonrefundable). That\u2019s helpful. Flyr will refund you up to $200 if your fare increases in that period and let you keep the lower price if the fare goes down. Note though that in some of my searches it was cheaper to lock in the fare directly on the airline\u2019s website. For instance, to hold the same United round-trip flight for seven days was $11 on Flyr and $8.99 on United.com. Lock in the fare through the airline\u2019s site and if the price goes up, you\u2019ve already secured the lower fare. If it goes down, you don\u2019t have to buy the ticket you\u2019re holding. Just book a new one at the lower price.Still, if, like me, you enjoy airfare hunting, it\u2019s probably worth revisiting Flyr when it has matured.Whatever farecasting tool you try, check the number of stops, time between connections, and trip duration (flights that are normally two hours can become 20 hours with layovers on some sites). No fare is a deal if you have to sprint through an airport only to miss the next leg of your trip, or spend more time flying from coast to coast than to Asia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Otto P\u00e9rez Molina of Guatemala Is Jailed Hours After Resigning Presidency", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUATEMALA CITY \u2014 Just hours after tendering his resignation as president of Guatemala, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina was sent to jail to await the conclusion of a hearing examining his role in a multimillion-dollar customs fraud case that has shaken the nation and sent reverberations throughout the region.For much of Guatemala\u2019s violent history, marked by dictatorship and military repression, such a scene would have been unimaginable: a president forced to resign, then sit in open court to hear charges leveled against him and ultimately spend the night in a prison he once might have overseen as a top general. All that in the course of a single day. In the courtroom on Thursday, he listened calmly while prosecutors played wiretap recordings that they said implicated him as the leader of a vast fraud ring. His face arranged in a look of alert composure, the now former president took notes as more than six hours of recordings played before judges, lawyers and the news media. Afterward, he paused to speak with reporters, proclaiming his innocence and pledging to face the allegations.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to listen but another thing to investigate,\u201d he said, referring to the long day of taped conversations. \u201cAll Guatemalans have to respect the law, and I assure you I will respect the law and this process.\u201dWhen Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina left the courtroom, he passed a series of cells filled with those accused of being gang members and others facing their own hearings. Some of them began catcalling, whistling, throwing up gang signs and shouting threats. He maintained the composure he had held during the hearing.Outside, a modest but jubilant crowd filled the city\u2019s central plaza, the nerve center of the protest movement that began five months ago. A throng of vendors sold protest paraphernalia, hawking whistles, masks and Guatemalan flags for about $5. As a sporadic rain fell, the crowd passed the time the same way it had for months, with drums, chants and blaring whistles.The difference on Thursday was that the noise was characterized by celebration, not the outrage that had fueled it for months. The protesters\u2019 goal of bringing down the president accomplished, the tenor was easygoing, even among the police. Where before hundreds of officers lined the perimeter of the plaza, on high alert, the contingent there on Thursday appeared relaxed, even relieved, at the events transpiring before them. \u201cThe powerful of this country never bothered to lift people from the street,\u201d said Cifuentes Arreaga Sergio, a 20-year veteran of the national civil police, who was stationed along the steps of the hulking Palacio Nacional. Ignoring the occasional explosion of confetti and the cacophony nearby, he betrayed a smile. \u201cThis was the only thing that the power of the state was going to respond to,\u201d he said.Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina was sent to Matamoros prison, which is on a military base in central Guatemala City.His vice president, Alejandro Maldonado, was sworn in as president on Thursday afternoon, after Congress voted to accept the resignation. Mr. Maldonado demanded the resignations of top government officials, though many had already stepped down. His term will end in January, with the inauguration of the winner of elections that were scheduled to begin on Sunday. Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina, 64, is the first president in Guatemalan history to resign over a corruption scandal, experts said, a striking rarity in a country long known for the impunity of its political establishment. And though the economy in Guatemala has lagged compared with those of other countries in Latin America, Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina\u2019s sudden reversal of fortune put it firmly within a wave of efforts elsewhere in the region to make political systems more accountable.His reaction to the protests might itself be a signal of how much Guatemala has entered a new era. Though Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina, who once ran the military\u2019s feared intelligence operation, steadfastly ruled out resignation until the very end, his government never resorted to the sort of harsh measures that characteristically met public dissent.Yet major questions loom. Before the monumental challenge of transitioning from a system of impunity to one more responsive to its people lies a more immediate one: Sunday\u2019s election.Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina\u2019s sudden departure leaves almost no time to enact serious reforms before the transfer of power. And the candidates for president were fielded in a world fundamentally different from the one that Guatemalans awoke to on Thursday.\u201cAt their finest moment, Guatemalans are faced with this really difficult choice between candidates who may not lead to the kinds of changes that people have been fighting for,\u201d said Eric L. Olson, a scholar at the Mexico Institute of the Wilson Center. Not all Guatemalans worried about the next steps. Indeed, the protesters seemed to possess a sort of euphoria marked by the belief that though they did not know their precise location, they were on the road to lasting change.\u201cWe have people with capacity who can lead in these elections,\u201d said Juan Gabon Villanueva, 56. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re corrupt, they will have to change their behavior.\u201dThe political convulsions in Guatemala are part of a broader movement across Latin America, with discontent expressed through widespread protests in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and elsewhere.Protesters reacted initially to the fraud scandal, in which millions of dollars were said to have been siphoned from customs revenue and contracts, but they also expressed deep frustrations over longstanding grievances: hospitals that ran out of medicine, rising crime, and police forces that sometimes did not even have enough fuel to report to crime scenes.The series of inquiries that ignited the public\u2019s rage were the work of an uncommon alliance of local prosecutors and investigators backed by the United Nations, known as the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala or by its Spanish-language acronym, Cicig.Established in 2007 to help expose the ties between criminal networks and politicians, the commission eventually emboldened the nation\u2019s own prosecutors to hold the elite to account, and become a source of inspiration for many Guatemalans. For much of its history, Guatemalan society has been divided, its different constituencies fighting their battles alone. The nation\u2019s indigenous population, which suffered the most under the civil war, which killed about 200,000 people, has long struggled for equal rights with little success.Yet the movement that began in April forged an unprecedented alliance of different groups. Guatemala City\u2019s middle class, long reluctant to speak out, began joining forces with peasant and indigenous groups. Eventually, the nation\u2019s church and business leaders also took the side of the protesters to demand change.None of the candidates in the election had been expected to win 50 percent or more of the vote, making it likely that a runoff, tentatively scheduled for Oct. 25, would be necessary.Protesters, however, have not been happy about their choices. The leading candidate, Manuel Baldiz\u00f3n, a businessman, is widely seen as part of the discredited political system. His vice-presidential candidate faces charges in a separate corruption case, and Mr. Baldiz\u00f3n\u2019s party had maintained a close alliance with Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina and his party.The other leading candidates are Jimmy Morales, a comedian, and Sandra Torres, a former first lady.The disdain for the political options was palpable among protesters who gathered in the rain on Thursday. Some held signs bearing the name of the leading party upside down with a slash through it. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to follow the path created by the institutions that are controlled by the people we are trying to get rid of,\u201d said Javier Gramajo Lopez, an early organizer of the protests. \u201cIf Maldonado doesn\u2019t hear the things we are saying, we will push him out too.\u201d Azam Ahmed reported from Guatemala City, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.

{"Headline": "Carlos Beltran, Once Central to Mets, Is Now a Key Figure for Yankees", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor anyone who was unaware that the Yankees are locked in a playoff race at a point in the season when each pitch carries added gravity, there were a couple of unmistakable signs on Wednesday at Tropicana Field.They both involved Carlos Beltran, the 38-year-old outfielder who has mastered the twin arts of economy of movement and self-preservation.First, Beltran \u2014 on a double by Greg Bird into the right-center-field gap \u2014 did something not often seen this season as he took off from first base. His stride lengthened, his arms pumped and before long Beltran was at a dead run. If he did not quite recall the days when he stole 40 bases in a season, Beltran nevertheless came sprinting, straining and finally sliding into home with an early lead.Next, Beltran helped preserve it by doing something even more scarcely seen. When Logan Forsythe led off the fourth inning by lacing a line drive to right field, Beltran charged forward, left his feet and made a sliding catch.If those plays were enough to stir memories for Yankees fans of what once was for Beltran, his mere presence in right field this weekend at Citi Field is certain to do the same for Mets fans.Beltran was a central figure for the Mets the last time they carried playoff aspirations, from the what-might-have-been 2006 postseason to the stupefying collapses of 2007 and 2008.Though the intracity series has an uncommon spice this season, thanks to the second half of it being played in September for the first time and the status of both teams as playoff contenders, Beltran, like several teammates, said it was just another important moment as the Yankees try to catch Toronto in the American League East.\u201cFor the fans, this type of series are always big and huge,\u201d said Beltran, who like his teammate Chris Young and Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson and reliever Tyler Clippard has played for both teams. \u201cFor us as ballplayers, we concentrate on playing the game. We don\u2019t get caught up on the whole hype.\u201dNow at the tail end of his career, Beltran nearly spent his prime with the Yankees instead of the Mets.As an impending free agent in 2004, Beltran carried the Houston Astros, who had acquired him in midseason, to the brink of the World Series, hitting eight home runs during the playoffs. That performance set Beltran up for a big payday, and the Yankees seemed a likely target \u2014 not just because of their deep pockets but because they had just gone four years without winning a World Series title and were watching their own center fielder, Bernie Williams, start to decline.But while Beltran\u2019s agent at the time, Scott Boras, tried vigorously to engage the Yankees, they had other priorities, such as acquiring starting pitching, which they did with Randy Johnson and Carl Pavano.What will that last game \u2014 that last inning \u2014 look like? World Series triumph in Game 7 on Nov. 4? Misery in the regular-season finale on Oct. 4, against the Nationals?They also wanted to avoid still another hefty luxury tax payment, which they would have incurred by signing Beltran.\u201cWhen you get to be a free agent, you\u2019ve got to put a list of teams that you think you could be able to go \u2014 the Yankees were one of them,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, it\u2019s just the team having the interest in the player. In that case, the Yankees were looking for pitching, so it wasn\u2019t like we got anything close to signing.\u201dSo, Beltran, convinced of the Mets\u2019 aspirations with their previous signing of Pedro Martinez, gladly accepted a seven-year, $119 million contract from them in early 2005.A year later, the Mets, and Beltran, were on the verge of the World Series.He had helped get them there with a strong 2006 season that enabled him to finish fourth in the National League Most Valuable Player Award balloting.Still, it was his bases-loaded strikeout for the final out of Game 7 of the National League Championship Series, a 3-1 loss to St. Louis, that remains in many minds \u2014 as frozen as he was at the plate by Adam Wainwright\u2019s final curveball.And while he had strong Septembers in the Mets\u2019 back-to-back collapses that followed 2006 \u2014 he hit .282 with eight homers and 27 R.B.I. in 2007 and .344 with six homers and 19 R.B.I. in 2008 \u2014 he could not prevent his club from falling apart.In any case, by necessity, his approach to the game is more calculated.After signing a three-year, $45 million contract with the Yankees before last season, Beltran was off to a good start when he tumbled over a wall in a game at Tampa Bay in late April, jamming his shoulder and wrist. Soon after, bone chips in his elbow made it too painful for him to play in the outfield. A series of cortisone shots eased the pain somewhat, but not as much as off-season surgery did.Healthy, he plays the game as if he intends to remain that way.Which means, in the field, he is not close to the Gold Glove center fielder he was for the Mets. But he does remain a formidable middle-of-the-order bat for the Yankees and, after a slow start and a stint on the disabled list in early July with a strained oblique muscle, he has been the Yankees\u2019 most consistent bat over the second half of the season, hitting .320 since July 31.Beltran also delivered possibly the biggest hit for the Yankees this season: a pinch-hit, three-run homer that beat Toronto last month.The Yankees\u2019 hitting coach, Jeff Pentland, who has known Beltran since his early days coming up with Kansas City, said Beltran\u2019s bat speed \u2014 once among the game\u2019s quickest \u2014 had picked up in recent weeks after he tweaked his swing because he was using too much of his upper body.A year ago, Beltran looked broken down, waiting to have surgery, his season and the Yankees\u2019 a great disappointment. Now, his bat is revitalized, and with the Yankees in the pennant race, his legs and his glove may be coming to life, too.It feels good, Beltran acknowledged.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing my job,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Can Airline Passengers Do About Bad Behavior?", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn TransitQ: Do fliers have any recourse when exposed to such bad behavior in the air?If you sense something is not right with your seatmate, what can you do?It depends on how \u201cnot right\u201d it is. The only thing you can do is inform the crew. If it\u2019s reasonably minor, your hope is that there\u2019s a free seat somewhere on plane and they can move you to it. If the plane is full, you can fly in your seat or hope to divert, but the crew will divert only in really serious situations. That\u2019s up to the pilot\u2019s judgment. In any place where it\u2019s not completely full, consult with the crew to change seats. The first incident happened within 30 minutes of landing so there wasn\u2019t going to be somewhere to divert quickly. They were almost there. If it happened early in the flight they could have wound up diverting the flight.How common are indignities of this caliber in-flight?This is very uncommon. There\u2019s no question people behave badly on planes because there are lots of people in a confined space and there are people who behave badly everywhere. So we do see altercations everywhere in the sky, whether it\u2019s the guy who brings the [Knee] Defender on and gets in a fight with person in front of him because he can\u2019t recline his seat. But I\u2019ve also seen bad behavior in premium cabins; it\u2019s not just a function of economy travel.If you are urinated on or in some way your property is damaged by another traveler, can you seek compensation from the airline or were you just unlucky?You were probably just unlucky. As long as it\u2019s not a member of the crew, the airline doesn\u2019t owe you anything. They are not actually at fault. They might offer a good-will gesture because you had a bad experience on their airline and they want to win back your business. You are more likely to get one based on your frequency of travel because they are interested in preserving the relationship. But you\u2019re not likely to have a successful lawsuit against an airline for being urinated on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombian Migrants Are the Scapegoats of Venezuela", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 In just over two years, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has squandered much of the political capital Hugo Ch\u00e1vez built up during his 14 years in office. The dramatic drop in world oil prices last summer has put a dent in the populist generosity of the governing United Socialist Party of Venezuela.The country\u2019s gross domestic product has fallen fast since the first quarter. The inflation rate is in the triple digits \u2014 there is no way of knowing exactly because the figure is no longer published. Homicide numbers have reached record levels. There are chronic shortages of basic goods: chicken, meat, car batteries, antiretroviral drugs.The government is trying to impose rationing, using fingerprint scanners and limiting people to buying certain products only one day per week. To buy diapers you must show your child\u2019s birth certificate.With the economy in free fall and little of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s charisma, Mr. Maduro has struggled to reassert the government\u2019s authority. For a time, he leaned on the armed forces, appointing military officers to executive and diplomatic posts. The ruling party, known by its Spanish initials as the P.S.U.V., has abused its majority in the National Assembly to place party loyalists at the head of watchdog agencies. But neither these measures nor official propaganda and the state\u2019s grip over the media could prevent the government\u2019s popularity from continuing to plummet.Then last month an unexpected opportunity arose: Three Venezuelan military officers in a shantytown near the city of San Antonio in T\u00e1chira state, by the border with Colombia, were ambushed and shot at by two men on a motorcycle. The officers were not killed, and the attackers were not identified, yet within hours Mr. Maduro called the event a paramilitary attack and announced a crackdown on supposed Colombian smugglers and criminals in Venezuela.According to the International Organization for Migration, some 604,000 Colombians were living in Venezuela as of 2012, many of them displaced by war at home years ago or more recently by urban violence and various forms of extortion. (These figures remain the most reliable today since the Venezuelan government often inflates its own.)This is not the first time Colombians have been blamed for our problems; that also happened when crime rose in the 1980s. But Mr. Maduro has taken the scapegoating to unprecedented levels after the ambush in San Antonio last month. The government promptly closed the border crossings in T\u00e1chira. Venezuelan officers began marking the homes of Colombians living in the area, painting the letter \u201cR\u201d (for \u201crequisar\u201d) on houses to be searched and \u201cD\u201d (for \u201cdemoler\u201d) on those slated to be bulldozed. Deportations, ordered with no semblance of due process, followed.The government has deported some 1,400 Colombians in the last month, according to the United Nations \u2014 nearly as many as the total for all of 2014. Over 18,000 Colombians have also left Venezuela on their own initiative. Their fear of being forcibly expelled is stronger than the fear that brought them here in the first place.They have crossed the river that marks the border in some places with whatever they could carry: a mat, a suitcase, a toy truck \u2014 scraps of the lives they were leaving behind. On the other side, their sudden presence has overwhelmed local Colombian authorities and created a humanitarian crisis.In a speech that startled even jaded observers, the senior P.S.U.V. official Jacqueline Far\u00eda, a former information minister, said the Venezuelan government\u2019s emergency measures were meant to protect \u201call those who are legally in our homeland, whether Venezuelan or not,\u201d and that \u201call those who are legally on our soil have their human rights guaranteed.\u201d The implication was that the rights of people not legally in the country would not be guaranteed.President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia has protested that the Colombians being deported are not being shown minimal standards of respect. He and Mr. Maduro have been engaged in a war of words. Mr. Santos has alleged that Venezuelan military aircraft invaded Colombian airspace twice recently; the Venezuelan government has said the allegation is a fabrication.By sealing off the border and cracking down on Colombian migrants, the Venezuelan government is attacking the consequences of its problems rather than their causes. This government controls the entire economy, through minute regulations overseen by a cumbersome bureaucratic system, from the production of goods to their wholesale and distribution. Yet it tries to pass on the blame for its failures.Mr. Maduro claims there have been no fewer than 12 conspiracies to assassinate him. He has resurrected an old territorial conflict with Guyana. He accuses the foreign governments that criticize him of interventionism. After a trial decried for ignoring basic procedural safeguards, the well-known opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez was recently sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for inciting violence during protests last year. And last week Mr. Maduro ordered the closure of yet another long section of the border with Colombia.Colombian migrants are suffering needlessly at the hands of a Venezuelan government desperately trying to save itself by riling up nationalist sentiment.\u201cHow shameful,\u201d I\u2019ve thought to myself this week, while having to stand yet again for hours and hours in long lines outside grocery stores. On most days in Maduro\u2019s Venezuela I can\u2019t find eggs to buy for breakfast, and when I do, I discover that I can no longer afford them.Naky Soto Parra coordinates leadership training for Liderazgo y Vision, a Caracas-based NGO.

But there is good reason to believe that these immigrants will contribute more to Europe economically than they will take from it.Numerous studies have found that immigrants bolster growth by increasing the labor force and consumer demand. Rather than being a drain, immigrants generally pay more in taxes than they claim in government benefits. Even a large influx of immigrants does not mean fewer jobs for the existing population, since economies do not have a finite number of jobs. Immigrants often bring skills with them, and some start new businesses, creating jobs for others. The less skilled often take jobs that are hard to fill, like in child care, for example, which allows more parents to work.Advocating a pro-immigration position has become politically difficult in the West, in large part because opponents have successfully cast newcomers as economic and social burdens. Their false arguments damage economies and the lives of millions of people trying to escape war and poverty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Economy, Crippled by Caution", "Date": "2015-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Visitors to Japan are often surprised by how prosperous it seems. It doesn\u2019t look like a deeply depressed economy. And that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t.Yet Japan is still caught in an economic trap. Persistent deflation has created a society in which people hoard cash, making it hard for policy to respond when bad things happen, which is why the businesspeople I\u2019ve been talking to here are terrified about the possible spillover from China\u2019s troubles.Deflation has also created worrisome \u201cdebt dynamics\u201d: Japan, unlike, say, the United States after World War II, can\u2019t count on growing incomes to make past borrowing irrelevant.So Japan needs to make a decisive break with its deflationary past. You might think this would be easy. But it isn\u2019t: Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, has been making a real effort, but he has yet to achieve decisive success. And the main reason, I\u2019d argue, is the great difficulty policy makers have in breaking with conventional notions of responsibility.Respectability, it turns out, can be an economy-killer, and Japan isn\u2019t the only place where this happens.As I said, you might think that ending deflation is easy. Can\u2019t you just print money? But the question is what do you do with the newly printed money (or, more usually, the bank reserves you\u2019ve just conjured into existence, but let\u2019s call that money-printing for convenience). And that\u2019s where respectability becomes such a problem.When central banks like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan print money, they generally use it to buy government debt. In normal times this starts a chain reaction in the financial system: The sellers of that government debt don\u2019t want to sit on idle cash, so they lend it out, stimulating spending and boosting the real economy. And as the economy heats up, wages and prices should eventually start to rise, solving the problem of deflation.How, then, can policy fight deflation?Well, the answer currently being tried in much of the world is so-called quantitative easing. This involves printing a very large amount of money and using it to buy slightly risky assets, in the hope of doing two things: pushing up asset prices and persuading both investors and consumers that inflation is coming, so they\u2019d better put idle cash to work.What\u2019s remarkable about this record of dubious achievement is that there actually is a surefire way to fight deflation: When you print money, don\u2019t use it to buy assets; use it to buy stuff. That is, run budget deficits paid for with the printing press.Deficit finance can be laundered, if you like, by issuing new debt while the central bank buys up old debt; in economic terms it makes no difference.But nobody is doing the obvious thing. Instead, all around the advanced world governments are engaged in fiscal austerity, dragging their economies down, even as their central banks are trying to pump them up. Mr. Abe has been less conventional than most, but even he set his program back with an ill-advised tax increase.Why? Part of the answer is that demands for austerity serve a political agenda, with panic over the alleged risks of deficits providing an excuse for cuts in social spending. But the biggest reason it\u2019s so hard to fight deflation, I contend, is the curse of conventionality.After all, printing money to pay for stuff sounds irresponsible, because in normal times it is. And no matter how many times some of us try to explain that these are not normal times, that in a depressed, deflationary economy conventional fiscal prudence is dangerous folly, very few policy makers are willing to stick their necks out and break with convention.The result is that seven years after the financial crisis, policy is still crippled by caution. Respectability is killing the world economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money Flows With Refugees, and Life Jackets Fill the Shops", "Date": "2015-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut his fortunes changed this summer when a Turkish smuggler hired him to recruit passengers from among the refugees and migrants flooding into this port city. Soon, his phone was ringing nonstop with people trying to get to Europe, and the cash was pouring in for him \u2014 as much as $4,000 per day.\u201cSome weeks I get nothing,\u201d Mr. Abdul-Hamid, 21, said. \u201cOther times, I\u2019m so busy I can\u2019t keep up.\u201dMr. Abdul-Hamid\u2019s swift success is a small part of the multimillion-dollar shadow economy that has developed in Turkey to profit from the massive human tide rushing toward Europe. Much of this new economy is visible in the streets here, where smugglers solicit refugees, clothing stores display life vests and inner tubes, and tour buses and taxis shuttle passengers to remote launch sites along the coast.Money is flowing through Izmir, the third largest city in Turkey, now a grim hub for migrants and a boom town for residents. Hidden from view is an extensive smuggling infrastructure, with makeshift \u201cinsurance offices\u201d that hold migrants\u2019 money, covert factories that churn out ineffective life vests and underground suppliers of cheap rubber rafts that sometimes pop or capsize during the voyage to Greece, stranding or drowning people at sea.Turkish officials say they strive to stop illegal migration and have detained 57,000 travelers and 107 human traffickers this year. \u201cThe Turkish authorities are doing everything in their power to prevent illegal immigration and related casualties,\u201d an official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity according to government protocol. \u201cInstead of pointing fingers, the international community must develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with the situation in Syria.\u201dBut here in Izmir, the state appears to be standing by as the daily crush of migrants makes its way through town and to the coast to catch rafts to Greece \u2014 an hourlong crossing, if all goes well. International monitors say that while migrants pump cash into the formal economy, the biggest winners are well-organized criminal networks that probably pay off the authorities to look the other way. Migrants and low-level smugglers made similar allegations that the authorities are sometimes paid to let migrants pass.To get here, many of the travelers say they were forced to cash out their lives, selling land, jewelry and heirlooms, hoping that what is ahead will replace what was left behind. In dozens of recent interviews in Turkey and Greece, migrants described going to great lengths to flee \u2014 taking on debt or pooling money from relatives to fund trips. Some came from Iraq and Jordan by plane, while others endured long bus rides from Iran or across Turkey. Still others passed though Lebanon to catch passenger ferries.Once in Turkey, they converge in Izmir, repurposing a struggling tourist infrastructure for the new raft economy.\u201cIt is all about the future,\u201d said Mohammed Khadra, a Palestinian refugee from Damascus who deserted the Syrian Army and fled to Turkey with $470 zipped into the pocket of his track pants. \u201cThere is no life left in Syria.\u201dThousands of migrants flock daily to the Basmane neighborhood, where they clog sidewalks with heavy bags and are often snared by smugglers on arrival.\u201cYou have to decide now; the boats are filling up,\u201d a smuggler told a confused-looking couple with two young children, pressing them to pay as Turkish police officers strolled by. \u201cIt is all safe and secure.\u201dMigrants gather near the Sinbad Restaurant, which is named after a folkloric Arab sailor but now overflows with modern voyagers seeking cheap meals.Nearby hotels that once courted tourists pack in people for $10 a night for spots on the floor. Others sleep on sidewalks or under bridges.Shops do swift business in backpacks and hip packs. One store has men\u2019s suits in one window and a family of mannequins wearing orange life vests in another. An employee who would not give his name said he sold 80 vests a day, for $13 each. Stacks of new life jackets lined the walls of a basement storehouse next door.\u201cThe refugees need these and we are making them available \u2014 in different sizes,\u201d said the woman working in the storehouse, who also refused to give her name.But the abundance of life vests covers one of the city\u2019s dark secrets: many of these items are locally made with cheap materials that leave the migrants vulnerable as they cross the sea. Some of the vests, for example, are made of foam that absorbs water.\u201cWe tell people not to buy the life vests because they\u2019ll sink,\u201d said a Syrian selling inner tubes on the sidewalk, declining to give his name for fear of retribution. \u201cWe tell them to buy inner tubes.\u201dThe largest profits, however, go to powerful Turkish smugglers on the coast who oversee the boats, according to the Syrians they employ and Greek maritime officials who track their activities.To fill their boats while remaining out of sight, they use Syrian \u201cagents\u201d who earn commissions for bringing passengers. Most passengers pay $1,200, and one person selected to pilot each raft rides free. Children go for half price.Most rafts hold 45 passengers, earning the smugglers a total of nearly $60,000. Even after paying commissions, the cost of the boat and motor and bribing officials, smugglers can net more than $30,000 for each successful crossing, according to Syrians involved in the process.To pay their way, passengers deposit their money at makeshift \u201cinsurance offices\u201d and receive a numeric code. Once they reach Europe, they give the code to their agent so he can collect the payment.He can also get the fare if the passenger is gone for three days, meaning that even if the passenger drowned, the smuggler gets paid.While many migrants have reclaimed their money after failed crossings (minus the $50 transaction fee), others lost everything when their agents disappeared.Ibrahim Ali Basha, an accountant from Syria, said he and a friend had rushed to the coast with their families after hearing a widespread rumor that Germany was sending ships to pick up refugees.The news was false, and they ended up in Izmir with only a fraction of the $11,000 needed to get their group to Europe.Out of options, Mr. Basha was trying to sell a kidney to fund the trip. \u201cEveryone is scared to buy,\u201d he said.Over a kebab dinner frequently interrupted by calls from potential clients, he said that besides building his wardrobe and paying his hotel bill, he had used his profits to smuggle two of his brothers out of Syria and into Europe. He planned to send the rest of his family before going himself, he said. \u201cUnless they stop it over there,\u201d he said, gesturing toward Greece, \u201cthe people will keep going.\u201dBoats are the smugglers\u2019 essential tool and they have used a variety in their quest to keep costs down.\u201cThey are taking the lives of these migrants,\u201d said Lado Gvilava, head of the International Organization for Migration in Turkey. \u201cThey drop them in the middle of the ocean, show them some lights and abandon them in the middle of the sea.\u201dMost rafts bear no markings indicating their origin and are so flimsy that many suspect they are made in Turkey specifically for smuggling. \u201cThese boats cannot be used for any other purpose,\u201d Mr. Sofiadelis said. \u201cNot for pleasure, nor fishing \u2014 nothing.\u201dYavuz Savut, who owns a maritime supply store, said he sold about 20 $4,000 rafts a month, making this year his most lucrative ever. He assumed the buyers were smugglers.\u201cIt is a legal business, so we don\u2019t ask people what they are going to do with it,\u201d he said.Nearby, another store had dozens of the same Chinese-made outboard motors used on the rafts stacked on the sidewalk and inside the store. Trucks continually stopped to haul them away.At night, crowds of migrants ready to depart gather in an oceanfront park awaiting directions to launch points from their smugglers. One night, dozens of migrants boarded tour buses parked near the Izmir municipal building. Others left in taxis, vans or trucks.As the sun rose one morning over the Greek island of Lesbos, Malik Al-Saleh, who had left Izmir the night before, stepped from a raft and kissed the sand before turning back to help others off. Mr. Saleh, 21, had fled eastern Syria after it was taken over by the Islamic State and made the trip with his brother, two sisters and their two babies. All knew that some migrants had drowned attempting the journey, but had decided the risk was worth it anyway.\u201cWe had seen the photos, but what else could we do?\u201d he said. \u201cWe are running away from death.\u201dKaram Shoumali contributed reporting from Izmir, and Ceylan Yeginsu from Istanbul.Advertisement"}

And a new hip-hop drama series directed by Baz Luhrmann, \u201cThe Get Down,\u201d recreates the Bronx music scene of the 1970s with an apartment on Shakespeare Avenue, among other Bronx locations. Each of these series appears on Netflix.Cynthia L\u00f3pez, the commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment, said that as more original content is being produced than ever before with the proliferation of entertainment outlets, her office has sought to spread the benefits across the city. \u201cWe want to ensure all five boroughs participate and benefit from the media development in New York City,\u201d she said.In total, the city\u2019s film and television industry directly employs about 130,000 people annually, including producers, sound engineers and makeup artists, and pours billions of dollars into local businesses, from restaurants to dry cleaners, according to the mayor\u2019s office. Sage General Store, a restaurant in Long Island City, Queens, for example, rings up about $1,000 a day in sandwich and salad platters, coffee service and other catering orders for television and film shoots during the week, Leslie Nilsson, the owner, saidMs. L\u00f3pez said that the economic benefits of the entertainment industry have flowed both ways. In addition to tax credits, the city\u2019s Made in NY program offers media productions a discount of at least 10 percent from more than 1,200 local businesses, as well as free advertising on buses, on taxi television screens and in subway stations.\u201cGotham,\u201d which is produced by Warner Bros. Television at Steiner Studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has already proved a boon to the city\u2019s economy. In its first season, the show completed 22 episodes, all in New York. It employed a cast and crew of about 275 people a week, and hired another 2,458 actors as extras, with a total New York payroll of $31 million.The show spent another $24.8 million with local businesses, including $580,000 to a Queens lumberyard for set construction materials and $260,000 for location rentals in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. It also paid $24,000 to a Bronx dry cleaner, $16,000 to a Staten Island coffee supplier, and $94,000 for assorted stationery and forms from Manhattan stores.\u201cWe see there is a serious infusion of resources into the neighborhood, the community, where the production is set,\u201d Ms. L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThat\u2019s one series, one season.\u201dAs for the Bronx, it had little more than a cameo in the first season of \u201cGotham.\u201d Of 127 location shoots in and around the city, only two were in the Bronx. In contrast, 44 were in Manhattan, 36 in Brooklyn, 19 in Queens and eight on Staten Island.Still, the Bronx courthouse was center stage the other day, as the cast and crew spent four hours filming a scene that would run about one and a half minutes on screen. As clouds of artificial smoke blew past the stately columns, the actors took their places around the podium and the cameras rolled.

A skilled construction worker idled by a sour economy \u2014 \u201c99 Homes\u201d seems to take place around 2010, in the recessionary aftermath of the financial crisis \u2014 Dennis (Andrew Garfield) is unable to keep up with his mortgage payments and so loses the modest house where he lives with his mother, Lynn (Laura Dern), and his young son, Connor (Noah Lomax). At the stroke of a pen, their world has come undone, and Mr. Bahrani captures the scene of his dispossession with almost unbearable precision, plunging the viewer into a storm of agonized feeling as Dennis struggles with rage, grief and shame at having been pulled, in front of his neighbors, into the ranks of society\u2019s losers.In contrast, Rick (played with tiger-shark ferocity by Michael Shannon), could conduct a self-help seminar on how to think, act and dress like a winner. With an e-cigarette clenched between his teeth, a pistol strapped to his ankle and a cellphone glued to his ear, Rick may be heartless, but he certainly isn\u2019t dumb. His assessment of the brutalities of the housing market in Central Florida \u2014 and of the Darwinian logic that underlies them \u2014 is hard to dispute. The bubble has burst, and as homeowners like Dennis find themselves underwater, trapped in treacherous and complicated loans, Rick is on hand to clean up the mess, or at least to profit from it. Compassion is for suckers, and one man\u2019s misery is another\u2019s opportunity.He shows up on eviction day, backed up by sheriff\u2019s deputies and bank documents, to tell families that they are now trespassing on property they thought was theirs. The furniture goes out on the sidewalk and the residents enter a spiral of downward mobility. Some plead for more time, others wave papers and invoke lawyers, and a few threaten violence, but the result is always the same. Dennis, Connor and Lynn wind up sharing a room in a motel overflowing with families in similar circumstances. Maybe the game is rigged, or maybe the laws of nature just work that way. It hardly matters to Rick \u2014 or to Dennis, whose passage from Rick\u2019s victim to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 forms the main axis of the film\u2019s narrative.Mr. Bahrani went a bit astray with \u201cAt Any Price,\u201d an overplotted, overacted movie with Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron as a father and son trying to save their family farm. With \u201c99 Homes,\u201d which he wrote with Amir Naderi, Mr. Bahrani has recovered his balance and sharpened his already formidable knack for concise, emotionally potent storytelling. True to its neorealist pedigree, the film works partly as a fable, an illustration of how impersonal forces shape individual human destinies. Its palette of feeling includes a bright streak of anger at the way banks, judges and politicians conspire to bully and bamboozle hard-working people like Dennis, and also at the way the pursuit of wealth has eclipsed all other sources of value in our lives.Mr. Garfield, who was an annoyingly needy Spider-Man, is entirely credible as a man risking his decency to protect himself and his loved ones. When Dennis starts carrying out evictions for Rick, his natural empathy proves to be an asset. He can give predatory capitalism a friendly human face. Mr. Shannon, though, is the film\u2019s center of gravity \u2014 its supernova, its black hole, its avatar of cosmic disorder. Like Michael Douglas in \u201cWall Street\u201d or Alec Baldwin in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d he is the seductive embodiment of capitalist amorality, a handsome devil offering a small amount of cash for your house keys and slightly better terms for your immortal soul.Some of the suspense comes from the realization that Mr. Bahrani has taken a big risk of his own. As Dennis\u2019s inner conflict becomes unbearable, you may start to become aware of the traps \u201c99 Homes\u201d has set for itself, and to anticipate endings that seem too bleak, too soothing or too sensational to fulfill the film\u2019s promise. But the ending, if I may say so without giving anything away, is just right, absolutely consistent with Mr. Bahrani\u2019s acute, impassioned understanding of contemporary American reality. The final shot is at once perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous, a reminder that some contradictions are more easily understood than resolved.\u201c99 Homes\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

{"Headline": "G.O.P. Discord Over Ex-Im Bank Intensifies, as G.E. Shifts Jobs Abroad", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe announcements were certain to reignite Republican infighting over the future of the 81-year-old export credit agency just as Congress was returning from its long summer recess, promising to widen the rift between the party\u2019s pro-business and anti-government wings both on Capitol Hill and in the presidential-nominating race.Antigovernment populists who deride the Ex-Im Bank as \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d or \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d so far have won in Congress, blocking reauthorization of the agency and forcing it since June to stop acting as lender of last resort to the foreign buyers of American-made products, from aircraft to car seats. While pro-bank forces were confounded over how to revive it, they seized on the latest corporate news to try to put their conservative opponents on the defensive and force action.G.E. announced that it would move about 400 jobs to France, whose own export credit agency offered financing for gas turbines, and relocate 100 jobs to Hungary and China to get credit for customers of its advanced aircraft gas turbines. The jobs would shift from New York, Maine, Texas and South Carolina.\u201cWe call on Congress to promptly reauthorize Ex-Im,\u201d said John Rice, the G.E. vice chairman. He called it \u201ca rare government program that supports the economy while cutting the deficit.\u201d\u201cIn a competitive world,\u201d he added, \u201cwe are left with no choice but to invest in non-U.S. manufacturing and move production to countries that support high-tech exporters.\u201dLast month, G.E. dropped Dallas from its short list of contenders to replace Connecticut as its corporate headquarters, a decision Tony Bennett, president and chief executive of the Texas Association of Manufacturers, attributed to \u201cthe political climate that\u2019s been chilled by certain Texas elected officials.\u201dFollowing G.E., Boeing announced on Tuesday that it had lost a bid to sell satellites to a Singapore-based satellite operator, Kacific, because the aerospace giant did not have the backing of a governmental export-credit agency. This news came two months after Boeing similarly lost a contract with Bermuda-based ABS Holding Ltd. and said it would be reducing the work force in its satellite manufacturing business, in part because of uncertainty over the Ex-Im Bank.The developments came as lawmakers drifted back from their long summer recess, and bank advocates searched for a legislative way to reopen the agency. The hope is to add language renewing its charter to one of the many bills Congress must pass this fall, perhaps one to finance the government or a transportation measure. Without renewal, the bank is open only to manage existing credit and insurance business for foreign deals.More than 100 chief executives for corporations who are members of the Business Roundtable arrived in Washington on Tuesday for an annual meeting, a day after the group\u2019s chairman sent congressional leaders a letter urging extension of the export credit agency. On Wednesday the group will meet with President Obama, who, along with most Democrats, supports the bank.On this issue among others \u2014 like funding the government, raising the federal borrowing limit and financing highways \u2014 such business groups have found themselves at odds with traditional Republican allies who increasingly reflect a new populist strain of conservatism in the party that is often hostile toward big business. For decades, the Ex-Im Bank was reauthorized by bipartisan votes, often unanimously.The National Association of Manufacturers recently stopped hosting the fund-raisers at its well-appointed offices that drew business donors for Republicans. Boeing and G.E. have not explicitly vowed to withhold support, but Boeing\u2019s vice president of communications, Gordon Johndroe, a former aide in the George W. Bush administration, said, \u201cIt would be odd for us to hold a fund-raiser or make a large contribution to someone who\u2019s being vocally opposed to an issue of such importance to us.\u201dThe bank\u2019s opponents are \u201cin some cases economically illiterate,\u201d said John Engler, the president of the Business Roundtable and a former Republican governor of Michigan. \u201cI think it\u2019s the antigovernment nature of so many members\u201d elected since the Tea Party\u2019s rise in 2010, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s inexplicable. Texas is the largest beneficiary of the Ex-Im Bank. We had in the last year 3,700 transactions that involved the bank, 164,000 jobs.\u201dMr. Bennett, the head of the manufacturers group in Republican-controlled Texas, said that at all levels of government, \u201cthe ultra-right wing of the party has put a fear factor into our elected officials, and we see some very bizarre behavior, very anti-business behavior and rhetoric out of these folks.\u201dBut on this issue and others, Republican lawmakers face counterpressures from conservative antigovernment groups including Heritage Action, Club for Growth and Charles and David Koch\u2019s Americans for Prosperity, which want to kill the Ex-Im Bank and are ready to finance campaigns against unsupportive Republicans. Many Republicans simply believe uncompromisingly in free-market principles, which they say is antithetical to Ex-Im\u2019s government intervention.Mr. Mulvaney, the congressman from South Carolina, said G.E. should have been able to get a line of credit from private-sector banks rather than the French government. Bank proponents say private institutions often will not or cannot provide assistance to foreign customers, and more than two dozen mostly developing countries require that exporters who bid for sales have the potential backing of an export-credit agency. More than 80 nations have such banks, with China\u2019s by far the largest.Mr. Mulvaney also questioned G.E.\u2019s claim that the bank\u2019s uncertain future forced its move, suggesting that other economic factors in the United States \u2014 corporate taxes, government regulations and tort costs \u2014 could have also driven the decision.\u201cAnytime we lose jobs to countries overseas, it should be cause for us to examine our international competitiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that goes far, far beyond just the Export-Import Bank.\u201dMr. Hensarling, who has counted the bank\u2019s lapse as a major victory for conservatives, was unavailable for comment.While the week\u2019s news put G.E. and Boeing at the center of the debate, bank supporters have tried to focus on small businesses that export to counter the anticorporate strain among Republicans, and demonstrate the bank\u2019s wider impact.\u201cWe need to get this done before we lose any more jobs,\u201d said Representative Stephen Fincher, Republican of Tennessee and the author of legislation resurrecting the bank. \u201cSome of my colleagues are pandering to the outside political groups instead of their constituents.\u201dDemocratic supporters clearly enjoyed the Republican discord but for the fact that they see a real threat to local jobs. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said, \u201cIt\u2019s insane to me that something that works this well, that\u2019s been so bipartisan, is jeopardized to score political points.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hearing on Insurers\u2019 Mergers Exposes Health Care Industry Divide", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies clashed Thursday over the merits of mergers planned by four of the five biggest insurers in the United States.The confrontation came at a hearing of a House Judiciary subcommittee that is investigating competition in the industry and how it would be affected by mergers combining Aetna with Humana and Anthem with Cigna.Daniel T. Durham, an executive vice president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for the industry, told Congress that the consolidation could promote competition and benefit consumers, achieving economies of scale that reduce costs.Moreover, Mr. Durham said, insurers are trying to counter the \u201charmful impact of consolidation among hospitals and other health care providers\u201d and what he called \u201cmonopoly pricing\u201d by makers of some prescription drugs.However, Thomas L. Greaney, an expert on health and antitrust law at St. Louis University, said he was skeptical of the argument that insurers had to merge to counter the market power of hospitals and doctors.Professor Greaney likened giant insurers and hospital systems to sumo wrestlers. \u201cExperience suggests that a showdown between the sumo wrestlers may well result in a handshake rather than an honest wrestling match,\u201d he testified.Even if a dominant insurer succeeds in bargaining successfully with providers, Mr. Greaney said, \u201cit has little incentive to pass along the savings to its policyholders.\u201dWitnesses from the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association harshly criticized the proposed mergers.\u201cThe Anthem-Cigna transaction threatens to reduce competition in at least 817 markets across the United States serving 45 million consumers,\u201d said Richard J. Pollack, the president of the hospital association. Anthem operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in a number of states, and Mr. Pollack said that Anthem\u2019s acquisition of Cigna could \u201cfurther entrench\u201d the dominant position of such Blue plans in many insurance markets.More than 30 percent of the 55 million Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in such private plans, attracted by the promise of extra benefits and lower costs.Mr. Durham, the insurance industry representative, said that hospital mergers often led to substantial increases in hospital prices, and that those increases led to higher premiums.In addition, he said, when hospitals buy physician groups, the doctors tend to charge more.Mr. Pollack challenged those arguments. \u201cThe annual growth in hospital prices has been low and declining,\u201d he said, and hospital clinics face competition from walk-in clinics at CVS, Walgreens and Walmart stores.Dr. Barbara L. McAneny, a trustee of the American Medical Association, said that \u201cthe concentration of market power among a handful of nationwide insurers\u201d could interfere with doctors\u2019 ability to care for patients.The mergers, she said, could threaten the \u201chealth and safety of American patients,\u201d and if the deals are consummated, \u201cthere is simply no going back.\u201dThe Justice Department is reviewing the deals to see if they would violate the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which generally prohibits mergers and acquisitions if the effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition.\u201dAt the hearing Thursday, House members expressed keen interest in the mergers, but their views did not appear to have crystallized into support or opposition.They did split along party lines on a related question: whether the Affordable Care Act was driving consolidation in the insurance and hospital industries.Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the 2010 law \u201cput in place a regulatory structure that stifled competition and instituted incentives for increased market consolidation.\u201dBut Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, said: \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a reaction to, not a cause of, consolidation in the health care marketplace. Waves of consolidation among health care providers and insurers occurred long before the Affordable Care Act.\u201dMr. Johnson said that competition among health plans in the new public insurance markets had held down premiums while increasing the number of choices available to consumers.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who was a federal health official from 2003 to 2007, said, \u201cIn the commercial market for private coverage, there\u2019s been a contraction in the number of carriers offering health plans.\u201d\u201cOnly about 50 new health carriers have entered the commercial market since 2008,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said at the hearing. \u201cHalf of these are the struggling not-for-profit co-op plans that the Affordable Care Act subsidizes. Around 40 health plans have left the market over this same stretch of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Makes Urgent Appeal in Alaska for Climate Change Action", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANCHORAGE \u2014 President Obama on Monday issued a global call for urgent action to address climate change, declaring that the United States was partly to blame for what he called the defining challenge of the century and would rally the world to counter it.\u201cClimate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is happening here, it is happening now,\u201d Mr. Obama said here at an international conference on the Arctic. \u201cWe\u2019re not acting fast enough. I have come here today, as the leader of the world\u2019s largest economy and its second-largest emitter, to say that the United States recognizes our role in creating the problem, and we embrace our responsibility to help solve it.\u201dIn remarks that bordered on the apocalyptic, Mr. Obama warned that the effects of global warming that have hit the Arctic the hardest would soon engulf the world \u2014 submerging entire countries, annihilating cities and leaving fields barren \u2014 unless more was done to reduce emissions. Four times in a 24-minute speech, he repeated his assertion that \u201cwe\u2019re not acting fast enough.\u201d The president spoke at the beginning of a three-day Alaska trip choreographed to lend vivid visual justification \u2014 in the form of receding glaciers, eroded shorelines and rising seas \u2014 to his drive for an international accord to reduce heat-trapping emissions leading up to a United Nations summit meeting in Paris in December.Mr. Obama has pledged that the United States will cut emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by 2025. After winning a similar pledge last year from China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the president hopes to reach what Secretary of State John Kerry, the host of the conference, called \u201ca truly ambitious and truly global climate agreement.\u201d \u201cThis year, in Paris,\u201d the president said, \u201chas to be the year that the world finally reaches an agreement to protect the one planet that we\u2019ve got while we still can.\u201d Mr. Obama wants his fight against climate change to be a central piece of his legacy, and he planned this week\u2019s journey with history in mind.He will hike Exit Glacier in the Kenai Mountains of southern Alaska on Tuesday and tour it by boat, meeting up along the way with Bear Grylls, the wilderness survivalist, to tape a segment for his NBC program, \u201cRunning Wild With Bear Grylls.\u201d On Wednesday, the president will meet with fishermen in Dillingham, known as the salmon capital of the world, and travel to Kotzebue, above the Arctic Circle, in a region where climate change has contributed to coastal erosion that is causing villages to crumble. On Monday, Mr. Obama offered no new proposals in his speech to foreign ministers at a convention center in downtown Anchorage, nor did he address the contradictions in choosing Arctic Alaska, where he has just approved offshore oil drilling by Royal Dutch Shell, for his call to action on the climate.Protesters lined the streets outside the conference center on Monday, holding a yellow flag with Shell\u2019s logo that said \u201cHell, no!\u201d along with a giant banner that said \u201cSave the Arctic.\u201d In a state that is heavily dependent on oil revenue, the issue is divisive, with environmental activists opposing Arctic drilling but many residents and officials saying it is a matter of survival.In his speech, Mr. Obama defended his record on climate change and laid out his case for the stringent carbon emissions rules he announced in August.\u201cWe are working hard to do our part to meet this challenge, and in doing so, we\u2019re proving that there doesn\u2019t have to be a conflict between a sound environment and strong economic growth,\u201d Mr. Obama said, taking on an argument often cited by industry leaders and opponents of pollution limits.And he offered scathing criticism of those who question the need for such measures or deny the science behind them, making an implicit dig at Republican presidential candidates. \u201cThose who want to ignore the science, they are increasingly alone,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re on their own shrinking island.\u201dHe also challenged what he suggested was complacency by ordinary citizens who fear they could be deprived of creature comforts. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest; there\u2019s always been an argument against taking action,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our lifestyles disrupted. The irony, of course, is that few things will disrupt our lives as profoundly as climate change.\u201dIn a particularly striking warning, Mr. Kerry said in a speech earlier on Monday that climate change \u2014 reflected by what he called \u201cseismic changes\u201d in temperatures and sea levels \u2014 could soon create waves of new refugees forced to abandon traditional homes or to fight for food and water.\u201cYou think migration is a challenge to Europe today because of extremism, wait until you see what happens when there\u2019s an absence of water, an absence of food or one tribe fighting against another for mere survival,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.He compared the scale of the challenge to World War II, when \u201call of Europe was overrun by evil and civilization itself seemed to be in peril,\u201d and said world leaders needed to rise to the occasion to address it.The conference \u2014 and Mr. Obama\u2019s visit \u2014 reflect a growing focus on the Arctic as the changing climate creates economic opportunities but also intensifies threats to the environment, to infrastructure and to old ways of life for the four million people who live above the Arctic Circle. The United States and many of the nations represented issued a joint statement on Monday afternoon reiterating promises to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane, and of the soot, or black carbon, from industry, automobiles and open fires. China and India did not sign the statement.Mr. Kerry was accompanied by Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and the White House\u2019s director of science and technology, John P. Holdren. Dr. Holdren presented a bleak, dispassionate report on diminished glaciers, melting permafrost, rising sea levels and the spread of wildfires that, he said, had already burned 31 million acres this year in Alaska, Canada and Russia.\u201cFires are now occurring in the tundra, which didn\u2019t used to happen,\u201d he said.If emissions are not reduced, Dr. Holdren said, temperatures could rise seven degrees, far above the threshold at which scientists predict drastic and potentially deadly consequences.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Desperate Crossing", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "\nIN THE CLOUDLESS EARLY HOURS OF JULY 27, two tiny fishing boats drifted across the Mediterranean Sea. Crammed aboard were 733 would-be migrants, including 59 children under the age of 5. Most were from the impoverished and despotically ruled northeast African nation of Eritrea.They carried with them only biscuits and some plastic bottles of water, and few of them knew how to swim. None wore life jackets. They had pushed off from the Libyan shore at about midnight, along with a third boat that was now missing. Their destination was the Italian island of Sicily, 300 miles away.Most of the migrants had no idea how long their journey might last, though a few had been told by their smugglers that they could expect to reach Italy in six to eight hours. In reality, at the boats\u2019 current speed, such a voyage would take at least six days, long past the point when almost all those onboard would have perished from dehydration or exposure. For the crossing, the migrants paid an average of $1,500.These 733 passengers were only the latest participants in a deadly drama that has been unfolding in the Mediterranean this year. After a decade of steady escalation, the flood of migrants into Europe has now reached a crisis point, with at least a quarter-million making the journey so far this summer. Most have sought to escape the poverty of sub-Saharan Africa or the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and their two principal entry points are Italy and Greece.By far the most perilous route is the Libya-Italy sea crossing, where more than 2,500 people have perished since March. In the worst incident, in late April, a grotesquely overladen fishing trawler capsized and sank within sight of a rescue ship; of the estimated 800 migrants aboard, only 28 were saved.Largely in response to that tragedy, a handful of rescue vessels \u2014 notably those operated by the medical-relief organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (M.S.F.) \u2014 now patrol the waters off Libya in hopes of intercepting the boats.SPAINBULGARIACORSICABarcelonaMACEDONIAITALYALBANIANaplesSARDINIAGREECEMediterraneanSeaReggio CalabriaAlgiersSICILYTunis30400MALTATUNISIA794ALGERIAM.S.F. rescue siteDarnah200TripoliMisurataBenghaziSurtLIBYA100 milesBULGARIACORSICABarcelonaMACEDONIAITALYALBANIANaplesSARDINIAGREECEMediterraneanSeaReggio CalabriaAlgiersSICILYTunis400MALTATUNISIA794ALGERIAM.S.F. rescue siteDarnah200TripoliBenghaziSurtLIBYA200 milesCORSICAITALYALBANIANaplesSARDINIAGREECEMediterraneanSeaReggio CalabriaSICILYTunis400MALTATUNISIA794M.S.F. rescue siteTripoliBenghaziSurtLIBYA200 milesITALYCORSICASARDINIAReggio CalabriaSICILYTunis400TUNISIA794240M.S.F. rescue siteTripoliLIBYA200 milesFor those attempting this crossing, the perils begin long before they get on the boats. The very lawlessness that has made Libya a smugglers\u2019 haven also means the migrants are prey to the rival criminal bands and tribal militias that now roam the nation. Many of those on the fishing boats had their personal Libyan horror stories: rape, torture, kidnappings that ended only when their families back home wired whatever money was left to cover their ransom. In their desperation to escape, even the risk of dying at sea seemed a better alternative.For this voyage, the smugglers squeezed dozens of passengers down into the boats\u2019 four-foot holds, where they could only lie flat as even more passengers were forced in on top of them.Those who are not Muslim are especially vulnerable. In Libya, Nuhami Kidane, 26, was refused medical treatment after a car accident when doctors noticed the rosary tattoo on her hand. Kidane, who asked that her face be concealed to protect her family, hoped to reach England and earn a nursing degree. \u2018\u2018I can read, I can write and I\u2019m very smart,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018There is nothing left in Eritrea, so this is why I made the journey.\u2019\u2019 Her hopes sank, however, as the sun rose higher.\u2018\u2018When I saw there was nothing around us,\u2019\u2019 she recalled, \u2018\u2018I thought, O.K., we are finished, this is all ending now.\u2019\u2019It had been six hours since the migrants first set off. Food and water were running out, and soon the situation grew even worse. From down in the hold came cries that the boat was beginning to leak.At 9 a.m., the migrants saw a ship in the distance and began to wave their arms frantically. An hour later, a small rigid-hulled inflatable boat, or RIB, approached. It made a series of slow passes around the two fishing boats for 20 minutes while a man onboard used a bullhorn to address the migrants in English and Arabic. Stay calm, he said. You are about to be rescued.The RIB had been launched from the Bourbon Argos, a retrofitted offshore supply ship chartered by M.S.F., which rushed to the area after receiving a distress call about the fishing boats. The crew on the RIB was to play a crucial crowd-control role in the delicate operation about to ensue, one designed to avoid a repeat of a tragedy that occurred several weeks earlier, when the M.S.F. team was rescuing migrants aboard an inflatable raft. The sudden collapse of a pontoon had triggered a rush for the Argos; as the M.S.F. team watched helplessly, at least three migrants swiftly disappeared beneath the surface.Today, all went smoothly. Over the course of 90 minutes, the M.S.F. team and the crew of the Argos methodically evacuated all the migrants aboard the two fishing boats, including one man suffering from delirium, who had to be removed on a stretcher.When the fishing boats were fully evacuated, crew members from the Argos removed the boats\u2019 engines and spray-painted messages on the decks saying that a rescue had been conducted. Cast adrift, the boats would later be destroyed by patrolling European naval vessels to prevent smugglers from reusing them.Safely onboard the Argos, the migrants hung their wet clothes to dry, drank fresh water and ate high-protein biscuits. In the afternoon, an M.S.F. staff member delivered some welcome news through a bullhorn: The missing third boat had been found, and its passengers, most of whom were also Eritrean, were now on a different rescue vessel. The report brought joyful embraces and a scattering of applause among those on the deck of the Argos. That evening, a Christian priest led the crowd in an exuberant two-hour service.The rescue was a success, but it also pointed to the increasingly perverse symbiotic relationship that has developed among migrants, smugglers and saviors. As rescue operations in the Mediterranean become more coordinated, it may encourage more migrants to attempt the journey, further enriching the smugglers in Libya.It was almost certainly the smugglers themselves who placed the distress call about the overladen fishing boats, and they have increasingly taken to telling their victims that, rather than Italy, it is a rescue ship that they will reach in a short time. Some on the fishing boats had been told precisely the same story.Now friends and family members separated between the two boats had found one another again. The stories they told were harrowing. Along with 26 other Eritrean Christians, Hagos Kibrom, 37, had been held for the past three weeks by two different groups of kidnappers in Libya, who beat and starved their prisoners while awaiting the delivery of ransom money \u2014 an additional $3,000 in Kibrom\u2019s case \u2014 from relatives back in Eritrea.\"Now I have no choice,\u201d Kibrom said. \u201cI have to find my way in Europe, or my family is ruined.\u201dThe Argos, now filled to capacity, turned back toward the Italian mainland, some 40 hours away.Once the excitement and euphoria of their rescue wore off, many of those on her decks fell into exhausted slumber. Others gathered in small groups to talk late into the night of their hopes and dreams upon finally reaching Europe: to go to university, to find good jobs, to bring their families to their new homes.In fact, the migrants would have very little chance of seeing their dreams realized. Barred from legally working while their petitions for asylum are processed \u2014 a process that, in most European nations, takes years \u2014 most will disappear into the Continent\u2019s growing migrant ghettos, where they will struggle to find work in economies that have little need for them, and will live at the margins of societies that increasingly resent their presence. The growth in the migrant population has spurred a hostile reaction across Europe, ranging from restrictive laws and border fences to, ever more frequently, physical attacks.For now, though, that all lay ahead. Before dawn on July 29, 54 hours after the migrants left Libya, the Bourbon Argos approached the harbor in Reggio Calabria, on the Italian mainland. As they watched sunlight spread over the foothills of Italy, they were unaware of another bit of dispiriting news. While the Eritreans aboard the missing third fishing boat had indeed been found, the two- or three-hour delay before the rescuers reached them had proved critical; onboard, rescuers found 13 migrants already dead.In the five weeks since the rescue of the Eritrean migrants by the Argos, at least 500 more migrants have died trying to make the Libya-Italy crossing.Map Sources: International Organization for Migration Missing Migrants Project, The Migrants FilesPhotography: Paolo Pellegrin/Magnum, for The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Stocks Dive as Worries About Asia Reverberate", "Date": "2015-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKeep the seatbelts on.Stock markets around the world tumbled Tuesday, dashing hopes that financial markets would calm down after two weeks of turbulence.Investors appear to be growing more nervous about the strength of the global economy. China released a weak report on manufacturing on Tuesday, and an influential international policy maker sounded a downbeat note on the outlook for Asian economies. In early trading on Wednesday, Chinese stocks again fell sharply, leaving the Shanghai composite index 40 percent lower than its recent peak. The price of contracts for the future delivery of oil, an indicator of the course of economic activity, also continued to drop in Asian trading.In the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index slid 58.33 points, or 2.96 percent on Tuesday. The benchmark is now 10.2 percent below its nominal high, putting it back in a correction \u2014 the Wall Street term for a decline of more than 10 percent from a peak level. The S.&P. 500 index is still 2.48 percent above the low it closed at last week.But the underlying ugliness of the action \u2014 only three stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose \u2014 suggested that the market could have further to drop.The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular market barometer, lost 469.68 points, or 2.84 percent, on Tuesday, to close at 16,058.35. The index is more than 12 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent on the day, and is down 11 percent from its recent high.Investors are now scouring the horizon for events that drive the markets up or down.Looming at the end of this week is the release of the United States jobs numbers. If the government figures on Friday show that employment growth has remained strong, investors may be encouraged that developments overseas will not do too much harm to the American economy. On the other hand, a robust jobs number may also lead investors to conclude that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month, rather than wait longer.\u201cThe jobs numbers on Friday will be really important,\u201d said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. \u201cIt will determine Fed policy one way or another.\u201d If the Fed decides to raise rates this month, it will most likely announce the move after monetary policy meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.The prospect of a September rise in interest rates has worried many economists and investors. In particular, they assert that the low level of inflation in the United States is a sign that the economy is still quite vulnerable to a slowdown.\u201cGiven the low wage and price inflation data seen to date, and increased uncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary-policy makers to closely monitor and depend on incoming data,\u201d he said.Even if the Fed decides not to increase rates this month, further problems in China and elsewhere could make investors reluctant to jump back into the stock market.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Both outcomes, however, could affect countries with economies that rely heavily on exports. As a result, such countries may decide to further devalue their currencies to regain competitiveness with China. The high stakes of such rivalries were made clear on Tuesday when South Korea reported export figures for August that were well below expectations. In contrast with past periods of turbulence, this one has not so far spurred a fierce rally in the 10-year Treasury note, a safe-haven investment. Its yield fell slightly to 2.16 percent on Tuesday from 2.21 percent on Monday. Adding to the nervousness on Tuesday, the price of oil fell after a strong rally in recent days. The benchmark crude contract in New York declined $3.79, or 7.7 percent, to $45.41. Over time, a lower price might signal less demand for oil as economies slow.The Vix index, a measure of volatility in the S.&P. 500 that is often called Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, jumped 10 percent, but it is still well below last week\u2019s high.The major European indexes all closed the day 2 to 3 percent lower. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 3 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 2.4 percent. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Care Gains, but Income Remains Stagnant, the White House Reports", "Date": "2015-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly nine million people gained health insurance last year, lowering the ranks of the uninsured to 10.4 percent of the population. But there was no statistically significant change in income for the typical American household in 2014, the Obama administration said on Wednesday.Overall, the new census numbers suggest that one major government program, to provide health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, is working, but that for ordinary Americans, especially the poor, the economic recovery \u2014 now into its seventh year \u2014 has yet to deliver measurable benefits.\u201cDespite decent employment growth in 2014, the persistent high unemployment yielded no improvements in wages and no improvement in the median incomes of working-age households or any reduction in poverty,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group influential with Democrats in Congress.\u201cAnyone wondering why people in this country are feeling so ornery need look no further than this report,\u201d Mr. Mishel continued. \u201cWages have been broadly stagnant for a dozen years, and median household income peaked in 1999.\u201dRepresentative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the new numbers showed that Congress should revamp antipoverty programs.\u201cRather than just treating the symptoms of poverty, our goal must be to help people move from welfare into work and self-sufficiency,\u201d Mr. Ryan saidIn its annual report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage, the Census Bureau said that the percentage of people without insurance was 10.4 percent last year, down from 13.3 percent in 2013.The fraction of the population without health insurance decreased last year in every state, the bureau said. Much of the change was attributable to the Affordable Care Act, officials said, but the Census Bureau could not say exactly how much.In the last two years, the Obama administration has issued a steady stream of upbeat reports showing a big expansion of coverage and a sharp reduction in the number of uninsured. To support its claims, the administration has cited estimates by the Urban Institute, the RAND Corporation, the Gallup organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others.None of those estimates, however, are as reliable or authoritative as the census data, which showed increases in both private and government coverage.From 2013 to 2014, the bureau said, the overall rate of insurance coverage increased for all racial groups and for Hispanics, who may be of any race. The increases were comparable for blacks, Asians and Hispanics (just over 4 percentage points) and lower for non-Hispanic whites (about 2 percentage points).The lack of any significant change in median household income, after adjustment for inflation, was somewhat surprising to experts, who had expected to see some modest growth in income because of improvements in the economy last year.Edward J. Welniak Jr., a Census Bureau statistician, said the income findings may reflect the fact that there were more \u201cnonfamily households\u201d in 2014. These households \u2014 single people living alone or with roommates, and unmarried couples \u2014 \u201ctypically have much lower incomes than family households,\u201d Mr. Welniak said.Many households have still not regained the purchasing power they had before the recession that began in December 2007. Median household income was 6.5 percent lower in 2014 than in 2007, the bureau said. The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number below it.The report included these findings:\u25a0 About 10 percent of households had incomes above $157,480 last year, while 5 percent had incomes above $206,570. At the other end of the spectrum, 10 percent of households had incomes less than $12,280.\u25a0 The pay gap between men and women has changed little in recent years. Among full-time year-round workers, median earnings for women were 79 percent of those for men last year, compared with 78 percent in 2007. By contrast, in 1964, the ratio was 59 percent.None of the major racial and ethnic groups experienced a statistically significant change in their poverty rates or in the number of people in poverty. The poverty rate for blacks (26 percent) is about two and half times that for non-Hispanic whites (10 percent).A family of four was classified as poor if its income was less than $24,230 last year. For one person, the threshold was $12,070.The biggest gains in health insurance coverage occurred last year among households with incomes less than $50,000 a year. For households with incomes of $100,000 or more, the gains were small.The extremes of coverage, as often in recent years, were found in Massachusetts, where 3.3 percent of the people are uninsured, and Texas, where 19 percent lack coverage. In Vermont, Hawaii and Minnesota, small shares of the population are uninsured. The reverse is true in Alaska, Florida and Georgia. Florida significantly expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but 16.6 percent of Floridians were still uninsured last year, the bureau reported.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fiorina Increased Hewlett-Packard\u2019s Sales, but Not Its Profits", "Date": "2015-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDebate CheckAt Wednesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, Carly Fiorina defended her record as C.E.O. of Hewlett-Packard. She was fired in 2005, and Donald Trump, among others, has criticized her performance.The early 2000s were a tough time for the tech industry, she said, and yet, \u201cdespite those difficult times, we doubled the size of the company, we quadrupled its topline growth rate, we quadrupled its cash flow, we tripled its rate of innovation.\u201dThe key undermining word in that statement is \u201ctopline.\u201dA company\u2019s top line is its revenue \u2014 how much money it takes in, before expenses. What shareholders really care about is the bottom line, or profit. As Mr. Trump correctly pointed out on Wednesday, Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s strategy to quickly grow H.P.\u2019s top line was to buy another large company, Compaq Computer. That deal was widely criticized at the time because it got H.P. a big increase in sales but little profit. Revenue from personal computers barely exceeded the company\u2019s cost to make and sell them.H.P.\u2019s best-known division, and by far its largest before the 2002 Compaq acquisition, is its printer business. H.P. had both the largest piece of the printer market and the most respected printer brand. This business made huge profits, especially off ink and toner. But printers were a mature business in the early 2000s and are even more so now as people print less: You can still make a profit on printer sales, but it\u2019s hard to get the total size of the printer market to grow. If H.P. wanted to get bigger, it was going to have to grow in other areas.Before the merger, H.P. was also in the business of manufacturing personal computers. This business wasn\u2019t profitable like the printer business; Windows P.C.s were essentially commodity products. It was hard to convince consumers to pay more for a computer from H.P. than one from I.B.M. or Toshiba. Vicious competition on price drove profit margins down almost to zero.At the time, H.P. struggled to compete with Dell, which had an advantage because it could sell computers directly to consumers instead of through stores and because it had lower manufacturing and distribution costs. (Dell\u2019s fortunes have waned in the years since Fiorina\u2019s tenure.)The idea behind H.P.\u2019s purchase of Compaq was that, by getting a bigger slice of the P.C. market, the company could find economies of scale, get better prices on parts and raise its profit margins. Mrs. Fiorina pushed the acquisition through over objections from many shareholders, most notably the family foundations of the founders that held a large chunk of the shares. Ultimately, the deal was approved with 51.4 percent of shareholder votes.But the merger did not produce the expected improvements in profits. In 2004, the combined company had $24.6 billion in revenue from selling computers, slightly more than the $24.2 billion it took in from printers. But it made just $200 million in profit from its computer business, a profit margin of less than 1 percent, compared with $3.8 billion in profits from printers.That said, profits rebounded under the next C.E.O.An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Carly Fiorina pushed the Compaq acquisition \u201cover objections from much of H.P.\u2019s board.\u201d The company\u2019s board voted unanimously to approve the acquisition. One board member, Walter Hewlett, who campaigned for shareholders to reject the acquisition, told the S.E.C. he joined the unanimous board vote to buy Compaq out of concern that a non-unanimous vote would allow Compaq to negotiate better terms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shell Exits Arctic as Slump in Oil Prices Forces Industry to Retrench", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe industry has cut its investments by 20 percent this year and laid off at least 200,000 workers worldwide, roughly 5 percent of the total work force. Companies also have retreated from less profitable fields in places like the North Sea, West Africa, and some shale prospects in Louisiana and North Dakota.American oil companies have decommissioned more than half of their drilling rigs over the last year, and production is beginning to drop in the United States. Even exports from Saudi Arabia are beginning to ebb because of a glut in its Asian markets.\u201cThe decision by Shell to abandon its Arctic drilling program for now primarily reflects the realities of lower global oil prices,\u201d said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, who advises oil companies and investment banks. \u201cWhen prices go down, the oil industry shortens their list of projects in development by removing the most expensive ones.\u201dThis year, industry executives held out hope that the oil price, which has fallen more than 50 percent to below $50 a barrel since last summer, would recover before too long. But in recent weeks, a growing number of executives have warned that the downturn could last well into 2016 and perhaps beyond, especially if the Iran nuclear deal leads to a flood of new oil on world markets.With demand dwindling, the current market of 94 million barrels a day has roughly two million barrels in surplus supply.Now, economic forces have scuttled what environmentalists had tried to do for years in the courts and with raucous protests in canoes and kayaks, arguing that drilling in the dark, ice-filled Arctic was dangerous to polar bears and other sea life.\u201cThis is a victory for everyone who has stood up for the Arctic,\u201d said Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace, a leader in the protests against Shell. \u201cThere is no better time to keep fossil fuels in the ground, bringing us one step closer to an energy revolution and sustainable future.\u201dWhen Shell first leased a huge portion of Alaska\u2019s Chukchi and Beaufort Seas after they were opened up by the George W. Bush administration, oil prices were soaring. Middle classes in China and the developing world were demanding more liquid fuels every year. At the same time, a growing number of oil fields around the world were aging and in decline.Then, just as Shell began its Alaskan effort, the shale revolution began in the United States. Independent oil companies found ways to fracture hard rocks to produce oil, nearly doubling domestic production. That surprise development, along with the slowing Chinese and European economies, drove the oil price down just as Shell returned to drilling in the Chukchi this year. The environmental movement delayed Shell at every turn, but the 2010 BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico pushed the company off several years as well.Industry experts say that there is plenty of oil in offshore Alaska and that renewed efforts are still possible if and when the oil price recovers. But environmentalists declared a triumph.But the company announced that its one well drilled this summer \u201cfound indications of oil and gas, but these are not sufficient to warrant further exploration.\u201d In a statement, it also acknowledged \u201cthe high costs associated with the project and the challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska.\u201dThe decision represented a major turnaround from the faith in the project that Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, expressed as recently as August. At the time, he said that Shell\u2019s holdings in the Alaskan Arctic could be \u201cmultiple times\u201d more bountiful than the enormous fields in the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cWe can\u2019t be driven by today\u2019s, tomorrow\u2019s, or next year\u2019s, or last year\u2019s oil price,\u201d he said.Shell\u2019s efforts to drill in Alaska have long seemed quixotic. It came closest to finding oil in 2012 when it drilled two shallow wells but had to stop short of deeper oil zones after several bizarre accidents, including the crushing of a containment dome during a vital test. This summer, a storm whipping though the Arctic Ocean forced Shell to suspend drilling, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service made a regulatory ruling that cut back the company\u2019s drilling plans.After a Finnish icebreaker hired by Shell struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutians in July, it was forced to go to Portland, Ore., for repairs. Protesters there tried to block the vessel, going so far as to suspend themselves from a bridge over the Willamette River.Shell\u2019s current venture into the Alaska offshore began under Mr. van Beurden\u2019s predecessors, and he has always been concerned about the project\u2019s costs and risks. Soon after he became chief executive in 2014, he temporarily halted drilling in Alaska because of legal and regulatory issues.He came around to the view that the potential bonanza was worth the expense and headaches, but now that drilling has produced an unexpectedly poor result, he may have decided to follow his original instincts and call a halt.\u201cThis first dry well seems to have been the trigger for the C.E.O. to pull the plug on their Alaska exploration campaign,\u201d said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London.The Alaska operations have cost billions of dollars. Shell said the value of Alaska drilling on its balance sheet was $3.1 billion and that it had a further $1.1 billion in contractual commitments, probably for items like drilling rigs. The company said it would take write-offs as a result of the decision to halt drilling.\u201cShell continues to see important exploration potential\u201d in offshore Alaska, Marvin E. Odum, president of Shell Oil, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, this is clearly a disappointing outcome.\u201dEnergy experts have expressed skepticism about the economics of Arctic drilling for some time.\u201cThe number of special challenges, unforeseen things you have to deal with, long supply chains, just make it very difficult to have the same level of confidence around costs as you do for development elsewhere,\u201d said Andrew Slaughter, executive director of the Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions.An article on Tuesday about Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s decision to end its oil exploration efforts in the Alaskan Arctic misspelled the name of an Oregon river over which protesters suspended themselves from a bridge in an effort to block the passage of an icebreaker hired by Shell. It is the Willamette River, not the Williamette.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caterpillar to Cut Up to 10,000 Jobs, Citing Falling Demand", "Date": "2015-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors already nervous about prospects for global growth reacted with dismay to the Caterpillar disclosure, sending shares in the company, one of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, down 6.3 percent for the day. Earlier Thursday, the Dow was down more than 1 percent but recovered some ground, closing lower by about 78 points, or 0.5 percent. Exchanges in Europe closed down roughly 2 percent.Although Caterpillar is affected more severely than most companies because mining businesses and other commodity producers are among its main customers, its problems illustrate the economic difficulties facing many multinationals.\u201cWe are facing a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors \u2014 namely in mining and energy,\u201d said Douglas R. Oberhelman, Caterpillar\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve already made substantial adjustments as these market conditions have emerged, we are taking even more decisive actions now.\u201dMost of the initial reductions will be among salaried workers and management, the bulk of them in United States, rather than the hourly work force, the company said. Along with layoffs, Caterpillar will look to reduce its manufacturing footprint and is considering closings or consolidations at more than 20 plants worldwide.In an op-ed article in The Peoria Journal Star, Mr. Oberhelman reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to the town but warned that the layoffs would be sizable.\u201cBecause Peoria is our global headquarters and we have the largest concentration of employees in Illinois, the impact here will be significant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeoria has been Caterpillar\u2019s home for 90 years and we know this is especially difficult and hard for our local employees, families and communities.\u201dThe company also reduced its outlook for revenue in 2015 by $1 billion, to $48 billion. That is a decline of more than 25 percent from four years ago, when surging commodity prices and the boom in Asia fueled very strong results.Caterpillar has been aggressive about cutting jobs and reducing costs since then. Still, the scale of its announcement on Thursday surprised investors.\u201cSeveral of the key industries we serve \u2014 including mining, oil and gas, construction and rail \u2014 have a long history of substantial cyclicality,\u201d Mr. Oberhelman said. \u201cWhile they are the right businesses to be in for the long term, we have to manage through what can be considerable and sometimes prolonged downturns.\u201dIn the first seven months of 2015, American companies exported more than $65 billion worth of products to China, making it the third-largest destination for American-made goods after Canada and Mexico.

{"Headline": "U.S. Trying to Protect Sage Grouse Without Listing It as an Endangered Species", "Date": "2015-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision brought to a climax a multiyear scramble by federal and state officials, energy companies and ranchers to find ways to protect and extend fragile breeding grounds for the bird, best known for its courtship strut, while sustaining economic development that threatens its habitat.Federal officials described the efforts to avert a listing as the most complex and complete land conservation plan ever developed to arrest the decades-long decline of the chickenlike bird, including mapping of nesting sites and migration corridors for protection from power lines and roads; measures to avert and fight fires that threaten sage grass habitat; and directing oil and gas companies to use directional drilling to avoid areas sensitive for bird survival.The plans establish buffer zones around areas where male grouse gather for breeding, many of which are close to or inside oil and gas fields.Environmentalists were divided over whether the measures went far enough to protect the bird from eventual extinction or were simply a sellout to business interests.\u201cThis is truly a historic effort,\u201d Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said at a ceremony with several governors and other federal officials at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge outside Denver. \u201cIt demonstrates that the Endangered Species Act is an effective and flexible tool and a critical catalyst for conservation.\u201dThe decision stemmed from a determination in 2010 by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service that the bird was in need of protection. But after study, officials decided that the number of birds and the extent of habitat are sufficient to assure its survival.Some environmentalists disagree, saying that studies show there is a strong probability that the critical sage grouse population in the Powder River basin of Wyoming and Montana will drop below minimal viability thresholds within 30 years. They say limitations on oil and gas drilling are insufficient to protect habitat, and they insist that electricity generation lines currently awaiting approval would be exempted from habitat protections.\u201cIt\u2019s a sign that politics as usual has taken over the process,\u201d said Erik Molvar, director of the WildEarth Guardians\u2019s Sagebrush Sea Campaign.An endangered species listing would have curtailed wind projects and coal mining, as well as drilling. Western governors and energy companies have lobbied hard against a blanket protection of sage grouse habitat, which covers 173 million acres.But Obama administration officials said that the collective efforts to plan protections for the bird\u2019s habitat were sufficient to save the species and not risk extinction for the foreseeable future.Once abundant in at least 13 Western states and three Canadian provinces, the greater sage grouse has declined in number by as much as 80 percent over the past century. Much of the blame comes from loss of habitat to the spread of suburbs, ranching, hunting and wild fires, which have worsened over time, in part because of climate change. Vulnerable to predators like eagles and coyotes, the grouse depends on vast expanses of sagebrush for food and shelter.Saving the sage grouse requires a broad effort coordinated among various levels of government. About half the habitat, generally drier lands at higher altitudes where the birds mate and nest, is on federal lands managed by the Interior Department. The rest is on state and private lands, particularly wetter meadows essential for the young chicks to mature.The conflict between some environmentalists and officials who want to protect industry has echoed the battle over logging in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s to save the spotted owl. But the administration and state officials have sought to bring environmental groups like the National Audubon Society into the fold to develop compromise plans to protect the bird and businesses.Court challenges to the compromise efforts are likely. Some Republicans and industry groups complained that the land management plans will unnecessarily harm commercial interests.\u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the Obama administration\u2019s oppressive land management plan is the same as a listing\u201d of the bird as an endangered species, said Representative Rob Bishop of Utah, the Republican chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.Brian Rutledge, an Audubon Society vice president, praised the effort as an \u201cunprecedented\u201d cooperation of the states, the federal government and environmental groups. \u201cWe have gotten attention paid to an ecosystem that was at best forgotten and at worst being destroyed by the way it was being managed,\u201d he said, \u201cand we are seeing that turned about.\u201dEnergy companies also joined the effort to protect their rights to drill and mine.Chesapeake Energy ordered its contracted truckers to drive to their wells only in daylight hours, so as not to disturb the bird\u2019s customary breeding at dawn and nesting at night in one new Wyoming field. Shell Oil developed seed mixtures to bolster the heartiness of vegetation that nourishes the sage grouse and gives chicks better cover from predators. Cloud Peak Energy jury-rigged an ingenious tool out of old mining drag lines to suppress cheatgrass before it can ruin the bird\u2019s natural habitat, and it voluntarily passed on its invention to competing coal companies and ranchers.\u201cToday\u2019s decision validates that we can work together to find solutions,\u201d said Paul Ulrich, the regulatory director at Jonah Energy, an oil and gas company. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a shift by industry as our knowledge about the greater sage grouse has improved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biden Formation Story", "Date": "2015-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBiden talked about Beau. \u201cMy son was better than me. And he was better than me in almost every way.\u201d He gestured toward how fluid grief is, how it goes round and round, hides for a few hours and then suddenly overwhelms. But there was something else embedded in that Colbert moment: a formation story.Every presidential candidate needs a narrative to explain how his or her character was formed. They need a story line that begins outside of politics with some experience or life-defining crucible moment that then defines the nature of their public service.Candidates like John F. Kennedy and John McCain were formed by war. Candidates like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were formed by their rise from broken homes and their dedication to lift others and heal divisions. Without a clear formation story, a candidate is just a hodgepodge of positions and logos.Democrats this year are looking for a formation story that proves commitment. This is a party that is moving boldly leftward. Its voters want to know their candidate has the inner drive to push through structural changes, not just half measures.Bernie Sanders has such a story. From his days at the University of Chicago onward, he has been a pile driver for progressive causes, regardless of the prevailing winds. Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t yet presented a clear formation story. She talks about being a grandmother, which humanizes her, but doesn\u2019t explain how she got to be the person she is.With Colbert, one saw the kernel of a Biden formation story that could connect not only with Democratic voters but with other voters as well. It is a story of dual loss: his wife and daughter decades ago and his son this year. Out of that loss comes a great empathy, a connection to those who are suffering in this economy and this world. Out of that loss comes a hypercharged sense of mission. Out of that loss comes a liberation from the fear of failure that dogs most politicians, and causes them to dodge, prevaricate and spin.People who have suffered a loss often want to connect their tragedy to some larger redemptive mission. Biden could plausibly and genuinely emerge sadder but more empathetic and more driven. That would be not only a natural reaction, but also the basis for a compelling campaign. Biden would then benefit from the greater verbal self-discipline he has developed while vice president and from the fact that this year, as Donald Trump proves, voters seem tolerant of free-talkers.Democratic voters aren\u2019t the only ones looking for a strong formation story. Republicans are looking for one, too, but the nature of the Republican race is different. If Democrats are arguing over what positions to fight for, Republicans are arguing about how to fight.Republican presidential candidates have found that the strongest way to win favor on the stump is to attack the leaders of their party in Congress for being timid and inept. Many Republican voters are alienated from their party\u2019s leadership. They\u2019re looking for a candidate who can lead a mutiny.Donald Trump\u2019s mutiny story is pretty clear. In doing business deal after business deal, he mastered the skills needed to take on the morons who are now running the party and the world. Ben Carson\u2019s story is clear, too. Through his faith and through his medical career he developed the purity of heart and the discipline of will required to walk into Washington without being corrupted by the rottenness found there.The Republican desire for a mutiny has kept Trump and Carson aloft longer than most people supposed. I still think they will implode. Their followers need them to be the superheroes they are portraying themselves to be. But politics is hard, especially for beginners, and sooner or later they will flounder and look like they\u2019re in over their heads. At that point it\u2019s all over. At that point, a Bush, Rubio, Kasich or Walker will have an opening to tell a different and more positive story.On the Democratic side, a Biden run would be more formidable than I thought last month. You need emotion to beat emotion. With Stephen Colbert he revealed a story and suggested a campaign that is moving, compelling and in tune with the moment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Life on the Papal Beat", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "FeatureA journalist reflects on covering the Vatican over the years, and how Pope Francis has, and has not, changed the institution.Supported byJust weeks before, Francis\u2019 encyclical on the environment, \u2018\u2018Laudato Si,\u2019\u2019 had landed with an impact rarely seen from a 40,000-\u00adword papal document. The New York Times and other news outlets covered the encyclical as a developing story, posting continual updates online as reactions poured in from environmentalists, from industrialists and from the faithful around the world. The conference had been hastily organized by the Pontifical Academies of Sciences and Social Sciences and Jeffrey Sachs, the prominent economist and director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Such a collaboration would have been rare in the past but represents the kind of bridge Francis is building between the church and the wider world.The conference was being held in a small amphitheater upstairs from the 1970s-era Paul VI audience hall, just to the left of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. There was more security than usual \u2014 two sets of metal detectors \u2014 most likely because of the visiting politicians. (The Vatican tries not to put barriers between the faithful and the pope.) Inside the auditorium, a few dozen journalists had gathered: veteran reporters and photographers for wire services, some of whom had spent decades covering the Vatican. I chatted with an Argentine journalist for a Latin American news wire. His star had risen with the new Argentine pope, who has drawn many new arrivals from Latin America into the Vatican press corps. This influx has made getting a coveted seat on the papal plane even more difficult. Competition was especially fierce for the pope\u2019s imminent trip to Cuba and the United States, not least because of his role in facilitating a private meeting at the Vatican last year between American and Cuban officials, which helped finalize the detente between the two countries. For the first time, some regular Italian outlets didn\u2019t get spots. Francis would not be addressing the press that day \u2014 popes never give news conferences and don\u2019t take questions in public; the only time they speak directly to the press corps is on the papal plane. Reporters were there mainly to document the politicians eager to be in his orbit.Francis finally appeared at the end of the day, with little fanfare and without an entourage. As people applauded and began filming him with their phones, the pope took his seat. He wore a simple cross over his white robe. He seemed a bit fatigued \u2014 temperatures were nearly 100 degrees \u2014 but he spoke off the cuff in Spanish for a long while. He warned of \u2018\u2018the idolatry of technocracy,\u2019\u2019 which he said leads to unemployment. He spoke of the exploitation of children, of migration and the risks of deforestation, especially in the Amazon, which he called one of the \u2018\u2018great lungs\u2019\u2019 of the world. He told the mayors he was very glad they had traveled to the Vatican to discuss environmental issues, because change has to start from the grass roots. \u2018\u2018The most serious and profound work,\u2019\u2019 he concluded, \u2018\u2018starts at the peripheries and moves toward the center.\u2019\u2019How else to make sense of the endless and elaborate delays, the delicate art of manipulating the interlocking gears of the machine, the tug of war between Rome and the local dioceses \u2014 all of which produces a perpetual displacement of responsibility that often erodes the line between willful obfuscation and benign incompetence. What providence wills, only bureaucracy can achieve. He who slows down time preserves power. I once asked Giulio Andreotti, the seven-\u00adtime Christian Democratic prime minister of Italy, the enigmatic force at the center of so many webs who never so much as flinched during the years of trials for associating with the Mafia \u2014 in which he was, naturally, acquitted \u2014 why Italy was so bureaucratic. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a certain guarantee,\u2019\u2019 Andreotti answered, sitting in his Senate office and speaking in his clipped monotone, his shoulders slightly hunched. \u2018\u2018Yes, it\u2019s a weight, maybe something flat and opaque, but it\u2019s also a guarantee to go one step at a time, not to take big curves. If you take big curves fast, that can be very risky.\u2019\u2019Francis may rewrite the role of pope, may even change the world, but he may not be able to change the Vatican, where for centuries the Roman curia, career Vatican bureaucrats, have bedeviled efforts at reform. To reach the Apostolic Palace, which dates from the 16th century, you enter through St. Anne\u2019s Gate. Past the Vatican bank and beyond a fleet of Vatican City State fire trucks, a Swiss Guard points you to a wood-\u00adpaneled elevator. The brass plate marking the floors reads \u2018\u2018I Loggia,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018II Loggia,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018III Loggia.\u2019\u2019 The Secretariat of State, the Holy See\u2019s foreign ministry and Home Office, occupies the third loggia. Here, a seemingly endless hallway with a wall of windows and soaring, coffered ceilings begins with a wall-size map of the globe. It is one of a series of frescoes depicting maps of the known world, painted between 1560 and 1585. There are Greece and Turkey. The Holy Land and Italy are rendered in gold. It was from here, the center of the center, that the Catholic Church brought the periphery under its sway. I have been in this hallway only once \u2014 the only time an official ever invited me inside \u2014 and it is one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen.At least since the invention of the stained-\u00adglass window, the Vatican has embraced new technologies to help the pope communicate with the faithful. In 1931, Pope Pius XI was the first pope to make a radio broadcast. In 1954, Pope Pius XII was the first to appear on television. In 2012, under Benedict, the Vatican opened the first papal Twitter feeds, which have grown to more than 23 million followers in nine languages under Francis and are managed by the Secretariat of State. But the Vatican press office is designed mainly to get the pope\u2019s words out, not to let the press in. The press office holds frequent news conferences with Vatican officials \u2014 never the pope \u2014 and issues nearly daily bulletins announcing the pope\u2019s meetings with church and secular officials and nominations or retirements of church officials around the world. Few institutions yield so many stories that can be reported without leaving your desk. The trick is understanding the stakes. A news bulletin arrives via email. Is it a tiny blip or something of vast importance? Benedict announces that he will make it easier for disaffected Anglicans to find a home in the Catholic Church. Is this a small thing or the largest setback in Catholic-\u00adAnglican relations since the Protestant Reformation? The Vatican insists on one interpretation. The Anglicans on another. It is always a question of perspective.The lingua franca on the papal plane is always Italian, although sometimes a pope will answer a question in a language spoken in a destination country. There is no simultaneous translation. Under Francis, the press office tries to issue translated transcripts quickly, but it is always one step behind the news cycle. Handouts with the pope\u2019s greetings to the leaders of every country whose airspace the papal plane has traversed are distributed to the press. The pope flies first class; the journalists sit in economy. Until a few years ago, papal trips were run by a Belgian with a fierce temper who would shout at journalists to form a single-\u00adfile line, as if we were unruly schoolchildren. The day\u2019s embargoed speeches were distributed as early as 4:45 a.m., with Mass at 5 o\u2019clock for those who wished to attend.Reporters tend to flock together by language \u2014 chiefly Italian, Spanish, English and French. No one ever has the same idea of what the story is. On a papal trip to Britain, centered on the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman, the 19th-\u00adcentury Anglican convert, I was trying to write an article explaining how Newman\u2019s intellectualism resonated with Benedict. Nearby, a colleague from a British tabloid was hashing out his story. \u2018\u2018What would you say was in that omelet that we ate on the plane?\u2019\u2019 he asked me. \u2018\u2018Herbs?\u2019\u2019 En route to France with Benedict in 2008, the journalists for Catholic news outlets were intrigued that his first speeches seemed to support a return to the traditional Tridentine rite that had been pushed aside with the Second Vatican Council. Those of us from secular news organizations were framing the story around the pope\u2019s inveighing, once again, against a world without spiritual values. And then there was the reporter for a German tabloid, peering out the window onto the tarmac, where Carla Bruni was greeting Benedict with Nicolas Sarkozy, then the president of France. He shouted into the phone to his editors: \u2018\u2018She\u2019s wearing flats!\u2019\u2019Under Benedict, Lombardi was forever trying to prevent the fallout from a crisis. Under Francis, his repeated message seems to be that the pope, in spite of his focus on those on the margins of society, is not, in fact, a Marxist. He mentioned the pope\u2019s speech in Bolivia, in which Francis spoke of the periphery as a catalyst of creativity and moral engagement. The speech \u2018\u2018could be read as leftist revolutionary, because it largely makes an appeal to the poor,\u2019\u2019 Lombardi said. \u2018\u2018But there was not a single word about class warfare. There\u2019s not a single word about violence. It\u2019s all about common good and love and responsibility.\u2019\u2019It falls on Lombardi to make clear that both popes speak for the same church. And it falls on the press to describe what we see. Four rows of columns or one? As always, it\u2019s a question of perspective.Rachel Donadio is the European culture correspondent for The New York Times and is based in Paris.

Last year, 17,668 apartments sold, with an average price of about 202,000 euros, or $226,200. Though the number of sales declined, transaction volume rose significantly to 3.57 billion euros last year from 3.03 billion in 2011.Prices in Berlin still remain a fraction of those in other top European capitals like London or Paris and are significantly below prices in Munich and Hamburg, because the city\u2019s property market is \u201ccatching up\u201d to those in other large cities following the reunification 25 years ago, Mr. Fischer said.The highest demand for apartments in Berlin is in the Mitte, or central district, \u201ca top culture and gastronomy scene and short distances to Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Gendarmenmarkt and Potsdamer Platz,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.Demand exceeds supply. According to the housing report by Berlin Hyp and CBRE banks, about 50,000 residents or 30,000 households moved to Berlin in each of the last two years.Some 226 projects with 17,600 apartments are expected be completed in the next three to four years, said Michael Schlatterer, a director of CBRE.\u201cSeventy to 80 percent of the completed units are condominiums for owner occupation,\u201d Mr. Schlatterer said. \u201cApproximately 50 percent of those serve as secondary homes, which means that the market for rental apartments doesn\u2019t really find any relief.\u201d Nearly 90 percent of Berliners are renters.WHO BUYS IN BERLINInvestors from Europe, the Middle East, China and the United States make up 60 percent of Mr. Zabel\u2019s clients. \u201cMost of our American clients want to have a second home,\u201d he said, mainly in the range of 500,000 to 700,000 euros, or $560,000 to $784,000. \u201cThen they figure out it is such a great city to invest in, so they buy several units.\u201dForeigners invest in Berlin because of relatively low prices, Germany\u2019s economic power and stability and Berlin\u2019s status as a tourist and cultural hot spot, Mr. Schlatterer said.The weak euro has increased interest among Americans, Canadians and Asians, with Russians among the top five nationalities of buyers in Berlin, Mr. Fischer added.BUYING BASICSGermany is hospitable to real estate investors, with no restrictions on foreign buyers and financing easily available, Mr. Fischer said. Mortgage rates for German buyers run 1.8 percent to 2 percent, while foreigners pay 2 percent to 2.5 percent.Investors should be ready to make a down payment of at least 40 percent to 50 percent of the value of the property.

{"Headline": "Investors\u2019 Fears on Commodities Add to Pressure on Share Prices", "Date": "2015-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks & BondsStocks fell sharply on Monday as investors added new fears to the list of concerns that have weighed on global markets in recent weeks.In addition to worrying about the world\u2019s largest economies, investors are now grappling with problems facing some of the world\u2019s most prominent companies. On Monday, a nearly 30 percent decline in the shares of Glencore, a large Swiss mining and trading firm hit hard by the plunge in commodities prices, sent fear through the markets.\u201cThey are one of the victims of the commodities decline \u2014 a very big one and very high-profile one,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a co-founder of the Solaris Group. \u201cIt\u2019s all related to global growth.\u201dAt the same time, investors are trying to assess the impact of the Volkswagen emissions-testing scandal on the broader auto sector and determine the outlook for biotechnology companies, which have sold off in recent days as politicians expressed their frustration with increases in drug prices.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index plunged 49.57 points, or 2.57 percent, to close at 1,881.77. The benchmark is now only marginally above the low that it sank to in August, when heavy turbulence interrupted a long ascent for United States stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 312.78 points, or 1.92 percent, to 16,001.89. The sell-off in biotech shares battered the Nasdaq index, which was down 142.53 points, more than 3 percent, to 4,543.97. European shares, as measured by the Stoxx Europe 600 index, fell 2.21 percent. The sell-off continued Tuesday in Asia at the start of trading, with the Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropping more than 3 percent, and the main index in Shanghai falling 1.5 percent. The nervousness showed up in other indicators. The Vix index, which measures investors\u2019 expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, spiked nearly 17 percent on Monday. Investors sought the relative safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 2.10 percent on Monday after closing at 2.17 percent on Friday.\u201cThe action since late August has been pretty poor,\u201d said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, a brokerage. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are many people who are pretty excited about stocks right now.\u201dThe S.& P. 500 index is now down nearly 12 percent from the benchmark nominal high it reached in May. A market that is down more than 10 percent from a peak is said to be in correction, in Wall Street parlance. A decline of 20 percent or more is a bear market. The last bear market in United States stocks ended in 2009.Much of the recent weakness in the markets can be attributed to concerns about the strength of the global economy. China\u2019s economy, the second-largest in the world after that of the United States, appears to be slowing. China\u2019s sluggishness could lead to slower growth in other countries, and its decision to allow its currency to trade more freely appears to have prompted China\u2019s trading rivals to devalue their currencies to gain an advantage in global export markets. On Monday, new data showed that industrial profits in China declined by almost 9 percent in August from a year earlier.Now, though, problems within big companies are adding to the bearishness on the economy.In the case of Glencore, the challenges are directly related to weakness in the global economy and commodities markets. Glencore\u2019s shares are now down nearly 90 percent from the price at which they went public in 2011. Trading firms like Glencore depend on constant access to cheap credit to finance their bets. But creditors may cut back their loans to a trading firm if its prospects appear to be dimming. Glencore has recently taken steps that aim to strengthen its balance sheet, like reducing debt and selling new shares, but the continued decline in its shares suggests that investors may think the company has to do more. Glencore declined to comment.The ire among some politicians toward drug companies appears to be spreading. On Monday, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform pressed the panel\u2019s chairman to subpoena Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a Canadian drug maker, to obtain documents relating to the increase in the price of two of its drugs. Valeant\u2019s shares fell nearly 17 percent, to $166.50.\u201cIt\u2019s not all terrible \u2014 look at Nike,\u201d said Mr. Greenhaus. \u201cHopefully, over the next few weeks we\u2019ll see more of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe, a Continent of Refugees", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 At the heart of Europe\u2019s confused response to the refugee crisis is a feeling, largely unexpressed but still quite palpable, that these desperate, robbed, half-starving Syrians are in some way a contaminant, that to allow them in will result in Europe\u2019s getting something horrible and staining on its fingers \u2014 but also that somehow Europe is \u201cfull.\u201dThis is not just knee-jerk racism. It is very important to Europeans to see themselves as living in a lucky citadel of rationality, a managerial environment based around consumer choice. Nationalism also continues to play a role; each European state sees itself as organic and complete. The world outside consists of inauthentic migrant states (the United States), dictatorships and poverty.This pleased-with-itself ideology has been central to Europe\u2019s leaders and their view of the world. But it is also of a relatively new vintage, and speaks of a desperate wish not to return to the bloody tumult that long defined European society.There is hardly a corner of Europe that has not been torn to pieces by massacres, the flights of whole populations and violent resettlements, all fueled by ideologies every bit as violent and nihilistic as those of the Islamic State. Europeans love to imagine that ferocity and unreason are somehow, like Syria, \u201cfar away\u201d \u2014 and yet if ever there was a part of the world that should feel a deep-rooted empathy for the plight of ordinary Syrians, it ought to be Europe.Just consider the ground covered by today\u2019s refugees, as they travel from Greece to Germany. In the last 100 years Greece itself and the rest of the southern Balkans have undergone civil war, military regimes and catastrophic change, and been subjected to such brutality that the landscape would be almost unrecognizable to a traveler trudging northward a little more than a century ago.This was a world that was, in many areas, heavily and deeply Islamic. But in a series of devastating wars before, during and after World War I, this all changed. Every group suffered, but from Greece alone in the early 1920s some half a million surviving Muslims were expelled eastward. Their disappearance was accompanied by the ruthless destruction of almost every trace of Islamic architecture.Only Albania, through a quirk of international statesmanship, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, which had at a key point been under the rule of the Hapsburg Empire, kept their Muslim populations more or less intact. Even into the 1980s the Communist authorities in Bulgaria were expelling their remaining Muslims.As today\u2019s refugees head into Serbia, they find themselves in a country once eviscerated by two world wars. Following the invasion of Serbia by the Hapsburg armies in 1914, it is reckoned that at least half of all Serbian men died, either in combat or through starvation or terror reprisals. For years much of the country was almost empty. Next door, Bosnia-Herzegovina became another disaster area in the 1990s, a wilderness of camps, ethnic cleansing and ideological terror.In Hungary, today\u2019s refugees enter a country itself entirely shaped and created by refugees. The grim scenes at the Keleti train station in Budapest could not have happened at a more appropriate place. So many tragedies from Hungarian history have been played out in that building.In both world wars, train after train of doomed soldiers left to cheers, flowers and military bands. Following Hungary\u2019s defeat in 1918 and the implosion of the Hapsburg Empire, of which it had been a vital part, Keleti station filled up with thousands of Hungarian refugees fleeing ethnic cleansing by vengeful Serbian and Romanian troops. And they stayed: Despite the collapse of Central Europe\u2019s economy after 1918, the permanent population of Budapest grew substantially because there were so many terrified incomers.In 1945 there were some 20 million European refugees milling around, fleeing persecution, the destruction of their homes or justice. The principal story of the latter half of that decade is how Europe as a whole found homes for all those people (sometimes tragically, as with those shunted back east into the clutches of the Soviet Union).Postwar Europe was shaped by waves of migration on a scale vastly greater than in the current crisis. In 1947 all German speakers were expelled from Czechoslovakia, and in a few weeks well over a million arrived in the American zone of occupied Germany alone. Despite entering a country mostly reduced to rubble and with a barely ticking economy, they were settled across southern Germany.In just a few weeks in 1962, some three-quarters of a million Europeans arrived in France following Algerian independence and were settled. Immigration from outside Europe is common, too \u2014 consider the millions of Britons of South Asian descent who moved in the 1960s and \u201970s, or the millions of German Turks.Mass movements of people lie at the heart of Europe, whether voluntary or involuntary. Communities adapt, terrible scars partly reheal, cities grow, children are born, new skills are found. Even setting aside the enormous complicating factor of the West\u2019s role in countries such as Libya, Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, the answer to the current crisis is obvious.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the Muslims who were expelled by Bulgaria in the 1980s. They were ethnic Turks, not Pomaks.Advertisement"}

Beginning in April, companies will have to pay at least \u00a37.20 to employees age 26 or older, an hourly rate that will gradually rise to \u00a39 by the end of the decade.\u201cBusinesses are responsible for making that happen, and today I\u2019m announcing how we will make sure they do,\u201d Mr. Cameron wrote in an article in The Times of London published Tuesday. \u201cThe national living wage will only work if it is properly enforced.\u201dLong a pledge of the opposition Labour Party, the cause of higher minimum pay was swiftly appropriated by Mr. Cameron after his re-election in May.Under the new enforcement process detailed by Mr. Cameron, employers would face fines worth 200 percent of unpaid wages up to a ceiling of \u00a320,000, doubling previous penalties. In addition, heads of companies who fail to comply would be barred from serving on company boards for up to 15 years, according to Mr. Cameron.\u201cTo unscrupulous employers who think they can get labor on the cheap, the message is clear,\u201d Mr. Cameron wrote. \u201cUnderpay your staff, and you will pay the price.\u201dIn an attempt to rebrand the Conservative Party as the party of the working people, Mr. Cameron has made replacing benefits with a higher minimum wage the centerpiece of a \u201cnew settlement\u201d for Britain, which also included measures to raise the personal tax allowance and double the amount of free child care available to parents, raising it to 30 hours a week.The British economy has shown impressive growth, expanding 3 percent last year, the fastest among the Group of 7 richest countries, and slowly reducing its budget deficit. But productivity and wages have been sluggish, even as the country\u2019s unemployment \u2014 5.6 percent in the second quarter \u2014 is among the lowest in the European Union.Critics of a higher minimum wage warn that it would prompt companies to invest more in automation and decrease the number of jobs, hitting hardest those it is intended to help. Even Mr. Cameron\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has said that the higher wage floor would cost 60,000 jobs.Tax credits for the working poor, which Mr. Cameron\u2019s government is scrapping in favor of his national living wage, are more effective at keeping people in jobs, the critics say. Advocates of higher pay counter that such credits effectively subsidize companies with taxpayer\u2019s money, even if most of the benefit goes to employees, economists say. They also point to studies on both sides of the Atlantic showing that at a low level \u2014 less than 50 percent of the median income \u2014 increases in the minimum wage have little impact on the employment rate.Some companies have volunteered to pay a living wage, defined as a wage adjusted for the cost of living in a given city. Oliver Bonas, a fashion and gift retailer that employs 500 people, promised to pay its employees at least \u00a37.85 an hour \u2014 and \u00a39.15 in London, where the cost of living is higher \u2014 as of Tuesday.\u201cMajor players in the retail sector have for a long time claimed that the living wage is too expensive to implement on the High Street,\u201d Mr. Moore was quoted as saying. \u201cThis move demonstrates that while it\u2019s not always an easy choice, it is the right choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Resting on Laurels, European Central Bank Leader Faces New Threats", "Date": "2015-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Thursday was supposed to be an occasion for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, to take a victory lap.Instead, he may face questions on why he and his policy council are not running even harder, given all the new uncertainties in global and European economies.But on Thursday, when Mr. Draghi presides at a regularly scheduled meeting of the central bank\u2019s Governing Council, he will need to address the welter of new and in some cases unexpected threats from around the globe, which could create pressure for yet more stimulus spending.A slowdown in the economy of China and other emerging markets has prompted wild swings in stock prices, although markets were relatively calm on Wednesday.The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates in the United States as early as this month, possibly causing borrowing costs to rise in the eurozone before growth is strong enough.Some economists are even warning again about the eurozone\u2019s lapsing into deflation, a broad decline in prices that is considered poisonous to growth and employment.An influx of refugees into Europe from Syria and other conflict zones, while outside the purview of monetary policy, adds to the uncertainty. Confusion among European leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone.These factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, that the European Central Bank began in March as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates.As a result, some analysts, so far apparently a minority, expect Mr. Draghi to send a strong signal on Thursday that the central bank\u2019s Governing Council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned.But any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the Governing Council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive, pre-emptive action. It took years for Mr. Draghi to resolve those tensions and begin the bond-buying program in the first place.\u201cI can imagine that the controversy within the Governing Council and the debates within the Governing Council continue to be quite heavy,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cSince there are some improving signs in the eurozone, those governors who were against quantitative easing will be against it even more.\u201dPartly because of that dissent, Mr. Darvas said he did not expect any major shift in policy from the European Central Bank on Thursday. Many analysts seem to agree.Nor, Mr. Darvas said, is major action necessary right away. While China is an important export market for Germany and other European countries, he said, a slowdown there will not derail eurozone growth.And while an increase in official interest rates by the Fed could spill over into the eurozone and raise borrowing costs, higher interest rates in the United States would also tend to strengthen the dollar and weaken the euro. That would be good for eurozone exporters, because their products would be cheaper for customers paying in other currencies.Still, at a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Draghi is almost certain to at least repeat earlier statements that the central bank is ready to deploy further stimulus if circumstances warrant.As of Aug. 28, the central bank had spent 290 billion newly created euros, or about $327 billion, buying eurozone government bonds on open markets. The sum is roughly in line with its aim of monthly government bond purchases of \u20ac50 billion.There is scope to increase the pace of the purchases, analysts said, and some see a chance that on Thursday Mr. Draghi will signal an increased willingness to do so.He could also signal that the European Central Bank intends to continue the stimulus spending beyond September 2016, the earliest it has said it would end the program. The central bank could also step up its purchases of private sector assets, in addition to the \u20ac10 billion per month it is buying already.\u201cA time extension of the asset purchase program to beyond September 2016 is the most likely option,\u201d analysts at Barclays said in a note to clients, adding that the decision could come as early as Thursday, and before the end of the year in any case.There are arguments in favor of stronger action.Unemployment in the eurozone fell to 10.9 percent in July from 11.1 percent in June, according to official figures published Wednesday. That is the lowest jobless rate in the 19 countries of the eurozone since February 2012. Still, it is almost double the rate in the United States and far from a level considered healthy.Inflation, at 0.2 percent in August, was unchanged from June and July. The rate is still well short of the European Central Bank\u2019s official target of just below 2 percent.Some economists remain concerned that the eurozone could yet slip into deflation, which has already infected some eurozone countries like Greece.And while China and the global market have at least temporarily pushed Greece from the financial headlines, that country continues to lurk as a risk to eurozone integrity. Fears have faded that Greece will be forced to drop out of the eurozone, but the country\u2019s economy is still in a shambles and there is uncertainty about whether a stable government will emerge after national elections scheduled for Sept. 20.Mr. Draghi could help calm those worries by announcing on Thursday that the central bank is ready to lift a ban on buying Greek government bonds as part of the stimulus program. Greece should now qualify because it has agreed to conditions demanded by other eurozone countries in return for as much as \u20ac86 billion in additional aid.If so, Greece\u2019s hard-pressed commercial banks would be among the main beneficiaries because they have large holdings of their own government\u2019s debt. European Central Bank purchases would help raise the market value of those bonds and help restore confidence in the country\u2019s banks.And Greeks who have withdrawn cash from their accounts might begin depositing money again and help the banking system return to normal.But economists and investors hoping for powerful action by the European Central Bank on Thursday may be disappointed. The central bank is not known for acting pre-emptively, and it is likely to wait until the Fed has taken action and until it is clearer what effect China\u2019s problems will have on Europe.\u201cOthers are betting the E.C.B. will step up quantitative easing, but it\u2019s too early,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank. \u201cThey still want to see what the Fed will do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is when we talk about screening every child for autism that the debate becomes heated.We lack the specific studies to prove the case, so what are we to do?I\u2019m not aware of studies on how parents of affected children comply with recommended therapy, but as a pediatrician my (admittedly) anecdotal experience has been that the parents of children with autism spectrum disorder are some of the most engaged and strongest advocates for their children. I know of no one who thinks that Question 4 would be answered negatively for a significant number of people.The task force\u2019s quibble is that these interventions were performed in children already found to have autism spectrum disorder. They weren\u2019t conducted in children whose positive screen led to diagnosis but who hadn\u2019t yet been symptomatic enough to concern their parents or physicians without screening.In a perfect world, asking for a study specifically involving those children might be a reasonable request. In the real world, such a study is almost certainly not going to happen. At least, not anytime soon.The interventions for autism are rarely pharmaceutical or device-related. As noted above, they are almost always behavioral or developmental. As such, they are not going to be funded by the health industry.

{"Headline": "The Apartment Trail Winds Back to Hamilton Heights", "Date": "2015-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntAs seniors at Vassar College, Jordan Miller and Jenna Konstantine lived in a campus house with three others. They were compatible housemates as well as friends.After graduating in 2013, both landed jobs in Manhattan. Mr. Miller commuted by train from his parents\u2019 home in New Rochelle, N.Y., while Ms. Konstantine, who is from Oneonta in upstate New York, stayed with an uncle in Passaic County, N.J., and took the bus. They knew they wanted to rent an apartment together in the city.\u00a0At first, they found nothing suitable. But one fall day, Mr. Miller was having brunch with friends who lived in Hamilton Heights in northern Manhattan, \u201ca neighborhood I had never heard of,\u201d he said. One of them knew of a two-bedroom upstairs from his place that was being renovated. Mr. Miller and Ms. Konstantine wound up renting the apartment for $2,150 a month, arriving on Jan. 1, 2014.\u00a0They took a 16-month lease because \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to have to move out on New Year\u2019s Eve and we weren\u2019t ready to do a full two years,\u201d Mr. Miller said.The apartment, on the fourth floor of a walk-up building in the West 140s, had a washer-dryer, an amenity they had not envisioned as even a possibility.\u00a0They split the rent in half. Mr. Miller, who works in public relations, took the larger room. That\u2019s because, in college, they had tended to hang out in his room. Talking in the living room would wake their suitemates.\u00a0As the lease neared its end, and with a rent increase in their future, they started thinking about Brooklyn. Many of their friends lived in or near Crown Heights, and \u201cthe rents are reasonable \u2014 or they were when our friends moved in two years ago,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\u00a0The lengthy subway trip home from visiting their friends was \u201cno fun, especially late at night,\u201d he said. What\u2019s more, \u201cI was ready to experience something different and new.\u201dSo the roommates hunted in Brooklyn, hoping to find a better apartment for a similar price and no broker fee. Mr. Miller wanted a dishwasher.\u00a0He was confident of success. \u201cWe thought we had some special knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had been through it before.\u201d\u00a0They liked the location of a two-bedroom on Union Street in Crown Heights. It was a block from the subway, on the sunny fourth floor of a walk-up building. The apartment, in mid-renovation, was smaller than their Hamilton Heights place, with neither dishwasher nor washer-dryer, and a rent of $2,250 a month.\u00a0\u201cIf we could get a dishwasher we could live without the laundry,\u201d Mr. Miller said. In this case, he felt they would be \u201cpaying more for less.\u201d They did not see any other two-bedrooms that tempted them to pull up stakes.\u00a0Intending to avail themselves of economies of scale, they contacted a college friend who also wanted to move, and shifted their efforts to finding a three-bedroom. Their budget was up to $1,100 a person.\u00a0A three-bedroom on Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, also a fourth-floor walk-up, was a bargain at $2,945 a month, but had neither dishwasher nor washer-dryer. The location wasn\u2019t ideal, closer to the IND trains than their preferred IRT line. The bedrooms were small.\u00a0They moved on.Another three-bedroom, a third-floor walk-up on Underhill Avenue in Prospect Heights, was $3,195 a month. This one, again with small bedrooms, had a washer-dryer, a dishwasher and even an extra half-bathroom. The apartment came with a broker fee and wasn\u2019t close to a subway. And when Mr. Miller, who wasn\u2019t able to visit, saw pictures of the kitchen, he had reservations. \u201cThe kitchen looked like it would attract dirt easily and wouldn\u2019t ever be clean,\u201d he said. After viewing the Prospect Heights place, Ms. Konstantine spent the rest of the day in the area, getting a haircut and going shopping. In the process, she realized she had all she needed in Hamilton Heights. There was no need to move to Brooklyn, which she could easily visit. To her, the long subway trip was not a hardship: She could read. \u201cI love having time on the subway,\u201d she said. \u201cI am three chapters away from being in Brooklyn.\u201dAnd with their lease near expiration, the roommates learned they would face a rent increase of just 2 percent, to $2,193 a month.\u00a0They had a good relationship with their landlord. \u201cWe always pay the rent five days early,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cWe had this great renewal option. Jenna really wanted to stay. She felt really settled here, and none of the apartments we saw were really exceptional and were not better than what we have now.\u201d The roommates signed on for another year. The prospective third returned home for the summer.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t like the stairs. but it\u2019s something I can deal with,\u201d Ms. Konstantine said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the worst thing, I think I\u2019m doing O.K. I think everybody who lives up here sometimes wishes they were a little closer to downtown Manhattan, but it\u2019s only a swipe away,\u201d she said, referring to a subway-ride card.The one change: They switched bedrooms. It turned out that they hadn\u2019t been hanging out in Mr. Miller\u2019s room after all. The living room sufficed for that.\u201cDishes appear out of nowhere,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cDishes are not Jenna\u2019s strong suit. I realize laundry is more important, but I still wish we had a dishwasher.\u201dEmail: thehunt@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW Is Said to Cheat on Diesel Emissions; U.S. to Order Big Recall", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe expected better from Volkswagen,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, the E.P.A.\u2019s assistant administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance. She called the automaker\u2019s actions \u201ca threat to public health.\u201dAgency officials issued the car company a notice of violation and said it had admitted to the use of a so-called defeat device. The recall involves 4-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi vehicles from model years 2009-15.A spokeswoman for Volkswagen confirmed that the company had received the notice and said the automaker was cooperating with the investigation. She declined to comment further on the case.The software was designed to conceal the cars\u2019 emission of the pollutant nitrogen oxide, which contributes to the creation of ozone and smog. The pollutants are linked to a range of health problems, including asthma attacks, other respiratory diseases and premature death.Experts in automotive technology said that disengaging the pollution controls on a diesel-fueled car can yield better performance, including increased torque and acceleration. \u201cWhen the pollution controls are functioning on these vehicles, there\u2019s a trade-off between performance and emissions,\u201d said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research group. \u201cThis is cutting corners.\u201dIt was Mr. Kodjak\u2019s group, in conducting research on diesel vehicles, that first noticed the discrepancy between Volkswagen\u2019s emissions in testing laboratories and on the road. They brought the issue to the attention of the E.P.A., which conducted further tests on the cars, and ultimately discovered the use of the defeat device software. California has issued a separate notice of violation to the company. California, the E.P.A. and the Justice Department are working together on an investigation of the allegations.Over the next year, E.P.A. officials said, owners of the affected vehicles should expect to receive recall notices from the company, including information about how to get their cars repaired at no cost to them.The recall covers roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the United States since 2009.Friday\u2019s notice of violation was the Obama administration\u2019s \u201copening salvo\u201d in the Volkswagen case, said Thomas Reynolds, an E.P.A. spokesman. The Justice Department\u2019s investigation could ultimately result in fines or penalties for the company. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, the Justice Department could impose fines of as much as $37,500 for each recalled vehicle, for a possible total penalty of as much as $18 billion.The notice of violation is part of a broader, more aggressive enforcement effort by federal regulators on the auto industry. Analysts and activists said it was intended to send a message to automakers that they would be harshly treated for compromising federal rules.\u201cThis is several steps beyond the violations that we\u2019ve seen from other auto companies,\u201d said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThey appear to have designed a system with the intention to mislead consumers and the government. If that\u2019s proven true, it\u2019s remarkable and outrageous. It would merit a heck of a lot more than just a recall and a fine. We would see criminal prosecution.\u201d\u201cThey want to make it clear that they\u2019re going to crack down on cheaters,\u201d said Frank O\u2019Donnell, president of the environmental advocacy group Clean Air Watch. \u201cThey\u2019re cheating not only car buyers but the breathing public. They want to lay down the law, enforce the law and show they\u2019re not going to tolerate cheaters. The laws and regulation are only as good as the enforcement.\u201dNews of the recall request also arrives in the midst of the Frankfurt Motor Show, one of the biggest events on the auto industry calendar. Volkswagen has taken over an entire exhibition hall to show off its cars, while Audi has a separate pavilion.Volkswagen, which also owns the high-end sports car makers Porsche and Lamborghini, recently surpassed Toyota as the world\u2019s biggest automaker. But VW has been struggling to gain market share in the United States, where it has long been weak. The investigation is unlikely to help. In the eight months through August, sales of Volkswagen brand cars in the United States fell 3 percent, to 238,000 vehicles. By comparison, Toyota sold 1.15 million vehicles in the same period.Richard Corey, an executive officer on the California Air Resources Board, credited \u201cdogged detective work in the lab\u201d for the discovery of the software, which he said resulted in the admission from Volkswagen that the company was using the devices.E.P.A. officials declined to reveal why they chose to initiate the investigation.The Volkswagen case is not the first federal investigation into the use of defeat devices. In 2007, the federal government reached a landmark settlement requiring Casper\u2019s Electronics, of Mundelein, Ill., to stop selling the devices, and to pay a $74,000 civil penalty. The company had sold approximately 44,000 defeat devices through its website and retailers since 2001.Aaron M. Kessler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Smarter Way to Raise Paychecks", "Date": "2015-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLOCAL and state minimum-wage increases are in style this season, with cities nationwide moving toward a $15-an-hour floor. But simply mandating that employers pay more is a clumsy and potentially counterproductive way to help the poor. Although some workers gain, others lose out on jobs altogether, while consumers \u2014 many poor themselves \u2014 face higher prices.Still, if done right, increasing take-home pay for low-wage workers is the best way to tackle poverty: It responds to the challenging economic landscape facing unskilled workers by raising their incomes, while increasing the incentive for those outside the labor force to step onto the first rung of the economic ladder. And it does so without shoving the poor into government programs, instead integrating them into the economy and giving them resources to allocate on their own.The often-cited alternative to an increased minimum wage, the earned-income tax credit, gets rave reviews from economists and politicians from both parties. The credit, paid to low-income households as a tax refund, increases as income initially grows, and then decreases as income goes above the poverty line.On the blackboard, this approach appears ideal. Low-wage workers benefit from additional income, but employers do not face new costs that might drive them to reduce hiring or increase prices. To the contrary, the program functions as a subsidy from which employee and employer both benefit, expanding the labor force by producing an incentive to offer and accept low-wage work.But life is messier than a crisply drawn supply-and-demand graph. A worker receives the tax credit as an after-the-fact lump sum, producing a boom-and-bust cycle for household finances. Twenty percent of eligible households fail to claim the credit, and even among claimants, most of them do not understand its calculation or what portion of their refund it contributes, diluting its incentive. Even worse, because the credit phases out as earnings increase, many households face a significant disincentive to work longer hours or have another member work.For the economy as a whole, the earned-income tax credit has several advantages. But individual workers prefer the larger paycheck a minimum-wage increase offers. A different policy \u2014 a direct wage subsidy \u2014 can accomplish both.A direct wage subsidy pays additional dollars-per-hour to low-wage workers. A \u201ctarget wage,\u201d proportional to the median wage in each local market, defines when the subsidy is no longer required; a worker\u2019s subsidy is calculated as half the gap from market wage to target \u2014 that way it phases out gradually as the hourly rate increases. For example, if the target wage is $12 an hour, then a worker earning $8 an hour receives a $2 an hour subsidy, added by the government to the worker\u2019s paycheck.From the worker\u2019s perspective, this policy looks much like a minimum-wage increase. From the economy\u2019s perspective, it looks like the earned-income tax credit. A federal program could put at least $150 billion toward such a subsidy by replacing the $65 billion spent on the earned-income tax credit and redirecting current spending from other, less effective anti-poverty programs for the working poor.To appreciate the strengths of a wage subsidy over other wage supports, consider its performance on each relevant dimension.First are the incentive dimensions: the effect on the behavior of workers and employers. For workers, the wage subsidy and minimum wage both pay the same benefit rate regardless of total earnings, so the total benefit increases with each additional hour worked; the earned-income tax credit has the drawback of decreasing as hours increase. For employers, the wage subsidy operates like the tax credit to subsidize employment; the minimum wage raises labor costs and so reduces hiring.Second are the distribution dimensions: the effect on the recipients and payers of the benefit. The recipients of the subsidy are low-wage earners, so that, as with the minimum wage, all similarly situated workers are treated equally. The tax credit focuses on households based on their family structure and total income, which keeps costs down, but at the expense of distorting the labor market by discouraging hiring.Taxpayers, meaning disproportionately higher-income households, pay for the subsidy. This is a key advantage over the minimum-wage increase, whose cost must be borne by some combination of the employers, other employees and customers. While much debate surrounds the distribution of that burden, it cannot help but land more heavily on lower-income households than federal taxes do.Third are the experience dimensions: alignment with the needs of workers and the abilities of government and employers. The wage subsidy adopts the more desirable format for workers by delivering a clear benefit in every paycheck. Implementation of the wage subsidy may seem daunting, but adjusting worker paychecks based on earnings is something the federal government has decades of experience doing via the payroll tax.Politically, there is much for both the left and the right to like about a wage subsidy. It does not discourage hiring or raise prices, some of the right\u2019s main complaints about the minimum-wage increase. But it also lifts paychecks directly, which is what the left likes so much about raising the minimum wage.Best of all, it would use current government spending in a way that helps the poor find work and better helps the working poor \u2014 which should make everyone happy.Oren Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hispanics in Congress Ask Treasury to Prevent \u2018Catastrophe\u2019 in Puerto Rico", "Date": "2015-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of Hispanic members of Congress called on the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, to take a more muscular role in Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis and prevent what they said could become \u201can economic catastrophe\u201d on the island.The eight lawmakers, all Democrats, said bankruptcy was the \u201cbest hope\u201d both for Puerto Rico and its many creditors on the United States mainland. They urged Mr. Lew to work with Congress to move two pending bankruptcy bills forward, and to intervene in other ways, as Treasury secretaries did during the financial crisis of 2008.\u201cTreasury was instrumental to helping auto manufacturers weather tough times and stabilizing Wall Street during the 2008 crisis,\u201d said Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, a New York Democrat, who wrote the letter. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t play a similar role here.\u201dGeneral Motors and Chrysler were able to restructure their debts under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because the Treasury provided interim financing at a time when no private lender could be found. The auto restructurings also were handled by a special task force working out of the Treasury Department. Without the Treasury\u2019s help, many experts said at the time, G.M. in particular would have had to liquidate, with devastating effects on jobs and the economy.A spokesman for the Treasury Department said it was reviewing the letter.Financial officials in Puerto Rico have sought to convince the United States government that while the island needs help, they are committed to reforming its economy and restoring its credibility as a borrower. The island\u2019s Treasury Department said on Monday that it collected sales taxes of $191 million in August, which was 13.2 percent higher than expected.Larger tax collections suggest that some of the changes underway may be working \u2014 among them efforts to go after the underground economy. Sales taxes are especially important because a big share of that revenue is used to back a certain class of bonds, called Cofina bonds.Over all, Puerto Rico has been struggling with about $72 billion in bond debt and has called for a restructuring that would lower its payments to bondholders by about $13 billion over the next five years. The debts of two big public corporations, which provide electricity and water services on the island, are being handled separately. The electric utility, known as Prepa, recently agreed on the terms of a restructuring with one group of bondholders; on Friday the two banks that finance Prepa\u2019s energy purchases must decide whether they also want to continue restructuring talks.The five-year plan calls for restructuring about $47 billion of Puerto Rico\u2019s $72 billion in bond debt and carrying out economic overhauls under an independent financial control board.Despite bright spots here and there, Puerto Rico continues to warn that its total debt is unpayable and that its inability to obtain protection in the federal bankruptcy courts makes any resolution much more difficult. Bills introduced in both houses of Congress would give Puerto Rico the power to send some parts of its government into Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy, but Republican lawmakers have shown little enthusiasm.Representative Jeff Duncan, a Republican of South Carolina, said in a letter in June that bankruptcy protection amounted to \u201ca financial bailout of Puerto Rican debt,\u201d which would \u201cprovide only temporary benefit.\u201dIn July, Secretary Lew said in a letter to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Republican of Utah, that he was concerned about Puerto Rico\u2019s lack of any legal framework for solving its debt. Without one, he said, the island faced \u201ca protracted and disorderly restructuring process\u201d that would \u201ccause long-term damage to the health, safety and financial well-being of the families living and working in Puerto Rico.\u201dLast week, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, said a team of experts on the island had projected its cash flows over the next five years and determined that the island had the means to pay just $5 billion of the $18 billion it is scheduled to pay its creditors over that time.He called on the investors who hold the bonds to help work out a plan for distributing the resulting $13 billion of losses. But they have so far been unsupportive. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to play something of a political game,\u201d said Daniel Irvin, chief executive of Capital Security Advisors L.L.C., a fund that holds several types of Puerto Rican debt. He said he thought the governor wanted to look as if his administration were making profound structural changes on the island, when his priority was really to pit different bondholder groups against each other.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot less expensive for the commonwealth to have the investors pay for the legal battle\u201d over which bonds have the highest priority, he said. If Puerto Rico defaults on any bonds while the investors are quarreling, he said, the governor will be able to put the blame on them, \u201cthe greedy Wall Street vulture capitalists.\u201dIn appealing to Mr. Lew for help, the Hispanic members of Congress said, \u201cWe believe that the Department of Treasury is uniquely positioned to promote a fair and efficient outcome.\u201d Aside from Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez, the signers represented California, New Jersey, Texas and Arizona.Advertisement"}

(A lot of the music she\u2019s looking for has something to do with her own background: raised in Illinois, her parents are from Taiwan and East Timor.) She achieves fluency in new languages in order to improvise within them; she studies their narrative traditions in order to write within them.Her pattern of working might suggest the opposite of the traditional jazz musician. Instead of staying inside the New York gig economy, she leaves for long stretches, undertaking travel and research projects to build new work for special concerts and carefully constructed records.

Like many Googlers, she has an enviable academic background, including a master\u2019s degree from Harvard. But her degree, from Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education, had to do with the interactions between neuroscience and teaching, a field far removed from software engineering. In 2013, Google hired Ms. Marchisio as a customer service representative, a job that paid the bills but failed to ignite her intellectual passions.\u201cI\u2019m superexcited with efforts to get girls and young people into coding, but for a long time I\u2019ve thought, \u2018What about me?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Marchisio said. \u201cI\u2019m here now, I\u2019m already in the work force. You can have me tomorrow if you just train me.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t turn you into a Nobel laureate,\u201d Mr. Thrun told me. \u201cBut what we can do is something like upskilling \u2014 you\u2019re a smart person, but the skills you have are inadequate for the current job market, or don\u2019t let you get the job you aspire to have. We can help you get those skills.\u201dIf predictions about the potential for technology to substantially improve education smell to you like Silicon Valley peyote, I don\u2019t blame you. Computers have long been held up as a magic bullet for learning, and they\u2019ve constantly failed to deliver; higher education has only become more expensive and less accessible alongside the rise of digital technology.Actually, that didn\u2019t happen. Mr. Thrun now says that in its first incarnation as a MOOC that tried to offer students a broad, general-purpose education, Udacity attracted many people to its classes, but just about everyone failed to complete the work. So in 2013, Mr. Thrun began reimagining Udacity not as a replacement to universities, but as a more practical vocational school that offered highly structured lessons to help people find jobs.In an economy constantly riven by technological change, Mr. Thrun says he believes periodic vocational training will become increasingly important in the job market. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think that a single college education can carry you for a lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cTo keep pace with change, your education has to be done throughout your life.\u201dSo far, Udacity\u2019s new model shows a glimmer of success. A year after the program\u2019s start, the company has 10,000 students enrolled in its nanodegree courses, and the number is growing by a third every month. Udacity charges $200 a month for the courses (students can take as little or as much time as they want to finish). When they successfully complete a course, Udacity gives back half the tuition. The company says that a typical student will earn a nanodegree in about five months \u2014 in other words, for around $500.Because students take several months or longer to complete their degrees, it is too soon to tell exactly how many will finish. So far, Udacity estimates the graduation rate to be about 25 percent. Thousands of workers have earned degrees, and hundreds have found new jobs as a result.Mr. Thrun attributes part of the success to the course material, which was developed in conjunction with companies to teach skills that they look for in employees. For instance, Udacity\u2019s Android course is staffed by instructors from Google, which developed the mobile operating system. Udacity\u2019s model also a puts a premium on one-on-one coaching, mentorship, career counseling and job-interviewing skills, all of which keep students more invested in their work.The absence of human interaction has long bedeviled online education, but Mr. Thrun has found a way to offer personalized teaching systems on a wide scale while keeping costs low. He does so using a proven Internet trick \u2014 online outsourcing. Udacity has a network of paid graders across the world who are well versed in each of its courses; when students submit their projects, one of these graders picks up the work and quickly assesses it, including detailed comments about the student\u2019s progress. The graders can earn $50 to $100 an hour.\u201cWith what I earned last month, I can take a trip to Europe,\u201d Aparna Sridhar, a Udacity grader in Chennai, India, told me.I spoke to several students who described Udacity as life-changing. One was Dan Haddigan, 28, who graduated from art school with a degree in printmaking and worked for several years at an art gallery in Philadelphia. Last year, he contemplated going back to graduate school for art but heard about Udacity and decided coding was more practical. The nanodegree was challenging. For several months, he said, \u201cI would wake up, work on projects for Udacity, go to work at the gallery, come home, then try to get more work on my projects.\u201d The course \u2014 in web development \u2014 took about five months, costing him $500. But Mr. Haddigan said the work proved rewarding. After finishing his degree, he found a listing for a job at IntuitSolutions, a web development agency.He hesitated in applying. \u201cI thought, who am I?,\u201d he said. \u201cI just took an online course and I\u2019m applying for these full-time jobs. They\u2019re going to laugh me out of the interview.\u201dThey didn\u2019t. He got the job.An earlier version of this article misstated Google\u2019s relationship to the mobile operating system Android.

{"Headline": "A Toxic Work World", "Date": "2015-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFOR many Americans, life has become all competition all the time. Workers across the socioeconomic spectrum, from hotel housekeepers to surgeons, have stories about toiling 12- to 16-hour days (often without overtime pay) and experiencing anxiety attacks and exhaustion. Public health experts have begun talking about stress as an epidemic.The people who can compete and succeed in this culture are an ever-narrower slice of American society: largely young people who are healthy, and wealthy enough not to have to care for family members. An individual company can of course favor these individuals, as health insurers once did, and then pass them off to other businesses when they become parents or need to tend to their own parents. But this model of winning at all costs reinforces a distinctive American pathology of not making room for caregiving. The result: We hemorrhage talent and hollow out our society.To begin with, we are losing women. America has unlocked the talent of its women in a way that few nations can match; girls are outpacing boys in high schools, universities and graduate schools and are now entering the work force at higher salaries. But the ranks of those women still thin significantly as they rise toward the top, from more than 50 percent at entry level to 10 to 20 percent in senior management. Far too many discover that what was once a manageable and enjoyable work-family balance can no longer be sustained \u2014 regardless of ambition, confidence or even a partner who shares tasks equally.Every family\u2019s situation is different; some women may be able to handle with ease conditions that don\u2019t work for others. But many women who started out with all the ambition in the world find themselves in a place they never expected to be. They do not choose to leave their jobs; they are shut out by the refusal of their bosses to make it possible for them to fit their family life and their work life together. In her book \u201cOpting Out? Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home,\u201d the sociologist Pamela Stone calls this a \u201cforced choice.\u201d \u201cDenial of requests to work part time, layoffs or relocations,\u201d she writes, will push even the most ambitious woman out of the work force.A young lawyer I know from Virginia was offered a general counsel position, which she determined she could take but only if she could work from home one day a week to be with her two children. Her employer refused. Still another woman wrote to me about her aspiration to an executive-level position and the predicament of doing so with a 2-year-old at home: \u201cThe dilemma is in no way the result of having a toddler: After all, executive men seem to enjoy increased promotions with every additional offspring. It is the way work continues to be circumscribed as something that happens \u2018in an office,\u2019 and/or \u2018between 8\u20136\u2019 that causes such conflict. I haven\u2019t yet been presented with a shred of reasonable justification for insisting my job requires me to be sitting in this fixed, 15 sq foot room, 20 miles from my home.\u201dTHE problem is with the workplace, or more precisely, with a workplace designed for the \u201cMad Men\u201d era, for \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d families in which one partner does all the work of earning an income and the other partner does all the work of turning that income into care \u2014 the care that is indispensable for our children, our sick and disabled, our elderly. Our families and our responsibilities don\u2019t look like that anymore, but our workplaces do not fit the realities of our lives.After careful study, Professors Padavic, Ely and Reid found that an equal number of men and women had left the firm in the preceding three years, a simple fact that contradicted management\u2019s women, work and family story. Some of the men also left because of the long hours; others \u201csuffered in silence or otherwise made do.\u201d The firm\u2019s key human resources problem was not gender, as management believed, but rather a culture of overwork.The firm\u2019s leadership resisted these findings. They didn\u2019t want to be told that they needed to overhaul their entire organizational philosophy or that they were overpromising to clients and overdelivering (for example, making hundred-slide PowerPoint presentations that the client couldn\u2019t even use). They wanted to be told that the firm\u2019s problem was work-family conflict for women, a narrative that would allow them to adopt a set of policies specifically aimed at helping women work part time, or be mentored, or join support networks. As Professors Padavic, Ely and Reid wryly concluded, their attitude \u201crequired a rejection of evidence on the part of evidence-driven analysts.\u201dBad work culture is everyone\u2019s problem, for men just as much as for women. It\u2019s a problem for working parents, not just working mothers. For working children who need time to take care of their own parents, not just working daughters. For anyone who does not have the luxury of a full-time lead parent or caregiver at home.EVEN if men and women join forces to demand changes in the workplace, though, we cannot do this alone, as individuals trying to make our lives work and as workers and bosses trying to make room for care. Some other company can always keep prices down by demanding more, burning out its employees and casting them aside when they are done. To be fully competitive as a country, we are going to have to emulate other industrialized countries and build an infrastructure of care. We used to have one; it was called women at home. But with 57 percent of those women in the labor force, that infrastructure has crumbled and it\u2019s not coming back.To support care just as we support competition, we will need some combination of the following: high-quality and affordable child care and elder care; paid family and medical leave for women and men; a right to request part-time or flexible work; investment in early education comparable to our investment in elementary and secondary education; comprehensive job protection for pregnant workers; higher wages and training for paid caregivers; community support structures to allow elders to live at home longer; and reform of elementary and secondary school schedules to meet the needs of a digital rather than an agricultural economy.Republican senators have sponsored a bill that would allow employers to offer employees paid leave hours instead of overtime pay; some polls show that a majority of women who vote Republican support paid family leave. Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, is co-leader of a bipartisan caucus across both the Senate and the House devoted to assisting family caregivers. She follows in the footsteps of former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, who successfully sponsored legislation to allow homemakers to contribute to retirement accounts the same way that salaried workers can. And as the baby boom becomes an elder boom, we can expect a whole new constituency for care, on both sides of the aisle.Change in our individual workplaces and in our broader politics also depends on culture change: fundamental shifts in the way we think, talk and confer prestige. If we really valued care, we would not regard time out for caregiving \u2014 for your children, parents, spouse, sibling or any other member of your extended or constructed family \u2014 as a black hole on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. We would see it as engaging in a socially, personally and professionally valuable activity. We would see men who lean out for care as role models just as much as women who lean in for work. We would think managing kids matters as much as managing money.Impossible, right? Yet I grew up in a society where my mother set out little vases of cigarettes on the table at dinner parties, where blacks and whites had to use different bathrooms, and in which almost everyone claimed to be heterosexual. That seems a lifetime ago, but I\u2019m not so old. Our world has changed over the past 50 years, vastly for the better from the point of view of African-Americans, the L.G.B.T. community and families who lost loved ones to lung cancer. Given the magnitude of that change, think about how much we can still do.We can, all of us, stand up for care. Until we do, men and women will never be equal; not while both are responsible for providing cash but only women are responsible for providing care. And though individual Americans might win out in our current system, America as a whole will never be as competitive as it ought to be. If we do not act, over time our families and communities, the foundation of our flourishing, will wither.The women\u2019s movement has brought many of us the right to compete on equal terms; it\u2019s time for all of us to claim an equal right to care.Anne-Marie Slaughter is the president of New America, a think tank and civic enterprise, and author of the forthcoming \u201cUnfinished Business: Women Men Work Family,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lambert: Chief Executive of Planet Montblanc", "Date": "2015-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 The headquarters of Montblanc, a maker of luxury writing instruments, leather goods and watches, is in a tidy but unpretentious cluster of factory buildings at the edge of a drab industrial district in this port city.It is perhaps not as posh a neighborhood as one would expect for a company whose watches can cost close to half a million euros.But a more rarefied environment awaits visitors in the low-rise building that includes the office of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lambert, 46, Montblanc\u2019s chief executive since 2013. The lobby is filled with the works of contemporary artists, including a facsimile of an Apollo lunar lander made of cardboard and plastic tubing by Tom Sachs, the New York artist known for his obsession with the space program.The message could be that, in the timepiece universe, Montblanc is on its own planet. And in many ways it is.Founded in 1906 as a maker of pens, Montblanc began offering watches in 1997. Its most exclusive models can take years to build by hand, by craftspeople who use microscopes for the most detailed work. A single watchmaker is responsible for designing and building a watch and then servicing it afterward. Customers are sometimes flown in by private jet to pick up their purchases.\u2018\u2018There are 46 people and we do 40 watches a year,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lambert said, referring to the workshop in Villeret, Switzerland, where Montblanc\u2019s most expensive watches are produced. The workshop, formerly known as Minerva and with roots going back to 1858, has been producing watches under the Montblanc name since 2010. (All Montblanc watches are made in Switzerland.)Yet as Mr. Lambert tells it, even the most exclusive watch brands are vulnerable to some of the same market forces that buffet the makers of any consumer product \u2014 recently, challenges such as the economic slowdown in China and other emerging markets or the strength of the Swiss franc.Montblanc customers, though by definition very wealthy, often time their purchases to currency fluctuations, Mr. Lambert said, buying when the market favors their own legal tender. And as they tend to be frequent fliers, many typically visit Montblanc stores, often in different parts of the world, several times before buying.\u2018\u2018They are ultrainformed,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lambert continued. \u2018\u2018We are in products that are quite rare, that are not affordable products. For many of our clients it\u2019s an emotional decision, but one that takes time to be achieved.\u2019\u2019Just as Montblanc customers are highly attuned to financial markets, the company\u2019s business is influenced by the value of the dollar and the euro, though often in ways that are difficult to predict and slow to materialize.\u2018\u2018Our business is very, very, very globalized. If you isolate one factor, you have only one third\u2019\u2019 of the overall picture, Mr. Lambert said. When economic shocks strike somewhere in the world, he continued, \u2018\u2018most of the time you don\u2019t have an impact the next day.\u2019\u2019Mr. Lambert takes a nuanced view of China, where sales of luxury goods have been hurt by slumping stock prices, a slowing economy and a political climate that discourages conspicuous consumption.He said it was a mistake to look at the Chinese market as monolithic. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re in the Chengdu region, it\u2019s not that the Shanghai Stock Exchange is not important for you, but the local economic environment is having quite an impact,\u2019\u2019 he said. And he noted that many wealthy Chinese buyers made their purchases abroad, perhaps during a stopover in Dubai or the Montblanc shop on Madison Avenue in New York, where they would not be recorded as Asian sales.Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont, the Geneva-based luxury goods group that owns Montblanc as well as brands such as Cartier, Piaget and Van Cleef & Arpels, described the Asian market as \u2018\u2018difficult\u2019\u2019 in its most recent financial report. Sales of specialist watches, a category that also includes other Richemont brands like Jaeger-LeCoultre, rose 5 percent in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, to 3.1 billion euros, or $3.5 billion. But operating profit in the category fell 6 percent, to \u00a4730 million, because of restrained purchasing by customers in China, the company said, as well as the strong Swiss franc. Montblanc declined to provide its own revenue figures.Mr. Lambert said that any slackness in China had been partly offset by growth in other developing markets like India or emerging African countries like Angola or Morocco. Montblanc is already looking for partners in Iran, he noted, now that economic sanctions are likely to be phased out.Brazil is doing well despite that country\u2019s economic problems, Mr. Lambert said. The decline of the Brazilian real has encouraged Brazilians to shop at home, benefiting Montblanc, which already had a strong retail presence there. \u2018\u2018The percentage of people buying in Brazil today is much higher than it used to be two or three years ago,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that the company would open two new boutiques in the country this year.Montblanc has 260 of its own stores worldwide, plus about 240 boutiques operated by franchise partners.Although Montblanc may be best known for writing instruments, Mr. Lambert\u2019s career has been spent in the watch business. In 1996, he joined Jaeger-LeCoultre, which is based in Le Sentier, Switzerland, as a financial controller. Three years later he became chief financial officer and then, in 2002, chief executive. In 2013, Richemont sent Mr. Lambert, a compactly built marathon runner who is fluent in German as well as English and his native French, to Hamburg.Despite his background in watches, Mr. Lambert said he divided his time roughly evenly among the company\u2019s watches, writing instruments and leather goods, a category that includes briefcases and mobile phone covers.An issue for Mr. Lambert recently \u2014 one all watchmakers face \u2014 has been to determine what response, if any, is needed to the arrival of smartwatches and particularly the Apple Watch.Luxury mechanical watches are, by definition, anachronistic and changeless. The point isn\u2019t just that they tell time, but that they do so in a way that is aloof from the rush of technology. At the same time, the potential of Apple to disrupt the watch market is not something that anyone in the industry can ignore.Montblanc\u2019s response has been to incorporate digital functions into the strap, which is replaced periodically anyway and thus more in sync with the swift obsolescence of digital devices, Mr. Lambert said. The Montblanc e-Strap, a \u00a4300 option introduced in August, offers functions such as flight information or activity tracking and can communicate with Apple or Android devices.\u2018\u2018We like to imagine that our products are lifetime companions,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lambert said. \u2018\u2018The accessories are different. A leather strap is replaced after a while.\u2019\u2019As for his favorite watch, it is called the ExoTourbillon Minute Chronograph Vasco da Gama Limited Edition 60. Named for the Portuguese explorer who pioneered a sea route to India, the watch features a dial made of aventurine, a kind of quartz, meant to suggest stars twinkling in the night sky as seen from the deck of a ship. There is a diamond at 12 o\u2019clock.The name ExoTourbillon refers to the tourbillon, a mechanism that helps keep a watch accurate no matter how it is held. The Vasco da Gama is part of a line of watches where the tourbillon is positioned above the dial, where it can be admired. \u2018\u2018I like that combination of manufacturing execution and technical inventiveness,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Lambert, who during the interview was wearing an \u00a411,900 limited-edition Heritage Chronom\u00e9trie Quanti\u00e8me Annuel from the da Gama line.The ExoTourbillon da Gama sells for \u00a448,000 in Germany. On Planet Montblanc, that counts as affordable.Advertisement"}
