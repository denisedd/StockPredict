{"Headline": "Capitalists, Arise!: Q. & A. With Peter Georgescu", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorGlobalizationSo the other critical piece to the puzzle is education. Here I mean more than just four-year college degrees. We also need to teach and train for specific existing and new skills. Trade schools for the young and retraining those who lose jobs is key. Private industry with help from local or state and federal governments will be a vital initiative to both keep us competitive and create the new jobs critical for economic growth and well-being.Tax incentivesFirst, I feel strongly that most of us benefit from working for a living. It\u2019s more than just about money. It can bring meaning, dignity and satisfaction to our lives. We feel better earning our daily bread than having it just gifted to us. Long-term, both workers and businesses will benefit greatly by better treated, better paid and better motivated employees.Second, it is morally right. Employees are vital corporate stakeholders with rights. Shareholders also have rights, but they do not have a legitimate right to short-term maximization. Shareholders are not the owners of a corporation in a legal sense or a moral sense. In a legal sense, the corporation owns its own assets (that is the preponderance of legal opinion) Employees are the vital value creators. They deserve fair pay for the value they help produce. And studies have proved again and again that better motivated employees produce better returns to all stakeholders over time: the shareholder, the employees, the corporation itself.First, people are concerned because government is too big, wasteful and inefficient. Sadly, there is a lot of truth to this. But government can become smart, frugal and accountable. Programs must be evaluated, fixed or killed. Measurement and accountability should be the hallmark of all government spending. We, the rich and the less rich, must demand it.Second, people want to pay only the taxes owed. Period. Well, the problem is a broken tax code. It must be fixed to be simple, transparent and fair for all. (All those tax loopholes, broomed.)Third, many wealthy people use their wealth wisely. Private philanthropy in this country helps us get the finest academic medical centers, best schools and universities, art of all varieties. Close to $250 billion in private philanthropy annually help make this nation be a more civilized place.Finally, wealth creation should be an incentive to build businesses, to add jobs. Overtaxing does, at some point, deter investments and job creation.We must demand of government greater accountability, measurement and efficiency. In that light, increasing taxes when necessary is wise. But balanced budgets are also wise. Paying interest on debt is expensive and wasteful.That said, if people felt our tax dollars were well spent, and the reasons for more taxes were clear and worthy \u2014 people would feel a lot better about higher taxes.Government involvement With this, a background. I am simply trying to give businesses some air cover to demonstrate that paying employees, including executives, more works. That investing more money in R&D to foster innovation works. Shareholders will see that, over time, they are likely to do as well or even better. (See Jagdish Sheth and others\u2019 book, \u201cFirms of Endearment.\u201d)The point is simple. Let\u2019s break the current logjam. Let\u2019s be practical. To keep doing the same thing while expecting different results is not just insanity \u2014 it\u2019s simply not practical.By paying people more, everyone wins: the people, their families, the economy \u2014 because of growth in consumption, and the government, through higher taxes (and in some cases, lower entitlements).1. Not sure why all of a sudden the government has to get involved to incentivize higher wages. That kind of flies in the face of the case you made that wealthy businesses have to do this or face the consequences. I understand it is a good business strategy to get something if you can, but I would say no to that (if I was the government). Sounds like NOT doing it is a bad business decision.Your idea deserves serious consideration from governments (local and federal) to provide creative tax incentives to build new business. The obvious rewards are compelling. A great suggestion.Student loans/college debt Clearly the cost of education is out of control. Before long we will see a revolutionary development in meaningful online education. The online quality will improve and provide both the engagement and networking now available in traditional schools at a very modest cost.I must also call out the poor quality of current education. Our kids rank in the lowest quartile among developed nations on basic skills and competencies. We generally know how to fix our problems. We have plenty of workable solutions tested that are also scalable. Now we need the will to break through the barriers and complexities and provide the needed resources.Frankly, we must make sure that quality education from the age of 3 is available to all children, without the burden of crippling debt.Schools must reform to deliver better education at lower costs, online education to provide equal or superior results must emerge, and some form of debt forgiveness must be provided to the folks currently in debt. Superior education to all, including new trade schools, are essential for our national security, for our economic growth and well-being.Small businessesThe 2016 electionInequality is at the top. It\u2019s not income equality we should seek. It\u2019s equality of opportunity that becomes imperative. Equality of opportunity is what has made America strong, what has kept our democracy alive. That\u2019s the definition of the American dream. Without that we see our middle class vanishing and both social and economic inequality accelerating. Our education, immigration, the environment, energy economic growth and jobs, our tax code. All issues which must be addressed with solutions to be implemented.I am for the candidate who has the vision, skills and competence to address these issues. I want, I demand specifics. I will seek practical, viable solutions. That\u2019s who will be my candidate. I want a person of integrity, competence and compassion. I want a person who wants to serve, not to be served. That\u2019s who will be my candidate and get my vote.I am convinced that person will emerge.Is capitalism under threat? A quick prelude is that I fear that our capitalist model is in danger. In the early days of capitalism (here in the US and elsewhere) companies were mostly family owned and run even for generations. Now we have the board, stockholders and CEO model, which appears very flawed. The stockholders often are just looking for short term gain, the board has no real ties to or \u2018skin\u2019 in the company, and the CEO is often colluding with the stockholders for short term gain.But that extraordinary engine has been hijacked by a rogue philosophy that says that shareholders\u2019 interests come first and which threatens to destroy both this magnificent engine and our very way of life. The misguided philosophy says that one of a corporation\u2019s stakeholders, the shareholders, deserves to have their value maximized in the short term. The three other vital stakeholders are not adequately represented at the decision-making table and inadequately compensated. First, the employees \u2014 who are the real value creators. They have been turned into a cost to be squeezed. Then, the corporation itself, where investment in R&D and innovation is grossly inadequate. Finally, a business\u2019s customers, who should be a corporation\u2019s prime stakeholder \u2014 not the shareholders.Even the moral justification that the shareholder is the owner and an owner gets what they want when they want it is a myth. In fact the shareholder is a mentor at best. They come into stock when they want and leave at their will. And they are of course immune from any corporation liabilities. That\u2019s not ownership. The preponderance of legal opinion is clear. The corporation owns its own assets, not the shareholder.So yes, we must rebalance a business\u2019s incremental value returns among the key stakeholders \u2014 the employees, the shareholders and the corporation itself. And we must always put the customer\u2019s interests first.If we do that, we can liberate free enterprise from its present-day shackles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soothing Talk by Federal Reserve Official Buoys Wall Street", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce again, the Federal Reserve helped save the day for investors.The United States stock market soared in late trading on Wednesday, shrugging off earlier declines in China and Europe. The powerful rally, which came after several days of severe plunges in the world\u2019s major stock markets, was inspired by soothing words from an influential Fed policy maker. At a news briefing in New York, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the recent turmoil in the financial markets was a risk to the United States economy. Crucially, he added that he found the prospect of raising interest rates next month \u201cless compelling.\u201d Mr. Dudley\u2019s words were manna for investors who had been starved of good news in recent days. On Thursday, stocks in Asia opened broadly higher for the first time since last week, including in Shanghai, where the main index was up more than 2 percent. Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial, said the remarks were \u201clikely to have influence well beyond today.\u201d On Wednesday in the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broad measure of the market, closed 3.9 percent higher, at 1,940.51. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average gained almost 4 percent, or 619 points, to end at 16,285.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained more than 4.2 percent to end at 4,697.54. It was the first positive day for all three market indicators after six days of losses.The respite from selling may yet prove to be temporary, but the trading on Wednesday showed that the Fed still holds a strong sway over investors\u2019 sentiment.Until the recent sell-off, investors had been betting that the Fed would raise interest rates for the first time in nine years at its September meeting. Now, after Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments, a rate increase next month appeared to be all the more unlikely. \u201cFrom my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September F.O.M.C. meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u201d he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that steers monetary policy. Mr. Dudley is a member of the committee.Those words raised hopes that a long-running era of cheap money that has buoyed markets would run a bit longer, at least past the next F.O.M.C. meeting on Sept. 16 and 17. \u201cI do not believe that Fed officials thought financial markets were quite as fragile as they proved to be in the last week, and they tend not to want to tighten policy during these periods of market turmoil,\u201d said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon, who keeps a close watch on the Fed.More broadly, Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments on Wednesday underscore a relationship between the Fed and financial markets that some analysts have come to describe as unhealthy.During the financial crisis about seven years ago, the Fed became the central bank to the world, providing emergency loans to global banks and funneling dollars to countries where there were shortages. The stimulus helped bring the financial system back from the brink of collapse and fueled a recovery in the United States that has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs.Still, in recent years, the Fed\u2019s ultralow interest rates may have also pushed stock and bond prices to what appeared to be unsustainable highs. Many investors even saw the plunges of the last few days as a healthy corrective to the ebullience. And some analysts have asserted that a September rate increase might be a good thing for stock and bond markets, because it would remove a nagging source of uncertainty.If the Fed does hold off on raising rates, it may seem like an indulgent overreaction, especially if stocks climb back to their recent peaks.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Stock market slides need not do collateral damage to the real economy \u2014 which Mr. Dudley seemed to acknowledge on Wednesday. \u201cThe stock market has to move a lot \u2014 and stay there \u2014 to have implications for the U.S. economy,\u201d he said. He also suggested that a September rate increase could still occur if economic and financial conditions were to steady.Even with Wednesday\u2019s rally, the S.&P. 500 is down nearly 6 percent this year, but it is no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for a market\u2019s being down 10 percent or more from its most recent high. After the rally, the benchmark is now down 8.9 percent from its high, reached in May. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 11 percent from its high, also reached in May. The stock market was powered higher on Wednesday by technology stocks, including Google, which rose 8 percent on the day. Trading was less volatile than it has been in some recent sessions, with Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge, the Vix index, down for a second consecutive day. In other markets, oil was weaker, with the benchmark United States crude contract falling 1.91 percent, to $38.56 a barrel.The recent sell-off in stocks has wiped about $1 trillion of value from the S.&P. 500, depleting households\u2019 nest eggs and perhaps delaying some spending. The S.&P. 500 is now lower than its peak in 2000, adjusting for inflation, according to data compiled by Prof. Robert J. Shiller of Yale.Still, stock market corrections have often come and gone, usually with little consequence. And, importantly, they do not always signal tough economic times ahead.\u201cCorrections are generally three times as frequent as recessions,\u201d David Bianco, a strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said in an email, referring to the period since 1960. \u201cThis time I think the cause isn\u2019t about U.S. recession risk.\u201dThe last time the stock market declined more than 10 percent was in 2011. But the United States economy has mostly grown steadily since then. Corrections hit the stock market in 1997, 1998 and 1999, according to data from S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, and in each of those years the United States economy grew by more than 4 percent. This shows that stock market corrections can be relatively isolated events that are driven more by concerns about the strength of corporate profits. Mr. Bianco noted that the profits of companies within the S.&P. 500 had been flat in recent quarters and were likely to remain sluggish for a while. \u201cI believe that is the cause of the correction,\u201d he said.The recent wave of selling was set off in part by China\u2019s surprise devaluation of its currency, the renminbi, on Aug. 11.Since the country\u2019s stock market started plunging in June, after a rally that more than doubled share values in a year, China\u2019s leaders have been scrambling to prop up the markets. But shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen have continued to slide. Officials now appear to be tacitly acknowledging the failure of their efforts to rescue shares.Li Kui-Wai, an associate professor of economics and finance at the City University of Hong Kong, said such measures amounted to \u201cfinancial socialism.\u201d\u201cBasically they just try to bail out everything,\u201d Mr. Li said on Wednesday. \u201cThe market is unsure about what China can do or will do, other than interfering in it,\u201d he added, referring to the state measures.Binyamin Appelbaum, Neil Gough and David Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Un-Greek Tragedies in Puerto Rico and Appalachia", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Friday the government of Puerto Rico announced that it was about to miss a bond payment. It claimed that for technical legal reasons this wouldn\u2019t be a default, but that\u2019s a distinction without a difference.So is Puerto Rico America\u2019s Greece? No, it isn\u2019t, and it\u2019s important to understand why.Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal crisis is basically the byproduct of a severe economic downturn. The commonwealth\u2019s government was slow to adjust to the worsening fundamentals, papering over the problem with borrowing. And now it has hit the wall.What went wrong? There was a time when the island did quite well as a manufacturing center, boosted in part by a special federal tax break. But that tax break expired in 2006, and in any case changes in the world economy have worked against Puerto Rico.These days manufacturing favors either very-low-wage nations, or locations close to markets that can take advantage of short logistic chains to respond quickly to changing conditions. But Puerto Rico\u2019s wages aren\u2019t low by global standards. And its island location puts it at a disadvantage compared not just with the U.S. mainland but with places like the north of Mexico, from which goods can be quickly shipped by truck.The situation is, unfortunately, exacerbated by the Jones Act, which requires that goods traveling between Puerto Rico and the mainland use U.S. ships, raising transportation costs even further.Puerto Rico, then, is in the wrong place at the wrong time. But here\u2019s the thing: while the island\u2019s economy has declined sharply, its population, while hurting, hasn\u2019t suffered anything like the catastrophes we see in Europe. Look, for example, at consumption per capita, which has fallen 30 percent in Greece but has actually continued to rise in Puerto Rico. Why have the human consequences of economic troubles been muted?And how terrible is that, really? The safety net is there to protect people, not places. If a regional economy is left stranded by the shifting tides of globalization, well, that\u2019s going to happen now and then. What\u2019s important is that workers be able to find opportunities somewhere, and that those unable for whatever reason to take advantage of these opportunities be protected from extreme hardship.There is, of course, the problem of maintaining public services for those who remain. Compared with Europe, America benefits hugely from having an integrated national budget \u2013 but it\u2019s not integrated enough to deal with really big regional shocks. And Puerto Rico faces some risk of a death spiral in which the emigration of working-age residents undermines the tax base for those who are left, and deteriorating public services then lead to even more emigration.Overall, however, the Puerto Rican story is one of bad times that fall well short of utter disaster. And the saving grace in this situation is big government \u2014 a federal system that provides a crucial safety net for American citizens in times of need, wherever they happen to live.Charles M. Blow is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Data Capture the True Health of the Creative Economy?", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookThe overarching problem that the F.M.C. has with the article is the macronarrative that musicians are doing slightly better than they were in the pre-Napster era, and that there are more people creating and performing music for a living. That criticism seems to be built out of two related objections: 1) that the essential question of whether musicians are faring better is unknowable, given the limitations of the data sets; and 2) that the data we included were cherry-picked to advance an \u201cagenda\u201d or thesis of positive growth in the music industry.In terms of the first objection, the post\u2019s authors write: \u201cIf you want to know how musicians are faring, you have to ask musicians, preferably a whole lot of them. You\u2019ll get different answers from different musicians, and they\u2019ll all be correct in terms of their own experiences. But your overall understanding will better reflect the complexity of the landscape.\u201d This is certainly true, and the F.M.C. is doing a tremendous job asking those kinds of questions. But as a society, we still find it useful and instructive to look at, say, national unemployment or G.D.P. statistics, even though there will be \u201cdifferent answers for different employers\u201d inside those numbers. Sometimes it\u2019s useful to zoom out and take the bird\u2019s-eye perspective, particularly if there is a widely held belief that a specific industry is on the edge of collapse.The F.M.C. authors are undoubtedly right that it is impossible to know exactly how many musicians are working in the United States right now, and how much money they are making. This is true of dentists and freelance writers and the manufacturing sector as well. It\u2019s in the very nature of national economic storytelling that the data are rough and a little murky. But the question is whether there is enough signal in that noise to discern broad trends in the industry \u2014 enough to say with some confidence if the bottom is falling out of the music business, or if things seem to be relatively stable.As for the suggestion that I selected only the data points that supported my argument and ignored other evidence, this is demonstrably untrue. If I had wanted to cherry-pick positive stats about the music business, I would have written this:Since 1999, according to the Department of Labor, the number of songwriters and music directors has risen by almost 250 percent. In the last 10 years, rising median wages for musicians have outpaced the rest of the economy by 50 percent. According to E.S.M.I., the number of self-employed musicians has increased by 45 percent since Napster launched. And a number of key statistics suggest that the music business is getting more egalitarian, with superstars taking a smaller piece of the pie.That\u2019s the paragraph you write if you are trying to skew the data to support a rosy argument. Technically speaking, every fact in that paragraph is true. But I used only one of those statistics (the E.S.M.I. number) because those isolated facts aren\u2019t representative of the broader trends that the numbers suggest when seen as a whole. That\u2019s why I included the lower number on composer/director wages from the O.E.S.; that\u2019s why I included the statistic about revenues for musicians being flat according to the Economic Census. We could have made the article even more rosy by reminding readers that the starting point for our study was 1999, at the height of the greatest economic expansion in United States history, while the contemporary numbers all date from the tail of the Great Recession.Interestingly, in all the responses to the article, no one so far has been able to suggest a data source that suggests that mean or median incomes for musicians have declined since 1999, adjusted for inflation. Everything that I have uncovered in many months of researching this article suggests that the story of music since 1999 is one of steady but small growth for musicians. Not some glorious renaissance, but certainly not a crisis. Given that you can\u2019t put every single piece of data into a magazine article \u2014 it\u2019s an essay, not a spreadsheet \u2014 we spent many hours trying cultivate a set of numbers that represented that balanced perspective, and where the data suggested negative trends (as in books and Hollywood films), we put those numbers front and center.As I wrote at the end of the article, I do not think this data should be used as a mindless defense of the status quo. For what it\u2019s worth, I think musicians (and other creators) deserve to see an even bigger piece of the pie. I get that groups advocating on behalf of musicians may worry that a modestly optimistic story will make it harder for artists to negotiate better deals with their labels or new streaming services, or will encourage consumers to return to their old music-piracy ways because they read some article that said the musicians are doing just fine. But I think it\u2019s just as important to point out that it has turned out to be a very exciting time to make music for a living, one filled with many new opportunities that didn\u2019t exist 15 years ago. It\u2019s important, for starters, because it contradicts a (false) theory that many smart people still hold about the state of the culture. But it\u2019s also important for the music itself. I worry that there\u2019s a whole generation of musicians out there who will be scared by all the doomsayers toward more conventional career paths, when there is so much evidence of opportunity all around us.Finally, I want to respond to this line from the end of the F.M.C. post:Let us be clear: our problem with Johnson\u2019s article isn\u2019t that he fails to conform to some doom-and-gloom scenario for artists working today. Indeed, there are a lot of new opportunities for artists, and those opportunities are worth celebrating. Most frustrating to us is that Johnson reinforces a false binary between pro-technology optimistic futurism and anti-technology digital pessimism. And that simply doesn\u2019t describe the state of the contemporary debate about art and the digital age.I don\u2019t see that the article plays into that false binary. What the article critiques is the premise that there is a kind of underlying technological weight dragging down the economics of making music across the board. I make it very clear at multiple points that technology is influencing creators in different ways: making it easier for some kinds of artists, and putting new burdens on others. Figuring out the nuances of those transformations is what the F.M.C. is doing, with great success. But there are many people out there who still think that digital networks pose an existential threat to professional musicians (and other creators). That\u2019s what my article was trying to wrestle with. Why can\u2019t we see the forest and the trees?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Turmoil Prompts New Speculation on the Fed\u2019s Timetable", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the first public indication that Fed officials had been rattled by recent market turbulence, which had already led many investors to conclude the Fed would wait a little longer before raising rates.\u201cFrom my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September F.O.M.C. meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u201d Mr. Dudley said, referring to the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.Even if the Fed hesitates, Mr. Dudley said he would hope to move later this year, at a subsequent meeting in October or December. He has emphasized previously that he does not want the timing of a move to come as a surprise for investors.\u201cNormalization could become more compelling by the time of the meeting as we get additional information on how the U.S. economy is performing and more information on international and financial market developments, all of which are important in shaping the U.S. economic outlook,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.For all the hedging in Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments, some analysts saw them as confirmation the Fed is unlikely to move at its meeting next month, scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17. Market-based measures of investor expectations, which have fallen alongside the stock market, already put the odds of a September rate increase at just 24 percent Wednesday.\u201cThe odds of a September rate hike have just dropped further, and we have to push our forecast for the first move to December,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told clients Wednesday afternoon. \u201cA massive payroll number next week, coupled with strength in August auto sales, retail sales and the ISM surveys, could yet persuade the Fed to move, but markets would have to rebound significantly too, and this all seems a bit too much to ask.\u201dBut Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in an email on Wednesday that he still saw a real chance for a September increase, provided markets behaved and the domestic economy continued to show strength.\u201cI do think he left the door open to September just a tad, which makes sense given that markets and payrolls can surprise in a bunch of ways,\u201d Mr. Feroli said.The Fed is marching toward higher rates because officials are concerned the economy will eventually overdose on easy money. While recovery from the recession remains incomplete, monetary policy works slowly, and the Fed is wary of the risk that the economy will overheat in coming years. The unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent in July, and policy makers at the central bank are hesitant to push it much below 5 percent.The government reported Wednesday that orders for durable goods rose 2 percent in July, the latest in a string of positive data. Analysts expect the government on Thursday to raise its estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product.But an economic slowdown in China, and that government\u2019s troubled response, have buffeted global financial markets in recent weeks, driving down equity prices, contributing to a new round of declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, and sending a rush of money into safe assets like United States Treasury securities.Some developments, like lower oil prices, will benefit American consumers. Others, like the decline of stock prices, are erasing wealth that might have been spent.The question confronting Fed officials is whether they are sufficiently confident about the resilience of domestic growth to raise interest rates.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, is scheduled to speak Saturday at an annual conference for monetary policy makers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Other Fed officials also plan to attend the gathering, where the impact of recent market developments will certainly be a major topic of discussion.Even as Mr. Dudley suggested a September rate increase was less likely, he cautioned on Wednesday against assuming the Fed would significantly alter its plans. He dismissed the possibility of a new round of stimulus.But the Fed might decide to wait a little longer. Markets have not found their balance, and Mr. Dudley noted that it was too soon to gauge the impact of the market downturn in broader indicators. The government, for example, will release next week a report on August job growth based on a survey conducted earlier in the month.William Lee, the head of North American economics at Citigroup, described Mr. Dudley\u2019s remarks as careful and balanced. If the market downturn continues, and broadens, Mr. Lee said he would expect the Fed to delay raising rates. If markets find their balance, he said he still expected the Fed to move in September.\u201cIt\u2019s a little more violent than people would like,\u201d Mr. Lee said of the market correction. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than people would like. But is it surprising? It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dMore important, he said, was the continued strength of domestic economic data.But Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon and a close Fed watcher, said that the Fed, in effect, was already tightening domestic financial conditions by standing still while central banks in other countries, including China, were racing to stimulate their economies. Raising domestic interest rates under those conditions, he said, would be \u201ctoo much, too fast.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated where Mr. Dudley held a news conference. It was in New York, not Buffalo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liquefied Natural Gas Makes Qatar an Energy Giant", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by6 PhotosRAS LAFFAN, Qatar \u2014 The temperature hovered around 100 degrees on the jetty here, where a set of pipes were connected to a giant red-hulled ship. But the moisture in the air froze on the pipes and flaked off, creating snowlike flurries on the early summer evening.Natural gas, when chilled to minus 260 degrees, turns into a liquid with a fraction of its former volume. The process has reshaped the natural gas business, allowing the fuel to be pumped onto ships and dispatched around the world.After investing tens of billions of dollars, Qatar is at the forefront. Part of the emirate\u2019s fleet, the Al Rekayyat, run by Royal Dutch Shell, goes to Fujian in China and Yokkaichi in Japan, as well as Dubai and Milford Haven in Wales.When loading was finished recently, four tugboats pulled the ship from its berth with a deep roar. \u201cI expect to be in the north channel around midnight,\u201d said the captain, Veerasekhar Rao Muttineni, over the marine radio, as the ship eased into the waters of the Persian Gulf. Four days later, it docked in Hazira on the west coast of India.Once a poor nation whose economy depended on fishing and pearl diving, Qatar is a relatively new giant in the global energy trade.In the 1970s, Shell discovered the world\u2019s largest trove of natural gas, called the North field, in Qatari waters. But there was no market for the fuel. Potential customers in Europe were too far to reach via pipeline, the usual method. Shell walked away.Looking to the example of Malaysia and Indonesia, Qatar and Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who was then its emir, started promoting L.N.G. in the mid-1990s. Exxon Mobil was the important early investor; Shell, Total and ConocoPhillips soon followed.Qatar and its energy partners took the business to a new level, developing far bigger and more efficient plants. Last year, Qatar produced about a third of all liquefied natural gas, although Australia and the United States have big export ambitions.It is a lucrative business that has made Qatar the world\u2019s wealthiest country by output per capita. While industry growth has recently been flat, worldwide volumes have roughly quadrupled in the last two decades to about 240 million metric tons a year, or 264 million short tons, accounting for about one-third of overall gas exports. Annual sales are estimated at $180 billion.\u201cWith the full development of Qatar, L.N.G. came of age,\u201d said Michael Stoppard, chief gas strategist at IHS, a market research firm. \u201cQatar made L.N.G. a bigger business \u2014 bigger projects, bigger ships, bigger volumes and a much bigger global footprint.\u201cRas Laffan, a desert headland about an hour\u2019s drive from Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha, bristles with storage tanks, pipelines and other gas processing facilities. Gas comes in from offshore wells and then passes through a series of refrigeration units that clean the fuel and chill it to liquid form. Qatargas and RasGas, the emirate\u2019s two exporting companies, have 14 of these facilities, known as trains.\u201cWe pushed the R&D to go another step, to increase the size,\u201d said Ibrahim Bawazir, a Qatargas executive, as he led a group of visitors dressed in orange fire-resistant suits around Qatargas 4, one of the largest and most modern installations. It stretches for three-fifths of a mile. \u201cIt is almost impossible to build L.N.G. on this scale,\u201d Mr. Bawazir said.With the ability to produce and process such huge quantities of gas, Qatar can keep its costs low. IHS estimates that it costs about $2 per million British thermal units, a standard natural gas measure, to produce and liquefy gas in Qatar. That compares with $8 to $12 for planned projects in the United States, East Africa and Australia. The low cost structure allows Qatar to be more nimble and make money even in the current weak environment, when prices are low.The Qataris originally planned to deliver much of their L.N.G. to the United States and Europe, but those plans were frustrated by the shale gas boom in North America. Instead, three-quarters of Qatari gas flowed last year to Asian countries like China, India and South Korea. Japan was Qatar\u2019s largest customer as its electric utilities substituted natural gas generation for nuclear after the 2011 Fukushima disaster.A vital part of Qatar\u2019s effort has been a new fleet of carriers, substantially larger and more efficient than previous models.At over 1,000 feet, the Al Rekayyat, which was built in South Korea in 2009, is only slightly shorter than the largest aircraft carrier. The ship carries up to 217,000 cubic meters of gas, about 7.7 million cubic feet, worth around $30 million to $40 million at today\u2019s market prices.The Al Rekayyat is surprisingly fast for such a large ship. It cruises at about 18 knots, a speed that the crew figures makes it too fast to be easily boarded by pirates.Still, the crewmen are cautious. On the first morning of the voyage, crewmen wearing heavy leather gloves, padding and hard hats rigged up barbed wire and water cannons to ward off pirates. \u201cThis is recommended good practice,\u201d Captain Rao said. \u201cWe look on with suspicious eyes.\u201dLater that day, the ship entered the narrow choke point at the east end of the gulf, the Strait of Hormuz. Captain Rao was on the bridge with a navigator, Ervin Markovic, and two crewmen scanning for trouble with binoculars. Shrouded in the heat haze above the pale green water, Iran lay ahead and to the port side of the ship. To starboard loomed a rocky outcropping from the coast of Oman.The strait, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s waterborne oil exports travel, is one of those passages that mariners approach with a sense of trepidation. The high volumes of maritime traffic combined with narrow shipping lanes increase the risk of collisions. Just a few weeks before this trip, a cargo ship had been detained by an Iranian gunboat.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Mr. Markovic said.The cargo carries its own risks.The greatest danger, experts say, is that the liquid might escape and expand into a flammable, asphyxiating cloud. On a ship like the Al Rekayyat, the L.N.G. is contained in special tanks designed to minimize the likelihood of leaks.L.N.G. requires a near obsession with precautions, drills and safety. Shell\u2019s rules prohibit taking devices like mobile phones or cameras that could spark an explosion on deck. Alcohol is not permitted. Crew members rarely go outside unless for work.Miroslav Ahmetovic, the chief officer, spends much of his workday in a room below the bridge monitoring the L.N.G. cargo on screens that display indicators like pressure and volume. Every few hours he dons hard hat, gloves, goggles and protective clothing and goes out on the sweltering deck to see that nothing is amiss.\u201cI want to make sure my video game conforms to reality,\u201d Mr. Ahmetovic said, emphasizing the constant vigilance that Shell requires.More than a day\u2019s journey away from India, the crew was already preparing for port. Mr. Ahmetovic gradually began easing open the valves to the L.N.G. tanks, letting the cold fluid gradually chill the pipes so they would not crack from sudden cold.\u201cIf you don\u2019t treat the cargo right, it will break the ship,\u201d he said.Captain Rao stood on the bridge with a crewman at the wheel testing the engine and the steering. He even tried a full reversal of the engines, which might be required in an emergency. Gathering his officers around him, he warned them to pay close attention unloading the fuel so that there were no mistakes.\u201cIf you are idle, ask yourself what you are missing,\u201d he instructed.On the fourth day, the Al Rekayyat eased through the narrow harbor entrance, halting at a modern jetty. From there pipes took the fuel to two large storage tanks, which fed the liquid into a long series of cylinders and other vessels. The fuel is gradually rewarmed back into a gas, so that it can be piped into the Indian pipeline network outside.The terminal area is almost spotlessly clean, with staff members dressed in neat blue uniforms. Outside the gates is a different matter. Trucks grind along muddy roads lined with ramshackle shelters. Families drawn by the prospects of work in the factories camp under bridges.Nilay Vyas, the general manager of Hazira, says that the pipelines buried in the ground outside the terminal are monitored by an optical fiber system that would \u201cgive a signal in case of unauthorized work.\u201d A patrol also goes out at least four times a day, he says, to check in person.Shell, which has made a bigger bet on gas than any of its rivals, opened the Hazira terminal in 2005 with the French giant Total as a junior partner. The terminal, the company figured, would supply the power plants and factories in the fast-growing industrial areas nearby.In the early days, Shell struggled to find customers, until the state\u2019s gas distribution system was expanded and Hazira connected. Now, the Indian economy is growing at a decent clip and the country faces an energy shortage. Customers, says Shell, are lining up, viewing L.N.G. as a clean, reliable source of energy.Maarten Wetselaar, the head of Shell\u2019s global gas business, said Hazira\u2019s gas receiving and processing facilities were \u201ccompletely sold out.\u201d\u201cEven if you begged us on your knees for a slot,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think in the next 12 months we could accept another cargo.\u201dAn article on Thursday about Qatar\u2019s emergence as a global energy player in liquefied natural gas rendered the name of a Qatari company incorrectly. It is Qatargas, not Qatar Gas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Haves and the Have-Nots", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeToday\u2019s threadbare warriors \u2014 fugitives from newer war zones \u2014 have no visible lances, swords, ships, shields or longbows. They number only around 3,000, yet they stir alarm and fear in Britain, a nation of 60 million that once saw itself as a haven for the needy and oppressed, from the Jews of Germany and Russia to Muslims in flight from Idi Amin\u2019s Uganda.This time, though, some inner switch has been thrown, blocking the circuitry of compassion and replacing it with hard-nosed calculations about who should be embraced by Europe\u2019s few resurgent economies.Call it asymmetric warfare \u2014 a battle of haves versus have-nots, between the sense of entitlement of those who have and the expectations of those who crave inclusion.In recent months, migrants fleeing war, tyranny and penury in parts of Africa and the Arab world have assembled near the French port of Calais. From there, often in a televised frenzy, they attempt a final leap into lands of opportunity that the authorities in France and Britain are bent on denying them.This summer, a strike by French port workers offered migrants an unexpected chance to smuggle themselves aboard trucks snarled in lines on their way to the tunnel that runs under the Channel. In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.British vacationers reported that migrants tried to break into the mobile homes towed behind their cars. News footage showed hooded figures advancing under cover of darkness.Compared with many of those who live in places like this prosperous southern English town, with its pebbly beaches and elegant stuccoed squares, those ghostly figures bear the scars of far more fragile, desperate lives.Biniam Habte, a 20-year-old Eritrean, who had crossed the Sahara in his quest to reach Europe, told a British newspaper reporter in Calais: \u201cOn the journey I have made, you carry your life like an egg in your hand.\u201dThe European response, by contrast, plays into a broader debate driven by populist, xenophobic parties tugging political discourse to the right.That, perhaps, is why the British government announced plans to abolish subsistence payments to failed asylum seekers and to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to rent homes \u2014 a signal to those in Calais to look elsewhere, and an effort to convince their own citizens that, despite all appearances to the contrary, the authorities have the crisis under control.Since the failure of the Arab Spring to create anything close to a summer of content, the latest surge has written new chapters in a protracted chronicle of enforced migration in Europe provoked by successive waves of post-Cold War conflict since the 1990s.\u201cStarting with helping the French on their side of the border, we're going to put in more fencing, more resources, more sniffer dog teams, more assistance in any way we can,\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron said.But Britain\u2019s response is seen by some critics as attacking the symptoms, not the cause, and Mr. Cameron\u2019s remark conjured a far more recent historical parallel than Agincourt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A George Benjamin Exacting Storm in Opera Comes to Mostly Mozart", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf there\u2019s one description that persistently attaches to the music of George Benjamin it\u2019s \u201cfastidious\u201d: a word that doesn\u2019t promise much for a career in opera, where grand, sweeping gestures tend to count for more than careful details. Opera is a rough-and-tumble business. Mr. Benjamin is, in the nicest way, exquisite.\u201cSkin\u201d is a troubling fairy tale, about a medieval parchment illustrator whose involvement with his patron\u2019s wife has catastrophic consequences. It\u2019s essentially a classic love triangle but embellished by a never-quite-explained cohort of angels who appear to supervise the action and connect it to the present day, so it becomes a story with continuing resonance.The special profile given Mr. Benjamin at this year\u2019s Aldeburgh Festival in Britain paired him with Ravel, to whom the word fastidious applies as well, and you could hear why: There\u2019s a shared aesthetic. But it was a formative encounter in his youth with Messiaen that especially drew him to the sound world of the French.Born in London in 1960, he was a precocious child who served notice of serious musicality by seeing \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and rushing straight off to buy the massive score of Ligeti\u2019s \u201cAtmospheres\u201d that is featured on the soundtrack. He was 8 then and, as he later recalled, \u201cThe score was bigger than me.\u201dFrom Ligeti his interests moved to Boulez, Henze and assorted other stars of the mid-20th-century avant-garde. But critically, at 16, he was introduced to Messiaen, made a good impression and immediately found himself commuting every month to Paris to sit in on the composer\u2019s legendary class at the Conservatoire.The infant in the room, he flourished and emerged triumphant \u2014 with a crazily aggressive piano sonata to his name that ruined instruments when he played it. The aggression got out of hand, but earned him a contract with the music publisher Faber.A unique achievement for someone so young, the Faber deal generated rumors that an English prodigy had surfaced: a Mendelssohn, a Mozart \u2014 or perhaps the \u201cNew Britten\u201d that cultural commentators were keen to find since the death of the old one in 1976.These were heavy expectations for a teenager. But Mr. Benjamin delivered, with three pieces in successive years that thrust him into prominence and made comparisons to Britten even harder to shrug off.He was a 20-year-old Cambridge undergraduate when his first orchestral score, \u201cRinged by the Flat Horizon,\u201d was played at the 1980 Proms at Royal Albert Hall, making him the youngest living composer ever featured at the country\u2019s leading music festival. A response to one of Turner\u2019s turbulent, semi-abstracted landscapes, it was fairly described in The Boston Globe\u2019s review of a later, American performance as \u201cthe most startlingly precise storm music ever written.\u201d And it signaled some of the preoccupations that would run through Mr. Benjamin\u2019s work ever after: an intense engagement with the core ingredients of sound \u2014 the implications of a single chord, the possibilities of harmony \u2014 and how they translate into atmosphere and color.With the chamber-scale \u201cA Mind of Winter\u201d following in 1981, and \u201cAt First Light\u201d in \u201982, his genius for creating impact out of careful, conscientious and meticulously ordered writing seemed to be confirmed.But qualities like that create their own parameters. They slow productivity, breeding self-doubt. And through the next five years, under considerable pressure as his audience, publishers and critics watched and waited, Mr. Benjamin wrote little more than half an hour of music.But he wasn\u2019t idle. After Cambridge, he went back to France to work at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique, which brokered meaningful liaisons between science and art, and had a large 4X computer to which radical composers flocked in search of new sounds.It was used by Mr. Benjamin to write \u201cAntara,\u201d a piece inspired not just by what was going on inside institute laboratories but also by itinerant Peruvian panpipe players busking in the street. He took them into a recording studio, taped every pitch they could produce, then processed the result into a sound-bank for a synthesizer keyboard that would play alongside live, acoustic instruments in concert.At its 1987 Paris premiere, \u201cAntara\u201d captured headlines. Critics noted Mr. Benjamin\u2019s bold step into the world of high technology \u2014 although, as things turned out, he was just passing through, and left it with a vengeance in a 1990 piece called \u201cUpon Silence\u201d that used the bygone resource of a consort of viols.But the 1990s brought more problems, as his production slowed down to a point where people were asking, \u201cWhatever happened ... ?\u201d When new pieces came they were impressive \u2014 \u201cSudden Time\u201d for large-scale orchestra in 1993, and \u201cThree Inventions\u201d for chamber orchestra in 1995 \u2014 but they took so long to arrive. And so much trouble.As he once told me in an interview, it was his nature \u201cto do in each piece what I haven\u2019t done before.\u201d So each one demanded a large degree of self-reinvention: of experimenting with new methods, structures and sonorities. The first few pages of the last \u201cInvention\u201d took nine months to write before he realized that, as he later said, \u201cThe piece had died in front of me\u201d \u2014 and he tore the whole thing up to start again.But if the \u201990s didn\u2019t deliver many notes on the page, they were a time for thinking. And for a long while Mr. Benjamin\u2019s thoughts had been leaning toward opera: an extravagant choice for a composer with his history, although his handful of vocal pieces showed a gift for setting texts, and he often talked about his music in the language of lyric theater. \u201cAntara,\u201d he once said, had been \u201cconceived like an unsung opera: My instruments are real characters.\u201dAll he lacked was a librettist, but that wasn\u2019t going to be easy.For Mr. Benjamin, it needed to be someone like himself: particular, exacting, careful. And the choice eventually fell on Mr. Crimp, a master of sharp, stylized language and experimental form with an emotional detachment that ensured his writing wouldn\u2019t be too big or blowzy for the music Mr. Benjamin imagined.They first collaborated on a 2009 piece called \u201cInto the Little Hill,\u201d which took the myth of the Pied Piper \u2014 a story that Mr. Benjamin had tried to set to music as a child but never, as he told me, \u201cgot further than the entrance of the rats\u201d \u2014 and turned it into a dark meditation on duplicity and deceit. Written with extreme economy, with just two characters who narrate their own stories in the third person, it lasts no more than 40 minutes but feels epic. And its success led to a prompt commission for a second Benjamin and Crimp collaboration, the larger but no less carefully created \u201cWritten on Skin.\u201dSubdued tone and a slow pace suggest a ceremonial rather than conventionally operatic drama. And although the orchestra is large, it\u2019s sparely used, with a specific ear for color (there\u2019s a bass viol and a glass harmonica in the ensemble). But there\u2019s also impact. And against all odds, the piece lives up to the dramatic expectations of a narrative so steeped in sex, murder and suicide (not to mention cannibalism) it could be Puccini.That the conscientious Mr. Benjamin is nothing like Puccini but succeeds in this invasion of his territory is what makes \u201cSkin\u201d such a compelling paradox: a punch delivered in a velvet glove with devastating stealth.But stealth is something Mr. Benjamin excels at, on and off the stage.He\u2019s working right now on a third opera with Mr. Crimp \u2014 for Covent Garden in 2018, which, in opera terms, is just around the corner. You\u2019d expect preliminary plans for casting, set design, rehearsals to be underway. But no one has, as yet, been told what this new opera is about. Not even Mr. Benjamin\u2019s own publisher, Sally Cavender.\u201cWe never know with George until we get the score,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very private about things like that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What a $15 Minimum Wage Would Mean for Your City", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesAs the campaign for a $15 minimum wage has gained strength this year, even supporters of large minimum-wage increases have wondered how high the wage floor can rise before it reduces employment and hurts the economy.Fortunately, economists have a handy tool for gauging the likely impact of minimum-wage increases: the ratio of the minimum wage to the wage of workers in the very middle of the income distribution, known as the median wage. The higher the ratio of the minimum to the median, the greater the boost to workers.Mr. Reich said that a handful of affluent European countries had or would soon have minimum-to-median ratios in the 50s and low 60s and did not appear to show many ill effects. (Some of them, like France, have significantly higher unemployment rates than the United States, but others, like Germany, do not.)Some of the results are what you\u2019d expect: The San Francisco area, thanks in part to its booming tech industry, has the highest current median wage on our list ($25.27), and in 2020 would have a resilient minimum-to-median ratio of 0.47, assuming 2 percent annual growth of the median wage in the interim. Washington at 0.49, Boston at 0.50, Seattle at 0.54 and New York at 0.55 would round out the top metro areas that could sustain a $15-an-hour minimum wage without much fallout. If anything, my calculations may overstate the ratios we\u2019d observe in these areas in 2020, because wages could rise significantly faster there than the 2 percent per year I assumed.Not surprisingly, two of these cities, San Francisco and Seattle, already have $15-an-hour minimum wage laws, and Washington may well join them next year.But some of the other numbers are worrying. For example, Los Angeles, which recently approved a $15-an-hour wage bill of its own, may have more trouble handling the change, even though we sometimes mentally lump it in with booming cities like San Francisco and Seattle. The city\u2019s current median wage is actually relatively low \u2014 $18.32 in the metro area versus $21.73 in New York and $24.58 in Washington \u2014 leading to an estimated minimum-to-median ratio of 0.65 in 2020. This would put it behind Minneapolis (0.61), Philadelphia (0.63) and Detroit (0.64), and roughly in line with Chicago (0.66).And, as Arindrajit Dube, an associate professor of economics at UMass Amherst, pointed out, Detroit\u2019s figure may be somewhat misleading. Its relatively high median wage and low minimum-to-median ratio may mask high unemployment or low labor force participation among people who want low-wage jobs but can\u2019t get them. Those jobs would drive down the local median wage if they existed, but they don\u2019t. \u201cDetroit is not a prosperous area, so there\u2019s not demand for low-wage service-sector jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, the jobs they do have tend to pay higher. Think of it more as the \u2018missing jobs.\u2019 \u201d(Alternatively, the explanation may be that most of the median-wage numbers are only available at the metro-area level rather than the city level. According to government data, the Detroit metro area, which includes a ring of more affluent suburbs, has had higher economic growth in recent years than the Los Angeles metro area and the same level of unemployment. But this may mask a much weaker economy in Detroit proper.)Finally, there are a handful of cities that appear to be distinctly ill-equipped for a $15-an-hour minimum. Wages are so low that $15 is fairly close to the median wage there. The minimum-to-median ratio in Las Vegas and New Orleans \u2014 big service-economy and tourism hubs \u2014 comes to 0.75 and 0.76. Oklahoma City would come to 0.75. Miami, the only city on the list where the most recent median-wage reading is actually under $15 ($14.93), has a minimum-to-median ratio at a staggering 0.8.The wide variation in minimum-to-median ratios does seem to recommend some variation when raising the minimum wage. A number of the cities that have recently passed minimum-wage laws \u2014 like Albuquerque, Louisville and Portland, Me. \u2014 have stopped far short of $15 an hour. If Las Vegas and Miami are considering raising their local minimum wages, they might be advised to follow suit. (Oklahoma City may be in a better position to absorb a minimum-wage increase because it has enjoyed very low unemployment and very rapid economic growth in recent years.)Still, as a general rule, this list is filled with prosperous cities \u2014 places it might make sense to single out with high-impact minimum-wage increases. It\u2019s their affluence that fuels the demand for low-wage jobs, exacerbating inequality.\u201cThe demand is essentially either driven by higher-income consumers in that area, or by tourism,\u201d Mr. Dube said. These are the very people, he added, who can afford to subsidize a higher minimum wage by paying more at restaurants and clothing stores.A note about my methodology:My approach to picking the cities was highly unscientific\u2014I chose 25 interesting cities among the 50 largest in the country, with the caveat that each region of the country needed some representation. The calculations are a bit crude; I calculated what the median wage would look like if it grew by 2 percent a year between 2014 and 2020. As a rule, I used the smallest geographic area available, but it\u2019s typically larger than the city proper.One final adjustment: When calculating and comparing minimum-to-median wage ratios, economists typically use the median wage for all fulltime workers, rather than the median wage for all workers. On average over the past decade, fulltime workers have made about 11 percent more than workers overall. So for the purposes of calculating my ratios, I took the median wage for each city and boosted it by 11 percent.Advertisement"}

Geithner \u2014 the nation\u2019s 75th Treasury secretary (2009-13) \u2014 showed up. And on Wednesday night, two more Hamilton successors were in the Broadway audience: Robert E.

You cannot work in the Treasury building, much less in my office, without looking at his picture and thinking about the contributions he made to our nation, both in terms of our economy and our democratic system.\u201dBut what does that mean about Hamilton\u2019s place on the currency? \u201cI am committed to honoring him,\u201d Mr. Lew said. \u201cWe have many exciting options, and we are continuing to listen to the American people about how we honor Hamilton and honor women and the countless contributions they have made to our country. Our currency is a reflection of our values and should rightfully represent our inclusive democracy.\u201dHamilton partisans opted not to argue the issue on Wednesday night.\u201cWhen I met him, I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve made my case,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Miranda said after greeting Mr. Lew postshow. \u201cWhat am I going to say that the show hasn\u2019t already said?

Erik Piepenburg explains, in six snapshots, why \u201cHamilton\u201d has become such a big deal.In a telephone interview, Mr. Rubin said Hamilton\u2019s place on the currency is the decision of Mr. Lew. But he echoed the arguments of those who think efforts to feature a woman on a bill should focus on the $20 note, which features Andrew Jackson, rather than the $10 note, given Hamilton\u2019s foundational role in the nation\u2019s financial history. \u201cIt is interesting \u2014 it was Jackson, after all, who vetoed the charter for the Second Bank of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a question of why you would take Hamilton off, but that\u2019s up to Jack.\u201dMr. Geithner, who is now president of the investment firm Warburg Pincus, declined to respond to questions about the show or the currency, according to a spokeswoman, Mary Zimmerman.Mr. Chernow said it made sense that the nation\u2019s economic stewards would come to see the show. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they have come to pay their respects to Alexander Hamilton, who set the benchmark against which all subsequent Treasury secretaries have been measured,\u201d he said. \u201cHe remains the patron saint of the Treasury Department with good reason.\u201dAnd, he said, Hamilton would have been \u201cdelighted by all the attention.\u201d\u201cHe was not a shrinking violet, as the show demonstrates,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was very preoccupied with his place in history, and how posterity would see him, and how he would be remembered, so he\u2019d be very happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Rogoff co-wrote \u201cThis Time Is Different,\u201d a seminal book that examined eight centuries of financial crises.Every financial crisis, he and his co-author, Carmen M. Reinhart, concluded, stems from the same simple problem: too much debt.To understand the wild machinations of the stock market in recent days in the United States and abroad, you need to look no further than China\u2019s astounding debt load and sputtering economy \u2014 and its ability to infect the rest of the world.\u201cChina is the classic \u2018This time is different\u2019 story,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said, rattling off all the different rationalizations for why the country convinced itself \u2014 and many others \u2014 that it could load up on debt but was somehow immune to the laws of economic gravity. He cited the government\u2019s control over the markets, the hundreds of millions of workers migrating to cities and the country\u2019s saving rate of about 30 percent of disposable income as just some of the reasons China was said to be impervious to a severe downturn. \u201cIt\u2019s very vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Rogoff added. \u201cThere is a lot of debt.\u201dHow much debt remains an open question, given the opacity of China\u2019s market. The country\u2019s debt load rose from $7 trillion in 2007 to $28 trillion by mid-2014, according to a report published earlier this year by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, China. \u201cAt 282 percent of G.D.P., China\u2019s debt as a share of G.D.P., while manageable, is larger than that of the United States or Germany,\u201d said the McKinsey study. \u201cSeveral factors are worrisome: Half of loans are linked directly or indirectly to China\u2019s real estate market, unregulated shadow banking accounts for nearly half of new lending, and the debt of many local governments is likely unsustainable.\u201dA look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.The question then becomes how interconnected China\u2019s economy is to the rest of the world. That\u2019s exactly what investors have been trying to determine over the last several weeks as China\u2019s government has devalued its currency and tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to stabilize its plummeting stock market. The drop has been worsened, in part, by debt as overextended Chinese speculators who borrowed money to buy stocks are now being forced to sell, creating a vicious cycle.\u201cHow does all that ricochet to emerging markets?\u201d Mr. Rogoff said in discussing the effect of China\u2019s slowdown on commodity producers like Brazil, whose economy is in a tailspin. \u201cLook at Russia. It\u2019s amazing they haven\u2019t had a financial crisis yet.\u201dMr. Rogoff is not the first person to identify China as a potential risk. Earlier this year, this column highlighted the views of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary and a Sinophile, who said, \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not a question of if, but when, China\u2019s financial system will face a reckoning and have to contend with a wave of credit losses and debt restructurings.\u201d And the hedge fund manager James Chanos has been sounding the alarm on China for years, recently declaring, \u201cWhatever you might think, it\u2019s worse.\u201dThere are, of course, significant political reasons China needs to convince the world and its own citizens that it can manage its convulsing financial markets and slowing economy. \u201cFinancial meltdown leads to a social meltdown, which leads to a political meltdown,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said. \u201cThat\u2019s the real fear.\u201dMr. Rogoff pointed to another factor that has contributed to China\u2019s financial woes.\u201cThe crisis in Tianjin fed into the mix,\u201d he said, referring to the deadly explosion on Aug. 12 in the port city, which killed more than 100 people. Mr. Rogoff said the explosion had undermined the credibility of the Chinese government because so many questions remained unanswered, and the response had been inadequate.So does Mr. Rogoff believe that China is headed for a terrible \u201chard landing\u201d that will lead to a global recession?Well, despite the market tumult and his persistent warnings, Mr. Rogoff says he believes that the last several weeks have raised the prospects of a meaningful crisis. But with China\u2019s trillions of dollars in reserves, he thinks the country may have sufficient tools to prevent a calamity that spreads across the globe \u2014 at least for now.\u201cIf you had to bet,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said, \u201cyou\u2019d still bet they\u2019d pull it out.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shake-Up in Moscow as Railways Chief, a Putin Friend, Is Reported Ousted", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Yakunin, who has known Mr. Putin since the early 1990s, has accepted a mostly ceremonial political position in the upper house of Parliament, local news media reported.His posting as a diplomat in the United States in the late Soviet period stoked speculation \u2014 never confirmed or denied \u2014 that he, like Mr. Putin, had worked for the K.G.B. He was also a co-founder of Bank Rossiya, which Western officials last year identified as having close financial ties to Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle.The bank, many of its clients and Mr. Yakunin were hit with sanctions by the United States in response to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Afterward, Mr. Putin made a point of directing government business toward sanctioned companies, asking that his salary as president, for example, be deposited in a Bank Rossiya account.It was unclear whether the sanctions on Mr. Yakunin played any role in his departure. But the national railway company has frequently been embroiled in scandals and accused of mismanagement.A recent effort to spin off regional commuter train lines led to a total breakdown in service in many cities, angering commuters and embarrassing the president.\u201cPutin is a man who is fiercely loyal to people who have been loyal to him,\u201d Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in New York, said in a telephone interview. He discounted the idea that sanctions alone could have cost Mr. Yakunin his job.\u201cIf he were starting to go after his insiders, that could well lead to panic and a true threat to the regime,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said of Mr. Putin. \u201cIf it\u2019s more of a pinpoint strike against an oligarch, a loyalist, who presides over a key sector that needs to perform better, that\u2019s a more plausible explanation.\u201dThe domestic policy shuffle in Moscow on Monday interrupted what had been a focus on Middle Eastern policy.Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, met on Monday with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, as the two countries tried to find a political solution to the Syrian civil war while preserving the rule of their ally there, President Bashar al-Assad. Last week, Mr. Lavrov met with the Saudi foreign minister and earlier in the month traveled to Qatar.By evening, state news outlets seemed to corroborate reports of Mr. Yakunin\u2019s ouster by citing government officials discussing his future after leaving the railway, where he took the top position in 2005.Earlier Monday, at a meeting of Mr. Putin and regional tourism officials, the railway company had, ominously, come under sharp criticism for the high price of its tickets.The Senate, like much of the formal structure of government in Russia, is largely powerless in the political system that has emerged under Mr. Putin. In his role as railway director, however, Mr. Yakunin had been viewed as a powerful insider, controlling levers of influence over mining and oil and gas companies in setting freight rates.Russian Railways is also politically powerful as one of the largest civilian employers in Russia, and one of the largest in the world, with about a million employees.In the mid-1990s, Mr. Yakunin and Mr. Putin, then a city official in St. Petersburg, joined six local businessmen in forming a cooperative of summer homes called Ozero, or \u201cLake,\u201d outside the city.The group went on to have an oversize influence over Russia\u2019s economy during the oil boom and under Mr. Putin\u2019s presidency. Members accumulated billions of dollars in profits over the years in banking, retail gasoline and other ventures; members, including Mr. Yakunin, whose salary at the railway in 2013 was $15 million, deny they owe their riches to Mr. Putin\u2019s rise in politics.Advertisement"}

Blinking with nervousness, he has the pathetic aspect of a walking apology for existence \u2014 and in fact, in an encounter with Zoe (Laura Dreyfuss), the girl he has a secret crush on, the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d spill from his mouth with a mortifying lack of logic. Nor can he manage to find anyone to sign the cast on his arm \u2014 a visible badge of shame in the cruel social economy of adolescence. (He broke it falling from a tree.)Evan is not the only lonely teenager at his school. Zoe\u2019s brother, Connor (Mike Faist), is a misfit of a darker bent. During an encounter in the computer lab, Connor snatches a letter Evan has written to himself, which is supposed to be a daily exercise in pep advised by his therapist, but in this case is a morose cri de coeur ending, \u201cI mean, face it: Would anybody even notice if I disappeared tomorrow?\u201d Days later Evan is called in to the principal\u2019s office and told that Connor has killed himself. His parents, Cynthia (Jennifer Laura Thompson) and Larry (Michael Park), discovered Evan\u2019s note in Connor\u2019s pocket, and assumed Connor was writing a farewell note to a friend. Although Evan first attempts to set them straight, Cynthia and Larry are so overwhelmed by grief \u2014 and comforted believing that Connor had a friend \u2014 that Evan soon finds himself embraced by the family as a kind of surrogate son, a feeling he finds hard to resist.Among the accomplishments of the musical is its nimble integration of the \u201creal\u201d world with the virtual world of the web, where Connor\u2019s death becomes a minor viral sensation. A tech-savvy schoolmate, Alana (Alexis Molnar), creates a tribute page and a fund is set up to create a memorial orchard. The set, by David Korins, trims the stage in transparent scrims of various shapes and sizes, on which Facebook posts, Twitter messages and other web communiqu\u00e9s scroll and flicker, underscoring how private griefs \u2014 not to mention outright fictions \u2014 can quickly become public causes, with unpredictable results. More notable, and impressive, is the deft manner in which \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d opens up the hearts and minds of its characters, through both dialogue and song, to reveal their scars, their regrets, the true feelings buried beneath their public facades. Zoe, for instance, who is played with a transparent naturalness by Ms. Dreyfuss, views her parents\u2019 willful rewriting of Connor\u2019s character with wariness. She still sees Connor as he was, and in the beautifully rendered number \u201cRequiem\u201d sings: Don\u2019t tell me that I didn\u2019t have it rightDon\u2019t tell me that it wasn\u2019t black and whiteAfter all you put me throughDon\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t trueThat you weren\u2019t the monster that I knewBut even Zoe begins to buy into the fictions being hungrily constructed by her parents, on the basis of emails ostensibly from Connor to Evan, created and backdated with the help of Evan\u2019s snarky fellow student Jared (a funny Will Roland). Cynthia, played with easygoing warmth by Ms. Thompson, and Larry, whom Mr. Park imbues with a sense of stoic grief, virtually adopt Evan. He lives with his mother, Heidi (Rachel Bay Jones), who works long hours as a nurse and is also taking night classes to become a paralegal. Although her character has less stage time than most of the others, Heidi is drawn \u2014 and portrayed by the fine Ms. Jones \u2014 with the same clarifying honesty as the rest, and her late-coming solo, in which she welcomes back Evan after the saga of Connor has taken a dark turn, is among the most touching songs in the score. \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d has its flaws. The integration of the ghost of Connor into the material can be awkward and doesn\u2019t actually add much to an already complicated story. (It also echoes a little too strongly a story line in \u201cNext to Normal.\u201d) But if he\u2019s going to hang around, it would be nice to see him with a little more nuance; alive or dead, he seems to be the generic goth kid clad in what Evan casually mocks as \u201cschool-shooter chic.\u201d The last beats of the story feel a little rushed, and Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul\u2019s music tends to be stronger than their lyrics, which occasionally lapse into gauzy blandness (\u201cAll we see is light/ \u2019Cause the sun shines bright/ Like we\u2019ll be all right\u201d). But the musical invests a familiar cultural trope \u2014 the angst of the lonely teenager \u2014 with freshness and vibrancy. Ill-considered though it may be, Evan\u2019s attempt to fill the void left behind by Connor, and the void in his own heart, feels affectingly truthful. \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d also raises the potent question of whether our booming social networks are causing more adolescent despair than they can possibly cure.Dear Evan HansenBook by Steven Levenson; music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul; directed by Michael Greif; choreography by Danny Mefford; music supervision, orchestrations and additional arrangements by Alex Lacamoire; co-music supervisor and additional orchestrations by Christopher Jahnke; vocal arrangements and additional arrangements by Mr. Paul; music director, Ben Cohn; sets by David Korins; costumes by Emily Rebholz; lighting by Japhy Weideman; sound by Clive Goodwin; projections by Peter Nigrini; stage manager, Judith Schoenfeld.

{"Headline": "Schumer Says Corporation Should Oversee Hudson Tunnels Project", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Chuck Schumer, seeking an end to the standoff over financing new Hudson River rail tunnels, proposed on Tuesday creating a nonprofit corporation to oversee the project and to assemble the billions of dollars needed to build new tunnels.The proposal by Mr. Schumer, a New York Democrat, comes amid increasing frustration with rail delays and intensifying pressure on political leaders to find a long-term solution for the century-old tunnels used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit.Federal and state officials have agreed on the importance of building new tunnels as part of a plan known as the Gateway project. But they have clashed recently and publicly over how to fund the project, which Mr. Schumer said could cost more than $20 billion.Addressing concerns of Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey, Mr. Schumer outlined several ways the federal government could provide funding and said the development corporation would consolidate the process.\u201cThe development corporation will allow every source of funding to flow into one pot,\u201d the senator said.Afterward, Mr. Schumer said he understood the governors\u2019 concerns.\u201cThe states are saying, \u2018We want to see what the federal government can do before we make a commitment.\u2019 I agree with that,\u201d he told reporters at New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get the federal government to pay for as much of this as possible.\u201dMr. Schumer said the region was quickly approaching a \u201ctransportation Armageddon\u201d and called the recent delays a \u201csoul-chilling premonition of our future.\u201dIn 2010 Mr. Christie canceled a tunnel project, known as Access to the Region\u2019s Core, but he has said recently that he supported building new tunnels if the federal government provided appropriate funding.On Tuesday, Mr. Foxx applauded Mr. Schumer \u201cfor his leadership and for recognizing that the only way forward is together.\u201d He said in a statement that meeting with the governors had to be \u201cthe first step.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Foxx, Jon Romano, said the secretary wanted to hear feedback from the governors on Mr. Schumer\u2019s proposal.Mr. Cuomo, who on Monday said \u201cit\u2019s not my tunnel,\u201d sounded more cooperative on Tuesday. But he did not address whether he supported Mr. Schumer\u2019s proposal to create a development corporation. In a statement, he thanked the senator for making the tunnels a priority.\u201cWe both agree that they will require significant federal investment,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, \u201cand I look forward to working with him to move this critical project forward.\u201d While the nonprofit could provide a structure for Amtrak, the states and local transit agencies to work together on the project, it would not change the tunnels\u2019 price or ensure funding. The project would need sustained political support. The Moynihan Station project, first proposed more than a decade ago to expand Penn Station to the nearby James A. Farley Post Office, has been scaled back significantly over the years and progress has been slow.Still, several construction and business groups expressed support on Tuesday for Mr. Schumer\u2019s proposal, as did Amtrak\u2019s president, Joseph H. Boardman, who called the plan to form a development corporation \u201ca good idea.\u201d\u201cWe look forward to working with him and all other stakeholders to consider this option and others to jump-start Gateway,\u201d he said in a statement.Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, said the proposal was \u201ca smart approach\u201d and reiterated the need for new tunnels.\u201cMost of New York City\u2019s large employers have business operations and employees living on both sides of the Hudson River,\u201d she said, \u201cmaking the tunnels a critical connection for the continued growth of the regional economy.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Navigating the Storm Engulfing Greek Banks", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyGreece\u2019s banks are the weakest point in its economic system. They need to be repaired to lift capital controls, restore depositor confidence and finance a future recovery. There are good and not-so-good ways of doing this.The banks have been hit hard since the radical-left government of Alexis Tsipras came to power in January. Deposit flight, which has been a periodic feature of the Greek crisis, took off again. The banks were then closed and capital controls imposed after Mr. Tsipras introduced a referendum, held in July, on whether to accept the demands of the country\u2019s eurozone creditors and the International Monetary Fund.What\u2019s more, the long recession, briefly interrupted last year, has returned with a vengeance. Soured loans, which reached 35 percent of all loans in Greece at the end of last year, will increase to well over 40 percent in 2015-16, Moody\u2019s Investors Service predicts.As a result, the banks, which have already been recapitalized several times during the crisis, need an additional equity injection of 10 billion to 25 billion euros, or about $11 billion to $27 billion. Until that happens, the European Central Bank, which has been authorizing emergency liquidity for the lenders, will not be willing to lift the capital controls. And as long as those last, more and more companies will go bust, landing the banks with yet more bad loans.Fortunately, there are reasons to be mildly optimistic. Although the people voted in the referendum against the terms demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors, Mr. Tsipras performed a U-turn and is now engaging in constructive talks. There\u2019s a good chance that a deal, offering Athens up to \u20ac86 billion in exchange for deep reforms, will be agreed upon by the end of August.Meanwhile, the E.C.B., which supervises the Greek banks, is moving fast to complete an assessment of how much capital they need.The creditors also seem to have excluded the worst option for recapitalizing the banks: bailing in their uninsured depositors. This would have involved forcibly converting a portion of their deposits into bank equity. It is a good idea, in theory, to bail in a busted bank\u2019s creditors rather than bailing them out with taxpayers\u2019 money. But this is sensible in practice only when there is enough equity and debt to take the hit without harming depositors. Greek banks do not have much of a cushion.But the best option isn\u2019t making much headway either. This is for the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, to take direct stakes in the banks. Instead, it looks as if the fund will lend money to Athens, which in turn will inject capital into the banks. A direct recapitalization would be preferable because it would cut the link between the government and the country\u2019s lenders. A further advantage is that if the eurozone directly owned the banks, depositor confidence would be immediately restored and capital controls could be swiftly lifted.One reason direct recapitalization has not been favored is that the European Stability Mechanism guidelines require a bail-in before it can inject equity. However, if the eurozone wished, it could change these guidelines.A further issue is whether Greece should create a so-called bad bank. The idea would be for the banks to sell problem corporate loans to a new asset management company at a deep discount to their official value. Experts in distressed debt would run the bad bank. In some cases, they would liquidate companies; in others, they would kick out the management; and in yet others, they would convert debt into equity. After shedding their dud loans to the bad bank, the \u201cgood\u201d banks could then focus on lending to good companies.Spain and Ireland have both had success creating bad banks after they were bailed out a few years ago. So far, though, the creditors have not been keen on a similar arrangement for Greece. One reason is that they worry that Athens would pull the bad bank\u2019s strings, favoring cronies.But there\u2019s an obvious solution: ensure that the asset management company is controlled by private investors.Yet another issue is whether the Greek banks should be allowed to count \u201cdeferred tax assets\u201d as part of their capital. The term refers to the right not to have to pay future taxes because past losses have been so big. They are a controversial form of capital because they cannot be used to absorb more losses in the present and so, arguably, aren\u2019t really capital at all. They now account for over half Greek banks\u2019 capital.Greece\u2019s lenders are its Achilles\u2019 heel. There is now a chance to clean them up properly. It would be a shame if this were wasted.Hugo Dixon is a freelance columnist and the author of \u201cThe In/Out Question: Why Britain Should Stay in the EU and Fight to Make It Better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colorado Spill Heightens Debate Over Future of Old Mines ", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySILVERTON, Colo. \u2014 When the mine here opened in the early 1890s amid a frenzy of frontier gold exploration, its founders gave it a lofty name: the Gold King, reflecting their great hopes for finding riches in its depths. Over the next decade, the Gold King went on to become one of the most productive mines in Colorado\u2019s San Juan County, with three shifts of men working 24 hours a day in its dark corridors.But the mine\u2019s prosperity proved short-lived. When the economy hit a recession in the early 1920s, its operators abandoned it, with open tunnels that filled with snowmelt and rainwater that eventually turned to acid, leaving behind a toxic legacy that this region has struggled to clean up for decades.The accident heightened a debate here over the future of this region\u2019s old mines, and served as a reminder, some critics say, that the Gold King\u2019s toxic demise could be repeated at any of thousands of abandoned mines around the country.\u201cOur initial economy was largely driven by mining,\u201d Gov. John Hickenlooper said in an interview last week at the State Capitol, a building with a gold-leaf dome that pays homage to this history. \u201cBut it left us a sad legacy of these sites that are going to need significant resources to fix. Damage that no one understood or realized that this was going to be an issue.\u201dColorado \u201cdodged a bullet\u201d this month, he added, saying the effects of the spill could have been far worse had the mine been larger or more laden with metals.In its heyday, the Gold King produced about 350,000 ounces of high-grade gold, according to its current owner, and its products landed on the fingers of well-off women in New York City, in the pockets of everyday Americans and in the vaults of banks around the world.After the Gold King shut down, it passed from company to company, with owners who each believed that it would one day be economically feasible to reopen the mine and extract more of the gold and other minerals buried there.Mr. Hennis, who lives in a Denver suburb, said the mine could contain 400,000 ounces of gold and four million ounces of silver, and he hopes to turn a profit by selling. But by 2011 the Gold King was spitting out metal-laced waste at an average rate of 176 gallons per minute, according to E.P.A. data, and it was just one of several leaky mines in San Juan County with a discharge rate that residents, local officials and experts call alarming.In the creek below the mines, tests showed that the water had levels of cadmium and copper more than 10 times the maximum federal standard for a waterway that sustains aquatic life, and the level of zinc was more than 40 times that federal standard.Today, there are two communities directly below the Gold King: Silverton, a town of 655 people that consists mostly of lifelong residents whose families came here generations ago to work in the mines, and Durango, a city of 17,000 that sits 50 miles to the south and is full of retirees and young people attracted by the spectacular hiking, biking and rafting nearby.The Animas River \u2014 the waterway affected by the mine spill and by the daily leakage of toxic waste \u2014 is deeply entrenched in the culture and economy of both places, used for fishing, rafting, irrigation, livestock and, in the case of Durango, drinking. But for years, the subject of mine cleanup has divided these communities.Others, fearful of the stigma that sometimes comes with Superfund status and leery of federal involvement in local issues, are opposed.The fault line in the debate often falls between newer arrivals, who tend to favor E.P.A. involvement, and longtime residents, who typically oppose it. The last mine in the county closed in 1991, but some Silverton mining families hold on to hope that the mines will reopen, something that would almost surely not happen if the region became a Superfund site.In Silverton over the weekend, residents said the E.P.A.\u2019s accident had heightened the disagreement.On Saturday, at a spot on a dirt road just across from the Gold King, one of the mine\u2019s former owners \u2014 Mr. Fearn, a longtime Silverton resident and engineer who is 71 \u2014 gazed out at the flow from the mine, which was still running at 600 gallons a minute, more than three times its typical rate.Even after the spill, he said, he favors a voluntary collaboration, rather than a federal takeover. \u201cIt\u2019s our community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to have a bit of a say in how it\u2019s done.\u201dAfter he spoke, a turquoise Jeep Cherokee pulled up, and Bill Dodge, a transplant from a Washington suburb who lives part time in Silverton, jumped out wearing a blue fly-fishing hat.He had heard about the accident and wanted to see the damage for himself. He was tired of the slow-moving stakeholders meetings, he said, with anti-Superfund residents \u201cwho scream and yell and complain and don\u2019t cooperate.\u201d\u201cWe need a treatment plant now,\u201d said Mr. Dodge, 74. \u201cI think this is the sort of incident that can provoke a change in attitude.\u201dJack Healy contributed reporting from Denver.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.P.A. Announces New Rules to Cut Methane Emissions", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. McCabe estimated that the proposals \u2014 which would require drillers to stop leaks and capture lost gas even in wells intended to extract only oil \u2014 would cost the industry up to $420 million to carry out by 2025, but that there would be savings, including reduced waste, of as much as $550 million during that period, bringing a net benefit of as much as $150 million.Those rules, if they withstand legal challenges, would transform the nation\u2019s energy sector.Reducing methane is an important part of the administration\u2019s strategy, because methane is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, although it persists in the atmosphere for far less time than carbon dioxide does. The administration has set a goal of reducing methane emissions by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.The latest proposed regulations are expected to reduce methane emissions by 20 to 30 percent, Ms. McCabe said, getting the administration about halfway to its overall methane reduction target. Ms. McCabe declined to say how the administration intended to get all the way to its goal.\u201cThere are a variety of approaches that people are looking at,\u201d Ms. McCabe said. \u201cE.P.A. is not the only agency looking at these operations.\u201dOil and gas companies oppose the proposals, calling them unnecessary and costly, while environmental advocacy groups say they do not go far enough because they apply mainly to new wells and not most existing ones.Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas who is the chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, released a statement on Tuesday saying the proposals are part of the administration\u2019s \u201cwar on American energy jobs.\u201d\u201cThe E.P.A.\u2019s own data shows that methane emissions in the United States decreased by almost 15 percent between 1990 and 2013, yet E.P.A. is forging ahead,\u201d he wrote.Faced with the E.P.A.\u2019s plan and another one that is expected from the Bureau of Land Management regarding methane, oil and gas producers are grappling with regulations that could prove costly just as many of them are coping with lower prices for their products, said Sandra Snyder, an environmental lawyer in Washington who represents producers.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot hitting the oil and gas industry at once,\u201d Ms. Snyder said.Environmentalists offered tepid praise of Tuesday\u2019s proposals, which must go through a public comment period and analysis that often takes a year before being completed. Many faulted the administration for focusing the proposals on only new wells.Jack N. Gerard, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association, said Tuesday\u2019s proposals were unnecessary because the industry was reducing methane emissions on its own.\u201cThe last thing we need is more duplicative and costly regulation that could increase the cost of energy for Americans,\u201d Mr. Gerard said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, Giving More People Health Insurance Doesn\u2019t Save Money", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthThere\u2019s an oft-expressed view that getting all those people covered could actually save the health system money. The argument goes something like this: Once people have insurance, they\u2019ll go to the doctor instead of an expensive emergency room. Or: Prevention costs far less than a serious illness down the road.The actuaries cited three main reasons they think health spending is set to tick up. One is the aging of the population; people tend to get sicker as they age. Another is the improving economy, which will enable more people to afford medical care \u2014 or the time off from work it might take to attend to their health needs. But the third, and a big one, was Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion.Amy Finkelstein, a professor of economics at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the Oregon study, described this finding as their least surprising result. \u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming evidence from our study and others that when you cover people with health insurance, they use more health care,\u201d she said.But what about prevention? In certain situations, early spending on someone\u2019s health will stop an expensive disease in its tracks, reducing future spending. Giving people health insurance often enables them to get just this sort of preventive care \u2014 and Obamacare requires insurers to offer most preventive services without charging any co-payments. You might expect health spending to jump initially, then slow in future years as people benefit from new prevention. But research shows that even preventive care rarely ends up saving money.Joshua T. Cohen, the deputy director of the Center for Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at Tufts Medical Center, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard it before: \u2018An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t really play out when you analyze the numbers, and the reason for that is that you have to give a lot of people those ounces of prevention to end up with one person who\u2019s going to get that pound of cure.\u201dThere\u2019s also the unavoidable fact that every time you prevent people from dying from one disease, they are likely to live longer and incur future medical expenses. The patient who benefits from the cholesterol screening may go on to develop cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s or some other costly illness.There are some prevention measures that actually do seem to save money. Counseling on contraception is one because the costs of prenatal care, delivery and pediatric care associated with an unplanned pregnancy are so substantial. But a lot of the preventive health measures that we tend to value a lot \u2014 mammography, screening for diabetes \u2014 tend to cost more than they save. Researchers like Mr. Cohen, who study these trade-offs, say we need to think more broadly about the value of what our preventive spending buys, not the narrow question of whether it saves money.Some are now managing chronic and potentially life-threatening health conditions. But those benefits don\u2019t mean we should be surprised by the actuaries\u2019 recent findings on spending growth. More people in the health care system means more dollars spent on health care. The increase doesn\u2019t mean that Obamacare is leading to runaway costs, or that it\u2019s failing to reform the health care system to make it more efficient. But it does mean that we can\u2019t think of the coverage expansion as free.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Are Those Walleye Biting? On Minnesota Lake, They\u2019re Not", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd it was no mystery why. That morning, it had become illegal to fish here for walleye, the most treasured fish in Minnesota, on Mille Lacs Lake, perhaps the most famous place in the state to fish for it. Only a few days into August, summer on the lake seemed to be over.The decision prompted howls of protest from business owners and residents, who said the department had mismanaged the lake\u2019s walleye population for years and had, in effect, threatened to devastate the local economy, which is dependent on anglers who rent charter boats, stay in nearby motels and eat at bars and restaurants.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad deal,\u201d said Bill Lundeen, an owner of a bait shop near the lake. \u201cI totally see businesses closing up because of this. We like to stay positive, and today\u2019s a hard day to do that.\u201dAs for the suggestion that anglers come to the lake \u2014 which, at 200 square miles is nearly twice the size of Queens \u2014 to fish for smallmouth bass or perch instead, Kathy, Mr. Lundeen\u2019s wife, shook her head dismissively.\u201cHere\u2019s what that would be like,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tickets to the Rolling Stones, O.K.? And just before the concert, Mick Jagger quits.\u201dThe morning after walleye fishing was called off, fishermen said they were packing their bags, while motels began racking up cancellations throughout August. At the Blue Goose, in the town of Garrison, which hugs the lake, once-popular guided trips to fish for walleye \u2014 $35 for a four-hour trip, bait and tackle included \u2014 were called off.\u201cI had two gentlemen come in this morning, buy a couple of sweatshirts, and then say, \u2018We\u2019ll be back again when the fish are back,\u2019 \u201d said Denise Reid, a clerk at the Your Up North Trading Post, which sells gifts and souvenirs.Barb Brezina, 49, one of the few people walking along the lake on a recent day, stopped next to a 26-foot fiberglass walleye statue where tourists routinely pose for pictures.\u201cWalleye is what this town is known for,\u201d she said, adding that she and her husband had decided to fish in another lake nearby instead. \u201cEveryone around here is going to suffer.\u201dTwo hours\u2019 drive to the south, in the Twin Cities, Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, has scrambled to placate people affected by the walleye fishing ban, even suggesting that the Legislature be convened for a special session to find a solution to the crisis in the Mille Lacs (pronounced mill-LACKS) area, possibly through interest-free loans or tax abatements.This is a \u201cdark day for Minnesota fishing and certainly the people of Mille Lacs,\u201d Mr. Dayton said at a news conference announcing the ban. He has said that he is considering a move to restock the lake with walleye, a plan that could begin next spring.Fishing is at the heart of Minnesota culture, with more fishing licenses issued here per capita than in any other state. The Department of Natural Resources says there are 5,493 fishable lakes.And it is hard to overstate the affection that Minnesotans have for walleye, a large, olive-and-gold-scaled fish with snow white flesh that is flaky and sweet. About 4.6 million pounds of walleye are harvested each year for sport. Good restaurants routinely command $30 for a walleye filet, saut\u00e9ed and drizzled with lemon; at the Minnesota State Fair, it is served deep-fried on a wooden stick. (Most restaurants here buy walleye from commercial fisheries in Canada.)There is little agreement on the reasons for the apparent drop-off in the walleye population, but experts at the state\u2019s natural resources agency say that larger predators \u2014 especially large walleye \u2014 appear to be eating younger walleye in alarming numbers. This could be because of a shortage of other fish like perch or tullibee, species that large walleye typically like to eat, but that have struggled to survive as lakes in Minnesota have gradually warmed as a result of climate change, some fish biologists say.Business owners in the Mille Lacs Lake region say that without walleye fishing, they have little to draw visitors. In the towns around the lake, where large signs reading \u201cWelcome Fishermen\u201d are a common sight, some day trippers and families with children visit, but it is primarily serious fishermen who expect to catch a half-dozen walleye each day.Kari Hough, an owner of a charter fishing service, said that he would focus on anglers who wanted to catch smallmouth bass or northern pike, though he had canceled his nightly trip to fish for walleye.He said he believed much of the criticism from the state agency and from Indian tribes, which under normal circumstances are allowed to fish for walleye using nets, was unfounded.\u201cThe D.N.R. is just doing their job,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing the best job they can do. You can\u2019t count wildlife.\u201dUntil the walleye population is corrected, some people have suggested that it is time for Mille Lacs Lake to rebrand itself. The Minnesota tourism office has proposed to spend $400,000 in the next two years, marketing the lake as a place that has more to offer than walleye fishing.Others said they were waiting for the Legislature and the governor to take quick action. \u201cA loan would be good, but how am I going to pay it back?\u201d said Randy Simons, an avid fisherman who rents pontoon boats to tourists in the town of Onamia. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody catching fish because there\u2019s nobody here.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article omitted part of the name of the resort. It is Twin Pines Resort, not Pines Resort.An article on Thursday about the end of the walleye fishing season in Minnesota referred incorrectly to larger walleye that appeared to be eating the smaller fish for food. They are predators, not prey.An article last Thursday about the end of the walleye fishing season in Minnesota gave an incorrect guide for the pronunciation for Mille Lacs Lake, where the fishing has been halted. It is mill-LACKS, not mill-LACK.Advertisement"}

Still, that meant the People\u2019s Bank of China had effectively devalued the currency 4.4 percent. It was the steepest drop since the country\u2019s modern exchange rate system was set up in 1994.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.China\u2019s stock markets are still struggling after a sell-off that began in mid-June. The government took extraordinary measures to support share prices, including barring major shareholders from selling stocks and ordering state agencies to buy, with backing from state banks. But they had little lasting effect.The renminbi\u2019s fall should provide a modest boost to the country\u2019s exporters, as the prices of their goods become relatively cheaper to overseas buyers. But officials at the central bank have denied that was why they pushed the currency down, saying instead that they wished to move closer to an exchange rate guided by trading.Instead of ignoring movements in the currency market, the central bank said it would begin to use them as the reference point in its daily setting of the exchange rate. The renminbi\u2019s reaction to this change, they said, was a \u201cone-off\u201d adjustment.The currency had been under pressure to weaken as China\u2019s economy slowed. But the central bank kept it closely linked to the dollar, which had strengthened against most other major currencies because of the rebounding economy in the United States.\u201cChina\u2019s equities market crumbled this summer because its regulators were incapable of acting in the face of a bubble,\u201d Daniel H.

And the renminbi\u2019s daily swings are still capped at a rise or fall of 2 percent.The central bank set the exchange rate at 6.397 per dollar on Friday, a tiny 0.01 percent gain from Thursday\u2019s market close. It remained steady around that level throughout trading on Friday, despite heavy volume, suggesting that the central bank was acting to keep the currency stable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ashley Madison Recession? Or an Ashley Madison Stimulus?", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWages of SinThe revelation of who opened accounts on the Ashley Madison site for adulterers got the attention of curiousity seekers and suspicious spouses. Josh Barro and Justin Wolfers had a different impulse. They wondered whether a surge in marital trouble resulting from the Ashley Madison hack could hurt the economy \u2014 or even, surprisingly, make it grow faster.Josh:The Ashley Madison hack, which appears to have exposed personal information about millions of users of the website for married people looking to have affairs, is likely to cause trouble in lots of marriages. Could that add up to trouble in the American economy?My instinct is that, economically, the impact of the Ashley Madison hack could look a lot like a hurricane. It is likely to unexpectedly destroy a lot of capital people invested time and money in creating \u2013 except, instead of buildings and infrastructure, this capital would consist of valuable human relationships.Divorce is costly, not just emotionally but financially. If you have to save up to pay a lawyer and rent a studio apartment, won\u2019t you eat out less and put off buying a new car? Could this be felt at the level of the macroeconomy \u2014 a divorce drag? How many divorces do you have to precipitate to tip the economy into recession?Justin:Lemme try to do some back-of-the-envelope math. And warning, most of my guesses will be wrong, but hopefully they\u2019re good enough to get the order of magnitude right.But let\u2019s run with the number for a worst-case scenario, and let\u2019s say that half of them were dumb enough to use easily identifiable email addresses or can be identified through credit card information. That brings us to 5 million marriages at risk. And let\u2019s say that half of all spouses actually check the files to see if their partner is there (that seems incredibly high to me but perhaps that is plausible once the data become easily accessible). Then we are down to 2.5 million marriages, and let\u2019s say that half of them can\u2019t work their way through it, then we have 1.25 million divorces. Let\u2019s say that a third of these folks would eventually have been caught cheating anyway or would have divorced for other reasons. So we have around 800,000 extra divorces.So what\u2019s the macroeconomic impact? Here\u2019s where I\u2019m truly making numbers up.Divorce is actually pretty simple in lots of cases \u2014 you just fill in the forms. (There\u2019s an argument that paralegals should be able to do this work.) Let\u2019s say that each divorce leads to $5,000 in extra spending on lawyers. That would mean an extra $1 billion in extra spending on lawyers per year, for each of the next four years. Value-added in the legal service industry was $225 billion in 2013, so the impact on the legal services industry as a whole turns out to be pretty small \u2014 a spike of about 0.4 percent higher demand for the next four years. Of course the impact on family lawyers will be much more concentrated, but still, this isn\u2019t huge.For the economy as a whole, you have to decide whether the extra spending on divorce lawyers is extra spending, or whether it comes partly from cutting back on other things. Even if it all comes with no offsetting spending in other categories, then $1 billion in legal fees pales in comparison to a $17 trillion economy. G.D.P. would be higher by 0.006 percent for a few years \u2013 too small an effect to measure.I suspect the bigger economic issue is what these divorces would do for new household formation. If all these newly single people formed new households, then household formation will be 200,000 higher each year for the next four years, and that would fuel demand for construction. But that seems too big: In the United States, folks who have been divorced start by moving in with friends or family, and then very often move in quickly with new partners. A lot of this is musical chairs not leading to demand for an extra home.A reasonable guess might be that annual household formation would be 100,000 higher for the next four years (the other half quickly repartner), but 50,000 lower for the subsequent four years (as some of the extra divorced folks continue to repartner). I\u2019m not quite sure how to convert this into G.D.P.-equivalents, but it seems relatively small compared to household formation rates.My sense in all of this: I\u2019ve almost surely overstated the number of divorces that will follow from Ashley Madison, and I\u2019ve likely overstated how much extra construction this will lead to. If you think that this extra spending has multiplier effects, that could boost the macroeconomic impact. But if you asked me for a bottom line, I think that the net effect will be less than 0.1 percent \u2014 basically impossible to see in our noisy macroeconomic data.Josh:Wait. What you\u2019re looking at here is a small but positive effect on the economy if the divorce rate rises?That strikes me as implausible. Divorce may create demand for more housing, but it doesn\u2019t make people more productive. It probably makes them less productive, because it\u2019s distracting and unpleasant and often acrimonious.If divorcing couples spend more on housing and lawyers but their income stays flat or goes down, they\u2019ll have to cut back their consumption of something else. This is the main economic effect I was assuming you would see \u2014 people buying fewer new cars and going on fewer vacations and eating out less.Saying extra divorces grow the economy is like saying paying people to dig holes and fill them up grows the economy \u2014 it can only be true if there is a serious demand gap, and new spending doesn\u2019t do anything to crowd out other spending, which may have been true in 2009 but isn\u2019t true today.Also, even if you\u2019re right, it takes time to add new housing units. There might be enough slack in the construction industry right now to simply increase the pace of housing construction by enough nationally, but not in every market. In some places, higher demand for housing will simply manifest as higher rents and prices.That is, all the divorcing couples out there looking for studio apartments will drive up rents and make it harder for millennials to move out of their parents\u2019 basements \u2013 adding another aspect of economic drag.Justin:You are right, my numbers come from thinking only about the demand side effects, and they are positive. But your argument that all this extra spending will crowd out other spending comes from thinking about people meeting their budget constraints period by period. But of course people can (and most likely will) borrow.Think of an analogy. When someone wins a $1 million lottery, we don\u2019t expect them to increase their spending by a $1 million that year. Instead, we expect them to raise their spending by $50,000 per year, for each of the next 20 or so years.Divorce is a bit like losing the lottery \u2013 a one-time windfall loss instead of a gain. Or alternatively, think of it as a consumer durable \u2014 a long-run investment in a better life. We don\u2019t typically expect people who buy a house or other durables to pay it all off overnight. Just because you spent $200,000 more on housing this year doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll spend $200,000 less on other stuff this year. Instead, you\u2019ll borrow and pay it off slowly.Likewise, the extra investments that divorce requires are all long-run investments that people will most likely \u201cpay off\u201d slowly over time. So I don\u2019t think that the effect on buying fewer cars will be that large.Josh:That long-run approach is valid so long as people are liquid \u2014 that is, they can borrow or draw down assets to finance the cost of a divorce without significantly changing their other spending patterns. That\u2019s true for some people; it\u2019s not true for others. Some people have no choice but to respond to a negative one-time income shock by spending less. Relatedly, divorce can be a reason people file for bankruptcy.But set aside these income shock effects. Relationships are valuable human capital, right? Shouldn\u2019t an event that suddenly and unexpectedly destroys a chunk of them look a lot like a natural disaster that destroys a lot of real estate? The loss of capital ordinarily leads to a loss of output.Justin:Now we\u2019re talking about the supply side of the economy. If relationships are productive \u2014 we are better on the job when married than when single \u2014 then the analogy with human capital is a good one. And destroying any form of capital lowers G.D.P.But it\u2019s not clear that marital relationships really are human capital in the economic sense. It\u2019s not enough to show that people enjoyed being married or liked their spouses (before the Ashley Madison discovery). To have an effect on G.D.P., the marriage would have to have been increasing their productivity.There is academic research on the \u201cmarriage earnings premium,\u201d finding that married men are paid a few percent more than unmarried men, arguably supporting the idea that marriage is a productive form of capital. But the same literature finds a \u201cmarriage penalty\u201d for married women versus unmarried women. I\u2019m not sure I find this persuasive evidence that relationships are in fact economically productive. It might just be that high-earning men are more attractive spouses.There are also longer-run effects to consider, but they\u2019re a generation away. The Ashley Madison hack might mean that more kids grow up without married parents. In most cases, we might think that a loving and intact marriage is better for kids than divorce. But in reality, many of these families face a different trade-off, between mom and dad staying together in an unhappy and perhaps conflict-ridden marriage, versus getting divorced and possibly repartnering. It\u2019s quite unclear what\u2019s best for the kids in these situations.But more important, you are right: The big costs here are real, it\u2019s just that most of them aren\u2019t measured in our economic statistics. They\u2019re broken homes and broken hearts. Just as a natural disaster is terrible though not necessarily a major macroeconomic event, the Ashley Madison leak may be terrible for many families, though not a macroeconomic event.Josh:Well, I guess that\u2019s a bit of comfort.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protests Across Brazil Raise Pressure on President Dilma Rousseff", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Tens of thousands of protesters returned to the streets of cities across Brazil on Sunday to express their ire against President Dilma Rousseff, reflecting a low ebb for her as she grapples with a colossal bribery scandal and a declining economy. Still, the protests in some cities seemed to lack some of the urgency of huge demonstrations this year calling for the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, a leftist who won re-election just 10 months ago, suggesting tension may be easing somewhat on the president as congressional and business leaders try to prevent a political crisis from intensifying. The protest in Rio de Janeiro had something of a Carnivalesque feel to it; some demonstrators wore bathing suits as they marched through the Copacabana district as trucks blared samba. But vitriol also marked the event, with some urging the president to kill herself or calling on the military to take power. \u201cA military intervention may be illegal, but the people have to mobilize to make it legal,\u201d said Rosangela Almeida, 53, an accountant, arguing that action must be taken to prevent Brazil from suffering the economic disarray of neighboring Venezuela. Decades of dictatorship in Brazil left a legacy of hyperinflation and human rights abuses, and political analysts consider the chances of the armed forces returning to power through a coup to be negligible. Still, rising polarization is feeding fears that political infighting could prolong an economic slump. Eying the potential for upheaval if Ms. Rousseff is forced to step down, business leaders have been pressuring political leaders to prevent the crisis from worsening. In a notable move, the newspaper O Globo said in an editorial that maneuvering against Ms. Rousseff in Congress had gone too far. The head of the Senate, Renan Calheiros, expressed opposition last week to impeaching Ms. Rousseff, while seeking to advance measures to restore confidence in the economy. The possibility that Ms. Rousseff could draw greater support in the Senate bolstered hopes that she could fend off momentum for her impeachment in the lower house. Still, some observers warn that the political crisis remains in flux. Prosecutors are expected to make more revelations in the bribery scandal involving Petrobras, the government-controlled oil company. The economy is expected to shrink both this year and next. And Ms. Rousseff\u2019s approval ratings remain mired in the single digits. \u201cConciliation is advancing, but it\u2019s still based on a precarious equilibrium,\u201d said Bernardo Mello Franco, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo. Ms. Rousseff insists she will not resign, even as her opponents hold her responsible for the scandal at Petrobras because the bribery scheme flourished while she was chairwoman of the company\u2019s board, before her election in 2010. She also faces legal challenges over whether her campaign received illicit contributions and if her government improperly used money from state banks to cover budget shortfalls. \u201cThere is a process of intolerance in Brazil unseen except in moments of the past when democracy was ruptured,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said last week in a televised interview. \u201cThe culture of the coup still exists, but I don\u2019t think the conditions are there for it to occur.\u201d Many protesters throughout Brazil on Sunday said they were prepared to deal with the consequences of ousting her. \u201cImpeachment would be momentarily destabilizing, but it\u2019s allowed in the Constitution, and it needs to happen,\u201d said Pedro Lopes Siqueira, 35, a public servant in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s judiciary. Others, however, are not so sanguine. C\u00e1ssia Regina Dias, 42, who earns a living making sweets, said she wanted Ms. Rousseff removed from power, but expressed dismay about the jockeying for power as the president\u2019s influence declines. \u201cNo party will be the savior after such damage,\u201d Ms. Dias said. Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura and Jill Langlois from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}

Even some of the country\u2019s top-performing portfolio managers have been hit. A fund run by William Miller, the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, gave back all of this year\u2019s gains of 14 percent. Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, lost about 10 percent over the last month. Both funds are now roughly flat over the last year.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in this business for 35 years, as I have, you prefer a fast death to a slow death,\u201d Mr. Smead said when I reached him in the midst of this week\u2019s turmoil. \u201cWe\u2019re not technical people, but for this bull market to have another leg, you have to have something like this happen.\u201dThat\u2019s because sustained market rallies come not during periods of complacency and optimism, but when most investors have given up and thrown in the towel (think of March 2009). \u201cIt had been a long while since we\u2019ve seen anything that looks like this sort of capitulation,\u201d Mr. Smead said.Mr. Miller said he met with his team on Monday after two days of unabated selling, and told them: \u201cWhat happened today and Friday is that the froth is being blown off the beer. The beer is better without the froth.\u201dThere\u2019s no way to know where markets are headed next, of course. By some measures, United States stocks are still expensive relative to expected earnings.The AlphaSimplex Group in Cambridge, Mass., which follows a strictly quantitative, computer-driven approach, significantly lowered its exposure to United States stocks on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s in response to the above-average risk we\u2019ve seen in the market, not just in the past few days, but building up over recent weeks and months, which includes the risk of contagion from abroad,\u201d said Alexander D. Healy, director of strategic research at AlphaSimplex.But one thing is certain: Stock prices are much lower today than they were a few weeks ago, with every major index, both in the United States and overseas, down more than 10 percent, which is the definition of a correction. (A decline of 20 percent or more is considered to indicate a bear market.)Both Mr. Miller and Mr. Smead told me they saw what looked like significant bargains emerge from the sharp drop, and they were using the opportunity to add to positions in their favorite stocks.Mr. Miller told me he was struck that this week\u2019s selling was across the board, affecting virtually all regions and sectors. \u201cThe selling was indiscriminate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s prospects have not changed identically and for the worse. That means there are opportunities.\u201dSo what was Mr. Miller buying this week? He said he was pursuing his themes of home builders (\u201ccompletely unaffected by China\u201d), airlines (\u201cscreamingly cheap, especially with low oil prices\u201d) and money center banks (\u201cgenerating huge amounts of capital\u201d). He also said he was intrigued by Twitter, which was trading below its initial public offering price this week.Mr. Smead\u2019s Smead Value Fund (investor class) ranks first among large cap blended funds over five years, with a five-year annualized return of just under 19 percent, according to Morningstar.He continued: \u201cWe try to take a long-term view. There are 86 million people in this country between the ages of 19 and 37. They don\u2019t own stocks, they do drive cars, and they want to buy a house. This is nirvana for them\u201d \u2014 because they haven\u2019t lost any money in the market, gas prices are plunging and mortgage rates are likely to remain low \u2014 \u201cand great for the United States economy.\u201dMr. Smead said he was buying four stocks, which he considered solid value propositions: Amgen, Berkshire Hathaway, American Express and News Corporation.If opportunities are appearing in the United States market, they are even more evident overseas, even in China, whose faltering economy and currency, and plunging markets, have been the trigger for the recent global market turmoil.In part that is because many emerging markets were already in a bear market before the recent plunge.\u201cEmerging markets are generally looking attractive relative to their historic valuations,\u201d said James Syme, a senior fund manager at J O Hambro Capital Management in London, although he added that there was a big difference between manufacturing exporters like China, Taiwan and South Korea, whose stocks \u201cseem incredibly cheap,\u201d and countries that rely heavily on commodity exports, like Brazil and Russia.The JOHCM International Select Fund ranks first over both three- and five-year periods in its category, which is foreign large cap growth funds, according to Morningstar, with annualized returns of 14 percent over three years. The fund is closed to new investors, but Mr. Syme manages the JOHCM Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund, which isn\u2019t. Over the last year, it is down roughly 20 percent, which nonetheless puts it near the top of its category, which is diversified emerging markets.\u201cWe\u2019re overweight in China, and we\u2019re using periods of weakness to top up positions,\u201d Mr. Syme said. \u201cThere are obviously stresses in the Chinese economy, but Chinese policy makers have plenty of tools to address those challenges. Interest rate cuts and currency weakness are two of those tools, and we expect to see results from their recent actions during the second half of the year.\u201dMoreover, he added, \u201cChinese stock valuations are pricing in an awful lot of bad news.\u201d He noted that the current forward price-earnings multiple on Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks is nine, \u201cwhich is about where it was after the collapse of Lehman.\u201d At the same time, his fund is avoiding \u201cthe commodity exporting nations.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very underweight Latin America, Indonesia and Malaysia, and have only a few select positions in Russia and South Africa,\u201d Mr. Syme said.Besides adding to positions in Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares, Mr. Syme said he was buying leading Asian technology companies, such as Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor.With the markets soaring on Wednesday and grinding higher in Thursday trading, purchases made earlier in the week look smart, for now.If the volatility continues and the indexes drop further, investors should remember what Mr. Miller says is a rather simple math lesson.\u201cIf you sell when stocks go down, you\u2019ll end up owning nothing when they hit bottom,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cYou should be doing the opposite.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about money managers who are looking for bargains after a global market sell-off, rendered incorrectly parts of the names of an asset management firm and two of its funds. It is J O Hambro Capital Management, not J. O. Hambro Asset Management, and the funds are the JOHCM International Select Fund and the JOHCM Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund, not the J.O. Hambro International Select Fund and the J.O. Hambro Global Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund.The Common Sense column on Friday, about money managers who are looking for bargains after a global market sell-off, misspelled the surname of the director of strategic research at the AlphaSimplex Group, who discussed the firm\u2019s investment strategy.

Will officials allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar by, say, 2 percent from the day before if new data shows the Chinese economy is growing faster than expected?China needs to stop fixing its exchange rate.

{"Headline": "Before Main Republican Debate, Bottom 7 Contenders Put On Brave Faces", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEVELAND \u2014 They called it the undercard. The kiddie table. The happy hour debate.The wry and self-deprecating nicknames coined by the seven presidential candidates bumped from the main Republican debate on Thursday were meant to put a brave face on a situation that none liked: They were relegated to a forum several hours earlier on the same stage, with far fewer people watching.The absence of the top 10 candidates, chosen based on national polls, sapped much of the potential energy from the debate, which took place in a nearly-empty sports arena. None of the participants criticized their peers. The pacing of the questions and dutiful answers felt more like a spelling bee than a vigorous exchange of ideas.At the outset, one of the two Fox News moderators, Bill Hemmer, brought up \u201cthe elephant that is not in the room tonight, Donald Trump,\u201d and the outspoken billionaire\u2019s shadow was felt throughout the debate.\u201cHow can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single-payer health care?\u201d Mr. Perry asked, referring to a position Mr. Trump once took.Even when not asked about Mr. Trump, candidates alluded to him. Mr. Santorum, speaking of illegal immigration, said that \u201csome of the other candidates have strong positions\u201d on the topic, but that his was different. Perhaps in an effort to top Mr. Trump, Mr. Santorum called for restricting legal immigration by 25 percent.Ms. Fiorina criticized Mr. Trump for shifting from liberal policies he had favored while flirting with earlier presidential runs.\u201cSince he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care and on abortion, I think, what are the principles on which he would govern?\u201d she said.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.Few of the candidates attacked Hillary Rodham Clinton unprovoked. (When asked by moderators, however, they enthusiastically obliged.) One who did, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, accused Mrs. Clinton of doublespeak in her defense of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Mr. Graham later took aim directly at the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, saying, \u201cThis deal is giving him a pathway to a bomb, a missile to deliver it and money to pay for it all.\u201dNearly all of the participants promised to reject the deal with Iran on their first day in office.Jim Gilmore, the former governor of Virginia, who struggled to get his share of the attention during the debate, proposed that \u201cthere be a Middle East NATO so that we can combine our allies there.\u201dAbortion was also a focus of the 80-minute debate. Mr. Jindal said that on Day 1 in the Oval Office, he would order investigations by the Justice Department and other agencies into Planned Parenthood, whose handling of fetal tissue has been the subject of secretly recorded videos that Mr. Jindal said \u201cshow hideous disrespect for life.\u201dGeorge E. Pataki, the former New York governor, was asked how, as a Republican favoring abortion rights, he could hope to win support when no candidate with his views had won a Republican presidential primary anywhere in 35 years. Mr. Pataki said that he was \u201cpersonally appalled\u201d by abortion, but that it was fruitless to continue trying to overrule the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow it under certain circumstances.Each candidate could cite long r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, from stints as governors to senators to chief executives. And many pointed to their experience to suggest that they could bolster job growth and the economy.It was unclear whether any of the candidates delivered a forceful enough performance to move themselves into the \u201cadult table\u201d in future debates. One of the contenders previously least known nationally, Ms. Fiorina, did come across as poised and tough.Mr. Perry, the No. 11 candidate in national polls, according to Fox News, may have suffered most under the formula used to winnow the field. Four years ago, he stood at center stage in a Republican presidential debate, reflecting his position as the leader in polls. His fall from favor with primary voters had much to do with his moderate positions on illegal immigration as governor.But on Thursday, he insisted there could be no national conversation on granting any kind of legal status to the millions of immigrants in the United States illegally before securing the border with Mexico. He said \u201cstrategic fencing\u201d and patrolling the border with \u201caviation assets\u201d were necessary to secure it. \u201cAt that particular point in time,\u201d Mr. Perry said, \u201cthen Americans will believe that Washington is up to a conversation to deal with the millions of people that are here illegally, but not until.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Restarts Reactor, Lifting 2-Year Ban Prompted by Fukushima Accident", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan took a decisive step on Tuesday toward ending a two-year freeze on the use of nuclear power, as an electric utility restarted one of the dozens of reactors in the country that were taken offline after meltdowns at a plant in Fukushima in 2011.The reactor at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant, in Kagoshima prefecture, is the first to return to service since government regulators introduced upgraded safety standards in 2013. Most of Japan\u2019s 48 operable commercial nuclear reactors were shut down soon after the Fukushima accident, and none have operated since 2013.The issue of whether Japan should again join the ranks of nations that use nuclear power is a highly contentious one here. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe supports restarting idled reactors that meet the new enhanced safety standards, arguing that Japan\u2019s economy depends on the low-cost power they provide. Japan has few domestic energy sources, and the country imports virtually all the fossil fuels it uses to power its cars, homes and factories. Electricity prices in Japan have increased by 20 percent or more since the Fukushima disaster, squeezing households and businesses.The public remains skeptical about the plants\u2019 safety, however, with surveys showing a majority favor closing the idled plants permanently.Plans to restart Sendai and other reactors have been in place since the new safety regulations were introduced more than two years ago, but they have been slowed by political and technical obstacles. The plants need to be retrofitted with new ventilation systems and other protections, and the operators require the approval of local political leaders to switch them back on. The Sendai plant was declared safe by regulators nearly a year ago, in September 2014.The utility that owns the plant, Kyushu Electric Power, said it removed control rods from the core of the reactor at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, initiating the atomic reaction that will eventually produce electricity. It plans to start producing and transmitting electricity for its customers next month.The national broadcaster NHK aired video of workers in the plant\u2019s control room as they restarted the reactor. Tomomitsu Sakata, a spokesman for Kyushu Electric Power, said the reactor had been put back online without any problems.Dozens of protesters, including a former prime minister, gathered outside the plant as the police stood guard.

The actual Republican front-runner rails, peddling insults instead of ideas. And the story line caroms from misogyny to xenophobia to a tussle over tresses: toupee or not toupee?It\u2019s impossible to see how anyone electable is salvaged from this.Then again it\u2019s not, because if you sort through the rabble, you find John Kasich.He may never make it out of the primaries. The odds are against him. And he has flaws, serious ones, which I\u2019ll get to.But that doesn\u2019t change the fact \u2014 obscured for now by the bedlam of the Republican contest \u2014 that the party has someone who\u2019s comporting himself with unexpected nimbleness, who would match up very well against Hillary Clinton or any other Democratic nominee and who could give Republicans hope, if they just gave him a chance.Here\u2019s the case for Kasich:He has plenty of experience, plenty of maturity. He knows how Congress works \u2014 and, presumably, how to work with it \u2014 because he served in the House of Representatives for 18 years, six of them as the chairman of the House Budget Committee.But there\u2019s plenty else that pegs him as independent-minded and might make him acceptable, even appealing, to swing voters, whom he seems as well positioned to capture as any of the other Republican candidates are.He has expressed openness to some kind of path to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally. He has shown little appetite for the culture wars that other Republicans gleefully fight (although, it must be noted, he formally opposes gay marriage and abortion rights).Most strikingly, he broke with Republican orthodoxy and with most other Republican governors and accepted the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, a decision he defended in a way that illuminated his skills as a tactician and a communicator. He said that what he\u2019d done made practical and cost-effective sense for Ohio, and that his course was consistent with true Christian principles, which call for helping the downtrodden.\u201cTo me, faith is the dos, not the don\u2019ts,\u201d Kasich explained last spring, steering the party\u2019s religious impulses away from divisive social issues and signaling that conservatism should be as concerned with a big heart as with a small government.By revisiting that tone and those themes in the first Republican debate earlier this month, he turned in one of the best performances of the night.\u201cThat\u2019s crucial, because the Trump phenomenon is a bigger thing than just a reality star writ large,\u201d Schoen said.During the debate, Ari Fleischer, who served in the second Bush administration, tweeted: \u201cKasich is killing it. Hopeful. Uplifting. Optimistic. And he has an appeal to those who think the GOP doesn\u2019t care.\u201dKasich is hardly the anti-politician that many Americans seem to crave. But he doesn\u2019t have the whiff of political royalty that Bush inevitably does. Put Bush up against Clinton and he erases some of her potential liabilities, because they\u2019re also his: all the reminders of yesterday, all the time spent in a bubble of privilege, all the unshakable allegiances to overfamiliar characters.Kasich can strike a folksier chord, reminding voters, as he frequently does, that his father was a postal worker and his grandfather a coal miner.I mean Marco Rubio, who can seem too green for the top job but not for the No. 2 spot. He\u2019s a talented politician. His selection could help with Hispanic voters. He connotes generational change. And he\u2019s from Florida (as is Bush, which argues against a Bush-Rubio ticket).There\u2019s no reason to think he\u2019ll do well in early primary contests in Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada. That puts do-or-die pressure on New Hampshire.He\u2019s known to have attention problems and a mean streak. His congressional career links him to the disastrous mid-1990s effort to shut down the government. And after Congress, he worked as an investment banker with Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm. That\u2019s a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 line out of sync with the electorate\u2019s mood.But he has made the best of it, portraying it as an inside look at a vital part of the economy, a fruitful research mission. He\u2019s dexterous that way. And Democrats, trust me, have noticed, enough to hope that Republican primary voters don\u2019t wake up to the same realization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cybersecurity Bill Is Latest to Be Delayed in Senate", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate headed into its August recess on Wednesday without voting on a cybersecurity bill, adding it to a contentious to-do list for September that includes a push to disapprove the Iran nuclear deal and a spending fight mired in abortion politics. The delay of the cybersecurity bill followed a pattern that has marked the Senate since the Republicans took control this year. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has struggled to accelerate the legislative track while still permitting members of both parties to amend bills on the floor, as he has repeatedly promised to do. Mr. McConnell tried this summer to attach the cybersecurity measure to a broader defense bill as a way to mousetrap Democrats into voting for it, but that effort failed. Mr. McConnell then went on to other legislative matters, including a major trade package. When the Senate finally turned to the cybersecurity bill, Mr. McConnell could not get an easy agreement on amendments, which further delayed the action, as did objections from some privacy advocates. Negotiating amendment deals may have slowed legislation far more than Mr. McConnell anticipated when he took the Senate\u2019s reins, even though he repeatedly used filibuster tactics based on amendment disagreements to block legislation when he was in the minority. He promised to deliver a different culture while in the majority, but getting consent among 100 senators is no easier for him than it was for his predecessor, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. This has sometimes produced dire results for Congress. A fight over changes to the Patriot Act \u2014 led by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who wanted a long list of amendments \u2014 led to a short-term expiration of the law.Few senators wanted to stick around beyond Wednesday, noting that the House was long gone. But senators in both parties said they feared that another cyberattack could hit the government or the private sector while they were home for the monthlong break. \u201cThere should be concern about that,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. Should there be a major attack in August, he said, voters could wonder \u201cwhy government didn\u2019t try to do something to prevent it.\u201dIn April, the House passed a measure that would push companies to share access to their computer networks and records with federal investigators. Neither the House legislation nor the bill to be considered by the Senate would have prevented attacks such as the recent theft of the personal information of more than 20 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management. \u201cOur nation has unparalleled strength,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has been working for years to get a cybersecurity bill out of the Senate. \u201cBut cyberspace allows much weaker adversaries to target our people, our economy and our military.\u201d She added, \u201cWe already know many of the steps necessary to reduce the likelihood of a cyber 9/11, yet many of these actions have not yet been taken in either the government or in the private sector.\u201dWhile Congress achieved many major accomplishments this year, including the final broad revisions to the Patriot Act, a new formula for paying doctors under Medicare, and two bills that may be reconciled to fix the No Child Left Behind law, other legislation continues to be hard-fought. On the horizon is a budget battle that some Republicans said could lead to a government shutdown if Congress does not move to take away money from Planned Parenthood. Congressional leaders hope to at least pass a temporary funding measure before an address by Pope Francis to a joint meeting of Congress on Sept. 24.\u201cIt takes a long time to do things in the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell said to reporters last week.

{"Headline": "Zombie Factories Stalk the Sputtering Chinese Economy", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosMiao Leijie loses money on each ton of cement his company produces. But stopping production is not an option.When the plant opened in 2011 to supply the real estate and infrastructure industries in the northern Chinese city of Changzhi, the company raised most of the initial money from banks. Now, Mr. Miao, the factory\u2019s general director, needs to keep churning out cement simply so the company can pay the interest on its loans.It will be tough for the business, Lucheng Zhuoyue Cement Plant, to get out of the hole. Customers and investments are drying up, and the company is borrowing even more money to stay afloat.\u201cIf we ceased production, the losses would be crushing,\u201d Mr. Miao said, as he chain-smoked in the company\u2019s quiet, spartan office. \u201cWe are working for the bank.\u201dChangzhi and its environs are littered with half-dead cement factories and silent, mothballed plants, an eerie backdrop to the struggling Chinese economy.Like many industrial cities across China, Changzhi, which expanded aggressively during the country\u2019s long investment boom, has too many factories and too little demand. That excess capacity, many economists indicate, will have to be eliminated for the Chinese economy to return to healthy growth.But rather than shut down, Lucheng Zhuoyue and other Changzhi companies are limping along in a kind of march of the undead.To protect jobs and plants, the government and its state-owned banks sometimes keep money-losing businesses on life support by rolling over or restructuring loans, providing fresh credit or offering other aid. While this may seem like an odd business tactic, it is part of a broader strategy to help maintain social stability, a major goal of China\u2019s leadership. Authorities in China\u2019s provinces and cities also back struggling factories just because they are deemed important to the local economy.Similar strategies have been tried before, with little success. In Japan, such businesses, known as \u201czombie companies,\u201d are blamed for contributing to that country\u2019s two decades of economic stagnation.As China allows its own \u201czombies\u201d to stalk the economy, the situation is clouding the country\u2019s outlook, making it difficult to predict where growth is headed. If the leadership doesn\u2019t address the underlying problem, the economic weakness could be prolonged.\u201cGlobal investors have now come to realize that China\u2019s travails are beginning to affect everyone,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong.Far from the sparkle of Shanghai or the export zones of Shenzhen, Changzhi is a modest city of three million people who live in low-rise apartment complexes and work in boxy factory compounds. The local economy depends on steel manufacturing and other heavy industries that girded the country\u2019s decades-long era of high growth. As the property market grew and the government plowed money into roads and other infrastructure, cement factories sprouted on the city\u2019s outskirts to capitalize on the bonanza, creating hundreds of well-paying jobs. In recent years, the busy local shops and crammed fast-food restaurants along Changzhi\u2019s narrow downtown streets bustled with new prosperity.But the country\u2019s economy is slowing down, threatening that wealth. Gross domestic product expanded 7 percent in the second quarter of 2015. While that would be a stellar performance by the standards of most countries, it is the slowest pace for China in a quarter-century.Some industries are plummeting, wreaking havoc in less economically diverse cities and towns. Empty apartments built during the boom are now weighing down the property sector. Businessmen in Changzhi complain that construction projects supported by the local government have also been scaled back.As a result, Changzhi\u2019s cement plants are saddled by excess capacity. Companies in the province can produce three times as much cement as what was actually needed in 2014, according to the Shanxi Provincial Association of Building Material Industries. Two-thirds of them lost money in that year.Such conditions have turned once promising companies into zombies. While trucks are still parked outside the sprawling industrial compound of Changzhi\u2019s Huatai Cement Clinker Company, there are far fewer than just a couple of years ago, and they have less to haul. The money-losing company has produced a mere 200,000 metric tons of cement this year, even though it is able to make one million.As a state-owned enterprise, Huatai has been kept running with the help of special assistance. Huatai gets coal on credit and access to cheap loans from its parent company, which is owned by the provincial government. That has allowed management to keep all its 300 workers on the payroll \u2014 the company\u2019s top priority. \u201cOur employees need to eat, they need to live,\u201d said one manager, who declined to give his name.Such measures may help sustain employment, but they also delay the much needed overhaul of Chinese industry. A study of China\u2019s labor market by the International Monetary Fund released in July noted that state-owned enterprises tended to keep workers that they did not need. From an economic perspective, it would be better for such businesses to downsize or even close, releasing their trained staff to work at companies or in sectors with stronger prospects. That would shift resources away from less productive parts of the economy, helping get growth back on track.Without such a shift, the economy could suffer in the future. Raphael Lam, deputy resident representative at the I.M.F. in Beijing, says Chinese policy makers should move more forcefully to enact pro-market reforms and allow state-owned enterprises to restructure. If not, he says, \u201cOver the long term, there would be an increasing likelihood of a sharper slowdown.\u201dThe situation is also complicating matters for workers not lucky enough to keep their jobs. Though unemployment has remained low nationally, workers in troubled Changzhi complain that good jobs are hard to find.At the Changzhi Cement Group, where the only sound is a barking dog, a former company electrician, Zhao Liwei, 43, watches TV inside a decrepit room for janitors at the compound\u2019s entrance. Two years ago, as production at the state-owned plant ground to a halt, her paychecks stopped coming. Most employees were left to fend for themselves.Since the factory was never formally shuttered, they have not received severance payments or other compensation, Ms. Zhao said. Though a private company took on a handful of employees to produce cement in a portion of the plant\u2019s facilities in August, the work is only temporary.Ms. Zhao has not worked at all. The only jobs in the area, she says, are sweeping floors and waiting tables, for as little as 500 renminbi, or $78, a month. She earned twice that working at the factory. \u201cWe were promised an iron rice bowl\u201d \u2014 the Chinese term for lifetime employment \u2014 she said. But now \u201cit is like we\u2019ve been left on an eternal, unpaid vacation.\u201dSome of these idled workers have faced biting hardship. Sitting outside a nearby deteriorating residential complex, Du Jianping, 45, says that she has to rely on handouts from her parents to put food on the table for her 12-year-old daughter. She and her husband lost their jobs at the Changzhi Cement Group, and ever since, Ms. Du has been earning a pittance selling women\u2019s clothes and children\u2019s toys at a stall outside a train station.She feels trapped, fearing she would be unable to get better work elsewhere. \u201cWe are too old to find jobs in the cities,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope the government could help lift up the cement industry so that it can recover.\u201dBeijing is sensitive to such pleas. Fearing that joblessness could lead to social instability, the government has made maintaining employment a primary goal of its economic policy. Premier Li Keqiang said during a news conference last year that the lowest growth rate acceptable to the regime \u201cneeds to ensure fairly full employment and realize reasonable increase of people\u2019s income.\u201dThe government is also planning to use state banks to finance another round of infrastructure spending aimed at aiding beleaguered industries like cement. Managers in Changzhi argue that the authorities should be doing even more to help, by setting a minimum price for cement or supporting local construction projects.Still, such steps may do little more than keep zombie companies alive \u2014 to the detriment of the overall economy. By pumping up growth with fresh credit and stimulus, the government might temporarily revive some factories, but also exacerbate the economy\u2019s problems of excess capacity and high debt.The consulting firm IHS Global Insight estimates that debt relative to China\u2019s output will reach 254 percent in 2015, nearly double the level of 2008. Such debt levels can pose substantial risks to an economy if borrowers are unable to repay them and a wave of defaults follows. \u201cThe size of debt only accumulates,\u201d said Grace Wu, a senior director at the rating agency Fitch in Hong Kong. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t help with the underlying economy. It doesn\u2019t help create jobs.\u201dOver the long term, Chinese policy makers are trying to decrease the economy\u2019s dependence on excessive investment for growth and allow household consumption to play a bigger role. That means the factories in many heavy industries, like cement, may never run again at full tilt.Wang Xiaohu has not completely given up hope. Over the years, Mr. Wang, a 40-year-old businessman, put 20 million renminbi, or $3.1 million, into Changzhi Ruili Building Materials Ltd., which can produce 300,000 metric tons of cement annually. But now the factory site is watched over by a lone, elderly security guard in an ill-fitting uniform. Mr. Wang was forced to idle the plant about 18 months ago, laying off nearly all of his 100 employees.Mr. Wang, though, has refused to liquidate the factory. Instead, he maintains the machinery, waiting for the day when the economy revives and he can produce cement once again \u2014 a day that even he acknowledges may never come. \u201cMany of the small and medium cement plants here are like this,\u201d Mr. Wang says. \u201cThe chances are slim that they will ever reopen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Predicts 3,000 Migrants a Day Will Pass Through Balkans", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe German police said they believed the fire in Nauen, about 25 miles west of Berlin, had been deliberately set, the latest of more than 200 attacks directed against migrants in the country this year. It was spotted just after 2 a.m. and swiftly destroyed the sports hall, which had been prepared to serve as temporary housing for about 100 migrants, the authorities said. No one was injured in the fire.Officials throughout the country have scrambled to find or adapt decent places to shelter new arrivals in Germany, where the struggle to stop anti-immigrant violence has vied for headlines with a mass migration not seen in Europe since the wars that ripped apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s.\u201cWe do not see any end to the influx of people in coming months,\u201d Melissa Fleming, chief spokeswoman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said on Tuesday in Geneva. She cited continued violence in Syria and Iraq and deteriorating conditions for refugees in overcrowded camps and homes in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.Ms. Fleming said that Germany and Sweden had taken in 43 percent of the asylum seekers in the 28-nation European Union, and she suggested that the burden should be divided more evenly.\u201cWe honestly believe if correct measures are taken, this is something that Europe can handle,\u201d Ms. Fleming said, according to Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger number than last year, yes. But it\u2019s not going to turn Europe upside down.\u201dOn Tuesday, a day after she joined France in urging more European action, Ms. Merkel reiterated that Germany and a handful of other countries needed help in tackling the problem.\u201cThree or four out of 28 cannot bear the whole burden,\u201d the chancellor told a crowd in Duisburg, a city in the German state with the most refugees, North Rhine-Westphalia.Germany, Sweden, Austria and France have led the way in sheltering new arrivals, according to European officials.The vice chancellor of Germany, Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats and minister for the country\u2019s booming economy, visited Heidenau on Monday, diverting from a planned tour of \u201cSilicon Saxony,\u201d the technology start-up scene around Dresden.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.German news media have reported that hundreds of people turned out for a demonstration Friday evening organized by the far right National Democratic Party in Heidenau, which like Nauen has a population of about 16,000. Some of those demonstrators then battled the police.On Saturday evening, anti-immigrant protesters and a group welcoming the new arrivals were both on the streets of Heidenau as police officers escorted four busloads of migrants to the converted building where they are now housed. Bottles and stones were thrown at the buses and at the police.\u201cIt is repugnant how right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis are trying to spread their dumb message of hate around a facility for refugees,\u201d Ms. Merkel said on Monday. She particularly condemned those who just watched, some of whom even took children along.German leaders have so far failed to halt the attacks on arriving foreigners.After returning from vacation and trying to settle the financial crisis over Greece, Ms. Merkel predicted that the new wave of migration would command the attention of European leaders for even longer than the past months of negotiations over a new bailout for the government in Athens.Since then, barely a day has passed without fresh accounts of migrants moving north, or of facilities for them coming under attack. A refugee shelter burned Sunday night in the western German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.So far, no injuries have been reported in the attacks, which totaled 202 in the first six months of this year, compared to 198 in all of 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let Older Americans Keep Working", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBOSTON \u2014 EVERY day, 10,000 baby boomers \u2014 Americans born from 1946 to 1964 \u2014 leave the work force. Most of them have not saved enough for retirement; at least one-fifth have basically no retirement savings. Our economy has a shortage of skilled workers.Keeping older Americans on the job therefore benefits everyone: It is crucial to maintaining economic growth, and it will help the boomers to preserve and increase their savings if longevity continues to rise.Sadly, Social Security, which was enacted 80 years ago this week, encourages older workers to leave the work force. There are remarkably strong disincentives to work for people who take their benefits early, between 62 and full retirement age (66, rising to 67 by 2027).Wait a minute, you might be thinking: Aren\u2019t my benefits permanently lower if I start collecting Social Security before full retirement age? And don\u2019t I get the maximum level of benefit if I wait until I\u2019m 70 to collect?There are many reasons for this. Some workers are laid off, or encouraged to retire via incentive programs from their employers. Others find their productivity is lagging. Many face age discrimination.Moreover our fear of death leads us to take benefits early so we don\u2019t lose them. But that logic, while understandable, is mistaken. The real danger is not kicking ourselves in the grave. It\u2019s living to 100 without a decent income. American women who have made it to age 60 will live, on average, until 86; men, on average, until 83. But we can\u2019t count on dying on time.We aren\u2019t taught to think of Social Security benefits as insurance against a catastrophic event \u2014 namely, living to 100 or, gasp, beyond.Starting at age 62, through age 65, annual earnings above $15,720 are taxed at a whopping rate of 50 percent, for those who take their benefits early. (A smaller monster tax, 33 cents on the dollar, applies to wages over a higher threshold \u2014 currently $41,880 \u2014 earned between Jan. 1 and your birthday in the year you turn 66.)Now, here\u2019s the really odd part. The earnings penalty is actually a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing. Under an arcane provision known as the adjustment of the reduction factor \u2014 ARF, for short \u2014 if you earn too much between 62 and 66, the loss of benefits will be made up to you, at 66, in the form of a permanent benefit increase.Come again? You get taxed and then you get untaxed?Precisely.Consequently, millions of older Americans believe they face a huge tax on working, which, if they understood the ARF, they\u2019d ignore.This would significantly improve work incentives for early Social Security beneficiaries. And here\u2019s the best part: It shouldn\u2019t cost Uncle Sam a dime. A tax that\u2019s fully handed back, after all, doesn\u2019t produce any net revenue.So much for helping young retirees stay active. What about even older folks \u2014 for example, those 70 or older? Fewer than 12 percent of them are still on the job.Giving them a lower tax rate might turn this statistic around. You don\u2019t need to be a rabid supply-sider (we certainly aren\u2019t) to recognize that lowering payroll taxes on Americans over 70 could induce at least some additional work force participation (and perhaps even pay for itself, through higher income tax revenue).Specifically, we\u2019d give those over 70 a pass on paying Social Security\u2019s 12.4 percent payroll tax \u2014 the 6.2 percent paid by employees and the 6.2 percent paid by their employers. The former would encourage older workers to keep working; the latter would help overcome the bias of some employers against keeping on employees beyond age 70. But we\u2019d also change Social Security\u2019s benefit formula to keep anyone over 70 from getting a higher benefit based on post-70 earnings.Telling young retirees they face a monster tax on working and then burying the fact that it will be repaid is ludicrous. It\u2019s inducing baby boomers to call it quits or work part time.Congress can and must end this insanity. It should also nudge those over 70, few of whom now work, to get back on the job. Both the boomers and Uncle Sam will be richer for it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal Between North and South Korea Defies Their Mutual Disdain", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach of them had domestic political reasons to want to show toughness and resolve, analysts said, so the confrontation swiftly escalated to the brink of armed conflict. Then, each leader had reasons to want to appear statesmanlike and in command of events, so an agreement was struck.\u201cBoth leaders will interpret the deal in their own different way and claim victory,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, an analyst at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. \u201cPark Geun-hye says her patient, principled approach on the North has finally worked. Kim Jong-un will say his daring initiative forced the South to a bargain.\u201dSome observers said the agreement opened up at least the possibility that the relationship could now improve to some degree.South and North Korea, of course, have never gotten along smoothly \u2014 technically, they have been at war since 1950, with combat halted only by a truce, not a peace treaty. But their relations have been especially testy under their current leaders.But an early casualty of the brinkmanship was the so-called trustpolitik policy she had promised \u2014 building trust with North Korea to guide it toward more openness, denuclearization and, eventually, reunification. The agreement on Tuesday \u201callows her to finally put meat on the bones\u201d of that strategy, Mr. Delury said.Mr. Kim has yet to deliver on his bold promise to improve North Korea\u2019s economy, a task seriously hindered by sanctions and the drying up of aid and trade that once flowed from the South. His government remains rooted in the cult of personality that surrounds his family, as evidenced by its jitters over the South\u2019s propaganda broadcasts.Analysts said the deal showed that despite having purged many of his father\u2019s time-tested advisers, Mr. Kim was able to oversee a complicated negotiation with the South. The talks lasted for days in part because the North\u2019s negotiators \u2014 senior figures in the government \u2014 had to leave the bargaining table frequently to consult with Pyongyang, South Korean officials said.\u201cIf you look at how this talk came about and how it led to a deal, you get a clear sense that Kim Jong-un has been calculating it carefully,\u201d Mr. Yang said.The expression of \u201cregret\u201d over the land mine episode could probably be explained to the North Korean public as a gesture of sympathy rather than an acceptance of responsibility, analysts said. The North\u2019s leaders have framed such concessions that way in the past, the analysts said.\u201cI even doubt that North Korea really cared that much about the South Korean loudspeakers, whose impact is never proven,\u201d said Kim Dong-yup, also of the University of North Korean Studies. \u201cIts outcries about them may very likely have been a ploy to provoke and drag the South into talks.\u201dThe \u201cregret\u201d compromise could also work for Ms. Park, by deflecting criticism that her rigid stance had made the North more provocative, analysts said. And the deal could help dispel her \u201cimage as a paper-pushing type of leader,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.On Tuesday, Ms. Park said the deal had been possible because of her government\u2019s \u201cconsistent principle of dealing sternly with the North\u2019s provocations while keeping the door open for dialogue.\u201dAnalysts saw wiggle room for the South in its promise to leave the loudspeakers turned off unless an \u201cabnormal case\u201d develops. South Korean officials said that caveat would discourage further provocations from the North, but the two sides are likely to have very different definitions of abnormal.Their willingness to build trust and cooperation will be tested in the talks that are to be arranged in the next few weeks. In past moments of brinkmanship, after reaching what seemed to be a breakthrough, the two sides have generally reverted to haggling and stonewalling.\u201cThe agreement is like a box with the sign \u2018Fragile\u2019 stamped on it,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cUnless handled carefully, it could break at any time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shake Shack Reports Higher Quarterly Sales and Profits", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company said that profits rose 2.3 percent, to $1.1 million, in the quarter that ended July 1, while same-store sales, or what it calls \u201csame-shack sales,\u201d grew 12.9 percent compared with 4.5 percent in the same quarter last year. Revenues over all, which include licensing payments, increased 74.7 percent to $48.5 million.Randy Garutti, chief executive of Shake Shack, said the company benefited from increases in customer traffic and price increases, as well as a return to crinkle-cut French fries, which, a spokesman said, arrive \u201cready to cook\u201d making them less labor-intensive than the hand-cut fries they replaced. There are more than 70 Shake Shacks in the United States and overseas.\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see how we\u2019ve capitalized on the wind at our backs,\u201d Mr. Garutti said.The company raised its outlook for the year, predicting that same-store sales would grow in the mid- to high single digits. It also announced it would open more stores than planned.Shake Shack\u2019s stock price has risen more than 200 percent since its initial public offering in January, when its shares went on sale for $21 apiece. It closed on Monday at $70.64 and was up 7 percent in after-hours trading.While most investment analysts do not recommend buying the shares at such prices, Shake Shack\u2019s stock has become a favorite to sell short, meaning that an investor places a bet that the price will fall.In Shake Shack\u2019s case, however, individuals known for selling short are not making that bet. Rather, the traders say, computers that routinely scour the stock market for overvalued stocks to offset undervalued stocks are responsible for the run-up in price.Many of the questions in a conference call with investment analysts were about how increasing labor costs might affect business. Shake Shack has long paid its employees above minimum wage, but the improving economy as well as efforts by states and localities to mandate higher pay are affecting costs in the restaurant business at large.Mr. Garutti said that Shake Shack had given its employees a good raise about a year and a half ago and that the move to crinkle-cut fries had reduced its labor costs. Still, he said, he did not think pressure to raise wages would end anytime soon.The company raised prices 3 percent in September, and then again in January. It said it has no plans to increase them further during the rest of fiscal year, despite continued cost increases for beef and for eggs, which it uses in custards and some sauces.In addition to crinkle-cut fries, Mr. Garutti said limited-time menu promotions had helped increase sales. Sales of the ShackMeister, a cheeseburger topped with ShackSauce and crispy shallots that won the 2014 Food Network South Beach Wine and Food Festival Burger Bash, ended last month.But it was replaced by another limited-time offering, the Roadside, a cheeseburger topped with a mound of caramelized onions and bacon steeped in beer.The company is also testing a chicken sandwich in three of its stores in the New York area.Analysts on the conference call repeatedly asked about plans to roll the chicken product out across more stores, but Mr. Garutti declined to say what plans the company has for it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The More China\u2019s Currency Falls, the More It Looks Like a \u2018Currency War\u2019", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThere were two stories for why China allowed the value of its currency to fall beginning on Tuesday, one of which makes the government look shortsighted and the other farsighted: It is looking to boost its export sector to combat a weakening economy or it is trying to liberalize its financial system as it ascends the global financial stage.After Wednesday\u2019s events, the shortsighted, export-boost story is looking like the more powerful explanation of what China is up to.The renminbi fell 1.6 percent against the dollar Wednesday after a 1.8 percent drop Tuesday. That amounts to an exceptionally steep two-day move in the exchange rate between the world\u2019s largest economies.In some of the halls of power in Washington, the reaction was more one of cautious optimism. The International Monetary Fund and United States Treasury adopted a wait-and-see view of the move. They have both been pushing China to liberalize its exchange rate policy so that it adapts more to market forces, and they were, it seemed, getting what they wanted.The fact that the sharp drop continued for a second day makes more plausible the idea that China is primarily motivated by a desire to advantage its exporters against competitors across Asia and beyond.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.Contrast that with the moves the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank took at various points in the last few years to loosen monetary policy and spur higher domestic inflation and growth. They have been controversial, and no doubt resulted in devaluations of their respective currencies, but the actions were carefully telegraphed, thoughtfully explained and explicitly aimed at domestic conditions rather than manipulating exchange rates.The Chinese central bank\u2019s move, by contrast, came as a complete surprise. It was accompanied by only vague official communication and appears to be narrowly targeted at the exchange rate. And because the Chinese central bank is not independent from its government, it\u2019s impossible to know whether politicians or technocrats are really pulling the strings on the policy.The book is not written on China\u2019s new currency policies; after all, they\u2019re only two days old. But if the sell-off continues the way it did Wednesday, the blowback to China\u2019s actions and talk of \u201ccurrency wars\u201d will only get louder, and the voices of praise for its move toward liberalization softer.Taking place against a backdrop of sluggish global growth, a United States presidential campaign season that is getting underway and a Chinese economy that just might be in real trouble, that will make for an interesting autumn in international finance.Advertisement"}

With the economy rebounding, Republican presidential candidates have increasingly turned their attention to foreign policy and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s four years as secretary of state, laying the blame for the persistent violence now engulfing Iraq and Syria at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s feet.For Mr. Bush, his latest speech, at the hilltop shrine to Mr. Reagan that has become a regular stop for Republican presidential candidates, appeared to mark a new, more aggressive chapter in his campaign.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.He faced a more serious problem this year after he stumbled in seeking to explain his position on whether the Iraq invasion led by his brother was justified. In his speech, Mr. Bush appeared to acknowledge criticism of the invasion, recounting a troubled history of Iraq policy \u201cthat includes failures of intelligence and military setbacks\u201d \u2014 even as he criticized Mrs. Clinton. \u201cIt was a case of blind haste to get out and to call the tragic consequences somebody else\u2019s problem,\u201d he said. \u201cRushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s aides noted that the Obama administration had inherited the war from President Bush and that it had followed the timetable he signed in withdrawing troops from the region. Mrs. Clinton opposed the surge but advocated within the administration for leaving a residual force in Iraq to maintain order there.\u201cAmerican boots on the ground cannot fix Iraq,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy adviser. \u201cOnly Iraqis can fix Iraq, with our support but not with our combat boots on the ground.\u201dMr. Bush was not alone among the Republican presidential candidates in criticizing the administration\u2019s policies in that region of the world. Both Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin have criticized the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. Mr. Walker has said he would not rule out sending troops to restore order. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio has said the United States should form a coalition with European allies to knock out the Islamic State, and also said he would not rule out sending in troops. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been one of the Obama administration\u2019s most persistent critics.But in his speech, Mr. Bush did less to suggest what he might do as president than to describe the origins of the Islamic State\u2019s emergence \u2014 what many of Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers agree was a premature withdrawal from Iraq, an insufficient support of the moderate opposition in Syria three years ago, and an incremental application of American power against Islamic State strongholds.\u201cRadical Islam is a threat we are entirely capable of overcoming,\u201d Mr. Bush said, \u201cAnd I will be unyielding in that cause should I be elected president of the United States.\u201dHe did not argue for the reintroduction of combat troops. Indeed, Mr. Bush appeared to be walking a line between calling for a more aggressive response in Iraq without calling for the kind of American military intervention that might alarm some voters by recalling the policies of his brother, as well as his father.\u201cWe do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do need to convey that we are serious, that we are determined to help local forces take back their country.\u201dWith his call for support of Sunni allies, he echoes a main theme of the Obama approach. And his support for increasing the Pentagon budget reflects to a considerable extent the policy of the Obama administration. But that has faced opposition from some Republicans in Congress who have sought to freeze military spending as part of efforts to cut back the size of governmentIn his attempt to find a middle place between Mr. Obama\u2019s actions in Iraq and Syria and the full commitment of troops, Mr. Bush argued for the creation of a \u201cno-fly zone\u201d on the Syrian border that would ultimately be expanded to \u201cprevent more crimes by the regime.\u201d But he did not call for the immediate ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.He also called for the rejection of the Iran nuclear deal, calling it \u201cunwise to the extreme, with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme.\u201d But he said nothing about what he would replace it with.Reporting was contributed by Michael R.

{"Headline": "Show Some Spine, Federal Reserve", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE financial markets and the Federal Reserve Board have been playing out a tragicomedy in three acts. Here\u2019s how it works: Initially, a flurry of news stories appear about how, a few months hence, the Fed intends to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in years. Second, the predictable market swoon, as Wall Street traders ponder the fact that the morphine drip of free money that they have been enjoying since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis might be pulled out of their arms. Finally, the Fed backs away from its much-overdue policy change, causing traders to rejoice and the artificially stimulated bull market in both stocks and bonds to continue. The curtain comes down, and the audience roars its approval.A similar drama occurred in the spring of 2013, during what has been called the Taper Tantrum. And now it\u2019s happening again.Some background: At the end of 2008, the Fed dropped its benchmark short-term interest rate to around zero. It also began a program with the Orwellian name of quantitative easing \u2014 buying huge sums of bonds to suppress long-term interest rates and stimulate lending and spending. Thanks to Q.E., the cost of borrowing money was pushed to next to nothing. This was a bonanza for those who make money from money \u2014 hedge-fund managers, private-equity moguls, banks \u2014 and a disaster for savers, retirees and anyone on a fixed income. (Have you checked the interest your bank pays you on your savings account? Mine: .06 percent per year.)The Taper Tantrum began in May 2013, when Ben S. Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, announced in congressional testimony that later in the year the Fed would most likely start slowing \u2014 hence, \u201ctapering\u201d \u2014 its monthly bond buying. On June 19, in a news conference, Mr. Bernanke reaffirmed that decision: The Fed, he said, \u201ccurrently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year.\u201d Before the afternoon was out, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 200 points, or 1.4 percent, and the bond market tanked as the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 2.36 percent, its highest level since March 2012. The Fed quickly backed down and the rallies in the stock and bond markets resumed.The third round of quantitative easing ended last fall. And all of this year, the markets have been chattering about an expected announcement that the Fed will finally \u2014 after nine years \u2014 raise short-term interest rates in September, by a modest 0.25 percentage points.Yes, it would be a little painful to start having to pay a little more for short-term borrowing and, yes, the net worth of Wall Street billionaires might increase at a slightly lower rate, but it looks as if the moment is at hand to end the morphine drip.The case for raising rates is straightforward: Like any commodity, the price of borrowing money \u2014 interest rates \u2014 should be determined by supply and demand, not by manipulation by a market behemoth. Essentially, the clever Q.E. program caused a widespread mispricing of risk, deluding investors into underestimating the risk of various financial assets they were buying.The only way to return the assessment of risk to something resembling normalcy is to stop the manipulation. That requires nothing less than serious intestinal fortitude from the Fed and a willingness to raise interest rates in the face of determined opposition from Wall Street.Sadly, the Fed, under Mr. Bernanke\u2019s successor, Janet L. Yellen, seems to be caving. The worsening economic news from China, combined with uncertainty about the Fed\u2019s plans, contributed to the recent sharp declines in stock markets around the world.All too predictably, the powerful advocates of the Fed\u2019s zero-interest-rate policy have raced to its defense. Under the headline \u201cThe Fed looks set to make a dangerous mistake,\u201d Lawrence H. Summers, the former Harvard president and Treasury secretary, wrote in The Financial Times, \u201cAt this moment of fragility, raising rates risks tipping some part of the financial system into crisis, with unpredictable and dangerous results.\u201d He then tweeted, \u201cIt is far from clear that the next Fed move will be a tightening\u201d (a raising of rates).Around then came a leaked note to clients from Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds, agreeing with Mr. Summers\u2019s assessment. He warned that the Fed might be so wedded to its \u201chighly advertised tightening path that it will be difficult for them to change to a significantly easier path if that should be required.\u201dThis elite pas de deux reached a crescendo on Wednesday when William C. Dudley, the president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that, upon reflection, September was not the time for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates. The argument for doing so, he said, seemed \u201cless compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u201d noting that \u201cinternational developments have increased the downside risk to U.S. economic growth somewhat.\u201d Once the news of Mr. Dudley\u2019s words got out, the markets rocketed upward. Crisis averted?Thursday was also the first day of the annual central-banker retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The gathering\u2019s theme is the boring-sounding \u201cInflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,\u201d but it\u2019s the perfect setting for these supposedly brilliant economists to figure a way out of this perennial Catch-22 once and for all. The right answer is self-evident: End the easy-money addiction, raise rates in September and begin the healing.William D. Cohan is the author of three books on Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Hope to Ride Swell of SoulCycle Fever in Coming I.P.O.", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly on a summer morning in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, dozens of mostly young, svelte women file into a quiet, candlelit studio where they mount gleaming stationary bikes. Soft clicks can be heard as they fasten their shoes to the pedals.Suddenly, a thumping beat blares through speakers as the room is illuminated in a soft lavender glow. The 72-strong pack begins to pedal in sync. The leader cajoles the cycling pride: \u201cForget about the job. Forget about the kids. These 45 minutes...are...all...about you!\u201dThis is SoulCycle. A sort of spinning, self-help therapy session with dim lighting and a primal dance beat. In recent years, SoulCycle has developed a cultlike following among celebrities like Victoria\u2019s Secret models and hedge fund wives alike. But nowadays, its biggest fans might be the Wall Street financiers hoping to ride the SoulCycle craze to big bucks with an initial public offering in the coming weeks.SoulCycle started with a single studio in 2006 on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. But its rapid expansion in recent years \u2014 it now operates 41 locations nationwide \u2014 has been fueled by wealthy investors, including the billionaire real estate mogul Stephen M. Ross, whose company, Related, is building the Hudson Yards development in Manhattan and owns the health club chain Equinox, which acquired a majority stake in SoulCycle in 2011.SoulCycle has set off something of a boomlet in so-called fitness boutiques, whose backers also happen to be some of their best customers.\u201cA lot of private investors are also our consumers,\u201d Mr. Kinnaly said. \u201cWe have a lot of financial industry folks, Wall Street or hedge fund executives, who are looking for a great workout in a short amount of time.\u201dPeloton Cycle, which sells $2,000 sleek stationary bikes for home use, counts the hedge fund Tiger Global Management, which has risen to prominence by backing start-ups, among its investors. (Peloton customers spend another $39 a month to have unlimited live classes streamed directly to their home bikes.)In July, another private equity firm took a stake in Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, an intense cardio and strength-training program that claims it can burn 1,000 calories in one hour as its techniques \u201cshock\u201d the body. If the workout doesn\u2019t shock the body, the $34-per-session price just might.If the 1980s exercise gurus Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons were focused on bringing fitness to the masses, these high-end gyms and boutique fitness centers are mostly after the affluent with money to burn. At $34 a session, three SoulCycle workouts a week will cost more than $5,000 a year. If one opts for the SuperSoul package, which lets customers reserve their favorite classes or instructors, each session costs a hefty $70.The factors driving the high-end fitness craze are similar to those that drive luxury car sales and luxury apartment listings: The wealthy are less sensitive to the economy\u2019s ups and downs.Less sensitive, at least, than most members of traditional big-box gyms, which are considered more cyclical businesses. In a downturn, financially struggling consumers often drop their gym memberships \u2014 which is what happened during the latest recession, sending Bally Total Fitness, Crunch Fitness and even the more upscale David Barton Gym chain into bankruptcy.\u201cWe are right now targeting affluent users,\u201d said John Foley, a former president of e-commerce at Barnes & Noble who founded Peloton Cycle in 2012. \u201cIf we sold only to the top 5 percent, we would have a $5 to $10 billion business.\u201dMr. Foley argues that cycling mania is in its early stages and won\u2019t go the way of other fitness crazes like Jazzercise, step aerobics or Tae Bo.\u201cAll over the country, not just affluent New Yorkers, want to burn 700 calories in a workout and have a glow about themselves all day,\u201d Mr. Foley said. \u201cSoulCycle and its brand have tapped into the notion of exercise as food for your mind as well as your body. What\u2019s happening in those cycling classes involves spirituality, psychotherapy and some self-help.\u201dIndeed, SoulCycle ambitions stretch beyond its 45-minute classes. Its prospectus states that it hopes to increase its number of locations, from the little more than three dozen studios it currently has to 250 in the United States alone. It also hopes to expand digitally to an \u201cat-home\u201d audience and to extend its brand by expanding its trendy workout apparel line. Perhaps that\u2019s why one of its new board members is Millard S. Drexler, the chief executive of the J. Crew Group.Because SoulCycle is in a quiet period ahead of its I.P.O., no one was available to speak for this article.According to the I.P.O. prospectus, SoulCycle started in 2006 when Ms. Rice and Ms. Cutler met over lunch; soon after, they opened their first studio on the Upper West Side.But the company\u2019s \u201cauthentic and powerful origin story,\u201d as its prospectus says, is a bit more complicated. The website makes no mention of SoulCycle\u2019s third founder, Ruth Zukerman, the spin instructor who introduced Ms. Rice and Ms. Cutler. After a falling out, Ms. Zukerman, who declined to comment, left to start Flywheel.SoulCycle\u2019s group of wealthy, savvy investors stand to benefit from the company\u2019s continued growth. Equinox is controlled by Related and the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, whose holdings include Shake Shack and J. Crew.Ms. Rice and Ms. Cutler have been given new titles \u2014 co-chief creative officers \u2014 with the chief executive title now being held by Melanie Whelan, a former Equinox executive.Despite a history of fizzling exercise fads and increased crowding in the boutique fitness category, SoulCycle is betting that its spin-loving customers will continue to flock to its pricey classes.\u201cTraditionally, exercise was viewed as a chore, a box that needed to be checked,\u201d the prospectus says. \u201cWe believe that fitness should be joyful, inspiring and help people connect with their true and best selves.\u201dJane Bornemeier contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gary Rivlin\u2019s \u2018Katrina: After the Flood\u2019", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.New Orleanians have been hearing it for 10 years now: How\u2019s New Orleans doing? Is it back? Is the Lower Ninth Ward .\u2008.\u2008. O.K.? The questioner takes the tentative, commiserating tone one might use to inquire about a friend\u2019s infirm grandmother who, at last report, had been moved to hospice. The local, sighing, responds tersely: New Orleans is doing terrifically and terribly. It\u2019s back but different and currently undergoing a furious transformation. Much of the Lower Ninth Ward is not O.K. But each of these answers requires a book-length footnote. If you really want to know how New Orleans is doing, you have to ask different questions.Gary Rivlin asks many of them in \u00ad\u201cKatrina: After the Flood.\u201d New Orleans\u2019s evolution during the last decade has been just as instructive and astounding as the events surrounding the storm itself, but only now, on its 10th anniversary, are the first major accounts of the recovery beginning to emerge. Most are likely to insist that \u201crecovery\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. What was lost won\u2019t be entirely recovered. What will ultimately take its place remains largely unknown. Rivlin\u2019s valuable book is among the first to relate, in clear and scrupulous detail, the decisions that have brought us this far, and to identify those who made them.His title is accurate but misleading. The story begins, like so many Katrina narratives, in late August 2005, \u201cwith a hurricane named Katrina bearing down on New Orleans.\u201d It ends nine years later, but the last seven are compressed into the book\u2019s final hundred pages. Rivlin spent much of the first year after Katrina living in New Orleans and Baton Rouge on assignment for The New York Times. While much of the press attention during that time focused on the faulty levees, squalid conditions in the refugee camps and apo\u00adcryphal rumors of anarchic violence, Rivlin found himself drawn to \u201cthe mess ahead.\u201d How would a city with one of the nation\u2019s highest rates of poverty and crime, riven by an ossified racial divide, recover from the most costly natural disaster in American history? Who would determine the city\u2019s future? Who would be made to suffer? Or, more precisely, how cruelly would the city\u2019s low-income black population be made to suffer?True to the genre, \u201cKatrina\u201d follows the star-crossed fortunes of a cross-section of residents: old-money millionaires, a middle-class black family in New Orleans East, white transplants turned political activists, and Lower Ninth Ward natives determined to rebuild their neighborhood despite deep opposition and deeper indifference. At the heart of the story are three local power brokers who granted Rivlin intimate access: the real estate mogul Joseph Canizaro, a personal friend of George W. Bush, who talks of \u201cplanning\u201d a city, as if this one had not already existed for nearly three centuries; Alden McDonald, president of Liberty Bank, one of the nation\u2019s largest African-American-owned financial institutions (\u201cLiberty\u2019s success and the future of the city\u2019s black neighborhoods were entwined\u201d); and the former mayor Ray Nagin, whose shellshocked incompetence is revived in exasperating detail. In these pages, Nagin is compared to Osama bin Laden, Richard Nixon and Willy Wonka.Those who lived it may not have the stomach to revisit the dysfunctional, tedious and often corrupt horse trading that dominated these early innings \u2014 the expert commissions and working groups and \u201csummits\u201d \u2014 but Rivlin vividly reanimates its surreal qualities. Weeks after the flood, newspaper boxes on street corners still taunt residents with the Aug. 28 issue of The Times-Picayune, bearing the headline \u201cKatrina Takes Aim.\u201d Workers entering an elementary school near a levee breach discover dead fish on the second floor. A man goes to mow the lawn of his disabled 79-year-old aunt and finds only lawn; her painstakingly restored home has been demolished and hauled away, the victim of a clerical error at City Hall.Rivlin is a sharp observer and a dogged reporter. He is unerringly compassionate toward his subjects \u2014 even Nagin, who recently began serving a 10-year sentence for corruption at a federal prison in Texas. But Rivlin\u2019s most valuable journalistic skill is his acute sensitivity to absurdity. He is particularly piqued by the absurdities of racial and economic injustice. He examines the specter of a \u201cKatrina cleansing\u201d \u2014 fears that the city\u2019s business elite were conspiring to repossess property and re-establish a white majority electorate. Lance Hill, a white political activist serving as a mole, tells Rivlin: \u201cIt was impossible not to pick up on this sentiment that this was our chance to take back control of the city. There was virtually a near consensus among whites that authorities should not do anything to make it easy for poor African-Americans to come back.\u201dRivlin compares the situation in the Lower Ninth Ward with that of Lakeview, an affluent white neighborhood that lies even farther below sea level. (This fact was only dimly grasped outside New Orleans, and even by Nagin, who mistakenly referred to the Lower Ninth as the city\u2019s \u201clowest-\u00adlaying area.\u201d) Two months after Katrina, even as power and utilities were reactivated in Lakeview, armed soldiers still blocked the bridges leading into the Lower Ninth. Racial injustice persisted long after the waters receded; two years later, \u00adminority-owned businesses had claimed a small fraction of federal aid, thanks to a decision by Congress and the administration to waive affirmative action rules in order \u201cto speed up the recovery.\u201d Discrimination even followed black evacuees to the cities where they resettled, particularly Baton Rouge, where officers were ordered to \u201cmake life unpleasant .\u2008.\u2008. so that they will relocate elsewhere.\u201dThe second variable was class. New Orleans East, predominantly black middle class, returned much sooner than the Lower Ninth and many other less famous but equally impoverished neighborhoods. Homeowners benefited from the multibillion Road Home program (not without its own bureaucratic horrors), but renters \u2014 a majority of the city\u2019s residents \u2014 were excluded.The big question of that tense early period concerned the scope of the rebuilding effort. Should residents with property in lower-lying neighborhoods be encouraged, or forced, to move to higher ground? Even before Katrina, when about 70,000 more people lived in New Orleans than today, the city had declined by about a third from its peak population. Should the city\u2019s footprint shrink accordingly?\u201cI don\u2019t want to see people rebuilding on quicksand,\u201d says Joseph Canizaro, chairman of the city\u2019s urban planning committee. But the \u201cquicksand\u201d neighborhoods housed 80 percent of the city\u2019s black population. The irony, Rivlin points out, was that white conservatives like Canizaro proposed that the government assume a paternalistic role, deciding where people should resettle, while much of the heavily Democratic population advocated a \u201cfree-market, almost libertarian approach\u201d: Residents should build wherever they want. Reducing the city\u2019s footprint might make sense \u201cfrom a planning standpoint,\u201d a member of the mayor\u2019s city planning commission says. \u201cBut from a human standpoint, it made no sense at all.\u201d Nagin conceded to public sentiment, as has his successor, Mitch Landrieu. \u201cTo shrink the city\u2019s footprint,\u201d Landrieu has said from the beginning, \u201cis to shrink its destiny.\u201dRivlin moves hastily through the major stories of the last five years: the decline in public housing stock; anxieties about gentrification and economic inequity; the cynical sabotaging of the public Charity Hospital to clear the way for an extensive new private hospital complex; the revelations of profound institutional rot in the police force and prison system, both of which have entered into federal consent decrees; the persistence of an alarming crime rate; and the continued deterioration of the coastal wetlands. The most expensive levee system in the world will be worthless unless the state funds its plan to rebuild the marsh. New Orleans, after all, is never just \u201cafter the flood\u201d; it is also always before the next flood.Even so the local economy is thriving, poverty rates are lower than before the storm, graduation rates are higher, and after a flirtation with bankruptcy the city has a budget surplus. New Orleans swarms with young people, many of whom are rising to positions of influence in public life. In his recent State of the City speech, Landrieu sounded triumphant: \u201cWe are not just rebuilding the city that we once were, but are creating the city that we always should have been.\u201d New Orleans has always been a place where utopian fantasies and dystopian realities mingle harmoniously. May New Orleans always remain so. Or at least may it always remain.KATRINAAfter the FloodBy Gary Rivlin462 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27.Nathaniel Rich, the author of the novel \u201cOdds Against Tomorrow,\u201d lives in New Orleans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Turns to Nevada as a General Election Litmus Test", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI love to be here because I\u2019m going all over the country talking about how we need to reshuffle the deck\u201d to favor working people, Mrs. Clinton told a crowd gathered in the gymnasium of the Dr. William U. Pearson Community Center. \u201cWhat better place to talk about it than here?\u201dDespite the outsize attention on Iowa and New Hampshire in this presidential race, Nevada, with its mix of rural and urban areas, a population that is more than 15 percent Hispanic, and lingering economic problems, is arguably the best early-state indicator of how a candidate would fare in a general election campaign.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here, particularly in Las Vegas, is very much what\u2019s happening in the country demographically, but on steroids,\u201d said David Damore, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re a state that has been white and rural and is now very diverse and will be majority minority soon.\u201dThe state carries only six electoral votes, but its demographics reflect the political realities in other Western potential battlegrounds, such as Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. \u201cWe want to win the caucus and lay the groundwork to win Nevada in November 2016,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a town hall event here on Tuesday, her third visit to the state since she declared her candidacy in April.Democrats here hardly hide their frustration that the state\u2019s Feb. 20 caucus, the third in the nominating contest \u2014 after Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 does not get the attention from candidates they think it deserves.The Clinton campaign has 22 full-time staff members in Nevada and had 70 volunteer fellows this summer, compared with 47 paid staff members in Iowa. The Nevada operation has contacted nearly 28,000 voters, held 1,136 one-on-one meetings and traveled the state to target Latinos, Native Americans, Asians and African-Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s a microcosm of the rest of the country,\u201d Ms. Ruiz said.By contrast, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main Democratic opponents, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, who also were in Nevada this week, have no staff here.For Mrs. Clinton, the issues she emphasizes here, mainly immigration and the economy \u2014 Nevada has an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, compared to the national average of 5.3 percent \u2014 could also help her against Republicans in a general election.\u201cLast time I checked, I think you still have the highest unemployment rate in the country,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in remarks that also included criminal justice reform, health care and gun control. \u201cI will do everything I can do to try to make sure we will continue to provide support that individuals and families deserve.\u201dThe most important bridge to Latinos here is through unions that have grown in strength and significance even as their political heft has diminished in much of the country, local political experts say. After her town hall meeting, Mrs. Clinton planned to take a tour of the Carpenters International Training Center and to speak at the state convention of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., where Mr. O\u2019Malley and Mr. Sanders are also speaking.The Culinary Workers Union, which has about 60,000 members in Nevada, more than any other union here, has not yet endorsed a candidate, but will be a critical force in the Democratic contest. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s local staff has already reached out to its leadership, her campaign said. Mr. Sanders, who has already met with the largely Latino union, will no doubt fight hard to win its support.\u201cThere\u2019s always a small contingent of very left-leaning Democrats in Nevada who certainly much prefer Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Michael Green, an associate professor of history at U.N.L.V.A Democratic victory here is far from certain. The 2014 midterm elections proved disastrous for Democrats in Nevada, giving hope to Republicans that the state could be up for grabs in 2016. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Marco Rubio, in particular, are looking to the Feb. 23 Republican caucus as a way to regain momentum should they lose in Iowa and New Hampshire.Regardless of party affiliation, \u201cNevada is going to be the initial indicator of where the rest of the country is,\u201d Ms. Marshall said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt Is Good", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut is the point simply that public debt isn\u2019t as bad as legend has it? Or can government debt actually be a good thing?Believe it or not, many economists argue that the economy needs a sufficient amount of public debt out there to function well. And how much is sufficient? Maybe more than we currently have. That is, there\u2019s a reasonable argument to be made that part of what ails the world economy right now is that governments aren\u2019t deep enough in debt.I know that may sound crazy. After all, we\u2019ve spent much of the past five or six years in a state of fiscal panic, with all the Very Serious People declaring that we must slash deficits and reduce debt now now now or we\u2019ll turn into Greece, Greece I tell you.Why?Now, in principle the private sector can also create safe assets, such as deposits in banks that are universally perceived as sound. In the years before the 2008 financial crisis Wall Street claimed to have invented whole new classes of safe assets by slicing and dicing cash flows from subprime mortgages and other sources.But all of that supposedly brilliant financial engineering turned out to be a con job: When the housing bubble burst, all that AAA-rated paper turned into sludge. So investors scurried back into the haven provided by the debt of the United States and a few other major economies. In the process they drove interest rates on that debt way down.And those low interest rates, Mr. Kocherlakota declares, are a problem. When interest rates on government debt are very low even when the economy is strong, there\u2019s not much room to cut them when the economy is weak, making it much harder to fight recessions. There may also be consequences for financial stability: Very low returns on safe assets may push investors into too much risk-taking \u2014 or for that matter encourage another round of destructive Wall Street hocus-pocus.What can be done? Simply raising interest rates, as some financial types keep demanding (with an eye on their own bottom lines), would undermine our still-fragile recovery. What we need are policies that would permit higher rates in good times without causing a slump. And one such policy, Mr. Kocherlakota argues, would be targeting a higher level of debt.In other words, the great debt panic that warped the U.S. political scene from 2010 to 2012, and still dominates economic discussion in Britain and the eurozone, was even more wrongheaded than those of us in the anti-austerity camp realized.Not only were governments that listened to the fiscal scolds kicking the economy when it was down, prolonging the slump; not only were they slashing public investment at the very moment bond investors were practically pleading with them to spend more; they may have been setting us up for future crises.And the ironic thing is that these foolish policies, and all the human suffering they created, were sold with appeals to prudence and fiscal responsibility.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alpha Natural Resources, a Onetime Coal Giant, Files for Bankruptcy Protection", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat deal turned out to be a disaster for the company when demand for both steelmaking and power-generating coal declined domestically and in several important international markets in recent years.\u201cThe change and challenges the U.S. coal industry has experienced over the last several years are greater than any in the past three decades,\u201d Kevin S. Crutchfield, Alpha\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement released by the company.\u201cThere is no doubt more uncertainty ahead, but also transformational opportunity in the coal sector for those who make proactive, strategic decisions,\u201d Mr. Crutchfield said.At the same time, China, which consumes 45 percent of the world\u2019s coal, is steeply reducing the burning of coal to combat urban air pollution. And the strength of the dollar is reducing the competitiveness of American coal producers.As a result, coal production has been plunging in the United States, falling 15 percent since 2008. Still, stockpiles are mounting at mines as coal-fired power plants shut down month after month.Only a decade ago, coal supplied roughly half of the source of power for the country\u2019s utilities; that percentage has dropped to about 40 percent. The Energy Department projects that coal will continue to lose market share over the next decade, although it will continue to be an important source of energy.\u201cWe are going to continue to see bankruptcies so the industry can get down to a size in terms of total capacity and output to have the financial wherewithal to be attractive assets at depressed prices and then operate profitably,\u201d said John Lichtenstein, an Accenture Strategy managing director who advises coal producers.For the last three years it has had to close much of its fleet of mines to reduce costs, shaving its payroll by roughly 4,000 workers, or more than a quarter of its work force.Alpha, which still operates 50 mines in several states, said it secured a financing package of $692 million arranged by Citigroup.It is at least the seventh coal company to go into bankruptcy over the last year. Most of the others have been small, although another major company, Walter Energy, filed for bankruptcy protection last month with a plan to give control of the company to senior creditors.Such a turn of events was hard to envision even five years ago, as Alpha and other coal companies went on a buying spree. Coal prices were high, global demand was galloping along with the surging Chinese economy, and earnings were peaking.Alpha acquired Foundation Coal to extend its operations to the western Powder River Basin, where coal can be cheaply mined off the surface, and the promise of exports to Asia was high. Then it made the Massey Energy purchase in 2011 after that company went into a tailspin following the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in West Virginia, in which 29 miners died in an explosion. The acquisition was based on an assumption that developing countries had an insatiable appetite for Appalachia\u2019s high-heat-producing coal for steel making.Wall Street analysts said the reorganization of the industry was inevitable and that the losers would be the equity holders and the banks, and owners of the debt acquired at face value. But much of that debt has already changed hands at pennies to the dollar, and the new holders of the debt will most likely acquire most of the new equity in the companies after they are reorganized.The other possible savior for the coal industry, according to some analysts, is China, although that could take some policy changes in Beijing.\u201cWe could see foreign capital coming into the industry within two years,\u201d Mr. Lichtenstein said, \u201cwhen things hit bottom and if the dollar weakens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nitrogen oxides are often used by scientists as an indicator of economic activity and of the effectiveness of pollution-control measures.From 2005 to 2010, the Middle East had some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing levels of polluting emissions, in step with economic development. According to the paper, however, in recent years many of the cities in the region showed a rapid decline in levels of nitrogen oxides, while levels continued to rise elsewhere in the world.That insight may not seem surprising, given war\u2019s dampening effects on economic activity. But the research employed a new tool for recognizing the effects.The space-based observations can be used as a \u201cthermometer\u201d of crises, Dr. Lelieveld said, and could even serve as a new way to measure the effectiveness of sanctions. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was ever before possible,\u201d he said, \u201cto observe something like that from space.\u201dDr. Lelieveld agreed. \u201cThis is not the \u2018silver lining of war,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an indicator of what\u2019s going on.\u201dAn article on Saturday about satellite measurements of air pollution around Middle Eastern cities that have been mired in war and civil unrest misidentified the journal in which a paper on the topic was published.

{"Headline": "Greece, Germany and the Euro", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRe \u201cGreece, the sacrificial lamb\u201d (Opinion, July 27): Joseph E. Stiglitz is certainly right to argue that in the euro crisis there is plenty of blame to go around. But then he goes on to focus on one side of the issue, namely Greece as the victim of a misbegotten politics of austerity. This is not wrong, but one also has to recognize that European taxpayers, German taxpayers in particular, are very worried that Greece will not, or cannot, get its own house in order. This is grounded in the fact that Greece did not do so after the second bailout and that there is no real assurance they will make the necessary reforms this time around. Given the staggering amounts of money Greece has gotten, coupled with the new money that it will most likely get, this is no small concern and needs to be underscored when it comes to assigning blame.  The writer is a visiting professor of politics at the Technical University of Darmstadt. Why doesn\u2019t someone simply tell the sad story of Greece like it is: Greedy lenders who were very smart and sophisticated nevertheless loaned money to entities they knew would not be able to repay the loans. Just like greedy subprime mortgage lenders in the United States. So why are the lenders to Greece surprised, and why are they trying to get blood from a stone? They should take their losses and not be so greedy the next time they lend money. Let\u2019s not cry for Germany and others who should have known better.How much further will the Greeks decline and how prepared are they to lose the final vestige of their dignity? Formerly the avant-garde of man, responsible for many of our most astonishing advances, the reputation and the economic power of the Greeks have gone the way of the Titanic. Their province now is finger-pointing and denial. They\u2019ve lived a life of ample leisure, counting on the multitude of foreign visitors gazing on the relics of their brilliant past \u2014 and borrowing the rest to satisfy their needs. While their debt was mounting higher than the Parthenon, they just ignored it until the land of Greece was threatened by collapse. And yet they blame it all on the very lifeline offered to them. One can only hope that over time the Greeks will recover some of that which they have lost and that this chapter of their history will mercifully fade in memory.How sad to see that the esteemed Joseph Stiglitz has bought into the \u201cGreek victim\u201d theatricals. Other countries managed to weather austerity measures and pull themselves out of a financial spiral without maligning their creditors, yet Greece continued down the path of ruin with brash determination. The Greeks obviously thought that they could tap bailout money forever and have only themselves to blame for the harsh conditions now being imposed upon them. Perhaps if the Greek government had accepted the previous offer instead of calling a referendum the pill might be less bitter to swallow. But Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras seems to be a man who likes playing high-stakes poker and is a poor loser. My sympathy lies with the European Union countries that have shelled out billions of their taxpayers money in good faith and are now branded as persecutors and oppressors.Re \u201cThe German Question redux\u201d (July 14) by Roger Cohen: The Germany of today is not at all comparable to the Germany before or during each of the two world wars. Yes, it is in a powerful economic position, but it is still following rules that every member of the European Union agreed upon. It is not Germany that is oppressing Europe; it is the system that is showing its weaknesses. Having a currency union without political union is problematic. The world has known that for years; it just became real now. Blaming Germany for wanting its money back makes no sense. It only shifts the focus from the actual problem to a secondary theater that might be emotionally more appealing but that distracts from what is truly happening. The actual problem is how to deal with the consequences of the current European system, not how to deal with the Germans. Re \u201cOverregulating life in Greece\u201d (Opinion, July 16): Steven Rattner contends that Greece needs to reform its economy, citing that it unfairly restricts \u201ca flotilla of fields including taxi and truck drivers, engineers, notaries, actuaries and bailiffs.\u201d Europe and the United States also restrict these and many other fields by requiring training, security clearances, purchases of medallions and so forth. This is not particular to Greece. And when Mr. Rattner complains that in Greece \u201cmost shops are required to close on Sundays,\u201d he ignores the fact that Germany operates much the same way; in many German states it is illegal to open on Sundays. As for the complaint that \u201cother rules dictate where new pharmacies may open, as well as their operating hours,\u201d what neighborhood commercial district in the United States doesn\u2019t have such regulations?Re \u201cEurope\u2019s impossible dream\u201d (July 21): Paul Krugman is off the mark when judging the euro\u2019s role and its long-term effects on the future of Europe\u2019s economies. The euro isn\u2019t the problem; it\u2019s Europe\u2019s huge debt levels, the overblown role of the state in the southern economies, inflexible labor markets, the vested interests of powerful bureaucracies and the lack of fiscal discipline. If the euro were based on \u201cfantasy economics,\u201d it could hardly have advanced to the position of the world\u2019s second reserve currency. If all the eurozone nations still had national currencies, the European Union would have been incapable of mustering the economic weight required to negotiate an equitable Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States. Europe needs monetary union to be competitive in the world marketplace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Kasich Balances His Blue-Collar Roots and Ties to Wall Street", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThey would even be able to taste the coal mine in that lunch,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cSome of you can relate to that.\u201dAs a congressman and as governor, Mr. Kasich has made hardscrabble stories of life in McKees Rocks a cornerstone of his political biography. And now the story of his blue-collar roots is an important part of how he is trying to distinguish himself in a crowded presidential primary field and draw a contrast with two of his leading competitors, Donald J. Trump and Jeb Bush, who grew up in wealthy families.Matthew Dowd, the former chief strategist for President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign, who today considers himself an independent, says Mr. Kasich has the potential to emerge as a favorite of establishment Republicans \u2014 and a credible general election threat to Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2014 but only if he distances himself from Wall Street.Mr. Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and his aversion to the culture wars present considerable obstacles in winning over more ideological voters.Far from treating his time at Lehman as a liability, however, Mr. Kasich has embraced it since announcing his candidacy last month, making it part of the image he seeks to project of a common-sense Midwesterner who can empathize with economic anxieties and has the business experience to allay them.\u201cI want to talk about it,\u201d he told voters recently. \u201cBecause I actually understand how job creators make decisions, and that\u2019s really, really critical if you want to be involved in economic growth.\u201dThat explanation worked well for Mr. Kasich during his campaign for governor in 2010, when memories of the financial crisis in this recession-battered state were still painfully fresh. Democrats saw his Wall Street ties as a weakness, but Mr. Kasich managed to turn a potential vulnerability into a strength, beating the incumbent Democrat, Ted Strickland, by pledging to make Ohio\u2019s government \u201cmove at the speed of business.\u201dMr. Kasich, who with his wife has assets worth between $9 million and $22 million, according to a recent financial disclosure, is hardly the only 2016 Republican hopeful with business ties. Mr. Trump has flaunted his success and wealth, and Mr. Bush advised Lehman, earning $1.3 million a year for two years from the firm. (Mr. Kasich, whose 2008 tax return showed roughly $600,000 in salary and bonus from Lehman, recalls that their paths crossed there once, during a meeting with an industrial client in Wisconsin.)But for Mr. Kasich, business was more a second career after a long string of successes in politics. He left Congress in January 2001 after an 18-year career that included a role as one of Newt Gingrich\u2019s lieutenants when he was House speaker, a stint as House Budget Committee chairman and a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.A friend helped him land an interview at Lehman Brothers.\u201cI came away thinking: interesting guy, not like a major door-opener,\u201d recalled Gary Weinstein, who interviewed him and became his boss. As to what the congressman knew about banking, Mr. Weinstein said, \u201cZero. It was shocking to me.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Working in Columbus out of a two-man office, Mr. Kasich struggled at first to gain acceptance from New York bankers who seemed to have little use for him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t welcome him into the club,\u201d said Wilber James, the friend who helped arrange the interview.But Mr. Kasich could still open some doors. He took bankers to California to meet Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive and a former Treasury Department official, which led to a small role for Lehman in Google\u2019s 2004 public stock offering.Here in Ohio, Mr. Kasich got Lehman involved in the public offering for Designer Shoe Warehouse, or DSW, a Columbus-based shoe retailer founded by the Schottenstein family, which employed Mr. Kasich after Lehman\u2019s demise.Mr. Kasich also made introductions for Lehman to Ohio state pension funds, which drew the ire of Democrats after the funds lost hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-fated investments with the bank. Mr. Kasich has said his contacts did not result in any business for Lehman.But friends say Mr. Kasich was most captivated \u2014 and perhaps influenced \u2014 by his work in Silicon Valley, where he had grown close to Mark Kvamme, a venture capitalist. \u201cYou\u2019re from Silicon Valley. Are you rich?\u201d Mr. Kvamme recalls the blunt Mr. Kasich asking when they first met.Mr. Kvamme made introductions to other venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs, and over time, Mr. Kasich and his longtime aide, Jai Chabria, the other half of the two-man Lehman operation in Columbus, eventually managed relationships with 45 companies.Then, in 2008, Lehman collapsed, a victim of its own risky mortgage investments, which Mr. Kasich said did not involve him. \u201cI was a banker,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t offering home loans to anybody.\u201dLike other Lehman employees who held stock options, Mr. Kasich lost money when the firm collapsed. (He also said he was \u201cdiversified,\u201d with income from his work as a Fox News analyst, corporate boards and public speaking.) What he gained, he said, was an understanding \u201cof the way C.E.O.s think.\u201dAs governor, Mr. Kasich quickly put that understanding to use \u2014 and drew criticism from Democrats who said that he brought a Wall Street mentality to the job. With varying degrees of success, he pushed a series of economic initiatives, including a proposal to sell state prisons and use the Ohio Turnpike to issue bonds.As JobsOhio offered tax incentives and other inducements to lure companies to relocate or expand in Ohio, Democrats and advocates for openness in government complained it was cutting deals in secret. David Yost, the state auditor and a Republican, called for greater transparency in the agency\u2019s activities, though Mr. Kasich insisted that JobsOhio was \u201cvery transparent.\u201dBut, said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, \u201chis mind-set was, \u2018I\u2019m just going to do what a business does, and if that means not sharing information, that\u2019s fine \u2014 if that means hiring buddies, that\u2019s fine too.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Kasich shrugs it off. His strategy is, as it has always been, to strike an aw-shucks tone, and invoke roots in McKees Rocks.\u201cI made more money than I ever thought I would make in something like that, and I\u2019m thankful for my experience,\u201d he said of his time at Lehman, expressing astonishment that \u201clittle Johnny Kasich\u201d had come so far. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve looked at McKees Rocks, but it\u2019s been an amazing journey.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting from Peterborough, N.H.videoAdvertisement"}

The company, with 40 employees, has annual sales of about $5.5 million. But as the two men entered their 60s, after nearly three decades as owners, they began to wonder how long the arrangement could endure.Their partner, Roger Reedy, had been talking for several years about retiring and moving to Florida. After considering various options, including buying Mr. Reedy out, Mr. Bizzarro and Mr. Jordan decided their best choice would be to join with him in finding a new owner.\u201cThe three of us aren\u2019t that far apart in age,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cAt some point in time, Dan and I will be looking at slowing down ourselves.\u201dIt is a realization that many business owners their age are coming to. As the sting of the recession fades and the economy grows healthier, entrepreneurial baby boomers who spent the last few decades building businesses are starting to move on to the next phase of their careers: cashing out.And as the generational torch is passed, the profile of small businesses is changing, too, with a markedly higher share of minority groups and women among younger business owners \u2014 a trend that could shift patterns of wealth and economic prospects.Businesses are sold for a wide variety of reasons, and America\u2019s improving economy is the largest factor in the recent rise, according to those in the industry. But bankers and brokers say there is a significant increase in sales from business owners in their 60s and 70s who are ready to turn their creations over to a new generation of owners.\u201cBaby boomers who were going to sell got stopped in their tracks in 2008, 2009 and 2010,\u201d she said. \u201cThings froze for a few years, then got better. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, they put together great years. Now, their books look good and they\u2019re ready.\u201dChronology and demographics are also a factor. \u201cThe \u201990s were a very good decade, so a lot of businesses got launched,\u201d Mr. Connell said. \u201cA lot of business owners were in their 40s. Now, it\u2019s 20 years later and they\u2019re at retirement age. A lot of this is just timing.\u201dIn the case of the Bimac owners, the decision to give up a business intersected with the ambitions of someone eager to take one on.Working with a broker, they placed an online listing that drew the attention of Roberto Santos, 46, a mechanical engineer from Ecuador.Mr. Santos spent most of his career in Latin America, working for a family business that was acquired four years ago by a Korean company. He transferred to the company\u2019s office in Houston, but he grew concerned about his career prospects.\u201cThe industry was taking a hit,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided it was a good time to look for something of my own.\u201dDuring his seven-month hunt, Mr. Santos gathered information on 10 potential acquisitions and visited two of the companies before finding Bimac. Four months ago, he bought the business and its assets, including its real estate, for $2.5 million.Mr. Santos is emblematic of the next generation of small-business owners, which is noticeably more varied in gender and ethnicity than the previous one.Women are also more heavily represented in the younger generation. Nine percent of the buyers over 65 in the study were women, compared with more than 20 percent of those under 49.Mr. Santos\u2019s financing for the deal is typical of how small-business sales often work. He put down 13 percent in cash, and Bimac\u2019s previous owners financed another 12 percent through a seller\u2019s note.Mr. Bizzarro and Mr. Jordan, both 64, are still working for Bimac; Mr. Bizzarro is the vice president of manufacturing and Mr. Jordan is the vice president of engineering. They do not feel ready to leave their careers behind yet.\u201cIf we retired, I think both of us would just go out and find another job,\u201d Mr. Bizzarro said.Mr. Santos says he is happy to have the previous owners stick around. He is planning to make some changes at Bimac \u2014 he would like to invest more in automation and expand the company\u2019s export business \u2014 but he likes having their institutional knowledge to draw on.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep them as long as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are teaching me a lot of things about the business.\u201d\u201cWhen you go to sell your house, the best thing you can do is paint it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like that with a business.\u201d Accounting records need to be clear and current, and the company\u2019s day-to-day operations should run smoothly. Owners who are crucial to their business need to make plans for their replacement, which may involve additional hiring.\u201cIt costs money to do some of these things,\u201d Mr. Merry said. \u201cI warn owners, \u2018Your personal income may suffer.\u2019\u201d\u201cSome of the baby boomers we deal with have no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business is just so demanding that they can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dFor those who decide to put their business on the market, the pool of potential buyers is the largest it has been in years, brokers say. Mr. Merry said the shoppers he works with tend to fall into two categories: companies making strategic acquisitions to fill out their business portfolios and individual buyers leaving corporate careers.\u201cI have a lot of guys who are 40 to 50 years old and need to buy a job,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been downsized, or transferred out of the area, and they decide to be their own boss.\u201dIt is a choice that Mr. Santos, whose wife and three children left Houston this month to join him in Dayton, is enthusiastically enjoying.Advertisement"}

They are less known for speaking out about how the music business itself should operate.That may be changing.Over the last few weeks, dozens of acts, including R.E.M., Common and Chuck D of Public Enemy, took to social media to support a bill that would require radio stations to pay royalties to performers.The debate has been enabled by social media and reflects changes in many artists\u2019 attitudes toward the online economy over the last 15 years or so \u2014 a period that stretches from the rise of Napster and iTunes to online streaming outlets like YouTube, Pandora and Spotify, and has been accompanied by enormous changes in how money flows through the industry.\u201cThe support that we\u2019re seeing, in terms of the range and number of artists, whether it\u2019s from somebody who\u2019s a working-class musician to somebody who\u2019s very successful, it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said Ted Kalo, the executive director of MusicFirst, a lobbying coalition that includes record labels and musicians\u2019 groups and that helped organize the social media campaign.In response, many streaming outlets point out that their actions are a legal and rapidly growing source of income for the industry as sales of CDs and downloads plunge.

Yet how much of that money makes its way into musicians\u2019 pockets remains hotly debated.Melvin Gibbs, a jazz bassist in New York who is the president of the Content Creators Coalition, said that declining royalties \u2014 he recalled once getting a check for 3 cents \u2014 were a factor that led him to study the business models of Internet companies that offer abundant music free or at low subscription prices.\u201cNone of these companies that are supposedly in the music business are actually in the music business,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said. \u201cThey are in the data-aggregation business. They\u2019re in the ad-selling business. The value of music means nothing to them.\u201dDespite growing complaints from middle-class musicians, it is still the stars who have the most impact. As Apple prepared last month to release its new streaming service, Apple Music, independent labels around the world said that the company\u2019s refusal to pay royalties for trial streams was unfair. But Apple did not budge until Ms. Swift scolded the company in a blog post \u2014 whereupon Apple changed course in a matter of hours.Lobbying has become another battleground. In April, the Fair Play Fair Pay Act was introduced to Congress, which would require AM and FM radio stations to pay royalties to performers, in addition to songwriters. The bill has been hailed by musicians and opposed by broadcasters, who have long argued that by playing a song on air they give it valuable promotion.Two weeks ago, National Public Radio also dropped out of the coalition after complaints from the Content Creators Coalition, which accused it of \u201cworking in Washington to deny fair pay to the very artists it purports to celebrate on their air.\u201dA spokeswoman for the MIC Coalition \u2014 whose name stands for Music, Innovation, Consumers \u2014 said that the group had not taken a position on the Fair Play act, though many of its members had as individuals. Michael Riksen, NPR\u2019s vice president for policy and representation, declined to say why the organization had left the MIC Coalition. But he said that he \u201cviewed the coalition as a way for the voice and values of public radio and NPR to be part of a broad-based conversation about copyright reform.\u201d\u201cHad it taken a position\u201d on the bill, Mr. Riksen added, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have joined in the first place.\u201dThe political chances are also unclear for the Fair Play bill, whose other provisions include paying royalties to artists for recordings made before 1972, which are not covered by federal copyright. Similar efforts have failed in the past, and the National Association of Broadcasters says that 203 members of the House and 19 senators have signed a nonbinding resolution opposing it.Still, Mr. Byrne and other musicians pushing for the bill say they are undeterred.\u201cThis one can be won, then we can move on to the harder ones,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cWhy this time? Can\u2019t point to anything specific. It feels right, and as musicians that\u2019s what often drives us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racial Wealth Gap Persists Despite Degree, Study Says", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe long-term trend is shockingly clear,\u201d said William R. Emmons, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and one of the authors of the report. \u201cWhite and Asian college grads do much better than their counterparts without college, while college-grad Hispanics and blacks do much worse proportionately.\u201dA college degree has long been recognized as a great equalizer, a path for minorities to help bridge the economic chasm that separates them from whites. But the report, scheduled to be released on Monday, raises troubling questions about the ability of a college education to narrow the racial and ethnic wealth gap.\u201cHigher education alone cannot level the playing field,\u201d the report concludes.Economists emphasize that college-educated blacks and Hispanics over all earn significantly more and are in a better position to accumulate wealth than blacks and Hispanics who do not get degrees. Graduates\u2019 median family income in 2013 was at least twice as high, and their median family wealth (which includes resources like a home, car and retirement account) was 3.5 to 4 times greater than that of nongraduates.But while these college grads had more assets, they suffered disproportionately during periods of financial trouble.From 1992 to 2013, the median net worth of blacks who finished college dropped nearly 56 percent (adjusted for inflation). By comparison, the median net worth of whites with college degrees rose about 86 percent over the same period, which included three recessions \u2014 including the severe downturn of 2007 through 2009, with its devastating effect on home prices in many parts of the country. Asian graduates did even better, gaining nearly 90 percent.To understand just how disappointing these results are, look at the impact during this period on comparable groups without college degrees. Blacks without degrees, in large part because they had much less to lose, experienced a 3.8 percent drop in wealth. Whites who didn\u2019t graduate from college lost nearly 11 percent. The wealth of Asian nongrads fell more than 44 percent.There is not a simple answer to explain why a college degree has failed to help safeguard the assets of many minority families. Persistent discrimination and the types of training and jobs minorities get have played a role. Another central factor is the heavy debt many blacks and Hispanics accumulate to achieve middle-class status.The collapse of the housing bubble played havoc with college-educated black and Hispanic families, who on average accumulated a huge amount of debt relative to the size of their paychecks. They borrowed a lot to buy homes, only to see them plunge in value during the mortgage crisis. While the average value of a home owned by a white college graduate declined 25 percent, homes owned by black and Hispanic grads fell by about twice that.This loss was made more devastating by the fact that blacks and Hispanics tended to have more of their wealth concentrated in their homes than whites and Asians, who, on average, accumulated more assets in the stock and bond markets, primarily through retirement accounts.The housing boom and bust particularly whipsawed college-educated Hispanics: From 2007 to 2013, their net worth fell a whopping 72 percent.One lesson, according to economists at the St. Louis Fed, is that borrowing too much to get a piece of the American dream often undermines any hope of sustaining it.That notion applies equally to excessive college and housing loans, they say. \u201cHow you finance an asset is just as important as the asset itself,\u201d said Ray Boshara, director of the Center for Household Financial Stability at the St. Louis Fed bank.Substantially narrowing the racial and ethnic wealth gap, Mr. Boshara and the study\u2019s authors suggest, would require policy changes to expand the availability of a quality college education without forcing students into outsize debt.While the recession has caused especially steep declines in black and Hispanic wealth, the study contends that the problem is deeply rooted and more persistent. \u201cThe recent crisis exacerbated these longer-term trends but did not by itself cause the long-term trends that we see,\u201d Mr. Emmons said.\u201cBlacks and Latinos at all education levels, including college and advanced degrees, earn less than their white counterparts, which means lower lifetime earnings\u201d and less ability to save, said John Schmitt, research director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who reviewed an advance copy of the report.Blacks and Hispanics are also less likely than whites to inherit money or receive help from their parents to cover a tuition bill or a down payment on a house.William A. Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at the Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity at Duke University, points out that a family headed by a black college graduate has less wealth on average than a family headed by a white high school dropout.While the researchers from the St. Louis Fed, when asked, played down the importance of financial support from family when explaining their results, Mr. Darity said he believed that family aid helped individuals avoid the type of risky big-ticket borrowing that ensnared so many Hispanic and black graduates.\u201cPrior family wealth is the key,\u201d Mr. Darity explained in an email, noting that it \u201cshapes both income-generating opportunities and the capacity to allow wealth to grow more wealth.\u201dAn article on Monday about new research showing that blacks and Hispanics with college degrees suffer disproportionately more in economic downturns than white and Asian college graduates gave an outdated position for Prof. William A. Darity Jr. at Duke University, who commented on the findings. He is with the Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity \u2014 not with the Consortium on Social Equity, which no longer exists.Advertisement"}

All five models add machismo to the familiar design. There is more high-strength steel in the structure, a claimed 43 percent reduction in noise, vibration and harshness. And a new 278-horsepower V6 engine switches from a standard Otto combustion cycle to the more efficient Atkinson. Loyal owners can safely go out and buy another without test-driving the Chevy or GMC.Be aware of a few things, though.Tacoma gets drum brakes in the rear, which Toyota claims are better for off-roading. I\u2019ll believe that when I see 4Runner and Land Cruiser switch to them. The rear section of the frame becomes a C-channel piece, while G.M. models stick to a fully boxed unit front to rear. Toyota engineers say the added flex of the C-channel piece improves ride quality. Hmmm.Tacoma can tow up to 6,800 pounds, so G.M. wins bragging rights by a bit. Colorado is quicker off the line. Finally, comparing the largest cabs, Tacoma\u2019s back seat is on the cozy side. Passengers will be better off in the Chevy, or a full-size pickup.For a news media event in Seattle (you know, the city 30 miles north of Tacoma), Toyota built an impressive off-road course worthy of a movie set. It buried TRD Off-Road model trucks in sand up to their axles and then used Crawl Control\u2019s electronics to patiently and automatically rock it out. Journalists were sent up grades so steep, all you could see was sky out the windshield. Very impressive.Owners who never venture from pavement will appreciate that the cabin uses materials expected in modern trucks these days. For some, the seat cushions might feel a bit short, and the steering wheel rake and reach adjustment stingy. A standard interior camera mount makes Tacoma the most expensive GoPro accessory money can buy.The dampened tailgate is secured with a key, not with the power locks. The rail tie-down system is standard in a composite bed that\u2019s 7 percent deeper. An AC power outlet is available for the bed. A clever three-piece rear bumper can be replaced in sections if you damage part of it. A standard rear view camera system reduces that possibility.Tacoma is much improved and quite capable. But the G.M. models have strong virtues and soon a diesel engine option. New Nissans and Hondas are waiting in the wings. Who\u2019s the winner? Buyers are. Competition might be the only thing tougher than these trucks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Little Room for Embellishment in Densely Packed Hong Kong", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong is a famously efficient city. Residents pride themselves on the flawless operation of the subway system and the airport. For 21 years in a row, the Heritage Foundation has ranked Hong Kong as the world\u2019s freest economy. But free markets come at a cost. Easy access to capital, years of record-low interest rates and an acute shortage of supply have made Hong Kong the most expensive place in the world to buy a home. Apartment prices set an all-time high on Aug. 2, according to the brokerage Centaline, up 18 percent in a year. They have risen 158 percent since their post-crisis lows at the end of 2008. That also makes them the priciest properties that anyone on earth can find. They are \u201cseverely unaffordable,\u201d according to the tracking group Demographia, and in 2015 posted the most-extreme figures in the 11-year history of its global housing-affordability survey of 378 metropolitan markets. The average home price is 17 times the median income \u2014 60 percent ahead of Vancouver, British Columbia, the second-most expensive place to save for a home. The rarefied prices have an inverse effect on architecture and design. First-time visitors to Hong Kong are often shocked by the remarkable uniformity of this densely packed city, full of billion-dollar residential skyscraper towers that are largely interchangeable. Barring a few exceptions, the world\u2019s most-expensive real estate consists of commoditized rectangular boxes of concrete, even at the very high end, that sell for as much as $12,000 per square foot, or $83 per square inch. So the most \u201cluxurious\u201d property in the world in terms of price is the most lacking in imagination.\u201cThe design is always reduced to the maximum profit you can make out of a lot \u2014 there\u2019s very little room for embellishment,\u201d said Michael Wolf, a photographer. \u201cThat\u2019s why Hong Kong\u2019s skyline is visually so horrible, I would say, unimaginative. It\u2019s all about your bottom line here.\u201dMr. Wolf specializes in images that frame Hong Kong\u2019s fearful symmetry. In his series \u201cArchitecture of Density,\u201d he removes the sky and ground to fill the image with vertical strings of thousands of windows that ripple together across residential tower after tower, a sheer wall of eye-holed concrete that blends together like the canvas of an abstract painting. Though the city\u2019s public housing, which accommodates almost half of Hong Kong\u2019s population, is the worst offender in terms of relentless uniformity, many \u201cluxury\u201d apartment complexes are not much better. They are frequently more colorful but no less repetitive. Mr. Wolf, who splits his time between Hong Kong and Paris, concedes that the situation has improved marginally since he moved to the city in 1994. The tower-block projects of the 21st century often feature flourishes such as large holes through their midriff that both aid air flow and feng shui, the much-prized \u201cwind-water\u201d concept of Chinese aesthetic design.There are notable exceptions to the straight-up-and-down residential tower. Frank Gehry designed the twin towers of Opus, a midrise development by Swire Properties, to appear like twisting stalks of thick bamboo. When the apartments opened, gazing toward Victoria Harbor from the site of the colonial mansion that once housed the head of the Taikoo dockyard, Mr. Gehry said he also intended the curves to maximize the views. He wanted each balcony, with its thick wooden rails, to feel like the deck of a large ship. Opus is Mr. Gehry\u2019s first residential project in Asia, and now is home to the most expensive apartment in the world\u2019s most expensive city. At 95,971 Hong Kong dollars per square foot, or $12,380, a 5,188-square-foot duplex with a garden set a record for an Asian apartment in June when it sold to a Danish businessman for 498 million dollars. Opus and the Henderson Land project 39 Conduit Road have traded places as Hong Kong\u2019s costliest apartment development per square foot. No sooner has one set a new high-water mark than the other surpasses it. One of Hong Kong\u2019s few stand-alone homes reportedly sold for 1.5 billion dollars this summer, or an even-greater 150,000 dollars per square foot.In April, 39 Conduit Road set the previous apartment record when a Singaporean buyer identified as Wang Shuang spent 434 million dollars for a 4,664-square-foot apartment, which is 93,000 dollars per square foot. Many locals blame mainland Chinese buyers for driving up prices in Hong Kong. At their peak in late 2011, they managed to buy a record 42 percent of new apartments in the city \u2014 via whatever means, since it is technically legal to take only $50,000 out of China per year. They now account for around 11 percent of new purchases. In all, 39 Conduit Road has 41 stories. But the schematics skip any number ending in 4, which sounds like \u201cdeath\u201d in Cantonese, and dub the top three levels the 66th, 68th and 88th floors, auspicious numbers promising wealth and long life. It is nowhere near as creative in its exterior design. It is a standard tower, albeit with a sharp-edged facade that flares at a 135-degree angle to maximize harbor-facing views. Its occasional clusters of tightly packed horizontal ridges, which mask uglier essentials like air-conditioning units, bring to mind the grille of a classic 1950s car. The most remarkable aspect of 39 Conduit Road is its engineering. The building gets deeper as it gets higher, with three \u201csteps\u201d on the way up that add a total of nine feet of added width and depth to the highest floors, compared with the base. The added land mass places considerable extra weight on the structure, but the developer calculated that the additional cost was worthwhile. \u201cNot only do we have to deal with a bigger structure, but the challenge is bigger as you go higher,\u201d said Phiyona Au-yeung, the director of residential design at the building\u2019s architects. \u201cBut in Hong Kong, the view is equal to dollars.\u201dMs. Au-yeung\u2019s firm, Dennis Lau & Ng Chun Man Architects & Engineers, or DLN, is one of Hong Kong\u2019s best-known homegrown architectural firms. DLN has also designed the sleek curves of HighCliff, an exceptionally tall, exceptionally thin residential skyscraper. Together with its similarly proportioned neighbor, the Summit, they make up the two \u201cchopsticks\u201d that tower over Happy Valley. With its sleekly curving facade and tightly rounded corners, HighCliff is, like Opus, one of Hong Kong\u2019s most instantly recognizable residential buildings. It placed second behind only the Gherkin in London (proper name: 30 St. Mary Axe) in the Emporis Skyscraper Award when it was completed in 2003. Ms. Au-yeung concedes that even the most luxurious apartments in Hong Kong tend to be rectangular boxes, but she says that is what Hong Kong buyers desire. Furniture fits better, and there is none of the \u201cdead space\u201d that comes with odd-shaped curves and corners. Ms. Au-yeung, who spent several years working in Seattle, believes there is another root cause behind the general lack of originality in Hong Kong: the government that approves all projects. In the West, proposed structures are typically judged by a design-review board made up of a panel of professionals.\u201cThey look at it as a holistic project,\u201d she said. \u201cOur system does not have that. It is very by the book, very black and white.\u201dThe demand for more-original architecture and properties, though, ultimately comes from the end user. There is a communitywide lack of appreciation of architecture as an art form, according to Wong Wah Sang, a professor of architecture at the University of Hong Kong. He believes the high price of Hong Kong property trumps looks and all. \u201cIn Hong Kong, these places are investments,\u201d Professor Wong said. \u201cYou are happy not because the building offers you good design. You are happy because you buy something, and the next day it increases 1 percent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen Harper of Canada, Hoping to Extend Conservatives\u2019 Hold, Calls Elections", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy law, Mr. Harper had to hold a vote in October. But he broke with Canadian political tradition by formally opening the campaign in the middle of summer during what is a holiday weekend in most of the country. The move appeared designed to give the Conservative Party an edge in campaign spending. The campaign period before the vote on Oct. 19 will be the longest since Canadians all began voting on a single day in 1874.On Sunday, Mr. Harper said that the state of the economy, which his opponents view as his weakness, was the main reason to re-elect his government.\u201cIt\u2019s an election about who will protect our economy in a period of ongoing global instability,\u201d Mr. Harper said after asking David Johnston, the governor general, to dissolve Parliament. \u201cNow is not the time for the kind of risky economic schemes that are doing so much damage elsewhere in the world.\u201dThomas Mulcair, the leader of the New Democratic Party, criticized Mr. Harper for producing eight budget deficits in a row and increasing the federal debt.\u201cMr. Harper has the worst economic growth record of any prime minister since 1960,\u201d Mr. Mulcair said. \u201cObviously, Mr. Harper, your plan isn\u2019t working.\u201dMr. Harper\u2019s Conservative party first took power in 2006 and has won two elections since then, gaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons in 2011. But over the past two years, concerns over the economy and ethics issues have eroded the popularity of Mr. Harper and his party.A collapse in oil prices has severely depressed Canada\u2019s energy industry, which is based in Mr. Harper\u2019s adopted home province of Alberta. And despite a corresponding drop in the value of the Canadian dollar, there has not been a hoped for jump in exports of Canadian goods.While Mr. Harper has promoted causes that have proved popular with some voters, including a tough-on-crime legislative program and unwavering support for Israel, the electorate may be tiring of him after more than a decade of his being in office.Mr. Harper has a reputation as a micromanager who is intolerant of critics, and critics say he has been overly aggressive with those who cross him, including opposition politicians, environmental groups and even the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.And after facing opposition parties short of cash and with weak leaderships in three previous campaigns, Mr. Harper is facing a newly resurgent opponent this time.In a country where summer can be all too brief, it is rare for politicians to call elections early unless forced to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s against all the folklore of Canadian politics to call an election in the summer,\u201d said C.E.S. Franks, a prominent parliamentary scholar and professor emeritus at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario. \u201cDoing that when people are on their docks, not thinking about politics \u2014 I can see it being about as welcome as a root canal.\u201dCanadians do not vote directly for prime minister, but will elect local members of Parliament in 338 electoral districts. In addition to the three major parties, the Green Party plans to field a comparatively large number of candidates, while many Quebec voters will also have the option of electing candidates from the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a once powerful but now ailing separatist group.Yasmin Dawood, a professor of law and political science at the University of Toronto, said the timing of the elections appeared intended to enable the Conservatives, who overwhelmingly lead in fund-raising, to outspend opponents.Cristine de Clercy, a professor of political science at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, said that even if Canadians were put off by a long campaign, it was unlikely to affect how they vote. She said that the defining issue of the campaign would probably be the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily fair to blame the federal government for the collapse in oil prices, but there are some deeper problems,\u201d Ms. de Clercy said. \u201cWhere I live in Southern Ontario, we\u2019ve been shedding manufacturing jobs for the last eight to 10 years.\u201dWhile Mr. Mulcair, a lawyer from Quebec, has been widely viewed as an effective opponent of Mr. Harper\u2019s in Parliament, he remains relatively unknown in the rest of the country and is seen as lacking in charisma. Mr. Trudeau, as the son of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a former prime minister, grew up in the public eye and shares his father\u2019s charisma. Richard Johnston, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who specializes in polling, said that Mr. Trudeau must overcome two blunders during the campaign.Voters on the center right, he said, were offended when Mr. Trudeau made a joke about Canada\u2019s use of its fighter aircraft against Islamic State targets. And younger voters and center-left voters, Mr. Johnston said, were dismayed by his decision to support sweeping national security legislation introduced by Mr. Harper, although Mr. Trudeau said the Liberals would amend it if they came to power.\u201cIt remains to be seen how he will withstand close scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Johnston said.Mr. Franks said that he disagreed with many of Mr. Harper\u2019s positions and methods, but that it would be a mistake to rule out another Conservative victory.\u201cI have an immense respect for Harper because he is just a really canny politician,\u201d Mr. Franks said. \u201cHe knows what he wants and he gets it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Game Hunting Is Also Big Business for Wealthy Few", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral hunting outfits in the United States help organize safari hunts in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe, where licensed hunting is legal. These safari hunts cater to a small but wealthy clientele of big-game hunters, who bring back more than 400 lion trophies \u2014 heads and furs \u2014 into the United States each year, according to the Humane Society, a conservation group. More than 750 elephants meet a similar fate.Big-game hunters operate in a separate world from weekend deer hunters in the United States. Plane tickets, specialized gear and weapons, safari guides and astronomical hunting fees determined by what kind of animal you want to kill \u2013 a lion costs more than $50,000, experts say \u2013 keep the pastime out of reach for most hunters.Commercial trophy hunting is allowed in more than a dozen African countries, with most hunts taking place in South Africa, Tanzania, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Americans make up around 60 percent of big-game hunters active on the continent, activists say.The Big Five animals hunted for sport, their conservation status according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List and the market rates that a trophy demands in South Africa, home to the biggest hunting industry on the continent.Mr. West\u2019s company is one of many that help American hunters plan trips overseas \u2014 offering everything from advice on weapons to guidance on what to expect once you\u2019re out in the wild.Mr. West has been on \u201chundreds\u201d of hunts, he said, including more than two dozen trips that have taken him overseas, where he has trekked with the Kalahari bushmen in Namibia and hiked in Argentina. (Mr. West\u2019s TV program shows him as he kills an animal and then poses by the corpse.)Big game hunters, he said, whether they kill anything or not, are first and foremost world travelers with a sense of adventure.\u201cSome of the trips that I remember more than any others are the ones where we didn\u2019t get anything, but had big adventures,\u201d he said. Argentina is a particular favorite. \u201cI just fell in love with their culture,\u201d he added.Mr. West sets up as many as 50 overseas hunts a year for well-heeled travelers, many of them in Africa. He said that his clients are financially savvy and have a deep commitment to nature and wildlife.\u201cThese are salt-of-the-earth people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may be wealthy, but people who hunt consider themselves conservationists.\u201dSabrina Corgatelli, an American hunter who was attacked on social media last week after she posted pictures of herself posing with a giraffe, a wildebeest and other animals she shot and killed on a legal hunt in South Africa, echoed that sentiment in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show.\u201cEverybody just thinks we\u2019re coldhearted killers, and it\u2019s not that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a connection with the animal, and just because we hunt them doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a respect for them.\u201d\u201cRevenues from hunting generate $200 million annually in remote rural areas of Africa,\u201d they wrote. Much of that money goes to pay for park rangers and other forms of wildlife management that is a boon to the animals, they argued. \u201cThis revenue gives wildlife value, and humans protect the revenue by protecting the wildlife.\u201dThat is an argument that opponents of hunting, like the Humane Society, reject.Instead, anti-hunting activists argue for the benefits of other forms of tourism. The local economy in rural Namibia, for example, may be better served by busloads of tourists toting cameras instead of rifles.\u201cTourism based on living animals brings in far more money than hunting does,\u201d said Teresa Telecky, a wildlife expert at the Humane Society and a critic of trophy hunting. \u201cThere are far more people coming to Africa for tourism than for trophy hunting, and that provides people with real livelihoods \u2014 working in restaurants, hotels, the tourism industry \u2014 and that is far more important than this theory that hunting revenue will trickle down to normal people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And the August performance of David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital will be closely watched. The hedge fund went into August down 9 percent for the year.In its letter on Wednesday, Pershing Square said the current depressed share prices of many of its top holdings in companies like Mondelez, Canadian Pacific and Zoetis did not reflect the real value of the businesses and that the companies had limited exposure to macroeconomic events. The firm\u2019s top five holdings were down between 5 and 15 percent for the month of August. Valeant, for example, has shed 11.6 percent, while Canadian Pacific is down 15 percent on the month.Separately, Pershing Square highlighted a potential conflict of interest between the fund and the personal investment of an employee related to the recent acquisition of Sprout Pharmaceuticals by Valeant.Pershing Square will report on Thursday the latest numbers that will include the moves in markets as of the end of Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bay Area\u2019s Disjointed Public Transit Network Inspires a Call for Harmony", "Date": "2015-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 There is much to relish about the Bay Area, from the intoxicating landscape to the blissful lack of humidity.One thing is not perfect, though: the daunting nature of the region\u2019s public transportation system, a patchwork of more than 20 operators spread across nine counties and 101 municipalities that have yet to spawn a cohesive map.As housing costs here continue to escalate, with growing numbers of people moving farther afield in search of affordability, the disjointed nature of the region\u2019s transportation fiefs, each with its own fare structures and nomenclature, has become the topic of increasingly intense debate among transportation policy experts.\u201cNinety percent of the people in the Bay Area are essentially tourists when it comes to transit,\u201d said Ratna Amin, SPUR\u2019s transportation policy director. \u201cThey don\u2019t use it.\u201dThe study recommends a variety of changes, from better trip-planning tools to smoother transfers. But there are roughly two dozen transit agencies in the region, and each operates and plans its system independently, with its own funding sources, which makes any uniform change difficult.Unlike in New York and Boston, where consistent maps and signage aid navigation and a single fare card generally takes riders all over the city, passengers in the Bay Area juggle multiple maps, timetables and a bewildering number of fare combinations, said Randy Rentschler, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the region\u2019s transportation planning and finance agency.\u201cNobody would set out to invent the system we have now,\u201d Mr. Rentschler said.For example, those age 12 and under get a youth discount on the Bay Area Rapid Transit, known as BART, which connects the East Bay, including Berkeley and Oakland, to San Francisco proper, but also goes all the way to San Francisco International Airport. But those age 18 and under get a youth discount on CalTrain, which goes from San Jose and other points in Silicon Valley to San Francisco. CalTrain has zoned fares in six zones, with different fares for each of the six bus companies that are also within its purview. Golden Gate Transit ferries and buses have their own zoned passes. And there are numerous types of passes \u2014 monthly, weekly, daily \u2014 on different systems.The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency oversees the city proper\u2019s surface transportation network, including bike lanes, public transit, traffic, parking and taxis. But it carries less than half of the region\u2019s trips. Commuters traveling by public transportation from the East Bay to Mountain View or other Silicon Valley locations face a train ride and at least three buses \u2014 a connection possible only if everything is on time.And demand has grown for these services. The traffic lull that occurred after the dot-com bust is long gone. In 2014, drivers wasted an average of 78 hours of delays in traffic, with San Francisco and San Jose ranking among the top five worst cites in the United States for traffic, said Jim Bak, a director of Inrix, a transportation data and analysis company in Kirkland, Wash.Ridership on CalTrain is up by 10 percent, for example, \u201ca reflection of the economy and the appeal of San Francisco,\u201d said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association in Washington, D.C.Even transit operators agree that transfer points like Embarcadero Station in downtown San Francisco \u201care the places where we should be doubling down,\u201d said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which oversees long-term planning and administers funding. The authority is working with BART on a rewards program that would coax riders into traveling during nonpeak hours either by offering points on electronic payment cards or luring them with prizes, like coupons from local businesses.Though certainly preferable to clogged highways, stations like Embarcadero test the mettle of even the most intrepid commuter. There, a transfer from BART to the city\u2019s light rail, known as MUNI, requires negotiating two levels, exiting through a turnstile, paying a new fare, entering another turnstile and descending another flight of stairs to reach a different platform.\u201cIt\u2019s a little intimidating,\u201d said Michael Beadle, 41, who completes that transfer daily in his commute from Castro Valley to his job at Ubisoft, a video game company. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve helped many travelers who got lost.\u201d\u201cA good map can help people understand how transit can serve them,\u201d Mr. Primus said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just where does the transit go, but how often it comes and how long might I have to wait?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Pitch to Vacationers: Crimea Is for Patriots", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAKI, Crimea \u2014 Tamara Tsetlayana stood on a narrow stretch of gray beach, rinsing off a thick layer of the black, ostensibly therapeutic mud that has drawn visitors to the salty lake here for more than a century.The dreary shoreline with its view of rusted dredging equipment was perhaps less appealing than previous holiday destinations in Turkey and Europe, she said, but patriotism drove her choice this summer.Yet that tourist tidal wave never quite materialized.President Vladimir V. Putin contributed his bit, too, taking a high-profile trip to Crimea this week. Past excursions have included exploits like bare-chested horseback riding or raising ancient amphorae planted on the seabed for him to \u201cdiscover.\u201d This time he went underwater in a clear bathyscaph to look at the wreck of 10th-century ship, which he said proved Russia had ancient links to the area.The prime minister of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, put a brave face on the overall season, telling a Western reporter that he was sorry \u201cto disappoint\u201d but that millions of Russian tourists actually were coming. \u201cEverything is all right with the tourist season,\u201d he said. \u201cPatriotically minded Russians gave special attention to Crimea.\u201dOrdinary people living off tourism \u2014 guides, taxi drivers, bed-and-breakfast owners \u2014 described the season as anemic. A group of villagers along the southern \u201cCrimean Riviera\u201d wrote an open letter to Mr. Putin in late July saying that visitors this year amounted to just 10 percent of the number in 2013, grousing that they faced unemployment and hunger.\u201cPeople do not know how they will survive the winter,\u201d the letter said.About 33,000 vacationers used to arrive every day by train, but Ukraine now blocks the tracks. Ferry service to southern Russia was never great, and although better organization and more boats cut the waiting time from days to hours, the volume remains limited. (The prime minister also fired the transportation minister.)Mr. Aksyonov said there had been a huge leap in the number of passenger planes, with 106 arriving around the clock, up from around 12, bringing some 15,000 people each day.A prodigious construction effort at the Simferopol airport more than doubled the terminal space over the past six months. Yet the airport is still hard-pressed to absorb the traffic. Some planes circle for 30 minutes awaiting a landing spot. The arrivals hall is so jammed with incoming travelers, even at 2 a.m., that those greeting passengers must wait out in the street.Many Crimeans noted that the tenor of tourism was changing. Ukrainians were happy to rent a room within walking distance of the beach and to cook their own meals. Russians prefer hotel packages. The supply in Crimea is extremely limited, unlike in Sochi, another Black Sea resort that was rebuilt for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\u201cMany people in Russia have been spoiled by all those fancy resorts in Turkey and Egypt with their all-inclusive vouchers,\u201d said Vera F. Basava, 67, a retired hospital worker hawking a rental apartment near the beach in the southern village of Gurzuf. \u201cSo they have doubts about coming here.\u201dBefore the crisis, Ms. Basava said she rented to all kinds of people, Ukrainians, Germans, Britons. In a good season she could earn 200,000 rubles, some $6,000, to supplement a monthly pension then worth $280 and now half that.Mr. Putin did not help matters in one of his first statements on Crimea last year by describing its resorts as below Russian standards.In 2014, 3.8 million tourists visited Crimea, according to government statistics.Down the street in Gurzuf, a guide named Lena, who did not want to provide her last name, was sitting under a sprawling fig tree trying to sell excursion tickets to the wineries, the palaces and the natural wonders that once made southern Crimea the playground of the czars and then the Communist Party elite.\u201cLast year many Russians came out of curiosity, but this is a weak season,\u201d she said, before admonishing a visitor: \u201cWhy are you sober? You are in Crimea!\u201dUpscale resorts seem to be doing better than others. At the Sea Wellness Spa Hotel in Alushta, a sprawling, forested coastal property, the price of rooms ranged from just over $100 a night for a studio to more than $2,000 a night for a six-room villa with its own pool. The hotel was running at 75 percent capacity, said Maria Boriy, its commercial director.In Yalta, Lubov V. Gribkova, the chairwoman of the City Council\u2019s tourism committee, said the southern port had raked in an unexpected windfall from taxes and fees because so many Russians stayed in hotels this year.How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.Yalta decided to skip its usual spring beautification program, spending the money instead on the technical studies needed to snag federal road construction money, Ms. Gribkova said.Poor infrastructure discourages tourism. Mr. Aksyonov said 80 percent of the road network needed replacing. But the Kremlin announced in June that auditors could not account for 60 percent of the money allocated for road construction last year.During the Soviet era, many of the palaces and estates of the czarist aristocracy were nationalized and converted to health sanitariums. There are still 144 of them, and little has changed since Soviet times.Many still offer the same menu of slightly weird science meant to improve your health: leeches to suck your blood, magnets that supposedly diminish pain, breathing in salt caves.In Saki, the N. N. Burdenko Sanitarium, a rehabilitation hospital, uses the famous local mud to treat people paralyzed in automobile accidents and other traumas, drawing visitors from across Russia and the former Soviet republics.\u201cPractically nothing has changed since Soviet times because it was all so effective that there was no need to tinker,\u201d said Snezhana Kotelevich, the deputy head of all the sanitarium\u2019s medical clinics.The first treatment Dr. Kotelevich offered a visitor was a mud enema to address prostate problems. \u201cAll the women will be yours after that,\u201d she said.Asked if the hospital treated the wounded from the war in southeastern Ukraine, Dr. Kotelevich responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a provocative question,\u201d before allowing that the wounded from the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic were treated at the facility. There was just one there at the time, she said, a man from the North Caucasus who could not walk and also had intestinal problems because of his wounds.Many Crimeans in the travel business expect the industry will recover only when the grandest infrastructure project of them all is completed, a multibillion-dollar bridge linking Crimea to the mainland. But that is at least three years off.One travel agent in Yalta keeps pictures on her computer of the huge foreign cruise ships that used to stop here, ghosts from yet another bygone era on Crimea before Western sanctions over Ukraine cut them off.\u201cWe thought Russia would fill this place with seminars and conferences, but so far nothing,\u201d she said with a sigh, adding that Crimea had turned into such a \u201cmadhouse\u201d that she did not want to give her name for fear of losing government business.An article on Thursday about Russia\u2019s appeal to patriotism to lure vacationers to Crimea this summer, which met with limited success, misspelled the surname of the chairwoman of the City Council tourism committee in the Crimean city of Yalta, who said it earned an unexpected windfall this season because many Russians prefer to stay in hotels, which are plentiful in Yalta. The chairwoman is Lubov V. Gribkova, not Gribokova. The article also misspelled part of the name of a rehabilitation hospital in Saki that is popular with tourists. It is the N. N. Burdenko Sanitarium, not N. N. Budenko.Nikolay Khalip contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expanding Web of Scandal in Brazil Threatens Further Upheaval", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The charges are nothing less than sweeping: Prosecutors say that Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of Brazil\u2019s lower house of Congress, took as much as $40 million in bribes for himself and his allies, plundering Petrobras, the government-controlled oil company, while laundering money through an evangelical megachurch. Officials in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government initially seemed relieved after Mr. Cunha was charged, according to news reports, arguing that putting him on the defensive makes the impeachment of the president a more distant possibility. As speaker of the lower house, Mr. Cunha has the authority to initiate impeachment proceedings against a sitting president. Ms. Rousseff, who has been battling for her political survival after winning re-election to a second term just 10 months ago, seems to have recently gained something of a respite. For instance, Renan Calheiros, the powerful leader of Brazil\u2019s Senate, has publicly expressed opposition to impeachment.Political analysts say that support from Mr. Calheiros, who is also being investigated over claims that he was involved in the Petrobras graft scandal, may be crucial for Ms. Rousseff as she faces a case in a federal auditing court tied to the Congress over claims that she improperly used state funds to cover budget shortfalls. A ruling against Ms. Rousseff could open the way for impeachment proceedings.Moreover, some business leaders and prominent media groups, despite having doubts about Ms. Rousseff\u2019s policies and governing style, have begun calling attention to the potential for a more severe crisis of confidence across the political system and the economy if she is impeached, especially since no testimony has surfaced that she personally profited from the Petrobras graft scheme.Reacting to Mr. Cunha\u2019s claim that he is the target of a conspiracy, his critics point out that the Petrobras scandal has already produced the arrests of many business leaders, including the billionaire chief executive of the construction giant Odebrecht, and political figures, including the treasurer of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party and Jos\u00e9 Dirceu de Oliveira e Silva, an influential party leader. Including Mr. Cunha, about 40 percent of the 594 members of Congress are facing charges of one type or another in connection with a long list of scandals, according to Congresso em Foco, a watchdog group. However, few lawmakers ever go to jail because they can be tried only by the Supreme Court, meaning years of delays and effectively enabling many of them to avoid convictions. Mr. Cunha commands loyalty from a large number of legislators, and his fight to remain speaker could draw greater attention to the impunity that has long defined Congress, in addition to producing gridlock at a time when Ms. Rousseff and her finance minister, Joaquim Levy, are trying to win congressional approval for contentious austerity measures. \u201cIt would be a slap in the face of the Brazilian people if Cunha manages to remain in his post,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Still, Mr. Cunha has his fair share of supporters, especially among legislators in Congress who owe him favors and groups that are clamoring for Ms. Rousseff to resign or be impeached. \u201cSomeone needs to prove he is guilty,\u201d Jovair Arantes, a congressman from Goi\u00e1s State, told reporters. \u201cUntil then, he remains in his position as speaker.\u201d But while Mr. Cunha counts on his loyalists, Ms. Rousseff may also benefit from a fractious Congress facing the prospect of being upended by having one its most powerful leaders ensnared in scandal. Bras\u00edlio Sallum, a sociologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, noted that two-thirds of the legislators in the lower house needed to support an impeachment vote for it to pass. For now, the figure remains out of the reach of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents, he said. \u201cTechnically speaking, the political conditions for impeachment are not yet there, meaning that the president could survive, albeit in a critical situation,\u201d Mr. Sallum said. \u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult to see any endgames on the horizon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They work with meager means to create something close to their hearts, without the crushing pressure for it to be a global financial success. But having little or no cash to make art can be difficult, so many directors see indies as a steppingstone to the mainstream, a calling card to show studios how their intimate ideas could translate to big-budget projects. That may mean making a number of small films, then a climb up the studio ladder.The indie-to-franchise trend has met with some industry skepticism, because it seems to work only to the advantage of men and not women.

{"Headline": "Good Timing for Britain to Shed Its R.B.S. Stake", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsBritain shouldn\u2019t obsess about losing money on its Royal Bank of Scotland stake. George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is about to get cracking on reducing the government\u2019s 79 percent holding, which will mean a short-term loss on the 46 billion pounds handed over by taxpayers in 2008 and 2009. That hit needs to be put into perspective.If the British government were to sell the entirety of its stake at R.B.S.\u2019s share price of 342 pence at the market close of July 31, it would lose about \u00a314 billion, considering the average in-price of 500 pence at which the government bought during the crisis.That\u2019s not great at a time when Mr. Osborne is trumpeting the need for further austerity. But factor in fees already paid by the bank to the state in return for insurance on its stinky assets from 2009 to 2012, as well as various other support measures, and the in-price is more like 430 pence, cutting the potential loss in half.Besides, this is not a particularly helpful way to think about the government\u2019s actions in 2008. If R.B.S. hadn\u2019t been bailed out, the British economy would have contracted by even more than the 7.2 percent it did. Questions of \u201cvalue,\u201d therefore, are a little fuzzy.If Mr. Osborne is still worried about prices, he could choose to parcel out R.B.S. shares to institutional investors a little bit at a time, as the government announced on Monday, with the planned sale of a 5.2 percent stake. But he could also go a bit faster.There is a parallel in R.B.S.\u2019s own deleveraging program. In early 2014, it took provisions covering notional losses of 15 percent on \u00a333.5 billion of assets it no longer wanted. So far, it has sold at tighter discounts: Since its initial estimate, it has released \u00a31.6 billion in provisions, helped by central bank quantitative easing that has kept asset prices high.The same factors could mean it is better to sell equity stakes now rather than to wait. But even if quantitative easing is unwound, R.B.S. would still gain from being a nonstate-owned institution. Investors rightly mark down institutions that are subject to political interference, which R.B.S. has been for years. Addressing that could push up the price \u2014 and further reduce the British government\u2019s exit wounds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Renminbi Devaluation May Initiate New Phase in Global Currency War", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisFor years, China looked like the principled noncombatant. As other countries, seeking to secure an economic advantage, let the value of their currencies slide on international markets, China held firm on the value of its money.But this week, China jumped into the fray. In a surprise decision on Tuesday, the country\u2019s authorities began sharply devaluing its currency, the renminbi. While the plunge paused on Friday, the renminbi was still down 4.4 percent against the dollar this week, a huge drop for China.The abrupt move opens a new phase in what some analysts see as a long-raging global currency war, a development that could leave the United States exposed and undermine efforts to pull the world economy out of the doldrums.But the countries that don\u2019t join the devaluations, like the United States right now, can end up suffering, if they export less and import more. A steep drop in the value of the renminbi could also intensify some of the forces that, in the view of some economists, have caused the American economy to underperform.These charts show the relative currency strength of East Asia\u2019s three largest economies over the last 15 years.\u201cThe risks of a deflationary, secular stagnation in the U.S. would be increased by a large devaluation of the renminbi,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary. Mr. Summers, however, cautioned against overreacting. \u201cOne has to be very careful about regarding market fluctuations and uncertainty among market participants as a crisis that demands major government interventions.\u201dEven so, the Fed faces a dilemma as it contemplates raising interest rates for the first time in more than nine years. A rate increase could drive the dollar up even more against other currencies, creating a vexing obstacle for the American economy at a crucial moment in its recovery.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a currency war for six years,\u201d said Stephen S. Roach, a senior fellow at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. \u201cChina is now moving on its currency, and other countries are using their currencies as a tool to relieve distress, and that is potentially destabilizing.\u201dChina\u2019s devaluation stems in part from a desire to let markets influence the price of the renminbi, a shift global policy makers have advocated. If managed well, it may give China a lift and the extra flexibility it may need as it deals with the challenges facing its economy.At a news conference on Thursday, officials from the Chinese central bank defended the devaluation and said it would be managed carefully. Zhang Xiaohui, an assistant governor at the central bank, said that there was \u201cno basis for the continued depreciation of the renminbi.\u201dThe hope among global policy makers, of course, is that the changes in exchange rates are not excessive and do more good than harm. Still, history shows that currencies often go down too much or go up too far, interrupting the strong trade flows that have underpinned the global economy for decades.The fear among some analysts is the currency tensions could worsen some of the entrenched problems that they say exist in the global economy.Some of them, for instance, assert that the international system relies too much on the dollar as a so-called reserve currency. This dependence means that the Fed\u2019s actions, set primarily for the United States economy, can change economic conditions in many other countries, even when the change is not warranted or constructive.In addition, some economists contend that, under the current system, countries like Germany and China are able to run stubbornly large trade surpluses. When they do, it can create economic headaches for other nations.\u201cWe are in a period of trade war \u2014 make no mistake,\u201d said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s a zero sum game. It\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s a negative sum game.\u201dIn the past, international authorities have taken bold steps to quell extreme moves in currency markets. Not wanting a repeat of the competitive devaluations of the 1930s, they set up a system of fixed exchange rates after World War II that severely limited how much currencies could fluctuate.After that fell apart in the early 1970s, major countries occasionally intervened to moderate currency movements through international agreements like the 1985 Plaza Accord, named for the Plaza Hotel in New York. At the time, the accord helped arrest a soaring rally in the dollar.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.Few, if any, analysts believe similar interventions are needed right now. But if currency tensions cause economic turmoil, eyes may turn to the world\u2019s largest central banks for help.In the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed in effect became the central bank to the world, extending emergency loans to foreign banks and funneling dollars to other countries to make sure financial systems didn\u2019t seize up.But the Fed is thinking about raising interest rates, perhaps as early as next month. When interest rates do go up, it could make life even harder for countries in the developing world, which could experience capital outflows. Also, companies in emerging markets that have borrowed in dollars will have to spend more of their local currency to pay back their dollar debts.To offset the Fed\u2019s tightening, Indonesia, South Korea and other such countries may decide to devalue their currencies even more.Seeing what a Fed increase could do, some analysts assert that the central bank will not raise rates next month. But if it does increase rates then, some central bank watchers say it should use cautious language to calm markets.\u201cIt will have to be the most dovish hike in history,\u201d said George Goncalves, rates strategist at Nomura Securities, referring to an interest rate stance that carefully seeks to avoid an unnecessary tightening of monetary policy.Still, the global economy may weather this storm without any big moves by international policy makers. Many economists believe that, despite its rise against other currencies, the dollar is not dangerously overvalued.China, they add, has many reasons to avoid an uncontrolled plunge in the renminbi. A particularly important reason is that Chinese entities have borrowed over $1.6 trillion in foreign currencies. A big drop in the renminbi would make that harder for some Chinese companies to pay back, because they would need to earn more renminbi to service their obligations.\u201cA sharp devaluation is not in China\u2019s interest,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, a China economist at ANZ Research. \u201cThat could make corporates very panicky.\u201dAnd for now at least, China may also limit the size of a devaluation, to avoid making the renminbi a big issue in the United States presidential campaign.But if China\u2019s economy weakens further, the country\u2019s leadership may not have the luxury of being able to massage its currency incrementally lower. Chinese policy makers may have to opt for a steeper decline to try to stimulate growth. Then the markets, in response, may aggressively push the currency lower if economic numbers are poor.\u201cIf China is going through the correction that many have predicted over the past decade,\u201d said Benn Steil, a director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cthe currency might have quite a bit further to fall.\u201dProlonged turbulence and economic pain may then force world leaders to think hard about whether the international system can be changed. The enormous amounts of easy money pumped out by the Fed over the last decade helped stoke booms in other countries that became unsustainable. And as the Fed has pulled back, the adjustment has been jarring for huge economies, like Brazil and China.\u201cThe system is coming back to bite us in the rear,\u201d said David Beckworth, an associate economics professor at Western Kentucky University. \u201cMaybe this experience teaches us that we are more interconnected than we ever were.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Stock Market Rout in a Month That Hedge Funds Would Sooner Forget", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom his getaway cabin deep in the woods, an experienced adviser to wealthy hedge fund investors was hopping from one conference call to another to manage clients\u2019 mounting anxiety.Similarly, a broker described how he had interrupted his vacation to respond to the needs of his nervous clients. And a multibillion-dollar hedge fund said numerous investors had requested play-by-play commentary and performance figures.The sudden and rapid sell-off across global markets that began late last week and deepened on Monday has caught many on Wall Street off guard, interrupting the vacation plans of richly compensated money managers \u2014 especially those at some of the nation\u2019s biggest hedge funds, where losses over the last few days have been especially steep.The ferocity of Monday\u2019s selling \u2014 in particular a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average of nearly 1,000 points in the first minutes of trading \u2014 was attributed to a number of events, from the forced sales of stocks bought on credit \u2014 known as margin calls \u2014 to economic woes in China and looming rate increases in the United States.But by the end of Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closing down 77.68 points, or 3.9 percent, there was still no clear reason for the plunge and not many big money managers were willing to stick their necks out and speak publicly. Even those who spoke privately to investors were few. \u201cI think they don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said one investor, who did not want to be quoted for fear of angering some managers.What is clear, however, is that the numbers rolling in for August from the hedge fund industry do not look good. Hedge funds went into the sell-off bullish, with $1.5 trillion in long positions \u2014 bets that stocks will rise in price \u2014 compared with $684 billion in short positions, bets that stocks will decline in price, according to an analysis of the industry by Goldman Sachs.The 10 stocks that Goldman said were the most widely held by hedge funds \u2014 stocks like Apple, Citigroup, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 were down from 5 to 10 percent over the last three trading days.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Leon G. Cooperman, founder of the $9 billion hedge fund Omega Advisors and a longtime market bull, is emerging as a big loser in the chaos. As of Friday, his fund was said to have lost 11 percent this month, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Cooperman did not return a call seeking comment.The firm was hit hard by big declines in the share prices of Allergan, AerCap, Citigroup and the American International Group \u2014 four of Omega\u2019s top stock holdings, according to regulatory filings.One hedge fund manager who invests mainly in United States stocks, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he would not be surprised if the average fund lost from 3 to 7 percent in August. He said the past week had been brutal and the losses had come far faster than most would have anticipated. Several managers described frenzied selling when the markets opened on Monday morning.Even the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, led by Ray Dalio, was not spared. The $162 billion firm told investors on Friday that its Pure Alpha fund was down 4.7 percent for the month. Going into August, the Pure Alpha portfolio had been up 11.8 percent for the year.Bridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.Before the full extent of the sell-off on Wall Street was known, Goldman had already predicted that the hedge fund industry would once again underperform the broader S.&P. 500, which, at Monday\u2019s close, was down 8.1 percent for the year. The Dow lost 588 points, or 3.6 percent. The average hedge fund has underperformed the broader market for six consecutive years, according to the research firm HFR.The warning signs for the latest global market rout appeared as far back as June, when China\u2019s stock market took a plunge and regulators intervened. \u201cThis is really a story about China and emerging markets. Emerging market currencies are off by between 10 and 20 percent over the past two months,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.\u201cThose who were short commodities, emerging market currencies or Chinese equities are clearly the winners here,\u201d he said, adding that after the most recent turmoil anyone who made bets against any stocks around the world would be winners, too.But after six years of a bull market run in which American stocks have hit one record after another, few hedge fund managers have been brave enough to short stocks with much conviction. To take a short position, a trader sells borrowed stock in a company that he or she thinks is overvalued in anticipation of buying it back at a cheap price.Yet, while the headlines on Monday were stark \u2014 analysts in China and the United States were calling it Black Monday \u2014 the sell-off was not as bad for some hedge funds that had short positions. The past week was a good time for money managers betting on stock declines.Express Scripts Holding, for example, which was flagged by Goldman Sachs as one of the most heavily shorted stocks, has shed 6.8 percent in the last three trading days. Exxon Mobil, another favorite short, was down 10 percent over the same period, in lock step with the price of oil dropping below $40 a barrel.Kerrisdale Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York, sent a \u201cflash estimate\u201d on Monday morning to let investors know that the fund would be down 2 percent for August, according to one investor. The hedge fund, which has a short bet against the satellite company Globalstar, was up around 10 percent for the year heading into August, the investor said.Hedge funds that scoop up distressed assets at bottomed-out prices also began to eye opportunities. \u201cWhat I have told investors is the economy is fine but now is a great time to be buying some things when they get hit,\u201d said Marc Lasry, a co-founder of the $13.9 billion hedge fund Avenue Capital Group.\u201cOther people may be having issues,\u201d Mr. Lasry said. \u201cFor us, that is an opportunity as opposed to a problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That session, the court said, made improvements in education funding, but did not go far enough.Mr. Dorn, the education superintendent, said in an interview that he did not see any way that the Legislature could meet its education obligations, and the Supreme Court\u2019s orders, without imposing new taxes. But that has proved hugely difficult.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bring Moldova Back From the Brink", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSTRASBOURG, France \u2014 The Republic of Moldova \u2014 a tiny country of just 3.5 million people \u2014 is at risk of becoming Europe\u2019s next security crisis, with potential consequences far beyond its borders.A former Soviet Republic sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova sits at the crossroads between Europe\u2019s East and West. Since it declared independence in 1991, power has alternated between the Communist Party, which has traditionally sought stronger ties with Russia, and pro-European parties that have staunchly advocated membership in the European Union. In 2009, the pro-Europeans came to power and made progress toward their goal. They signed an association agreement to deepen political ties with Brussels and gradually integrate Moldova into the European common market. Exports increased, the economy grew and, in return for a series of reforms, including improving human rights, Moldovan citizens were granted visa-free travel into E.U. territory. Yet today the picture is far less optimistic. Over the last six years little has been done to open up the country\u2019s economy and its institutions. Corruption remains endemic and the state is still in the hands of oligarchs, while punishingly low incomes have propelled hundreds of thousands of Moldovans to go abroad in search of a better life. Many still look to Brussels for the answer, while others instead believe that prosperity lies with the Eurasian Economic Union, led by Russia. What unites both camps is their palpable resentment toward venal elites. Ask an average Moldovan how life varies under the different parties and you\u2019ll frequently hear that it makes no difference.This widespread public frustration now has a lightning rod. At the end of last year, $1 billion disappeared from three of the country\u2019s banks. The scandal has come to epitomize the state\u2019s failure to protect citizens\u2019 interests. Few believe that the individuals responsible will be held accountable or that the money will be returned. The taxpayer bailout that was required to stabilize the banks has bludgeoned public finances. The value of the Moldovan currency, the leu, has dropped, interest rates have rocketed and a recession looms.All outside financing has been suspended, pending concrete action to address corruption and get the financial sector in order. If the authorities fail to do what is needed to restore external support \u2014 and quickly \u2014 the country will face serious economic turmoil. Social programs for the poor and vulnerable will be cut just before the harsh winter months.The regional picture is also bleak. In recent months, there has been a serious deterioration in relations with Transnistria \u2014 the breakaway, Russian-speaking province along Moldova\u2019s eastern side. Two decades ago, encouraged by Moscow, Transnistria declared itself independent and hundreds died in the ensuing fighting. The conflict has since been frozen. The crisis in Ukraine, however, has sparked fears of a thaw.Many in Moldova worry that Transnistria could become the next Crimea, an anxiety that has been further fueled by appeals for Russian protection from some of the province\u2019s civic groups. Transnistria\u2019s leaders complain that Moldova is conspiring with Ukraine to keep them under economic blockade and have now ordered Transnistrian army reservists between 18 and 27 to mobilize. At this stage, a full-blown military conflict is unlikely but, in such a tense environment, even skirmishes could spiral out of control.Moldova\u2019s newly formed government must act quickly. The country\u2019s three main pro-European parties recently entered into a coalition and the Parliament narrowly approved Valeriu Strelet as its prime minister, who also supports E.U. membership.The clear lesson from Ukraine has been that, in today\u2019s Europe, a state\u2019s strength and stability depends on its commitment to democracy and the rule of law. Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea was deeply destabilizing, but we must never forget that the crisis in Ukraine began with the people\u2019s profound disillusionment with their political institutions. Moldova, too, must now think of its democratic security. Alongside the urgent measures needed to fix the banks, the government must immediately begin purging corrupt officials from public bodies. As a start, the dozens of judges \u2014 some very high-profile \u2014 who have been accused of egregiously abusing their power should be investigated. Law enforcement agencies must also do everything they can to arrest the individuals responsible for the massive bank fraud.In order to give people confidence that justice will be served in these cases, murky political interference must be eliminated from the judicial system. Legislation currently before Parliament that would guarantee the impartiality of state prosecutors should be implemented without delay. And to prove that no one is above the law, the current blanket immunity from prosecution enjoyed by members of Parliament should be reduced. More fundamentally, Moldova will need to implement the basic checks on power that should exist in any democracy. The key anti-corruption agencies \u2014 the Anti-Corruption Center, the National Integrity Commission and the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office \u2014 must be set on an independent footing, with clear powers and genuine muscle. Robust restrictions on party funding will be necessary to weaken the grip of big money on politics. New rules will also be required to break up media monopolies and provide critical journalists with better protections. As the guardians of the European Convention on Human Rights, which sets out where state authority should end and citizen power should begin, and which nations across Europe are obliged to uphold, the Council of Europe will seek to help Moldova carry out reforms that meet international standards and are deemed legitimate at home and abroad. Whatever their differing hopes for the country\u2019s future, both the European Union and the Russian Federation have an interest in the success of these efforts. Neither will benefit from a weak neighbor that brings with it financial black holes, organized crime, trafficking and uncontrolled migration. Despite years of disappointment, many Moldovans still hold great ambition for their country. They maintain that, freed from corruption, it can be transformed. But first, this captured state must be returned to its citizens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In California\u2019s Inland Empire, an Economic Recovery Brimming With Industrial Complexes", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetTypically defined as the region east of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, and encompassing San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, this area of industrial development has been on a long march to recovery since the 2008 financial crisis.Tens of millions of square feet of warehouse and logistics space have been built since 2011, and tens of millions more are on the way.By almost 10 million square feet, it had the most industrial space under construction in the second quarter of this year in the nation, according to CoStar, a commercial real estate market research company.Yet the region, which during the recession was a cautionary tale of overdevelopment and speculation, had the least amount of preleased space out of the top 20 markets in the first quarter of this year with 22.9 percent, and the second-least out of the top 10 in the second quarter with 32.5 percent, according to CoStar.But this time, few in the industry or the local government say they are concerned. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are busy, and major corporations are building warehouses, so-called fulfillment centers and logistics centers to accommodate the growth.In this industrial real estate market, the vacancy rate is about 3.7 percent in the western parts of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, and about 6 percent in the eastern part, both below the national average of 6.8 percent.According to CoStar, this means that close to 5 million square feet of unoccupied space was absorbed, whether by a tenant vacating or new construction. Real estate companies report figures of 7 million to 9 million square feet. One company, Cushman & Wakefield, cited 9.2 million square feet of net absorption, which it called an \u201call-time record for the market.\u201d\u201cAll our projects are experiencing a high level of interest,\u201d said Brandon Birtcher, the chief executive of Goodman Birtcher, a development and investment group. It recently leased 1.6 million square feet of space to the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., and has 4.5 million square feet under construction or recently completed in the region.Mr. Birtcher\u2019s confidence in the fundamentals of the market is typical of developers, local government officials, real estate agents and, actually, opposition figures.Still, the region has relatively inexpensive land, is close to both of the nation\u2019s busiest port complexes and within reach of more than 23 million consumers.With transportation costs projected to increase and technology helping to bring down the costs of both manufacturing and processing, corporations have begun moving their warehouses and logistics centers back toward areas with more people.\u201cThe huge population in Southern California drives a lot of growth, a lot of cargo remains here, so the Inland Empire is a major distribution hub,\u201d said Philip Lombardo, executive vice president and managing broker at the Inland Empire branch of Cushman & Wakefield. \u201cThe market is hitting on all its cylinders.\u201dThe rise in e-commerce and improved methods of distribution have spurred companies to build new, more efficient buildings.\u201cMost of these are not the old-style building with 30 to 60 employees,\u201d said Thomas Taylor, senior executive vice president at Colliers International.Companies \u201care customizing their orders with fairly large pick-and-pack sections that employ more people,\u201d he said. \u201cWarehouses are like the new manufacturing.\u201dAmong the corporations that recently moved into a fulfillment center warehouse in the area is Amazon, the giant online retailer.Increasing domestic and international trade has also increased shipments moving through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, both of which need more space to handle those orders.\u201cWe are expecting 5 to 6 percent annual growth through 2030,\u201d said Lee Peterson, a Port of Long Beach spokesman. Mr. Peterson said that the port was preparing to accommodate larger classes of container ships, and that trade levels were expected to at least double by 2030.\u201cWe are tied very closely with them,\u201d he said of the centers and warehouses based in the Inland Empire region. \u201cThe port is just one part of the supply chain. We are literally are connected and all the links have to be strong.\u201dJay Orr, the chief executive of Riverside County, the tenth-largest county in the United States, agrees.\u201cWe are a natural extension of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething like 40 percent of all goods flow through Inland Empire.\u201dCiting unemployment figures close to 6 percent, down from over 14 percent in 2010, Mr. Orr said his administration was trying to appeal to businesses and create jobs.He pointed to the county\u2019s early adoption of the EB-5 visa program, which has helped to encourage foreign investments and promote work force programs like job fairs and training.Transportation and warehouse jobs have increased more than 18 percent from 2012 to 2014 in San Bernardino County, compared with 4.4 percent nationally, according to numbers furnished by Mary Jane Olhasso, assistant executive officer for the county.But criticisms have long been leveled at the types of jobs that have been created.\u201cThere was a lot of hope that this development would help boost the regional economy, and certainly it has created a lot of jobs, but these jobs tend to be low-paying and are often temporary,\u201d said Ellen Reese, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Riverside and one of the authors of a recent study and policy brief on raising the minimum wage for local warehouse workers.Ms. Reese said that unemployment in the industry was as high as 28 percent, depending on the season. Still, she acknowledged the reality of the warehouse economy in the area, and advocates a remedy rather than a revolution.\u201cHow can we make these jobs better jobs? By moving them from temporary positions into direct hire positions, so these workers are working directly for the warehouses with higher wages and benefits,\u201d she said, arguing that higher wages would translate into an improved economy because of workers having more disposable income and paying more in taxes.Penny Newman, executive director of the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, and a lifelong resident of Riverside County, has faced an uphill battle in advocating environmental and political reform.\u201cWe seem to have a low esteem, and our leaders seem to take whatever is thrown at them,\u201d she said, in reference to land development deals.Ms. Newman raised concerns about the environment and residents\u2019 quality of life, which have tagged along with the region\u2019s transition to an industrial hub from an agrarian economy.\u201cWe are not just getting a little bit of pollution and impact, we are getting a lot, without receiving the benefits,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about replacing a warehouse with another building, it\u2019s about a bigger picture.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe have four major universities here, and grads won\u2019t stay in the area for warehouses.\u201dResidents and decision makers agree that the Inland Empire\u2019s economy must diversify to protect itself from kind of implosion that occurred in 2008.\u201cWe can\u2019t just be an economy of commuters and have home construction as driver of the economy,\u201d said Mr. Orr, who said that manufacturing, health care and opportunities created by supply chain optimization were possible areas for growth. \u201cIf we have to weather another recession, we will be stronger.\u201dBut with developers ever ready to dig, such pivots have been elusive, even as some projects purport to include elements of such diversification.Two examples of major planned developments include Goodman Birtcher\u2019s 2.4-million-square-foot mixed-use logistics facility, which will include a logistics center, a hospital and retail and office space. The World Logistics Center, proposed by the developer Iddo Benzeevi, is set to stretch more than 40 million square feet.\u201cEveryone is monitoring the economy to try to avoid having an oversupply,\u201d said Mr. Lombardo of Cushman & Wakefield. \u201cWe are just getting to where we were before the crisis now, and we don\u2019t feel we are in an overbuilding situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Comcast Invests by the Billion in Theme Parks, Hogwarts and All", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 The Universal theme park chain was the last thing Comcast was interested in when it bought NBCUniversal four years ago. Endless upkeep? Endless spending on new rides? Endless anxiety about public safety?Thanks, but no thanks. Some analysts predicted a speedy sale.Instead, Comcast did a public about-face, identifying Universal Orlando in particular as a growth engine and spending $100 million to build a \u201cTransformers\u201d ride here in 2013. Still, there was skepticism. Was Comcast becoming a new theme park force? Competitors insisted the jury was still out.Well, the verdict just came in: Comcast is pouring billions into Universal Orlando and a sister property in California, opening major attractions and resort hotels at breakneck speed \u2014 and visitors are flooding the gates as a result. Attendance increased 10.4 percent last year, with Universal parks generating 40.2 million turnstile clicks. For the first half of this year, NBCUniversal\u2019s theme park unit had operating cash flow of $617 million, a 49 percent increase from the same period a year ago.\u201cThat\u2019s just a huge, huge number for a business this size,\u201d Stephen B. Burke, NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive and senior executive vice president of Comcast, said in a July 23 conference call with analysts. \u201cWe see this as a major growth driver for the company for five, 10, 15, 20 years.\u201dBut now Comcast faces a new question: Is it moving too fast and disregarding the perennial problems that have long challenged this corner of entertainment?More hotel rooms are on the way \u2014 a lot more. Mr. Burke has said that Universal Orlando, which will have 5,200 rooms after Sapphire Falls opens next year, could have 10,000 rooms and still maintain profitable occupancy levels.Add in the billions Disney is spending to expand its own empire \u2014 the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort opens next year and megawatt \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d additions are coming to Disney outposts in Florida \u2014 and perhaps the biggest theme park building boom in history is underway, analysts say. It is a remarkable turnaround for a business that became a backwater in the years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when attendance dropped sharply.But with increased investment in theme parks comes increased risk. Theme parks will always be sensitive to swings in the economy. Another challenge involves managing visitor expectations; training them to expect something new every summer will eventually disappoint. Analysts point out that, despite an extraordinary safety record, these teeming resorts could become relative ghost towns overnight if a park anywhere in the world became a target of violence.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great business,\u201d said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cYou\u2019re always pouring money into them. It\u2019s relatively low return. And when you have a downturn in the economy, they typically get hit pretty hard.\u201dStill, theme parks, at least for the moment, are a reliable business. Last year, the Universal parks were significantly more profitable for NBCUniversal than movies or broadcast television. \u201cComcast\u2019s stock price is driven by growth, and the parks, while a small piece of Comcast over all, have become an outsized contributor to its growth,\u201d said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS.\u201cTechnology is changing so quickly it\u2019s hard to predict how many people 30 years from now will be watching linear television or movies with Oculus glasses, but I feel strongly that for decades to come families are going to want the experience of having fun together at one of our theme parks,\u201d Mr. Burke said in an interview.Universal expanded into Florida in 1979 with the purchase of 312 acres of \u201cpalmetto scrub and swamp,\u201d recalled Mr. Williams, who has worked for Universal and its various parent companies (MCA, Matsushita, Seagram, Vivendi, General Electric, Comcast) for more than 40 years. With an emphasis on thrill rides, Universal became a force among teenagers and young adults when it finally opened in 1990.But Universal\u2019s parks, suffering from underinvestment as owners came and went, \u201cwere in an attendance death spiral\u201d by 2000, according to Sam Gennawey, the author of \u201cUniversal vs. Disney: The Unofficial Guide to American Theme Parks\u2019 Greatest Rivalry.\u201d\u201cWe are user-friendly,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIf visitors notice what we\u2019re doing here and decide to spend a day or two less at a competing resort, hip hip hooray.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Eurotunnel Crisis", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEurope\u2019s failed policies on migration are claiming new victims. And this time, instead of drowning when rickety boats go down in the Mediterranean \u2014 nearly 2,000 people have drowned so far this year\u2014 migrants are dying on European soil. Since the beginning of June, 10 have died near Calais, France, trying to hitch a clandestine ride through the Eurotunnel to Britain, their dream destination. In the face of this determined desperation \u2014 and disruption of a transportation link for tourists and goods \u2014 Britain and France have reacted with undisguised hostility, in sharp contrast to more welcoming nations like Italy and Greece.Conflicts, despotism and failed economies in Africa and the Middle East have sent hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers to Europe. Roughly 100,000 refugees have set foot in Greece and nearly 80,000 in Italy so far this year. Italy is not a rich country and Greece is devastatingly poor. But their welcoming response shames leaders of wealthier nations, like Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, who warned darkly of \u201ca swarm\u201d of migrants in Calais poised to overrun his country, following a night when there were many attempts by small groups returning again and again over many hours to breach the Eurotunnel\u2019s entrance.It is no less shameful that France cannot deal more humanely with the refugees gathered at France\u2019s end of the tunnel. Calais has long been a jumping-off point for migrants seeking to reach Britain, yet some 3,000 of them \u2014 most from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Afghanistan and Syria \u2014 are gathered in a squalid camp on the outskirts of town with scant toilets and little food, subject to abuse by the police.Britain pledged this week to contribute 7 million pounds, or $11 million, to improve security at the French and British entrances to the tunnel. The French government has sent 120 additional police officers to Calais. France and Britain have also promised to repatriate migrants to Africa and to attack smuggling rings trafficking migrants to Europe.None of this addresses the humanitarian crisis. Until Britain, France and the rest of the European Union face up to their collective responsibility to deal humanely with migrants, accept migrants\u2019 natural desire to reunite with family members, and concede (finally) that no barrier will prevent desperate people from risking their lives to reach safety and opportunity, more migrants will die.Advertisement"}

Debate: Policy Is Not His Point", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe proposed a \u201cgreat wall\u201d to keep out illegal immigrants, but changed his mind when he visited the Mexican border.He donated $10,000 to re-elect Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, but in attacking Mr. Walker, blithely revealed that he had no idea of the governor\u2019s record when he made the contribution.That is because Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity \u2014 his support in some polls is double that of his closest competitors \u2014 is built on his unfettered style, rather than on his positions, which have proved highly fungible.He may be the first post-policy candidate.Yet many of Mr. Trump\u2019s positions have an improvisational air, shifting in their specifics as he seems to dream them up or reconsider them on the fly and out loud, in free-associative speeches or shoot-from-the-hip interviews.What some have called \u201cTrumpism\u201d is founded not on a specific agenda, like the bullet-point Contract With America in 1994 that led to the Republican takeover of the House. A look at the line-up for Thursday night\u2019s debate in Cleveland, the first of the Republican primary contest, which will be broadcast by Fox News, and how each candidate could gain with a strong performance.Rather, it is built on boiling grass-roots anger over the ineffectiveness and scripted talking points of conventional politicians on matters like illegal immigration and America\u2019s global power.\u201cEverybody in the establishment misunderstands the game he\u2019s playing,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the author of the Contract With America and onetime House speaker who was himself a Republican presidential candidate in 2012. \u201cHis opponents want to talk about policies. He\u2019s saying if you don\u2019t have a leader capable of cutting through the baloney, all this policy stuff is an excuse for inaction.\u201dAnticipating the debate on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI\u2019d rather just discuss the issues.\u201d But he added in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that he would respond in kind if targeted by a rival. \u201cIf I\u2019m attacked, I have to, you know, do something back, but I\u2019d like it to be very civil,\u201d he said.Waffling, flip-flopping and inconsistencies, all of which might hobble a conventional candidate, have not dimmed Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to his Republican supporters.He seemed to lose no ground as rivals and the news media pointed out the stark reversal in his ideology since he flirted with a presidential run in 1999. Back then, Mr. Trump supported abortion rights and a soak-the-rich tax on fortunes in excess of $10 million.When another presidential contender, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, called him \u201ca cancer on conservatism\u201d last month, pointing out Mr. Trump\u2019s previous advocacy for single-payer health care and his support of Hillary Rodham Clinton, it was Mr. Perry, castigated on social media, who paid a price.\u201cWhen are the media going to start asking for specific solutions to specific problems?\u201d Mr. Clovis asked in an interview. \u201cI put that on you guys.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s positions and history as a political changeling have begun to receive a vetting in the news media. Following up on his promise to replace the Affordable Care Act with \u201csomething terrific,\u201d Bloomberg Politics dug into the somewhat vague details he had cited and concluded that his plan \u201csounds quite a bit like Obamacare.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump dodged Fox News\u2019s Greta Van Susteren on his plan to defeat the Islamic State, pleading, \u201cI don\u2019t want the enemy to know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he told Anderson Cooper of CNN, who also pressed him about the issue, that he would \u201cbomb the hell\u201d out of Iraqi oil fields held by the Islamic group. CNN followed up with military analysts who called this an ineffective strategy.Still, as a post-policy candidate, Mr. Trump may be somewhat impervious to being pinned down, whether by the news media or by his rivals.Citing the danger that lurks for other Republicans in taking on Mr. Trump, a ferocious counterpuncher, some debate veterans speculated that his rivals would prefer to demur.\u201cMy impression is every one of them will go in with a line or two ready to go, if Trump seizes upon them and they can\u2019t ignore it without looking weak,\u201d said Dan Senor, who helped Paul Ryan prepare for his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re all hoping to not have to use it.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s seeming mutability is not limited to his own positions; in Iowa recently, he said he had not known much about Mr. Walker\u2019s record as governor before donating to his 2014 re-election. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing, but he was fighting, and I like a fighter. Does that make sense?\u201d Mr. Trump said.Perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s most consistent policy stance has been his opposition to trade deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that he blames for the loss of blue-collar jobs. His proposal of a 35 percent tax on goods from Mexico and higher tariffs on Chinese imports is a ratcheting up, rather than a reversal, of positions he took more than a decade ago. (Back then, as an independent espousing liberal views, he called for a one-time 14.25 percent tax on fortunes above $10 million.)His seizing on trade and immigration in this campaign has allowed Mr. Trump to tap into the economic anxieties of American workers who have lost out in the global economy, and to capitalize on nativist fears.Which makes attacking him on those issues, above all, a risky proposition in a Republican primary debate.\u201cThis is a guy who\u2019s saying some outrageous, but not inaccurate, things many people feel,\u201d Mr. Senor said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any candidate\u2019s best interest in trying to take him down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Greek Bailout, Same Old Woes", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy is in free-fall and politics are unstable. One crisis feeds the other. Just as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras appeared to accept that he had no alternative but to work with Greece\u2019s partners on a new bailout, hard-liners in his Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) declared that they wanted no compromise with creditors, and are now pushing to leave the euro.The figures are merciless and Mr. Tsipras\u2019s conversion, though radical, still appears halfhearted, a result of pressure. In an interview with state television, he explained his sudden decision, at a 17-hour European Union summit meeting, to ignore the referendum\u2019s overwhelming \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cUnder conditions of financial asphyxiation and blackmail, there were two alternatives on the table: agreement under these terms or a disorderly bankruptcy, an exit from the euro,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said. He and members of his government are openly opposed to many measures that they now must pass and implement.No one comes out clean. Each protagonist has pointed at the others\u2019 failures and then added to Greece\u2019s woes. The creditors\u2019 fixation on austerity, when it was clear that this in itself could not fix Greece, caused immense damage to the political center, the force that could lead Greece toward reform. Now those parties, discredited by their mismanagement of the country in the past, and for implementing unpopular reforms, must support a party that came to power by attacking them.Syriza\u2019s anti-austerity crusade, and its promise of alternative policies, found enthusiastic backing among a number of prominent international economists and political movements, who could not see that \u2014 at least until now \u2014 the new government\u2019s plan was little more than wishful thinking and a total aversion to any modernizing reforms. This places Syriza squarely in the populist political tradition that brought Greece to this sorry state. We must still wait for a true radical force to emerge, one that will aspire to make Greece an efficient state, a viable economy and a just society.Nikos Konstandaras is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Goldman Executive Is Chosen to Lead Dallas Fed", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas on Monday chose for its new president Robert Steven Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs executive.Mr. Kaplan will take office Sept. 8, in time to participate in a potentially important meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee the following week, when policy makers may decide to raise interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis.He will not vote, however. The presidents of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks vote on a rotating basis, and the Dallas Fed does not hold a vote until 2017.The selection of Mr. Kaplan will help to preserve a modicum of academic diversity among senior Fed officials, most of whom hold doctorates in economics. Mr. Kaplan, like Mr. Fisher before him, will become one of the rare exceptions.Mr. Kaplan worked for more than two decades at Goldman Sachs, rising to lead both its investment banking and investment management operations. Such deep Wall Street experience is unusual among Fed officials, and potentially valuable as the Fed aims to orchestrate a smooth return to more normal conditions.But a coalition of community activists criticized what it described as a secretive selection process. The group described the result as one Wall Street insider replacing another, noting that Mr. Kaplan came from Goldman Sachs while Mr. Fisher has taken a job at Barclays.Mr. Kaplan, the group also said, serves on the board of Heidrick & Struggles, a search firm that was hired to find the replacement for Mr. Fisher.\u201cNeither the process nor the result serves the public interest,\u201d Ady Barkan, director of the Center for Popular Democracy\u2019s Fed Up campaign, said in a statement. \u201cThe Fed should do much better.\u201dMr. Kaplan remains a senior director of Goldman Sachs, which the firm describes as an honorary title.In addition to serving on the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, Mr. Kaplan will oversee about 1,200 employees, including a staff of research economists in Dallas and satellite offices in Houston, El Paso and San Antonio. Reserve banks also help to operate the plumbing of the financial system, including currency distribution, and to regulate local banks, although that work is largely directed by officials in Washington.Mr. Kaplan is an unusual choice for the Dallas job because he has no ties to Texas, something the bank has prized in its choice of past presidents. Mr. Kaplan grew up in Kansas and has spent his adult life mostly in New York and Boston.An article on Tuesday about the choice of Robert Steven Kaplan, a former Goldman Sachs executive, as president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank misstated, in some copies, the name of the public interest group with which Ady Barkan, who commented on the selection process, was affiliated, and a correction in this space on Wednesday misstated Mr. Barkan\u2019s role there. It is the Center for Popular Democracy, not the Center for Public Democracy, and he is director of the center\u2019s Fed Up campaign, not of the center itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge Sharply for a Second Day on Wall Street", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock prices around the world continued to plunge on Friday, threatening to end one of the longest bull runs in the history of the United States stock market.A searing six-year rally in United States stocks had advanced into the summer months, shrugging off challenges like the dispute over Greece\u2019s debt that nearly led to the country crashing out of the euro. But in the last two weeks, world markets tumbled as investors grew increasingly concerned about economic conditions in China, which unexpectedly devalued its currency last week, and the outlook for the economies of other large developing countries.As the selling accelerated Friday afternoon, some benchmark indexes were at or near 10 percent below their recent peaks \u2014 a \u201ccorrection\u201d in Wall Street parlance. \u201cThis is likely going to go down as the first meaningful correction in four years,\u201d said David Rosenberg, an economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff.Sell-offs in the financial markets need not cause harm in the real economy. In many cases in the postwar period, the United States stock market has recovered after reacting negatively to problems overseas. Strong employment numbers and other economic indicators suggest that the United States economy remains resilient.Still, fear in financial markets can feed on itself. And the declines in the markets are coming not only as China struggles, but also as the Federal Reserve is winding down its huge stimulus efforts. Trillions of dollars of cheap money from the Fed has fueled economic growth and helped push markets higher around the world. Now, the question is whether the world can stay on the recovery path without the Fed\u2019s largess.Such concerns on Friday helped push stocks far below the peaks they reached just weeks ago when investors were ebullient. The Dow Jones industrial average is more than 10 percent below the high it reached in May. At Friday\u2019s close, the index was down 530.94 points, to 16,459.75, a loss of 3.1 percent on the day.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark, fell below the psychologically important 2,000 mark. It was down 3.2 percent on the day and more than 7 percent below its recent peak. It fell 64.84 points, to 1,970.89. The index lost $1.14 trillion in value this week, according to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.The Nasdaq, which contains a lot of technology stocks, fell 3.5 percent on Friday, a slide that takes the index nearly 10 percent below its latest high. It closed down 171.45 points, to 4,706.04.The price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, briefly fell below $40 a barrel. Later on Friday it was trading at $40.11, nearly 25 percent below its price at the start of the year. The decline in the price of oil and other commodities may indicate that there is less demand for such commodities because economies are slowing. The fall in oil reduces energy bills for consumers and companies, but it also hammers the profitability of the many oil and gas companies that have invested heavily during the recent shale boom.The Vix, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, spiked higher than the level it reached last fall, when global markets last sold off on concerns about global growth.Investors rushed into the relative safety of government bonds. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.05 percent on Friday, from 2.07 percent on Thursday.In the coming days, investors will have to decide whether the selling is part of summer squall that will soon pass \u2014 or the start of tougher times for the global economy that could weigh on stock markets for months.\u201cThere is a relatively more ominous slowdown going on in emerging markets \u2014 and that\u2019s what the trade is all about right now,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.Officials at the Fed will also have to weigh the seriousness of the turbulence in the markets as they decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years. Raising rates as early as next month, as some investors have expected will happen, could further unnerve investors, damp economic activity and speed the flow of dollars out of developing countries. As a result, the Fed may decide to wait until later in the year, or longer. The central bank may try to estimate the impact of a falling stock market on the wealth and spending habits of United States households. The six-year bull run, which began as the last bear market ended in 2009, has helped drive up households\u2019 holdings of stocks and mutual funds by over $10 trillion.Much, of course, depends on the strength of the Chinese economy \u2014 and an economic release on Friday could stoke further pessimism. Output in China\u2019s manufacturing industry contracted in the first three weeks of August at the fastest pace since the depths of the financial crisis, according to a preliminary reading of the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index. It came in at 47.1 points for August, compared with 47.8 points in July. The August figure was its lowest reading since March 2009 on a scale in which any figure below 50 indicates contraction.Since the devaluation, China has moved to keep the renminbi from depreciating further by selling dollars. This effectively takes money out of the financial system, so the central bank has been busy this week trying to add liquidity. On Wednesday, it announced 110 billion renminbi ($17 billion) in new six-month loans to 14 unnamed financial institutions.These measures have not been enough, as China\u2019s overnight money market rates have continued to inch upward. Many analysts now think the central bank must respond more aggressively.The main Shanghai index fell 4.3 percent, while the Shenzhen index closed 5.4 percent lower. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index declined 1.5 percent after having given up all its gains for the year this week. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo closed down 3 percent.European shares were also trading lower on Friday. Benchmark indexes in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Milan were all down about 3 percent, capping a week of declines.Positive survey data published on Friday was not enough to overcome investor doubts about whether the Continent could break out of its pattern of perennially sluggish growth, analysts said.A monthly survey of business sentiment by Markit, a research firm, signaled a modest pickup in eurozone growth. But the survey also pointed to nearly stagnant growth in France, the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany.Another headwind for United States stocks is that their valuations \u2014 or the yardsticks that investors use to determine whether a company is cheap or expensive \u2014 recently climbed to demandingly high levels. This can make stocks more vulnerable to declines when bad news occurs or fearfulness grows among investors.Companies are struggling to bolster their revenue, for instance. In the second quarter of this year, companies in the S.&P. 500 managed to post revenue growth of only under 1 percent \u2014 even after excluding energy companies, which have been hit hard by the decline in the price of oil. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very slow,\u201d Ms. Martin Adams said.Neil Gough and Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Optimistic About Inflation, Stanley Fischer Suggests That Fed Will Stick to Plan on Rates", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, said on Saturday that he saw \u201cgood reason\u201d to expect that inflation would rebound to a healthier pace as the American economy continued to grow.His remarks on Saturday were highly anticipated after days of turmoil in financial markets that raised questions about whether the Fed\u2019s plans had changed. Mr. Fischer, an important adviser to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, was also stepping into a void created by Ms. Yellen\u2019s decision not to attend this year\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting.As for inflation, the Fed has said repeatedly that it will act based not on observed inflation but instead on its expectations for future inflation. The Fed exerts gradual influence on economic conditions, so officials must set interest rates on the basis of their expectations about developments.Inflation by both measures has stayed below 2 percent for more than three years.These economists also see low inflation as evidence that the economy continues to operate below capacity, suggesting that the Fed can safely continue its stimulus campaign \u2014 and perhaps should be doing even more.Mr. Fischer said on Saturday that the impact of economic slack might be overstated, noting that conditions had undoubtedly improved but inflation had not rebounded.He pointed to evidence that the strength of the dollar was a major culprit. As the American economy grows and the rest of the world struggles, the dollar has gained value in comparison with foreign currencies. Americans are buying more cheap imports, holding down the cost of living, while American companies are struggling to sell exports, putting a damper on economic growth.These headwinds, Mr. Fischer said, were beginning to subside.\u201cGiven the apparent stability of inflation expectations, there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile some effects of the rise in the dollar may be spread over time, some of the effects on inflation are likely already starting to fade.\u201dEven so, Mr. Fischer declined to deliver an explicit verdict on September. \u201cI will not, and indeed cannot, tell you what decision the Fed will reach Sept. 17,\u201d he said, referring to the date of the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting.Mr. Fischer and other officials have said the Fed might delay an increase because of the turmoil in financial markets even if domestic economic conditions are ripe. Officials say they are not inclined to act in the face of volatility, in part because they see little practical difference between moving in September and waiting a little longer. The Fed is also scheduled to meet in October and December.Advertisement"}

But I take little comfort in watching China burning money and Russia burning food, because in today\u2019s interdependent world we\u2019re all affected.I also find no joy in it because we Americans, too, have started burning our most important source of competitive advantage \u2014 our pluralism. One of our two political parties has gone nuts and started following a pied piper of intolerance, named Donald Trump.First, we watched China\u2019s leadership burn money \u2014 trying to prop up a ridiculously overvalued stock market by buying falling stocks with government savings, and then seeing that market continue to collapse because the very fact that the government was intervening suggested no one knew what these stocks were worth.The economic management team in Beijing has seriously lost its way. But leaders do funky things when the ruling party\u2019s bargain with its people is \u201cwe get to rule and you get to get rich.\u201d Collapsing markets can quickly lead to collapsing legitimacy.Ask the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. He burned the eastern quarter of Ukraine to distract the Russian middle class from his economic mismanagement and illegitimacy.Putin decided that building his own Silicon Valley \u2014 the Skolkovo Innovation Center outside of Moscow \u2014 was too hard. So to build his legitimacy he chose nationalism and seized Crimea instead. Putin prefers to manufacture chips on his shoulder than microchips. When the Crimea annexation nationalist sugar high wore off, Putin started burning food imported from countries sanctioning Russia for seizing Crimea from Ukraine.My fear is that once Putin\u2019s food-burning nationalist sugar high wears off, he\u2019ll burn up another neighbor. Estonia, please beware.Alas, though, America has joined this assets bonfire. We\u2019re now in a world where all top-down authority structures are being challenged. It\u2019s most obvious in the Arab world where you have pluralistic countries that lack pluralism and so could be held together from the top-down only by an iron fist \u2014 and when that iron fist got removed they spun apart. America\u2019s greatest advantage is its pluralism: It can govern itself horizontally by its people of all colors and creeds forging social contracts to live together as equal citizens.It not only makes us more stable but also more innovative, because we can collaborate internally and externally with anyone anywhere, leveraging more brainpower. Who is the new C.E.O. of Google? Sundar Pichai. Who is the new C.E.O. of Microsoft? Satya Nadella. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s family did not come over on the Mayflower.But right now we\u2019re messing around with that incredible asset. Yes, we must control our borders; it is the essence of sovereignty. It has been a failure of both our political parties that the Mexican-American border has been so porous. So I am for a high wall, but with a very big gate \u2014 one that legally lets in energetic low-skilled workers and the high-I.Q. risk-takers who have made our economy the envy of the world \u2014 and for legislation that provides a pathway for the millions of illegal immigrants already here to gain legal status and eventually citizenship.In June 2013, the Senate, including 14 Republicans, passed a bill that would do all that. But the extremists in the G.O.P. House refused to follow, so the bill stalled.And now we have Trump shamelessly exploiting this issue even more. He\u2019s calling for an end to the 14th Amendment\u2019s birthright principle, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born here, and also for a government program to round up all 11 million illegal immigrants and send them home \u2014 an utterly lunatic idea that Trump dismisses as a mere \u201cmanagement\u201d problem. Like lemmings, many of the other G.O.P. presidential hopefuls just followed Trump over that cliff.This is not funny anymore. This is not entertaining. Donald Trump is not cute. His ugly nativism shamefully plays on people\u2019s fears and ignorance. It ignores bipartisan solutions already on the table, undermines the civic ideals that make our melting pot work in ways no European or Asian country can match (try to become a Japanese) and tampers with the very secret of our sauce \u2014 pluralism, that out of many we make one.Every era spews up a Joe McCarthy type who tries to thrive by dividing and frightening us, and today his name is Donald Trump.Advertisement"}

Mr. Li also noted that there would be no continued depreciation of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, after a sharp devaluation earlier this month. The currency \u201ccan maintain fundamental stability at a reasonable and balanced level,\u201d he said.Even so, the tumult has prompted further action by the leadership.In an aggressive two-part move on Tuesday, the central bank lowered the benchmark lending and deposit rates by 0.25 of a percentage point. It also cut the so-called reserve requirement ratio \u2014 the amount of cash that banks are required to hold in reserve \u2014 by 0.5 of a percentage point. It was China\u2019s fifth interest rate cut since November, and the fourth reduction of the reserve ratio since February. The central bank made a similar tandem cut to both rates in June, when the stock market first began to fall from its peak, but that reduction of the reserve ratio did not apply to the biggest banks.\u201cCurrently, there are persisting downward pressures on the country\u2019s economic growth,\u201d the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said in an explanation that accompanied the announcement Tuesday evening. \u201cThere has also been quite large volatility in global capital markets recently, and monetary policy tools need to be applied more flexibly.\u201dThe central bank also made a step toward interest rate liberalization by removing the upper limit on interest rates for fixed-term deposits of more than one year. With inflation in China generally low, the bank said the time was ripe for such steps. \u201cThis marks another important step forward in interest rate marketization reforms for our country,\u201d it said.At the same time, China has been struggling with deflation, or falling prices, in its industrial sector for more than three years. Injecting more funds by freeing banks to lend more should help soften the blow of deflation and stem capital outflows.Li-Gang Liu, the chief China economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, estimated that the reserve ratio cut would immediately insert about 650 billion renminbi, or about $100 billion, into the banking system.The cut \u201cwill spur bank lending and lower firms\u2019 funding costs,\u201d he wrote in a research note on Tuesday after the central bank\u2019s announcement. But Mr. Liu doubted these latest measures alone would be enough to meet the government\u2019s economic growth target of about 7 percent this year. He continued, \u201cFurther monetary policy easing by the People\u2019s Bank of China is still in the cards.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racially Disparate Views of New Orleans\u2019s Recovery After Hurricane Katrina", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly four out of five white residents believe the city has mostly recovered, while nearly three out of five blacks say it has not, a division sustained over a variety of issues including the local economy, the state of schools and the quality of life.The survey, which was conducted by the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University, was released on Monday. The hurricane and the failure of the New Orleans levees on Aug. 29, 2005, caused more than 1,800 deaths across the coast and damaged or destroyed more than a million houses and businesses.Former President George W. Bush, who has expressed regret about some facets of his administration\u2019s handling of the disaster, is planning to visit both New Orleans and the Mississippi coast this week, while former President Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend New Orleans\u2019s main event on Saturday \u2014 a public commemoration with music, prayer and remembrances by civic and community leaders.Mr. Obama and many local leaders will be celebrating the accomplishments since the storm, the extraordinary grit of Gulf Coast residents and the efforts to rebuild what was destroyed as something much better.While a plurality of New Orleans residents rate the quality of life as about the same as before Katrina, the L.S.U. survey reports, more than one-third of blacks say it has gotten worse. The percentage of whites who believe their quality of life has improved, at 41 percent, is more than double the percentage of blacks who say the same thing.\u201cLook, there are some gains, there are real gains,\u201d said Andre M. Perry, 44, an education consultant who came to the city after Katrina. \u201cBut this 10th anniversary in so many ways is dangerous. I think a lot of people are saying, \u2018Look at what we\u2019ve done,\u2019 as if the work is finished, and we\u2019re nowhere near finished.\u201dTen years after Hurricane Katrina, a survey by Louisiana State University found a stark divide among black and white residents over various issues.Black residents, and in particular black women, report a harder time returning and rebuilding their lives after the storm. This is in part because of a couple of hard facts: African-Americans were far more likely to have lived in a flooded part of the city, and places that were worse-hit by the flooding, such as the Lower Ninth Ward, have taken much longer to recover.That the extent of the flooding is directly connected to the perception of recovery is also reflected outside New Orleans. The survey shows that people in neighboring Plaquemines and St. Bernard Parishes, both of which were predominantly white and were catastrophically flooded, have even dimmer views of the extent of recovery than the residents of New Orleans.The poll of 2,195 respondents, both in New Orleans and elsewhere in south Louisiana, was conducted via telephone interviews from July 7 to Aug. 10. The margin of sampling error within the city was plus or minus five percentage points.The differing views about the state of the city may also reflect a change in the city\u2019s makeup. Any comparison of New Orleans\u2019s population before and after Katrina is complicated, in part because the population was not stable in 2005 but, according to some examinations, on a steady downward trajectory.But comparisons are also made difficult because many of those here in the city now are not those who left. The L.S.U. survey found that more than a quarter of the city\u2019s current residents had moved here since Katrina. Those who did so were wealthier and more likely to be white and college educated than those who lived here before 2005.An article on Tuesday about the stark racial divide in how New Orleans residents view the city\u2019s recovery since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 misstated the day of President Obama\u2019s planned visit to New Orleans. It is Thursday, not today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Problem With House Prices", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn the housing bubble, prices rose beyond all reason. In the bust, they fell even more than they had risen. For a long time since then, they recovered in fits and starts.Recently, however \u2014 as is fitting in a saner real estate market \u2014 house prices have been rising in line with personal income and other economic fundamentals in local areas. But a return to a more stable growth pattern does not mean that housing will once again become the economic engine it was in the decades before the bubble.One reason is that millions of homeowners still owe hundreds of billions of dollars more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. Those borrowers tend to live in areas that were hard hit in the bust and still have weak economies, a mix that makes it nearly impossible to outgrow earlier losses. Their plight hurts the broader economy, because underwater homeowners are less likely to spend, relocate or build wealth.Another reason that housing cannot propel the economy the way it once did is the growing inequality in incomes. That home prices are increasing in tandem with income is a sign of stability. But only investment income has been rising steadily in the recovery, while wages from work have stagnated. One result is that buying a home is still out of reach for many working people, particularly those who would have been first-time buyers in a healthier economy. Another result is that builders have largely focused on higher-end homes, leading to a low inventory of new starter homes.The situation is evidence of the unrepaired damage from the bust. Aggressive intervention to provide debt relief and create good jobs is still needed, but has not been forthcoming. It is not too late for remedial steps, if only the political consensus to take them could be found.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuban Youth See New U.S. Embassy, but Same Old Drab Life", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosHAVANA \u2014 Wedged between a construction site and the shells of once grand colonial homes, a basketball game was underway, the neighborhood pouring into the rubble-strewn street for some evening entertainment.It wasn\u2019t much. A chewed concrete floor, a splintered backboard and a piece of bent rebar for a hoop. But as entertainment went, the price was right: No one paid a thing to enjoy the seaside air, the sunset or the game as they soaked up a snapshot of life seemingly preserved in time.And that, to many in attendance, was precisely the problem.While the news media was buzzing about the new American Embassy, which had reopened for the first time in more than 50 years, barely a word passed among the Cuban youth about the many changes afoot in their nation.\u201cChange? My life won\u2019t change,\u201d said Yunior Rodriguez Soto, 17, posted by the court with a few friends. \u201cI mean, look how we\u2019re living, look how we are playing?\u201d he said, pointing at the goal, which had been knocked askew.He paused. The ball zipped out of bounds and a friend raced to retrieve it. Change, in his mind, would come in spite of the government, not because of it.\u201cThey won\u2019t let it happen,\u201d he said, referring to the Cuban government. \u201cIt\u2019s just how they are.\u201dAs much as the young welcome political opening and economic reform, such changes are unlikely to filter down to their lives anytime soon. Measurable change will come slowly, stalled between the leadership\u2019s desire for prosperity and its determination to maintain control.Even with evidence of change in the streets of Havana \u2014 new clubs, bars and glimmering restaurants that rival those of more affluent Caribbean neighbors \u2014 life for many Cubans has barely improved. And that may well inform the Cuban authorities\u2019 biggest challenge in coming years: managing expectations.\u201cSo far, the only way to see change is to make a boat and sail off,\u201d said Day\u00e1n Roa Santana, 20, a Cuban baseball player, who did just that in late December.On Dec. 30, about two weeks after the government announced that it would restore diplomatic relations with the United States, Mr. Roa Santana set sail for America on a rickety boat he built with a friend. After a few days at sea, he was captured by the United States Coast Guard and sent back home, where he was forced to pay a heavy fine.As soon as he can save up money for the next journey, he says, he will be gone.Cases like Mr. Roa Santana\u2019s are not new, and officials are well aware they aggravate a demographic problem already undermining an economic overhaul. Unlike many developing nations, which enjoy large youth populations, Cuba resembles the graying communities of Northern Europe or Japan, societies grappling with how to finance their old people without the engine of youth. Nearly 20 percent of the Cuban population is over the age of 60, making it the oldest in all of Latin America.Officials and analysts say that economic change is part of a strategy to persuade young people to stay and have families, replacing a swollen public sector with more private jobs \u2014 a promise that has been slow to take shape.The government has for years tried to encourage more private sector development. Restaurants, nail salons and about 200 other approved businesses now employ nearly 400,000 people, according to government figures. Real estate reform has been enacted, and the tourism sector is booming, though without the infrastructure to support it.But the government, struggling to balance economic growth with state control, often works at cross purposes. Small-business owners are subjected to a byzantine structure with heavy government oversight, where free enterprise is often stifled by a state struggling with letting go.Such realities are particularly galling for the newer generation of Cubans, like Jose Luis Rodriguez Roig, 24, who owns a private cafeteria with his father that sells pizzas, burgers and coffee.To buy flour, Mr. Rodriguez Roig says, the government prices are often too high to turn a profit. So he, like other Cubans, turns to the black market, a move that could land him in trouble.\u201cThere are tricks here and there, but the law isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d he explained, at a late-night party on the rooftop of a friend\u2019s home in Havana.A friend disagreed, arguing that the government was in the midst of changing, prompting a conversation taking place across the country now.\u201cHow can you not see?\u201d his friend, Alejandro Rodriguez Zaldivar, 30, who was hosting the party in his aunt\u2019s home, insisted. \u201cThere\u2019s an embassy and people are starting to think different. My grandfather\u2019s generation was revolutionary. My father\u2019s generation was less. This is the direction things are going.\u201dMr. Rodriguez Roig shook his head and pulled on a cigarette.\u201cYou asked me what change do I see? Nothing,\u201d he concluded, drawing his arm over the roofs of the low-slung houses toward the waterfront. \u201cJust because there\u2019s an embassy over there, it doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201dAfter 50 years of stasis, there is a desire among Cubans to see the fruits of this new era right away. And yet the government has said the pace of change will be slow.\u201cThe reason it has taken so long is that the government only now finds it in their interest,\u201d said Yusbel Hernandez Campanioni, who was visiting the beach of Guanabo on a recent weekday. \u201cIf it was up to the Cuban people, it would have happened a long time ago.\u201dDuring the summer, youth often flock to the beaches near Havana, like Playa Santa Maria, near Guanabo, which is about a 25-minute drive from the capital. Public transit there and back is less than 5 cents, an affordable outing for Cubans with little disposable income.On a recent weekday, thousands of Cubans idled along the slender white sand strip, a coast of cerulean water. Arrayed in the sand, Mr. Campanioni and Yohendy Rodriguez Curreta sipped rum from the bottom half of a split beer can.Many summer days are spent like this, though the pair lucked out when Mr. Curreta\u2019s cousin visiting from Mexico pitched them a free bottle of liquor.\u201cOtherwise, we would just be laying here,\u201d said Mr. Curreta, 21, who works as a janitor at a cultural center for about $10 a month.For Mr. Curreta, salary was an issue. It was hard to afford the basics on his income, he said, no matter how hard he worked.\u201cHere you consume based on what you can afford,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is what we can afford.\u201d\u201cEveryone speaks revolutionary, but we live day to day,\u201d interjected Mr. Campanioni. \u201cWe think about what we are going to do today, and tomorrow we will think about the next day.\u201dAnd yet Cuba is a different place from even a decade ago, with a budding set of high-end paladars, or private restaurants, where prices can rival more opulent tourist destinations in the Caribbean.More well-off teenagers have an array of options to choose from, including La F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a former peanut-oil factory that bears all the hallmarks of Brooklyn chic: exposed brick, industrial accents, even an old smokestack looming over the neighboring building.The newly opened venue, a venture between a prominent Cuban musician and the state, is an example of what the government is aiming for, whether the youth realize it or not.On a recent night, thousands of young people from 12 to 18 years old gathered outside the building, awaiting entrance to a party.\u201cWe don\u2019t really think about politics,\u201d said Amalia Sanchez, 17, standing with a throng of friends. \u201cWe just want to have fun.\u201dHannah Berkeley Cohen contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suez Canal Upgrade May Not Ease Egypt\u2019s Economic Journey", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a pageant of soaring jets and singing schoolgirls that lasted hours, Mr. Sisi on Thursday inaugurated what he called \u201cthe new Suez Canal\u201d and portrayed it as the cornerstone of his plans for an economic turnaround.\u201cEgyptians needed to confirm to themselves and the world that they still can,\u201d Mr. Sisi declared to an audience of dignitaries assembled near the Suez Canal city of Ismailia for the opening. He called it \u201can additional artery of prosperity for the world.\u201d On Friday, every imam in Egypt is expected to preach about its benefits and cite the example of a trench dug by the Prophet Muhammad that led to a battlefield victory, according to instructions from the religious authorities.The \u201cnew canal,\u201d however, is in reality a parallel side channel running about one-third the length of the existing waterway. And Mr. Sisi\u2019s promises about its rewards, economists and businessmen say, will depend on the resolution of the same problems holding back the rest of Egypt\u2019s economy, including poor government and a lack of transparency, dependability and public security. The hype about the canal, some analysts say, does little to ease the doubts of investors.The real advantage of the new channel is that it is expected to lower the average transit time for ships, possibly by several hours.But Mr. Sisi\u2019s government has told Egyptians that the canal\u2019s expansion aims to add $100 million a year to the economy and create a million jobs, and \u201cthose numbers are just totally impossible,\u201d said Reem Abdel Halim, an Egyptian economist.The president set a one-year deadline for digging the new channel, greatly increasing the cost, which came in at more than $8 billion, according to Egyptian officials. But the rush provided only symbolism and no tangible payoff, economists said.The existing canal is operating well below maximum capacity, in part because shipping volumes remain below their peak eight years ago. Transport volumes are sagging again this year because of the economic downturn in China and reduced Western demand for Persian Gulf oil.\u201cThree years would have been just as sound,\u201d said Ragui Assaad, a fellow at the Economic Research Forum here and a professor at the University of Minnesota.The ups and downs make any projections of future canal tolls highly speculative at best, said Peter Hinchliffe, the secretary general of the International Shipping Federation. His organization estimates that the total shipping volume will grow by more than 30 percent over 10 years, but Mr. Sisi\u2019s government projects that the added channel will more than double the canal\u2019s toll revenue by 2023, to $13.2 billion a year from about $5.3 billion.Mr. Hinchliffe recalled an old saying: \u201cPredictions are great, until you start talking about the future.\u201dThe new side channel to open on Thursday adds 30 miles in an attempt to allow two-way traffic for more of the passage. Although the new channel will not yet allow two-way traffic for the full length of the canal, it will expedite passage by allowing longer or more frequent convoys to pass. That can help attract traffic.For shipping companies deciding between the Suez Canal and other routes, \u201cit is all about time, and \u2018how much time can I save?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Willy C. Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School who studies manufacturing and transportation.The creation of jobs, however, will depend on attracting investors to build factories or logistics facilities in planned industrial zones around the canal. And experts said there was little reason to think that shorter transit time would attract investors put off by the other challenges of doing business in Egypt.\u201cSure, Egypt needs that kind of infrastructure to produce jobs, but, oh man, have they got a long way to go,\u201d Professor Shih said.Militant attacks in Cairo and North Sinai have scared away investors, economists said, and Mr. Sisi appears to be forgoing economic changes for short-term political stability.His government spent billions of dollars in aid from Persian Gulf monarchies to improve Egypt\u2019s energy infrastructure and avoid recurring blackouts. But economists and business groups say the government has deprived industries of power to placate consumers.While blackouts have all but ceased for homes in Cairo, \u201cthe improvement in homes this year came partly at the expense of factories,\u201d said Mohamed Hanafy, the executive director of the metal industries section of Egypt\u2019s quasi-governmental industrial federation. \u201cThe halts and interruptions for factories have increased compared to last year.\u201dMr. Sisi last year began cutting Egypt\u2019s unaffordable food and energy subsidies. But complementary plans to raise taxes stalled in the face of opposition from the business elite.At an investment conference in March, Mr. Sisi announced with great fanfare that an Emirati developer would build a modern metropolis near Cairo. But a tentative agreement with the builder quickly fell apart and the financing has grown uncertain.Some Egyptians have described the capital city and canal projects with a term borrowed from a popular comedy film: \u201cFankoosh,\u201d a nonexistent product hyped by a marketing wizard. In the film, he fills the demand he has created by selling narcotic-laced candies.\u201cNo. 1, and the most important thing, is that it\u2019s not Fankoosh,\u201d Ashraf Salman, the minister of investment, said in a recent television interview during which he was pressed about whether the capital city plan was similar hokum.\u201cIt\u2019s a project that the government has launched,\u201d Mr. Salman said. \u201cAs such, it\u2019s a target.\u201dMayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Finance Ministers Approve Greek Bailout", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Eurozone finance ministers on Friday backed a Greek bailout plan approved earlier in the day by lawmakers in Athens, overcoming months of bitterness.The finance ministers ended lengthy talks in Brussels after finessing the final elements of the deal, which grants Greece as much as 86 billion euros, or about $95 billion, during the next three years.The sticking points had included the role of the International Monetary Fund and the possibility of reducing Greece\u2019s debt-repayment burden and the process for recapitalizing the country\u2019s banks.\u201cThe past six months have been difficult,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the European Union executive body that helped broker the deal, said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we have looked into the abyss. But today, I am glad to say that all sides have respected their commitments.\u201dIn a statement, the managing director of the I.M.F., Christine Lagarde, said the agreement in Brussels \u201creverses much of the policy backtracking that caused the previous program to run seriously off track.\u201dBut Ms. Lagarde said the fund was not yet in a position to lend more money to Greece. She called on Greece\u2019s European partners to \u201cmake concrete commitments\u201d during a coming review of whether Greece was sticking to its promises and targets \u201cto provide significant debt relief, well beyond what has been considered so far.\u201d Only then would the fund\u2019s executive board \u201cconsider further financial support for Greece,\u201d she said.The I.M.F. was not directly represented at the meeting in Brussels on Friday but took part by conference call, eurozone officials said.The agreement will allow a first disbursement of \u20ac13 billion from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund, to Greece on Thursday, said Klaus Regling, the fund\u2019s managing director.That will allow Greece to repay \u20ac3.2 billion to the European Central Bank by Thursday to avoid a debt default.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.More important, the decision also offers the country a longer-term approach to financing its staggering debt, which now exceeds \u20ac315 billion.Among the elements decided during the talks on Friday was to accelerate the establishment of a fund to manage the proceeds from the privatization of Greek state assets, and rules by which Greek banks should be recapitalized. While losses would be forced on some creditors of Greek banks, there would be no losses for any depositors, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the European finance ministers, known collectively as the Eurogroup.At a news conference here Friday night, Mr. Dijsselbloem acknowledged that the I.M.F. was not yet ready to contribute financially but said it was \u201cvery important that the I.M.F. comes back on board, so to speak.\u201dMr. Dijsselbloem said the financial participation of the fund would be decided only in October. But he sought to emphasize that eurozone lenders understood the resistance by the I.M.F., and that the Eurogroup would do more to take its concerns into account.\u201cWe should look at debt service as a principle\u201d and ask whether \u201cin economic terms Greece can \u2014 over the next, let\u2019s say, 30 years \u2014 service its debt,\u201d Mr. Dijsselbloem said. The eurogroup \u201ctook a step forward by having an agreement on the method,\u201d he said.A key question was whether Germany has enough confidence that Greece will stick to the terms of the three-year package and that the I.M.F. will commit its own finances to that plan.The German Parliament and some others among eurozone countries still need to vote on whether to approve the plan.Germany is the biggest lender to Athens among the 19 eurozone countries, and German taxpayers are wary of channeling new money to Greece, which has already received two bailouts worth more than \u20ac240 billion since 2010.Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission who is in charge of the euro, said at the news conference Friday that national approvals should be completed by Wednesday, allowing Athens to make the payment due the next day.In recent weeks, Mr. Tsipras agreed to measures he had long resisted, including tax increases and cuts in government spending.The accord requires Greece to impose strict spending limits, enact new tax increases and carry out sweeping changes in the way it manages its economy.Even with those details in place, the European Commission has been fighting the perception that \u2014 along with the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. \u2014 it rushed the bailout plan for Greece this week.Critics in Germany also say that the deal does not do enough to guarantee the transformation of the Greek economy or to ensure that money from the privatization of Greek state-owned assets like ports and airports is used primarily to pay down the country\u2019s debt.\u201cGermany isn\u2019t the only country that is still asking questions at the moment,\u201d Jens Spahn, the German deputy finance minister, said on Thursday on German radio.Another concern for countries like Germany is that Mr. Tsipras might not be in power long enough to put the terms of the deal he negotiated in place if there are early elections in a political atmosphere where sentiment against diktats from the rest of the eurozone remains strong.Mr. Regling, the head of the bailout fund, said he expected the amount the eurozone would eventually pay out to Greece in the three-year accord would be less than the full \u20ac86 billion. That sum, he said, would be offset by an eventual contribution by the I.M.F. and by receipts from privatizations of Greek state assets.Over all, the loans \u201cwill allow Greece to service its debt, to repair its banks, to clear accumulated arrears, and to build cash buffers for the future,\u201d Mr. Regling said. \u201cThis is critical to keep the economy working while giving time for Greece to restart reforming its economy and improving its administration.\u201dEven with a bailout, the Greek economy is still expected to shrink 2.3 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2016. The dire economic conditions could provoke another political backlash against austerity in a country already reeling from years of recession and high unemployment.And whether any of the debt relief measures will be sufficient to help Greece return to prosperity and pay back its vast loans is an open question for many European lawmakers.\u201cWithout any commitment to debt forgiveness or restructuring, there will be no meaningful solution to the Greek crisis,\u201d Sven Giegold, a German lawmaker who is the economy spokesman for the Green group at the European Parliament, said on Thursday. \u201cThis is what finance ministers should be prioritizing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Horror Story Points to Need for Precautions", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyEarly in the evening of July 4, Micaela Giles\u2019s mobile phone started sounding alerts, and a series of messages straight out of a horror movie began scrolling down her screen.When she called Airbnb, its employees would not give her the address and would not call the police. Instead, they gave her a number for the Madrid police and told her to ask the police to call the company for the address. But the number led to a recording in Spanish that kept disconnecting her, she said, and when she repeatedly called back her Airbnb contact, the calls went straight to voice mail.His host, who was born male but is living as a woman, denied Mr. Lopez\u2019s accusations. She denied threatening him and said that the sex act was consensual and that he is transphobic. If she is right, filing a false police report and telling the story publicly would be an unlikely way to bury a regrettable experience.Airbnb, Uber and their ilk have managed to get people to refer to them as pioneers of something called the sharing economy, a neat trick given that they are in the business of renting out rooms and charging for rides.Still, logic and decency would suggest that when you\u2019re in danger, as Mr. Lopez claimed to be, Airbnb would come to your rescue. And in the wake of this episode, Airbnb said on Friday that it was clarifying its policies to make sure that its employees know to always call the police when someone reports an emergency in progress.Mr. Lopez found himself in Madrid in the first place because he had such a great experience with Brazilian Airbnb hosts in 2014. His Madrid host told him to meet her at a subway exit near her residence.When they arrived at her apartment and she locked them in, he said, she repeatedly tried to kiss him. He rebuffed her, and then she ordered him to take off his pants unless he wanted to sleep in the streets without his belongings, he said. As these events unfolded, he began messaging his mother, though by the time his mother realized that Airbnb would not give her his address and that she had to get it from him, he said, his host had cut off Internet access.His host, meanwhile, began rattling around in the kitchen drawers, and Mr. Lopez said he feared that she had a weapon and concluded that the choice to leave was not a real one. After the sexual assault, it was not clear whether she would let him go, he said, and he began looking around for something that he could use to hurt her so that he could escape.\u201cI was telling myself that I was going to have to kill her or she was going to kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cThoughts that should never have to go through anyone\u2019s mind started to come into mine. How are you going to live with yourself the rest of your life knowing that you killed someone? But if you don\u2019t, then you won\u2019t have a life.\u201dHe chose not to try to fight his way out and eventually concocted a story about plans he\u2019d made to meet friends nearby. Those friends knew where he was staying, he told his host, and they would come for him or call the police if he did not meet them. This scared her enough that she let him leave with his belongings.Mr. Lopez\u2019s description of the episode, which he gave to me in a three-hour interview at his family\u2019s home, matches the one he gave in his police report. The Madrid police would not comment on the investigation, though his host said that they had already visited her and that she expected to be exonerated.According to Airbnb, this was a unique situation on a weekend when 800,000 people were staying worldwide with an Airbnb host. A number of the company\u2019s safety procedures came into conflict. On one hand, Airbnb wants sexual assault victims to be able to decide for themselves when, how or if to report a crime. On the other, the company wants to report crimes in progress when customers are in danger and will turn over information quickly if the police request it.In this instance, Airbnb\u2019s employees believed that the assault had already taken place, according to Nick Papas, a company spokesman. Ms. Giles said she warned of an imminent assault when she first called but later, after hearing from her son, told the company that it had already happened.\u201cWe realize we can learn a lot from this incident and we can do better,\u201d Mr. Papas said by email. \u201cWe are clarifying our policies so that our team will always contact law enforcement if we are made aware of an emergency situation in progress. Safety is our No. 1 priority, and we want to get our hosts and guests as much help as possible.\u201dA spokesman for HomeAway, another short-term rental company, declined to comment about its policies in such situations.Mr. Lopez\u2019s family had a few suggestions for other Airbnb travelers. The guest and a family member or friend should always have the host\u2019s address easily accessible. Make sure your phone has international service and that you know how to call the local emergency number; Mr. Lopez did not realize his phone would allow him to call and said he would have been scared to speak out loud into the phone in any event. Also, a few details on his host\u2019s profile did not match her Facebook page. In retrospect, he wishes he had been more suspicious, even though he said that she had good reviews on Airbnb. The listing has been removed.The company\u2019s clarification of its policy, meanwhile, should help, too. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of Jacob\u2019s courage,\u201d his mother said. \u201cAnd as a family we\u2019re thrilled about the change.\u201dRaphael Minder, Eduardo Porter and Julia Preston contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Henry Holland, Who Computerized Evolution, Dies at 86", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Henry Holland, a computer scientist whose seminal work on genetic algorithms, or computer codes that mimic sexually reproducing organisms, proved crucial in the study of complex adaptive systems, a field he helped create, died on Aug. 9 at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 86.The cause was cancer, his daughter Gretchen Sleamon said.While a graduate student at the University of Michigan in 1953, Dr. Holland, wandering through the school\u2019s mathematics library, chanced upon \u201cThe Genetical Theory of Natural Selection,\u201d a 1929 book by the English statistician and evolutionary biologist R. A. Fisher. In one arresting example, Mr. Fisher described the seemingly random fluttering of a colony of butterflies as a dynamic information network that could be mapped mathematically.He began thinking about using computers to analyze complex adaptive systems: continually evolving aggregates that emerge through the spontaneous interaction of myriad agents and develop multiple organizational levels. Examples include the human brain, ant colonies, economies and tropical rain forests. One of his most innovative ideas was to develop computer codes, which he called genetic algorithms, that mimicked evolutionary processes by mating and mutating possible solutions; they in turn generated new solutions leading to an optimal result \u2014 a computer version of the survival of the fittest.In 1975 Dr. Holland presented his ideas in \u201cAdaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems,\u201d one of the most frequently cited works in the fields of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computing, with implications for fields as varied as psychology, neuroscience, economics and linguistics. It led to the widespread acceptance of genetic algorithms as an optimization and search method in computer science beginning in the 1980s. John Henry Holland was born on Feb. 2, 1929, in Fort Wayne, Ind., and grew up in several small Ohio towns where his father, Gustave, set up soybean-processing mills. His mother, the former Mildred Gfroerer, often worked as his accountant. After graduating from high school in Van Wert, Ohio, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked on the first real-time computer, Whirlwind, and earned a physics degree in 1950.For the next year and a half, he worked at IBM\u2019s main research laboratory in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., on the company\u2019s first commercial computer, the 701, called the Defense Calculator. As a way of testing the computer, he and his team leader, Nathaniel Rochester, devised a program to simulate Hebb\u2019s theory of cell assemblies, which seeks to explain the way neurons in the brain self-organize during the learning process. Such neural-network simulations later became standard in artificial intelligence research.At the same time, one of his colleagues, the electrical engineer Arthur Samuel, taught the computer to play checkers. Samuel showed that a computer program could be self-improvable. With time, the 701 adapted its tactics to the other player\u2019s moves, becoming a better player. The lesson was not lost on Dr. Holland. After earning a master\u2019s degree in mathematics at the University of Michigan, he did doctoral work in the school\u2019s new department of communication sciences and in 1959 received its first Ph.D. in what would later be called computer science. His dissertation, \u201cCycles in Logical Nets,\u201d described the changes caused when feedback was introduced into logical networks.In addition to his daughter Gretchen, Dr. Holland is survived by his other daughters, Alison Butler and Manja Holland; his sister, Shirley Ringgenberg; and four grandchildren. His two marriages ended in divorce.He explored the nature of complex systems in the books \u201cHidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity\u201d (1995) and \u201cEmergence: From Chaos to Order\u201d (1998). In his 80s, he published \u201cSignals and Boundaries: Building Blocks for Complex Adaptive Systems\u201d (2012) and \u201cComplexity: A Very Short Introduction\u201d (2014). In 1992 he was named a MacArthur Fellow. Dr. Holland often said that he picked up some of his best ideas by talking to people outside his field \u2014 linguists, musicians and poets. \u201cMy own idiosyncratic view is that the reason many scientists burn out early is that they dig very deep in one area and then they\u2019ve gone as far as it\u2019s humanly possible at that time and then can\u2019t easily cross over into other areas,\u201d he said in a 2006 interview. \u201cI think at the heart of most creative science are well-thought-out metaphors, and cross-disciplinary work is a rich source of metaphor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s now very difficult for Germany to pretend that the euro is a common currency rather than a straitjacket for any euro member whose economy falters, including Germany\u2019s. The way Germany handled the crisis also reveals that eurozone membership isn\u2019t permanent. No one will ever see the euro in the same way again.Germany\u2019s actions expose the limits on integration in the European Union: No greater fiscal and monetary powers will be given to the eurozone and the Union as a whole.

The opposite is true. Greece\u2019s problem is not a lack of fiscal spending, but its lack of a framework for a competitive market economy. Germany insists that the third bailout be used to drive structural reforms in Greece. It would be absurd to argue that this insistence undermines the Franco-German partnership. First, Greece is not important enough for either country to risk a rupture with its most important partner. Second, it is exactly the disagreements between Berlin and Paris \u2014 and the workable compromises that have invariably emerged \u2014 that have driven European integration forward.The writer\u2019s claim that Germany has stopped compromising is simply wrong. Germans would have liked to insist on the no-bailout clause in the European Union treaty. Result? Today the German government\u2019s direct exposure to Greece is \u20ac90 billion, or more than \u20ac2,200 for every German household.Germany and France will now redirect their focus from Greece toward building more solid institutions for the euro.

As an Irish citizen and an economist, I can tell you it didn\u2019t. Mr. Sinn says the bubble burst in 2006; it was 2007. Mr. Sinn says no fiscal rescue was available; there was, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Irish debt relative to G.D.P. went from about 35 percent in 2006 to about 124 percent in 2013.Mr. Sinn also says Irish wages fell drastically. Not so. According to Ireland\u2019s Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey, private sector wages fell by about 4 percent, while public sector wages fell by about 3 percent during the crisis. Not nothing, but hardly a drop justifying the term \u201cdrastic.\u201dWhat actually happened was employers reduced their wage bills by reducing employment and average hours worked per employee. This is important because what is really going on in the Irish economy is a Keynesian adjustment in quantity of labor and not a neoclassical wage-rate adjustment. This implies that the \u201ccure\u201d for Ireland\u2019s problems was not so much a supply-side set of \u201creforms\u201d but an increase in demand, first from the rest of the world thanks to Ireland\u2019s remarkable openness as an economy, and then from a demand response following the end of austerity in 2013.The Greek economy is nowhere near as open as the Irish economy, and, as measured by the cyclically adjusted structural balance, has already endured more than double the amount of austerity than Ireland. The Irish story isn\u2019t a price adjustment; it\u2019s a quantity adjustment. Mr. Sinn gets the most important part of his diagnosis wrong. His prescription is likely to kill the Greek patient.Stephen Kinsella, Limerick, Ireland The writer is a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Limerick.To the Editor:As an analyst of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, which plunged our continent into its \u201clost decade,\u201d I am stunned by the Greek bailout and its dire consequences.

The Brady Plan brought back normalcy. It replaced outstanding debt with long-term bonds and significant debt relief. Who believes Greece will repay its debt? And how can decision makers be exempted from the political and human consequences of this bailout, including the weakening of Greek borders to migration from the East?Gonzalo Biggs, Santiago, Chile Advertisement"}

North Korean public pronouncements can be as virulently anti-Japanese as they are anti-American, so it was natural that the clock change would be billed as throwing off a hated vestige of colonial domination.\u201cThe wicked Japanese imperialists committed such unpardonable crimes as depriving Korea of even its standard time,\u201d the North\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency said on Friday.South Korea has its own historical grudges with Japan, but the time of day is not one of them. Jeong Joon-hee, a spokesman for the Unification Ministry in the South, said that following Pyongyang\u2019s lead now would be confusing and expensive for a country that, unlike the North, is thoroughly integrated with the global economy.A photographer parts the curtains on one of the world\u2019s least-known places and brings back pictures of a country that is defined for many by mystery and war.Japan is widely resented on both sides of the border, but the North enshrines its hostility toward Japanese and other foreign \u201cimperialists\u201d in its Constitution and puts the resentment at the core of the country\u2019s ruling philosophy of \u201cjuche,\u201d or self-reliance.

{"Headline": "Exclusion of Blacks From Juries Raises Renewed Scrutiny", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHREVEPORT, La. \u2014 Here are some reasons prosecutors have offered for excluding blacks from juries: They were young or old, single or divorced, religious or not, failed to make eye contact, lived in a poor part of town, had served in the military, had a hyphenated last name, displayed bad posture, were sullen, disrespectful or talkative, had long hair, wore a beard.The prosecutors had all used peremptory challenges, which generally allow lawyers to dismiss potential jurors without offering an explanation. But the Supreme Court makes an exception: If lawyers are accused of racial discrimination in picking jurors, they must offer a neutral justification.In Louisiana\u2019s Caddo Parish, where Shreveport is the parish seat, a study to be released Monday has found that prosecutors used peremptory challenges three times as often to strike black potential jurors as others during the last decade.That is consistent with patterns researchers found earlier in Alabama, Louisiana and North Carolina, where prosecutors struck black jurors at double or triple the rates of others.In Georgia, prosecutors excluded every black prospective juror in a death penalty case against a black defendant, which the Supreme Court has agreed to review this fall.\u201cIf you repeatedly see all-white juries convict African-Americans, what does that do to public confidence in the criminal justice system?\u201d asked Elisabeth A. Semel, the director of the death penalty clinic at the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.As police shootings of unarmed black men across the country have spurred distrust of law enforcement by many African-Americans, the new findings on jury selection bring fresh attention to a question that has long haunted the American justice system: Are criminal juries warped by racism and bias?But many prosecutors and defense lawyers said peremptory strikes allow them to use instinct and strategy to shape unbiased and receptive juries. \u201cI\u2019m looking for people who will be open, at least, to my arguments,\u201d said Joshua Marquis, the district attorney in Astoria, Ore.Jeff Adachi, San Francisco\u2019s elected public defender, said peremptory challenges promote fairness.\u201cYou\u2019re going to remove people who are biased against your client,\u201d he said, \u201cand the district attorney is going to remove jurors who are biased against police officers or the government.\u201dNo defendants were acquitted when two or fewer of the dozen jurors were black. When there were at least three black jurors, the acquittal rate was 12 percent. With five or more, the rate rose to 19 percent. Defendants in all three groups were overwhelmingly black.Excluding black jurors at a disproportionate rate does more than hurt defendants\u2019 prospects and undermine public confidence, said Ursula Noye, a researcher who compiled the data for the report.\u201cNext to voting,\u201d she said, \u201cparticipating in a jury is perhaps the most important civil right.\u201dProspective jurors arriving at the courthouse here walk past a towering monument to the Confederacy, featuring grim likenesses of four Confederate generals.Carl Staples, a 63-year-old African-American, recalled how the monument made him feel when he reported for jury duty.\u201cIt dashes your hopes,\u201d he said, taking a break at the gospel radio station where he works as an announcer. \u201cIt has its roots in the ideology of white supremacy.\u201d He said much the same thing during jury selection in a 2009 death penalty case, and that played a part in his dismissal for cause.Much of the gap had nothing to do with peremptory strikes. Of the 8,318 potential jurors in the study, which reviewed 332 trials from 2003 to 2012, only 35 percent were black.Professor Diamond suggested reasons for this. Blacks may be less likely to be on jury lists that are drawn from voter registration records, less likely to appear when called, more likely to qualify for hardship exemptions and more likely to be disqualified for felony convictions.Still, prosecutors here used peremptory strikes against 46 percent of the black potential jurors who remained, and against 15 percent of others. In 93 percent of trials, prosecutors struck a higher percentage of blacks than of others.Dale Cox, the parish\u2019s acting district attorney, said jury selection was more art than science and could not be quantified. \u201cStatistics can be misleading,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be any number of variables that would explain those strikes that have nothing whatsoever to do with race.\u201dThe study\u2019s findings, though, were in keeping with data from around the country.\u201cOpposition to the death penalty is much more common among black people, polls regularly show,\u201d he said. Striking jurors for hesitation about capital punishment is legitimate, he continued, adding that it is largely balanced \u201dby defense lawyers doing exactly the same thing the other way.\u201d\u201cThe probability of this disparity occurring in a race-neutral jury selection process is less than one in 10 trillion,\u201d Judge Weeks wrote.He denied any improper conduct, and noted that he had never had a conviction questioned by a court or reversed because of his jury selection practices.He added that it was not always clear whether black jurors helped or hurt the prosecution.\u201cThe defendant on trial may be African-American and the victim is African-American,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a scenario that is 90 percent of our cases here in Shreveport. So you can see right away I want African-Americans on the jury, by and large, because they are the voice of the victim.\u201dOf the 12 prosecutors who handled at least 20 trials, 10 were white. The highest dismissal rate was held by Brian H. Barber, a white former prosecutor who struck five times as many blacks as others. Now a judge, he did not respond to requests for comment.When the Supreme Court hears the death-penalty case from Georgia, Foster v. Chatman, No. 14-8349, it could reshape the ways juries are selected.The case arose from the 1987 trial of Timothy T. Foster, an African-American facing the death penalty for killing a white woman, Queen Madge White. Prosecutors worked hard to exclude blacks from the jury.In notes that did not surface until decades later, they marked the names of black prospective jurors with a B. They highlighted those names in green. They circled the word \u201cblack\u201d where potential jurors had noted their race on questionnaires.They ranked the black prospective jurors in case \u201cit comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors,\u201d as the prosecution\u2019s investigator put it in a draft affidavit at the time.There was no need for that, though. Prosecutors struck all four black potential jurors.When challenged, Stephen Lanier, the lead prosecutor, offered lots of reasons for the strikes. All the prospects were said to be some combination of confused, incoherent, hostile, disrespectful and nervous. Three did not make enough eye contact. A 34-year-old black woman was too close in age to the defendant, who was 19. (The prosecution did not challenge eight prospective white jurors age 35 or under.)\u201cAll I have to do is have a race-neutral reason,\u201d Mr. Lanier said, \u201cand all of these reasons that I have given the court are racially neutral.\u201d The judge rejected the defense\u2019s objection.After Mr. Foster was convicted, Mr. Lanier urged the all-white jury to impose a death sentence to \u201cdeter other people out there in the projects.\u201d The jury did so.Mr. Foster, who has spent decades on death row, is seeking a new trial.Troubling evidence of bias led the Supreme Court to adopt the race restriction in jury selection nearly three decades ago.In a concurrence in the Batson decision, Justice Thurgood Marshall said it was a necessary step to combat \u201ccommon and flagrant\u201d race discrimination, citing statistics from Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina and Texas. But he called for \u201cbanning peremptories entirely.\u201dHe noted that England had eliminated peremptory challenges but \u201ccontinues to administer fair trials based largely on random jury selection.\u201dBut other lawyers and scholars have argued for more limited changes to the system.Some say allowing fewer peremptory challenges \u2014 three, say, instead of the 12 each side gets in Louisiana \u2014 could combat the worst abuses.Abbe Smith, a law professor at Georgetown, would go further.Shreveport, in the northwest corner of Louisiana, was once a booming oil town. Its downtown is now dotted with empty storefronts, and among the few bright spots in its struggling economy are casinos and the occasional film or television production lured by tax breaks.The courthouse is a grand affair, though, with marble walls and bronze fixtures. But the courtroom in which Frederick Dudley\u2019s jury was selected this month was charmless and modern, with a low ceiling and fluorescent lights.Race may have played a role in the proceedings, but not always in predictable ways. Mr. Dudley, a 26-year-old black man with dreadlocks, had rejected his court-appointed lawyer\u2019s advice to plead guilty to armed robbery in exchange for a 10-year sentence. He asked Judge Katherine Dorroh, who is white, for a new lawyer. She told Mr. Dudley that he was free to hire a lawyer but that otherwise he was stuck with David McClatchey, a white public defender.The lawyers questioned prospective jurors in groups of 14. \u201cI happen to represent a young man who is African-American,\u201d Mr. McClatchey said. \u201cIf you were in deliberations and someone said something prejudiced, would you speak up?\u201d Thirteen people, both black and white, said they would. \u201cNo,\u201d said a white woman. \u201cTheir opinion is theirs.\u201d Neither side challenged her, and she was seated.The prosecutor, Treneisha Hill, who is black, asked many more questions. \u201cTell me one thing about you that would make you a good juror for this case and one thing that wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said. The jurors responded to the second part of her query with common themes.They were worried about crime. They did not want to miss work. A white woman said she might not be able to be fair because her husband had recently been robbed at gunpoint. \u201cHe was an African-American man,\u201d the juror said, glancing at Mr. Dudley. \u201cI look at him and think, \u2018Were you the one who held a gun to my husband\u2019s head?\u2019\u201dMr. McClatchey used a peremptory strike to dismiss her. \u201cIt\u2019s like cutting the mold off the cheese,\u201d he later explained.In the end, he used nine peremptory challenges, three of them to strike blacks. The prosecutors used four, only one to strike a black potential juror, a young man with dreadlocks, much like the defendant\u2019s.That did not surprise J. Antonio Florence, a defense lawyer here not involved in the case. \u201cYoung black men,\u201d he said, \u201chave absolutely no chance of getting on a jury.\u201dThe final panel \u2014 12 plus an alternate \u2014 included six black members, all women. Mr. McClatchey said those demographics could work against him, as the black jurors might identify with the prosecutor rather than with his client. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten smart,\u201d he said of recent hiring practices by the district attorney\u2019s office.But the jury never sat. Mr. Dudley pleaded guilty the next day and was sentenced to 12 years in prison the next week. Mr. McClatchey said his client\u2019s decision to plead was wise, as \u201che was obviously guilty.\u201d\u201cBecause of the nature of the case,\u201d he added, \u201cthe jury selection was very basic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Trump believes the Chinese (and others) have been playing us for fools; using cheap labor, currency manipulation and trade barriers to favor their exports and limit our imports.In Mr. Trump\u2019s mind (although not in the minds of serious economists), that\u2019s why we\u2019ve lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000.The Chinese are certainly protectionists, but a shift in manufacturing jobs was inevitable. For centuries, as countries have developed, the locus of jobs has shifted based on comparative advantage.Moreover, many of those manufacturing jobs weren\u2019t lost to other countries but to growing efficiency, just as employment in agriculture in the United States has fallen even as output has risen.No policies could reverse tectonic forces of this magnitude, and in suggesting that there are remedies, Mr. Trump is cynically misleading the American public.Still worse are his notions for how to bring jobs home, particularly his call for huge tariffs. At various times, he has proposed levies of 25 percent on imports from China and 35 percent on Ford vehicles assembled in Mexico. That would significantly raise prices for Americans and unleash retaliatory moves.Another tenet of his trade policy would be a weaker dollar, which would discourage imports by making them more expensive and increase the competitiveness of American exports.But a weaker dollar depends on low American interest rates, and Mr. Trump has separately decried the expansionary monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.In that criticism, Mr. Trump has been aligned with a flotilla of staunch conservatives who have argued for years that maintaining interest rates near zero is certain to unleash asset bubbles and rampant inflation.To date, that view has proved utterly wrong. Low interest rates have helped our economic recovery. And not only is inflation nowhere to be seen, but the prices of key barometers, like commodities and energy, are falling.The list of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrongheaded ideas goes on and on: We shouldn\u2019t increase the minimum wage, which is well below historic levels, after adjustment for inflation. Corporate taxes should be eliminated. Global warming is a fantasy.By some estimates, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border would cost billions and his plan to deport 11.5 million undocumented immigrants could cost at least $400 billion over 20 years, while losing the services of millions of workers would significantly dent economic growth.When challenged on his more outlandish ideas, Mr. Trump retreats into chest thumping, with comments like \u201cyou have to let me handle that, O.K.?\u201dAt times, Mr. Trump goes on the attack without actually disagreeing. The Affordable Care Act should be abolished, but his suggested replacement bears considerable resemblance to President Obama\u2019s plan. He has pushed for even greater involvement by government in health care, praising the single-payer models of Canada and Scotland.I guess a foolish inconsistency can also be the hobgoblin of a big mind.When it comes to budgets, Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers (were he ever to release any) couldn\u2019t possibly add up.He wants to build infrastructure, bolster defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, cut taxes and protect Social Security and Medicare from any trims, all while proclaiming that he\u2019s a fiscal conservative.In 1999, to address the problem of too much federal debt, Mr. Trump proposed a one-time, 14.25 percent wealth tax on the very rich. Fortunately, the idea never gained traction; a $5.7 trillion tax increase would have plunged the economy into recession, if not depression.In the Republican debate, Mr. Trump, who has watched four of his companies slide into bankruptcy, said of the nation\u2019s debt mountain: \u201cThey need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.\u201dConfronted recently by one journalist about his policy prescriptions, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy, believe me. You\u2019ll be happy.\u201d I\u2019ll be happy when he is off the stage.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and contributing opinion writer. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Deadly Tianjin Blast, Shortcuts and Lax Rules", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosWithin two years, Rui Hai International Logistics had built a reputation as the go-to place for businesses looking to ship hazardous materials to customers abroad, a niche market that had been dominated by sluggish state enterprises.Rui Hai offered lower prices, a no-hassle approach to paperwork and quick government approvals. Business was brisk. It seemed like another success story for the Binhai New Area, a thriving economic development zone established here by the ruling Communist Party around one of China\u2019s busiest seaports.Now, more than two weeks after explosions at its warehouses leveled a section of that district, killing 150 people, injuring more than 700 and leaving millions here fearful of toxic fallout, Rui Hai has become a symbol of something else for many Chinese: the high cost of rapid industrialization in a closed political system rife with corruption.In interviews with more than a dozen of Rui Hai\u2019s former clients and associates \u2014 and unusually critical reports in China\u2019s state-controlled news media \u2014 a picture has emerged of a company that exploited weak governance in one of the party\u2019s showcase economic districts and used political connections to shield its operations from scrutiny.Rui Hai began handling hazardous chemicals before it obtained a permit to do so, and it secured licenses and approvals from at least five local agencies that conducted questionable reviews of its operations. Local authorities outsourced one safety review required for a storage permit to a private contractor that Rui Hai selected and paid.As much as 3,000 tons of hazardous chemicals were stored at Rui Hai on the night of the explosions, including 700 tons of sodium cyanide, deadly in a dose of less than a tablespoon, and 1,300 tons of fertilizer nitrates, more than 500 times the amount used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Rui Hai\u2019s shipping yard covered more than 11 acres, but clients said it routinely packed huge volumes of different volatile chemicals together in haphazard fashion instead of storing them separately, at safe distances and in smaller quantities as recommended in the industry. \u201cNobody wanted to stand in their way,\u201d said one chemicals exporter in Tianjin, who asked not to be named to protect his business from reprisal, when asked why regulators took no action.The catastrophe in Tianjin has stunned a nation inured to living with one of the worst industrial safety records in the world. By the government\u2019s own count, more than 68,000 people were killed in such accidents last year \u2014 nearly 200 every day, most of them poor, powerless and far from China\u2019s boom towns.But the Aug. 12 blasts at Rui Hai were different, because they occurred so close to middle-class neighborhoods in one of China\u2019s most prosperous cities, a modern metropolis of 15 million just a half-hour ride from Beijing on gleaming high-speed trains. And they unfolded nearly in real time online, with dramatic video shared widely across social media before censors could stop it. Criticism of the party\u2019s management of the economy had already been on the rise, with growth at its slowest pace in a quarter-century and the stock market reeling since early summer. Now the explosions have prompted broader questions about whether party officials who operate with few checks on their authority can pursue development without endangering public health and safety.\u201cFrom the blasts to the botched government response, everything about this disaster is outrageous, which is why people are so furious,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIt was a man-made disaster that could have been prevented, and it has exposed a range of systemic problems, from the lack of regulation for handling hazardous chemicals to the collusion of business and corrupt officials.\u201dTrust in the government could erode further if evidence emerges that local officials overlooked and concealed the dangers posed by Rui Hai and other facilities in the Binhai New Area.As recently as 2013, Chinese academics warned of \u201cmany unacceptable environmental risks\u201d in the district, citing the growing chance of accidents from the storage of dangerous materials so close to residential neighborhoods and singling out the area where the Rui Hai facility was located. That warning, and others like it dating to at least 2008, were ignored.China\u2019s top leaders have promised a transparent investigation into the disaster, and nearly two dozen local officials and Rui Hai employees have been detained or placed under investigation. But the government has thus far been silent on crucial questions, including what exactly caused the blasts. Nor has it addressed reports that firefighters in the district were unprepared to deal with a chemical fire and may have triggered bigger explosions or released toxins by spraying water on the blaze.\u201cWe had no idea it was a warehouse for dangerous goods,\u201d said Quan Li, 25, a firefighter who was buried under debris when the fire department\u2019s building collapsed in the blasts. Speaking by phone from a hospital bed, he said the department had drafted a risk-management plan this year that identified the most dangerous sites in the port.Rui Hai, he said, was not on the map.Playing Catch-UpFor decades, Tianjin has sought to emerge from the shadow of Beijing, its far more powerful and privileged neighbor, and to catch up with the rival port cities that pioneered China\u2019s economic transformation. The centerpiece of these ambitions has been the Binhai New Area, a vast stretch of industrial parks and skyscrapers along the muddy shores of the Bohai Sea about 30 miles from downtown.China\u2019s leaders began to experiment with the first special economic zones in the late 1970s to promote foreign investment and market-oriented policies. The districts promised tax breaks as well as freedom from over-regulation, and they grew so quickly that the rest of the country has since sought to emulate their approach. Binhai won special status in 1994.Through the decades of rapid growth, however, the Communist Party has struggled to strike a balance between cutting red tape and enforcing rules to protect the environment, workers and public health. With little public scrutiny of their work, party officials are only occasionally punished for neglecting the latter, usually only after an accident. But they can count on being rewarded for pushing the limits for economic growth, with promotions \u2014 and opportunities for graft.Mr. Yu, 41, had been deputy manager of the local branch of the state conglomerate Sinochem. Mr. Dong, 34, sold tires, cosmetics and wine, but his father was the police chief at the port, and that apparently helped them get the necessary fire safety, land and environmental permits.The news agency noted that Mr. Dong \u201cdid not specify whether there was a bribe or official misconduct.\u201dBut Rui Hai set up warehouses about half a mile from an apartment complex and a rail station, in violation of Chinese regulations requiring that hazardous chemicals be stored farther away from residential areas and transport hubs.The environmental impact assessment ordered by regulators in Tianjin in 2013 made no mention of that fact. Instead, the Tianjin Academy of Environmental Sciences reported that 100 percent of the 128 residents it surveyed welcomed the facility in their neighborhood.Former clients said they began using Rui Hai as early as February 2014. But it was not until May 4, 2014, that the Tianjin Transportation and Port Administration issued a temporary permit allowing the company to store and ship hazardous chemicals.The license was effective retroactively, beginning April 16, and good for six months. At the bottom, it was marked, \u201cThis document is not to be made public.\u201d On Thursday, prosecutors said they were investigating the officials responsible for issuing the license, including the director of the transportation administration.When that license expired, Rui Hai continued handling chemicals without one. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cease operations because we didn\u2019t think it was a problem,\u201d Mr. Yu told Xinhua. \u201cMany other companies have continued working without a license.\u201dThe warehouse in Tianjin that exploded was just one of many buildings across China that store toxic chemicals near residential areas.Rui Hai may have been granted only a temporary license in 2014 because it had not yet obtained a safety certification, a process that the port administration outsources to private companies.Ma Jun, a prominent Chinese environmental activist, said that these safety consultants routinely skewed their findings to satisfy corporate clients. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay in this business without compromises.\u201d he said.The first company approached by Rui Hai declined to take the job, citing the facility\u2019s proximity to the residential complex, Mr. Dong said in the Xinhua interview. But Rui Hai shopped around, and found another firm, one that corporate records show is affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security. That relationship has led some Chinese journalists to describe it as a \u201cred-hat intermediary,\u201d or a firm set up by officials to extract payments from businesses.It added that Rui Hai had \u201cestablished a rather sound safety management system.\u201d Four months later, Rui Hai received a new permit to handle hazardous chemicals, good for three years.Ignoring the WarningsWhen local officials first recruited him as an adviser nearly a decade ago, Shao Chaofeng saw a chance to show that his ideas for energy-efficient and ecologically sound growth could find a home among the smokestacks and cranes of the Binhai economic zone.A young environmental engineer on the faculty at Nankai University in Tianjin, Professor Shao drafted dozens of papers setting out ideas for industrial development free of the haze, toxins and water pollution that have blighted much of eastern China.\u201cInitially, people paid attention,\u201d he recalled.But if Professor Shao was at first inspired by the prospect of a \u201cnew Binhai,\u201d he finished his years of work on the district increasingly troubled. Officials were piling on one industrial project after another, sometimes dangerously close to schools and residential neighborhoods.\u201cThe rapid development of industry, especially petroleum and chemical industries, have greatly increased major environmental risks in the Binhai New Area,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut at the same time, environmental risk management standards in the district have not undergone timely and effective improvement.\u201dOfficials were not hostile to his proposals, Professor Shao said, but many seemed overwhelmed by the pressure to build up the economic zone, and there were frequent reshuffles of personnel.By about 2011, Professor Shao\u2019s government consultancy work on Binhai had dried up.Based on incomplete statistics, they counted 84 instances of pollution at the port between 1998 and 2012, most of them attributed to \u201coperational\u201d failings. Yet, they noted, the government planned to develop the shipping of chemicals as a \u201cmain pillar\u201d of the port\u2019s growth.Professor Shao was away on business when he heard the news of the explosions. Reached by telephone a few days later, he recalled feeling stricken by regret. \u201cI felt deeply pained in my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt there were many things that could have been ... \u201d His voice trailed off.He said he and the others who built the risk model that forecast trouble in 2015 had never anticipated that a company would store such vast amounts of hazardous chemicals so close to a residential area. \u201cSuch a large quantity of dangerous chemicals \u2014 it was just too much \u2014 should never have been placed in what was quite a central location,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t a residential district, even on the edge of the city, this was wrong.\u201dSidestepping SafetyThe sodium cyanide arrived at Rui Hai in wooden crates, hundreds every month, each marked \u201cTOXIC\u201d with an imprint of a skull and bones. The material was headed to mines around the world to extract gold from rock, but it was as deadly as the cyanide used in the Nazi gas chambers.Storing and shipping sodium cyanide was one of Rui Hai\u2019s specialties. This summer, it had received an especially large shipment \u2014 700 tons, enough to fill 35 shipping containers. But the company was authorized to store only 10 tons at a time, according to the 2013 environmental assessment.Former clients said Rui Hai executives were willing to sidestep safety measures aimed at reducing the risk of accidents and often boasted of their ability to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. \u201cWhatever problem you had \u2014 not enough time, a huge order \u2014 they took care of it,\u201d said the chief executive of a large Chinese plastics company, who asked to be identified only by his surname, Liu, to avoid retaliation from the authorities. \u201cTheir talent was cutting through all the hassle.\u201dCalisto Radithipa, a chemicals trader based in Hong Kong, shipped sodium cyanide to Zimbabwe through Rui Hai several times. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was profit first,\u201d he said.Based on customs and transport records, officials say, Rui Hai was storing as much as 3,000 tons of hazardous chemicals on the night of the explosions, including 1,300 tons of ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate, used in fertilizers and to create explosive materials. Also on the site were 500 tons of magnesium, an explosive powder, and metallic sodium, which is used to purify metal and can spontaneously ignite when exposed to air.There were also unspecified amounts of calcium carbide, a highly flammable chemical used in welding; sodium hydrosulfide, an extremely toxic compound used in mining that can turn into a volatile gas when heated; and toluene diisocyanate, a compound used to make plastics that explodes when exposed to heat.A year earlier, the stockpile was even larger. According to a routine safety inspection in June 2014, there were 4,261 tons of hazardous chemicals at Rui Hai. Experts say storing such large quantities of chemicals at one site is dangerous, because it heightens the risk of an explosive reaction and can exacerbate the damage caused by fire. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible amount,\u201d said Neal Langerman, a chemical safety consultant in San Diego. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have large quantities, you really have to do it right. If you do it right, it costs you money.\u201dChinese regulations require that hazardous chemicals be kept in well-ventilated areas, far from sunlight, power cords and other heat sources. But Rui Hai\u2019s warehouses were known for shoddy construction and outdated equipment, people involved in shipping chemicals from the warehouse said.Chemicals are also supposed to be stored separately and at safe distances to reduce the risk of reactions. But Rui Hai often crammed containers full of different dangerous chemicals next to each other, former clients said.Hu Jianzhong, a manager at a Tianjin logistics firm, said Rui Hai packed the containers together because the authorities had not allowed warehouses to devote more space to hazardous materials, even as the volume of chemicals going through the port increased in recent years. The safety assessment conducted by the private company before Rui Hai obtained its license noted that containers were stacked three high when two should be the limit.The government says it has contained the fallout from chemicals at the blast site, but residents in Tianjin remain worried about the long-term effects of the toxins scattered in the explosion. \u201cIt might take decades for them to figure out the impact of so many chemicals in the air and water,\u201d said Zhang Yangyang, 29, a lawyer wearing a respirator who emerged from her home lugging a bag of possessions. \u201cThis is not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the model number of the Airbus jets assembled in the Binhai New Area in Tianjin.

Yet last fall Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, suggested we might need to regulate the development of artificial intelligence \u201cjust to make sure that we don\u2019t do something very foolish.\u201dSurprisingly, Musk found support from some prominent technology leaders. Bill Gates said he didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand why some people are not concerned\u201d about what he called \u201csuper intelligence.\u201d Stephen Hawking claimed that \u201cthe development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\u201dOver the past decade or so, we have seen some impressive demonstrations of artificial intelligence, including Watson, IBM\u2019s \u201cJeopardy\u201d champion; Siri, Apple\u2019s personal assistant; and Google\u2019s self-driving car. We have also seen some clear evidence that smart technology is restructuring the industrial economy by doing certain kinds of work that require skill and judgment we traditionally associate with flesh and blood. We may not need to follow Musk\u2019s call for regulation, but we probably need to assess the state of artificial intelligence and robotics, a task that John Markoff describes as looking for \u201ccommon ground between humans and robots\u201d in \u201cMachines of Loving Grace.\u201dThe development and deployment of any technology is a complex process that involves a host of people with different interests, including researchers, engineers, regulators, bankers, business leaders and others. Markoff, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, tries to find his common ground by focusing on the researchers who create the basic technology and how, he writes, they \u201chave grappled with questions about the deepening relationship between human and machine.\u201d Markoff concedes that designers and engineers are removed from the ultimate application of their work. They \u201cgrow uncomfortable when asked about the potential consequences of their inventions and frequently deflect questions with gallows humor.\u201d To help us understand these researchers, Markoff divides the field into two categories. The first consists of work that is trying to duplicate human behavior with computing systems: artificial intelligence. The second category, intelligence augmentation, consists of work that attempts to expand human abilities. Markoff developed these two categories in \u201cWhat the Dormouse Said,\u201d his 2005 book on the influence of 1960s counterculture on technology and computing. In \u201cDormouse,\u201d he laid the foundation for \u201cMachines\u201d by telling the stories of the pioneering artificial intelligence researcher John McCarthy and Doug Engelbart, the engineer who invented the computer mouse. In his new book, Markoff updates his narrative with recent stories of artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation, including the Google autonomous vehicle program, which began at Stanford University, and Apple\u2019s Siri, which started as a project at S.R.I. International, formerly known as the Stanford Research Institute. Along the way, he retells the stories of McCarthy, Engelbart and others.Markoff mentions \u201cDormouse\u201d in his preface to \u201cMachines,\u201d writing that his research for the earlier book gave rise to a paradox that he wanted to explore in this new one: \u201cThe same technologies that extend the intellectual power of humans can displace them as well.\u201d But \u201cMachines of Loving Grace\u201d often returns to ideas from the foundational years of computer science, and the repeated stories sometimes make this new book seem as if it\u2019s looking backward rather than forward. As Markoff himself points out, the line between artificial intelligence and intelligence augmentation is sometimes fuzzy, \u201cwith machines that will simultaneously augment and displace humans.\u201d Artificial intelligence technology from self-driving vehicles can be used as intelligence augmentation to help a driver avoid dangerous situations. Similarly, devices that are intended to augment human performance can easily allow one person to do the work of two.The book ends with a too brief treatment of the problem that may ultimately bring large numbers of robots into our homes and lives: the need to care for the aging members of the baby boom generation. We may need to deploy smart machines to augment failing skills or to expand the population of nurses and companions. Personal care is one of the most human of activities. A full discussion of this subject would involve not only interviews with researchers but also conversations with nurses, business people and regulators \u2014 only then might we be better equipped to determine whether a new machine can be made humane enough to care for us.

{"Headline": "Fading Economy and Graft Crackdown Rattle China\u2019s Leaders", "Date": "2015-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut by 6:10 p.m. that day, Mr. Zhou\u2019s career was over, and he faced years in prison.The Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption agency announced it was investigating him on \u201csuspicion of serious violations of party discipline and the law,\u201d signaling his ouster as the party chief of Hebei Province, one of the nation\u2019s most populous.Mr. Xi has positioned himself as the chief architect of economic policy \u2014 usually the prime minister\u2019s job \u2014 and has vowed to reshape the economy, exposing himself to blame if growth continues to sputter. At the same time, Mr. Xi is making enemies with an anticorruption drive that has taken down some of the most powerful men in the country and sidelined more than a hundred thousand lower-ranking officials.Senior party officials are said to be alarmed by the state of the economy, which grew at the slowest pace in a quarter century during the first half of the year, and now seems to be decelerating further. In a sign of its anxiety, the leadership this month implemented the biggest devaluation of the Chinese currency in more than two decades, sending global markets into plunges.Even before these episodes, early this year a number of party elders had quietly urged Mr. Xi to focus more on reinvigorating the economy, according to an adviser to senior party and government leaders and an editor at a party media outlet, both of whom requested anonymity to describe internal discussions.The advice was viewed as a sign of their dissatisfaction with Mr. Xi\u2019s management of the economy but also as implicit criticism of his pursuit of high-profile corruption cases that had tarnished their legacies and targeted their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, the adviser and the editor said. \u201cRight now, the economic situation is not good, so the core of the party\u2019s work should be shifted more toward the economy,\u201d the adviser said, paraphrasing the message communicated to Mr. Xi.The campaign has also stoked resentment among the party rank and file and set the bureaucracy on edge, with wary officials afraid to move forward on important projects, the party media editor and others said.Retired party leaders can wield significant influence in China because of their networks of supporters across the apparatus. But Mr. Xi appears to have consolidated power faster than his immediate predecessors when they took office and there has been no suggestion that his leadership of the party might be challenged.In the past two weeks, though, two leading official news outlets have published unusual editorials hinting at internal turmoil.Another commentary published Wednesday on the website of the state broadcaster China Central Television described fierce resistance to Mr. Xi\u2019s agenda and called on his supporters to step up their efforts to carry out his policies. The article, which was widely distributed on popular Chinese websites, was notable not only because it openly acknowledged the opposition to Mr. Xi but also because of its strident language.\u201cThe stubbornness, ferocity, complexity and weirdness of those who haven\u2019t adapted to reform or are even opposed to reform may go beyond what people imagine,\u201d it said.Mr. Xi has pledged sweeping market-oriented reforms to overhaul the Chinese economy for long-term growth, including plans to weaken monopolies enjoyed by state enterprises, to wean the economy from its dependence on inefficient state-directed investment, and to liberalize the nation\u2019s financial markets, with the aim of making the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, a strong competitor to the dollar on world markets.But there has been little progress toward these goals, and as growth has begun to stall, the government has adopted measures that run counter to Mr. Xi\u2019s call to allow market forces to play the \u201cdecisive role\u201d in the economy, including aggressive intervention to prop up the stock market last month and policies encouraging state banks to lend money.Behind the scramble is a deep-rooted anxiety within the leadership about possible social instability if the age of supercharged growth in China ends. China\u2019s gross domestic product grew more than 26-fold in the 37 years since the country began to open up its economy, bolstering the party\u2019s authoritarian rule and lifting more than 600 million people out of poverty.\u201cEveryone understands that the economy is the biggest pillar of the Chinese government\u2019s legitimacy to govern and win over popular sentiment,\u201d said Chen Jieren, a well-known Beijing-based commentator on politics. \u201cIf the economy falters, the political power of the Chinese Communist Party will be confronted with more real challenges, social stability in China will be endangered tremendously, and Xi Jinping\u2019s administration will suffer even more criticism.\u201dSome have asked whether the party leadership and its technocrat advisers are up to the task of managing a slowing economy after decades of experience with one that has only soared, fueled in large part by mass migration from the countryside to the cities. Even neutral observers warn that Mr. Xi may be promising too much.\u201cThe Xi generation of leaders has lofty ambitions and resolve that are bigger and broader than their predecessors, and their objectives are even greater, so he can\u2019t spend as much energy on specific economic issues as in the past,\u201d said Li Daokui, director of the Center for China in the World Economy at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University and a former member of the monetary policy committee for China\u2019s central bank. \u201cWhether such lofty ambitions and objectives can be realized remains to be seen,\u201d he said in an interviewOne concern is the way the government has handled the stock market. In the first part of the year, state news outlets cheered as the market climbed to new heights and helped reduce debt burdens for Chinese firms. People\u2019s Daily declared on April 21 that the bull market had \u201cjust begun.\u201dBut share prices in Shanghai peaked on June 12, then fell by almost a third in less than a month, wiping out the accounts of countless small investors who had borrowed to invest. Before that, the authorities did nothing to disabuse the investing public of the notion that a rising stock market was a state-backed goal and integral to Mr. Xi\u2019s promise to build \u201cthe China dream.\u201d\u201cTo allow such an idea to spread among China\u2019s investment community, at a time when China has still not yet managed to establish a healthy functioning stock market, was deeply irresponsible,\u201d writes Barry Naughton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, in a forthcoming paper.Professor Naughton said in an interview that Mr. Xi\u2019s penchant for putting himself in charge of policy-setting committees \u2014 called \u201cleading small groups\u201d by the Chinese \u2014 has upended the way China usually shapes economic policy. It may also have contributed to recent missteps and led to more abrupt, ad hoc policy shifts. Mr. Xi chairs at least six such committees, including one on finance and economics and a new one on restructuring the economy.But these committees under Mr. Xi have not fully succeeded in taking control of economic policy, Professor Naughton said, and that has resulted at times in bureaucratic confusion.But it also spooked investors around the world who interpreted the 4.4-percent devaluation that resulted as a desperate bid to help China\u2019s flagging export sector by a government more worried than it is letting on. Exports fell more than 8 percent in July.The policy adviser to senior party and government leaders said fears that the slowing economy could lead to social unrest prompted the Politburo in a July 30 meeting to approve a raft of measures to bolster growth, including the decision to devalue the currency. Other steps will follow, the person said.Mr. Xi\u2019s campaign against corruption enjoys broad support in a nation where the widening gap between rich and poor is attributed to the ability of a small minority to prosper by abusing government positions or using political connections. As the economy falters, though, the risks for Mr. Xi multiply, said one retired party think tank official.\u201cThe main thing is the economy. As long as the economy continues to decline, people will have more and more objections, and there will be more and more pressure on the leadership,\u201d said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss internal party politics. \u201cAnd right now, the fact is that the economy is in decline.\u201dMichael Forsythe reported from Hong Kong, and Jonathan Ansfield from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Venezuela Tries to Silence Critics", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialPolls suggest that the political party of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela could take a beating during congressional elections in December. It would be richly deserved for a ruling party that has mismanaged the oil-rich nation\u2019s economy, triggering soaring inflation and food shortages. Whether the opposition will get to compete fairly, though, is in doubt. On Monday, officials in Venezuela announced that a leading opposition politician, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, will be barred from running, along with a handful of other government critics. Another leading opposition leader, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, has been imprisoned since February 2014, facing spurious charges.The action against them is outrageous. Opposition leaders have offered sensible ideas to start addressing the country\u2019s monumental problems. In recent days, politicians critical of Mr. Maduro have taken steps to close ranks, which could strengthen an opposition movement that had been beset by divisions in the past. Voters should be allowed to consider whether they represent a better alternative to Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party.The United States has called on Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council and the country\u2019s comptroller general to allow Ms. Machado and other banned candidates to appear on the ballot on Dec. 6. \u201cThese decisions clearly have the intention of complicating the ability of the opposition to run candidates for the legislative elections and limiting the range of candidates that can be presented to the Venezuelan people,\u201d the State Department said.Ms. Machado was one of the leaders of street protests in early 2014 that were crushed by the authorities. Late last year, Venezuela\u2019s top prosecutor filed charges against her for supposedly plotting to assassinate Mr. Maduro. Like the allegations against Mr. L\u00f3pez, the charges against Ms. Machado are ludicrous. Opposition leaders have refrained from endorsing acts of violence.Ms. Machado has offered a substitute candidate for the election in December, but vowed to keep pursuing public office. Latin American leaders should insist that she be allowed to compete. Letting Mr. Maduro weaken his rivals ahead of the election would increase the likelihood that they would see no choice but to take to the streets again. A new round of demonstrations would further destabilize a country already roiled by an economic crisis.Advertisement"}

And he declared a state of emergency in a stretch of territory along the border, allowing warrantless searches and placing restrictions on public gatherings or protests.At the same time, soldiers in this Venezuelan border town began house-to-house searches in a sprawling slum, checking identity papers and rounding up hundreds of Colombian citizens, many of whom had lived in Venezuela for years. They were made to sit in a dusty soccer field under the baking sun for hours before being sent to the bridge and kicked out of the country.Officials said that more than 1,000 people were deported.In closing the border, Mr. Maduro said he was responding to an episode in which three Venezuelan soldiers were shot and wounded. The details remain hazy, but Mr. Maduro said it was an attack by a Colombian paramilitary group obeying the orders of a former Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, whom he has frequently described as an enemy bent on overthrowing his leftist government.Mr. Maduro said the border shutdown would last indefinitely, and that he planned to expand the state of emergency to other parts of the country.But to analysts and those caught in the crackdown, the state of emergency was inextricably tied to the economic and political crisis gripping Venezuela, with politicians looking for someone to blame.For now, the focus of Mr. Maduro and the hundreds of soldiers he dispatched has been on a large slum that hugs the T\u00e1chira River separating the two countries, an area he says is a nest of paramilitary groups, brothels, criminals and smugglers.During a televised news conference this week, he vowed to raze the slum.\u201cWe\u2019re going to knock down all the houses there, just so you know,\u201d Mr. Maduro said. \u201cNot a single house will remain.\u201dThe warnings set off despair and anger here in the neighborhood, where a backhoe has already started knocking down houses. Many people said they were hard-working Venezuelan citizens or Colombians with legal residency, and they asked why their homes were slated to be torn down.\u201cI don\u2019t see the justification at all,\u201d said Jairo G\u00f3mez, 55, a Venezuelan who has a small business selling empanadas. He built a house here 13 years ago and now fears he will lose it.In an area of the slum, named after the Argentine revolutionary hero Che Guevara, a backhoe was brought in this week and began knocking down the cinder block houses.On Wednesday night, some families were busy dismantling their own homes to salvage the construction materials so they could be sold or used again later.\u201cYou just want to lie down and never wake up,\u201d said Tatiana Cerna, 33, a Colombian who said she lived here legally with her Venezuelan husband and child. A few yards from other houses that had already been demolished, the family was working with hand tools under the moonlight to take apart their home, brick by brick, beam by beam.\u201cThis is the kind of family that lives here,\u201d said Ms. Cerna, a seamstress whose husband is a taxi driver. \u201cIf they want to stop the smuggling, I think the national guard itself is involved. To come and knock all this down is not the solution.\u201dMr. Maduro\u2019s popularity is extremely low because of the country\u2019s economic struggles, and the country is approaching a crucial legislative election in December that could enable the opposition to win a majority for the first time in years.While closing the border and evicting immigrants may stir some nationalist sentiment, it could backfire in a country where many naturalized Venezuelans vote and many other voters have Colombian relatives.\u201cWe were Chavistas, but never again,\u201d said Wilson Velazco, 32, Ms. Cerna\u2019s brother-in-law, covered in dust from the demolition and using the Spanish term for the followers of Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\u201cMaduro is a clown, not to use a more offensive word,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Ch\u00e1vez were alive, he never would have permitted this.\u201d\u201cRaiding houses, removing the inhabitants by force, separating families, not allowing them to take with them their few belongings and marking the houses in order to demolish them later on, these are totally unacceptable actions that recall bitter episodes of humanity that must not be repeated,\u201d Mr. Santos said.Each country has long pointed to the other in times of internal tension. Relations reached a low point when the conservative Mr. Uribe and the leftist Mr. Ch\u00e1vez were presidents and engaged in a heated ideological struggle.Mr. Uribe accused Mr. Ch\u00e1vez of supporting guerrilla groups fighting the Colombian government. Tensions cooled after Mr. Santos became president in 2010 and Venezuela helped broker peace talks between Colombia and its largest rebel group.But this week the acrimony returned, and on Thursday both countries announced that they had recalled their ambassadors. \u201cVenezuela\u2019s problems are made in Venezuela, not in Colombia,\u201d Mr. Santos said. Mr. Maduro, in turn, called Mr. Santos a liar and accused him of neglect. \u201cColombia has turned into a net exporter of poor people, fleeing misery, fleeing war,\u201d Mr. Maduro said on Thursday.\u00a0Mr. Maduro defended his border policy. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Colombian,\u201d he said this week, adding that 5.6 million Colombians live in Venezuela, which has a total population of about 30 million. \u201cWe love the Colombian people.\u201dHe said that if the houses of any innocent people were destroyed the government would provide them with new apartments, although he offered no specifics about how the government would determine who was innocent or when they might get new housing.He also rejected comparisons that his critics have made between him and Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate whose campaign is partly built on stirring sentiment against Mexican immigrants to the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t have Donald Trump\u2019s hairdo and much less his bank account and even less his ideology,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.But Mr. Maduro and other government officials have increasingly lashed out at Colombian immigrants since last year, saying that through smuggling and black-marketeering they are responsible for the escalating shortages and high prices here.Venezuela has fallen further into economic disarray since Mr. Maduro was elected in 2013 after the death of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.The government has stopped disclosing basic economic data, but most economists estimate that inflation is well over 100 percent annually and that the economy is in a deep recession, all made worse by plummeting prices for oil, the country\u2019s only major export. Many basic goods are in short supply and long lines at stores are common.The opportunities for smugglers are enormous. Gasoline in Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest estimated oil reserves, is virtually free, costing about six cents a gallon at the main exchange rate of 6.3 bol\u00edvars to the dollar, and just a small fraction of that at black market exchange rates that currently run more than 700 bol\u00edvars to the dollar.But in Colombia, gasoline fetches prices similar to or higher than those in the United States. Vast quantities of fuel are routinely smuggled across, generating enormous profits.There is also a brisk trade in other goods that can be bought in Venezuela at low government-mandated prices and sold at much higher prices in Colombia, including staples like corn flour, powdered milk and rice, or materials like cement.Across the border in the Colombian city of C\u00facuta, hundreds of deportees were jammed into shelters, and there were long lines at gas stations caused by the sudden absence of contraband gasoline.Some deportees sneaked back across the river at night, making several trips back and forth carrying their belongings. Some, including those leaving voluntarily, continued to carry belongings across in the early morning, with Colombian police officers wading into the gray water to help.Patricia Helves, 19, sat on the riverbank nursing her 11-month-old baby. Ms. Helves, a Colombian married to a Venezuelan bus driver, said that she had walked across the river fearing that she would be deported if she stayed. Her husband carried the family belongings over.\u201cI\u2019m not going back,\u201d she said.A map on Friday with an article about a crackdown on immigrants from Colombia by the government of Venezuela misspelled the name of another South American country in some editions. It is Ecuador, not Equador.Reporting was contributed by Patricia Torres from San Antonio del T\u00e1chira, Susan Abad from C\u00facuta, Colombia, and Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good News on U.S. Economy Is Getting Lost", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 If you believe the political discussion, from left and right, the American economy is in dreadful shape, beset by rampant joblessness and too much debt.Actually, the economy has been steadily, if too slowly, improving.Unemployment is down to 5.3 percent from 10 percent in President Obama\u2019s first year in office. Gross domestic product is expanding at a clip of 2.5 percent, a modest pace but growth nonetheless. The federal deficit is estimated at $486 billion this year, or about a third of what it was in 2009. Despite all the complaints about the Affordable Care Act, 15 million more Americans are covered than two years ago.Why all the negative rhetoric? Persistent systemic problems have kept wage growth stagnant for a long time. The recovery has been very top heavy.The economy invariably becomes a political target when there is no White House incumbent running for re-election. The opposition party has to talk about how bad things are and its ideas for change. The incumbent party, in this case the Democrats, must be more nuanced, striving to avoid getting tarred as defenders of the status quo.Yet, the United States is one of the bright spots in an unsettled global economy. Much of Europe remains prostrate.A few years ago, the BRIC nations \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2014 were viewed as the world\u2019s locomotives. Today, Brazil and Russia are economic basket cases. The picture is mixed in India, which changed its method for calculating gross domestic product, potentially overstating growth.The shakiness of China, at least short term, was on display last week when it allowed its currency to plunge, underscoring fragility in what is the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The move followed recent government restrictions on the stock markets that also reflected displeasure with poor results.In an integrated global economy, European woes and worries about China affect the United States. Donald J. Trump\u2019s China-bashing may have populist appeal; it would have no economic benefits.Private investment remains sluggish as companies struggle to generate more revenue for the top line. It is those investments that drive productivity that then turns into wage growth. That is not happening.So, despite the comparatively promising performance, many Americans do not experience any improvement. Not only are wages stagnant but the unemployment rate is deceptively low in part because it does not account for part-timers who want to work full time.There\u2019s little that politicians can do to change the situation in the 14 months before the presidential election.Gridlock in Washington precludes most actions. The premium should be on not doing harm, such as shutting down the government or bringing the country to default by failing to raise the debt ceiling this autumn.The Federal Reserve could make a difference by tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates. The chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, is very sensitive to weakness in the employment market and the best guess is that her steps will be cautious and modest.Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist who is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination, arouses crowds with denunciations of the economy and vows to soak the rich. But few mainstream liberal economists believe steeper taxes on investment and wealthier Americans would produce an economic boom.Many of the more right-wing Republican presidential candidates advocate slashing federal spending, which is also not a prescription to goose the economy. Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida, though he has been short on specifics, has promised to produce an economy that grows 4 percent or more a year. His top economic advisers were leading decision-makers in the administration of his brother President George W. Bush when the rate of expansion never reached 4 percent. The only time over the past half-century that such fast growth was achieved for four consecutive years \u2014 the length of a presidential term \u2014 was under Bill Clinton.Advertisement"}

After the sale, the government has a stake of about 72.9 percent in R.B.S.The report noted that the government had estimated in 2008 that it could lose \u00a320 billion to \u00a350 billion from those bailouts.He continued, \u201cNow is the time for R.B.S. to rebuild itself as a commercial bank, no longer reliant on the state, but serving the working people of Britain.\u201dMr. Osborne said the proceeds from the sale would be used to pay down the national debt.Shares of R.B.S. were down 0.5 percent in midday trading in London on Tuesday.The government has had an easier time reducing its stake in Lloyds in recent years, as the lender\u2019s profitability has improved. The government had a stake as large as 40 percent in Lloyds after extending a bailout of \u00a317 billion to the lender in 2008.The British government has since reduced its stake in Lloyds to just under 14 percent and has recovered about \u00a313.5 billion of the bailout money given to Lloyds.The lender has announced its intentions to become a much smaller, British-focused retail and corporate bank.The bank said, however, that it was not likely to return capital to investors through share buybacks and dividends before the first quarter of 2017, and it again recorded a large restructuring charge tied to its overhaul.\u201cThere is more work to be done,\u201d he added, \u201cbut we\u2019re determined to build a bank the country can be proud of.\u201dCitigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS coordinated the R.B.S. offering.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Alaska, Obama Will Be in Middle of Oil and Climate Change Battle", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Gov. Bill Walker ticks down the things he wants President Obama to see in visiting this vast northern state starting on Monday, and glorious glacial vistas are not at the top of the list.\u201cI\u2019d show him the number of employees we\u2019ve laid off, the troopers we\u2019ve laid off, the trooper stations we\u2019ve closed, the brand-new helicopters that we\u2019re putting into storage \u2014 taking the blades off because we can\u2019t afford to operate them on search and rescue,\u201d said Mr. Walker, a former lawyer and businessman who was elected last year as a political independent. \u201cIt\u2019s real, and it\u2019s not a slight adjustment.\u201d As Mr. Obama comes north for what the White House has described as an examination of the effects of climate change, Alaska is battling over oil \u2014 its chief source of revenue \u2014 and the thorny implications of drilling. Oil prices have fallen to multiyear lows, and production has declined from aging oil fields \u2014 with consequences rippling through a state that pays for just about everything with taxes from oil. Mr. Walker, in an interview in his Anchorage office, said he planned to press Mr. Obama to loosen restrictions on exploration and to pledge support for a natural gas pipeline. More broadly, Mr. Walker said, he hoped to help the president understand Alaska\u2019s dependence, because of climate and geography, on what can be extracted from the land or sea. \u201cFrom oil and gas development to fish caught in the ocean, we literally live off the resources,\u201d Mr. Walker said.But fossil fuels are also blamed for human-caused climate change, and that reality has set up a competing claim for the president\u2019s attention. More drilling for energy, climate advocates say, is not the answer for Alaska or the planet. With a three-day trip for Mr. Obama planned out by the White House \u2014 including the first visit by a sitting president to some of Alaska\u2019s most remote Arctic communities \u2014 the uncertainties and stakes are high, people on all sides of the energy fight say.\u201cIt\u2019s a battle for humanity,\u201d said Ryan Joe, 26, an Alaska Native college student who was helping plan an anti-Arctic-drilling rally for Monday in downtown Anchorage, led by Greenpeace and other groups. \u201cHow is drilling somewhere going to make it better for the world?\u201d Mr. Joe said.Recent tumult in global stock and energy markets has added further urgency, as doubts about economic growth in China and around the world have clouded Alaska\u2019s future. The credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s earlier this month downgraded Alaska\u2019s outlook to negative from stable, citing the structural deficit in the state budget. The Arctic \u201cis not a pristine snow globe that deserves to be tucked away and preserved,\u201d said Tara Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, based in Barrow, in a telephone interview. \u201cOur people have lived here for thousands of years,\u201d she added, \u201cand have found the balance between responsible development and environmental stewardship.\u201dMr. Obama himself is seen as conflicted by many Alaskans, most of whom did not vote for him in either of his presidential races.His administration\u2019s approval earlier this month of Shell Oil\u2019s plan to explore for oil in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast gave hope to those who want him to encourage or least allow more drilling. But that he is coming here specifically to look at climate change implications also suggests to many people an agenda that does not necessarily include Alaska\u2019s economic interests. The White House has signaled that Mr. Obama might not want to talk about oil and drilling at all while he is here.Alaska has had an uneven economic ride with Mr. Obama even beyond oil. In per capita federal spending, for things like land management and other programs, it was one of the most federally dependent states in 2013, according to a study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, beaten only by the geographic triumvirate around the capital \u2014 Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. From 2008 to 2013, the study said, Alaska was in 49th place for growth of per capita federal spending. Military bases are yet another crucial part of the Alaska economy, and the number of military personnel based in the state is also set to shrink, with a decrease of 2,675 troops recently announced by the Defense Department.Mr. Walker said he would like the president to stand somewhere in far western Alaska, where Russia\u2019s coast can be seen across the Bering Sea, and understand that climate change is also bringing geopolitical change. Alaska, he said, just as it was in the Cold War, is at the front lines as Russian rebuilds its Arctic military presence.Some Alaskans are hoping Mr. Obama sees a middle way.The president of the State Senate, Kevin Meyer, a Republican, said a tour of the Cook Inlet south of Anchorage, where oil-drilling platforms and rich fishing grounds are flourishing, would show that the issues are not all black and white.\u201cResource development, fishing and the environment can all coexist,\u201d Mr. Meyer said, \u201cand I think Alaska is a good example of that, if that\u2019s what he wants to see.\u201dBut even if the focus remains fixed on climate, Mr. Walker said that the visit could still be valuable and important to Alaska because the economic and social costs of climate change are also clearly mounting. At least one remote coastal village, with more probably set to follow, may have to be moved, he said, as sea levels rise.\u201cRelocating a village is pretty spendy,\u201d Mr. Walker said.But there is also anxiety here about whether images of a changing climate \u2014 captured by the cameras and attention that will follow Mr. Obama \u2014 could be perceived by some people as Alaska\u2019s fault, as an energy dependent state.As Chris Tuck, the minority leader in the State House of Representatives and a Democrat, put it: \u201cI\u2019m just hoping we don\u2019t get blamed for the fact that the glaciers are melting.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Says Its Economy Contracted in Second Quarter", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Burdened by weaker consumer spending and exports, Japan\u2019s economy contracted in the second quarter, government data showed on Monday, the first such setback since a short but painful recession last year.The Cabinet Office said gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the three months through June. Most analysts believe the economy will return to growth during the current quarter.Japanese growth rates have fluctuated wildly in recent quarters, and the latest downturn only partially erased gains from a strong expansion in the first quarter, which the government now estimates at 4.5 percent. Last year was even more volatile: Consumer spending surged before a sales tax increase in April 2014, lifting the economy to its fastest pace in years, then evaporated afterward, setting off a recession.The size of the contraction in the quarter through June was roughly in line with the expectations of private-sector economists. In surveys by news agencies, analysts had forecast an annualized contraction of 1.8 percent to 1.9 percent, on average.But economists say the tide may be turning back to growth in the current quarter.\u00a0In a recent survey by the Japan Center for Economic Research, an affiliate of Nikkei, Japan\u2019s largest financial newspaper, 40 analysts predicted that growth would rebound by an average 2.5 percent in the period from July to September.\u201cTemporary factors were a big part of it, though I\u2019m not saying the only part,\u201d Akira Amari, the economy minister, told reporters, referring to the second-quarter downturn.\u00a0Unusually heavy rainfall in June hurt sales of air conditioners \u2014 a major seasonal item in humid Japan \u2014 while an increase in taxes on ultra-small cars weighed on the auto industry, he added.Masamichi Adachi, the chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase, said he saw little risk that the economy would contract for two straight quarters, the simplest technical definition of a recession, in part because the tight job market was finally putting upward pressure on wages.\u2018\u2018Consumption likely will pick up, particularly with favorable weather and an expected increase in real income,\u2019\u2019 he said.The slowdown is nonetheless a setback for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which has been trying to pull the economy out of nearly two decades of deflation through a stimulus program known as Abenomics.The program, under which the central bank injects vast amounts of cash into the economy, has kept borrowing costs low and weakened the yen. It has been a boon for global manufacturing companies like Toyota that earn much of their revenues abroad in currencies like dollars and euros.But while Abenomics has increased profits at big corporations and lifted the stock market, many ordinary Japanese say they feel few benefits. Jobs are plentiful \u2014 the unemployment rate is just 3.4 percent, close to an 18-year low \u2014 but the paychecks that go with them buy less than they used to. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, average wages have been stuck in a persistent decline.Household spending fell at an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the second quarter, the economic report on Monday showed. A government sentiment survey released last week showed consumer confidence had slipped to its lowest level since January.Pay has been increasing comfortably for some workers. Toyota, for instance, this year increased base wages for its Japanese work force by the largest margin in 13 years. But economists caution that gains have accrued disproportionately to those with permanent jobs at major companies \u2014 an elite but shrinking minority.Many of the jobs that have been created since Mr. Abe became prime minister at the end of 2012 have been part-time or temporary, with lower pay and fewer benefits.Exports, which have been hurt by a weaker Chinese economy, tumbled at an annualized rate of 16.5 percent last quarter, according to the economic report. That was only partially offset by a 9.8 percent decline in the value of imports.China\u2019s rapid development in recent years has had spillover benefits for Japan, where experienced manufacturers of industrial machinery have supplied much of the equipment used in China\u2019s proliferating factories. China supplanted the United States as Japan\u2019s largest trading partner several years ago.Thus the slowing pace of growth in China \u2014 and, in particular, a decline in demand for capital goods \u2014 has hurt important parts of Japan\u2019s export economy.The quarterly contraction in Japan could revive speculation on whether the central bank will step up its stimulus efforts. The Bank of Japan has been pouring money into the economy by buying government bonds from the market at a rate of 80 trillion yen a year, or close to $700 billion. Yet the sustained increase in consumer prices that it hopes to generate as a result has been elusive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is California Really Winning the Drought?: Reader Q. & A.", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEcosystemsThe vast Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in Northern California sits at the heart of California\u2019s water system, a hub through which water from Northern California moves to Southern California. The delta is also home to fish that rely not just on adequate water, but water that is not too salty, and that is cool. California has become accustomed to diverting delta water for farming and urban use. But in the drought, sending that water out of the delta doesn\u2019t leave enough water that is cold enough for fish already struggling.Farmers talk about officials choosing fish over humans. Environmentalists talk about a system that drives whole species to extinction so we can grow strawberries and almonds, which can easily be grown elsewhere. The delta is such a complicated, emotional topic that I knew I couldn\u2019t untangle the issues in the short space I had for the article.I think there are two important lessons from the competition in the delta. First, California\u2019s water system needs updating in legal and water-rights terms. That\u2019s hard, but the recent progress on groundwater I mention in my article means the drought may offer the opportunity.And second, any arrangement of water distribution that pits farmers who are trying to feed the United States and earn a living against the extinction of whole species is badly off-kilter. Whatever we can say about water, our own use of it does not require driving other species to extinction.But calming the emotions involved in the delta enough to get to those two points will require real persistence and leadership. And some of the fish may not last that long.How California\u2019s lessons can apply to the rest of the U.S.If people take the time to see their current water situation clearly, finding smart solutions to how to manage that water is not that hard. It\u2019s the first step that turns out to be hard.She\u2019s right. Except for the reality of the modern political landscape. Ms. Mulroy says that such a project would be on a scale similar to others we\u2019ve done, including the interstate highway system.\u2014 by which she means it\u2019s within reach. But the United States won\u2019t tackle any nonmilitary projects of that scale at the moment. And the environmental and logistical issues involved in creating artificial rivers to move water hundreds of miles west across many states and many individual cities would create a project that would take years to finish, and would most likely involve huge court battles.In fact the water problems of the West (and the coming problems of the East) can be solved using much less money, and with much less conflict, by getting people in those states to work together to more smartly allocate the water they\u2019ve got, to change pricing so people and farmers understand the cost and the value of their water, and to put in place water reuse systems and much smarter agricultural water technology than is in use now.But the kernel of your question is whether we should allow communities and states to stumble along to solve water problems without national guidance and leadership. Water could use a lot more concentrated attention at the national level, where it gets almost none.Country\u2019s dependence on CaliforniaThree things are important here:\u2022 Farmers have been choosing to move to crops like almonds, pistachios and wine grapes because those crops are much more profitable than traditional fruits and vegetables. That is, for a given amount of water and a given amount of effort, the land produces more money growing nuts and grapes. That\u2019s the way a market economy and democracy are supposed to work \u2014 we want businesspeople to make decisions that make sense for them in the market. We don\u2019t want some central authority picking crops for farmers \u2014 we want them to make those choices.\u2022 The missing element is that farmers assume they\u2019ll have water, and they assume the water will be pretty cheap. In the case of the huge move to nuts and grapes in California, farmers are planting crops that cannot be fallowed \u2014 they need to be watered every year, even when it\u2019s dry. They make more money, but they require absolutely consistent water. If water were priced more realistically, and if the risk of losing water were clearer, farmers could still make those choices \u2014 but they would know they were assuming risk of losing their investment. They might make different choices, in fact.I want to be clear, JBR: I wasn\u2019t bragging about the population growing in California. (I don\u2019t live there, in fact.) I was pointing out that unlike in previous historic droughts, like the Dust Bowl, people weren\u2019t fleeing this drought. We in the United States have never directly managed the population of communities \u2014 we don\u2019t tell people where to live. More to the point, we don\u2019t use water availability to discourage population growth \u2014 even when that might be smart. For decades, many of the fastest-growing cities in the country \u2014 Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, Los Angeles \u2014 have been in areas where water is very scarce.There are in fact smart ways of building \u201cwater availability\u201d into city growth plans, and into farming communities as well. You charge new homes and businesses the real cost of adding growth to the water supply. You make sure farmers not only account for the water they use, but pay the cost of the water itself (not just the cost to deliver it to their fields) \u2014 so farmers grow crops appropriate to the water availability. A century of basically unlimited water in this country has spoiled us. I think increasing water scarcity is going to force communities to put these kinds of policies in place, however belatedly.What you can\u2019t do is create those systems in the few weeks between now and when the rain may come this fall and winter. A groundwater law passed last year \u2014 while it will take effect slowly \u2014 will really inspire communities to capture that rainwater and find ways of letting it infuse aquifers.Those kinds of systems require planning, construction and money. If El Ni\u00f1o rains come in the next six months, California won\u2019t be able to take advantage of the water as well as it should or to protect itself from the flooding. But the drought is causing a reassessment of how to do just that in the years to come.There is a whole system of moving water, and a system of water rights, built up around those practices \u2014 and thousands of people have created their lives on that system. You can\u2019t simply turn off the water and tell those people to move somewhere else. For one thing, you\u2019d lose the produce in the nation\u2019s grocery stores.You can change the water system, and price the water itself, so farmers evolve to use water in sustainable amounts to grow the right crops.At the moment, one thing that will not happen is desalinating ocean water for crops. It is simply too expensive. In fact, if farmers had to pay even what ordinary homeowners pay for tap water, none of us would be able to afford more than about one head of lettuce a month. Cheap water doesn\u2019t just benefit the farmers \u2014 it\u2019s been the key to cheap food for the rest of us. And almost no one in California is using desalination even for drinking water, because of the cost.Desalination technology has advanced in recent decades, allowing us to produce water at half or a third of the cost as 25 years ago. But water produced through desalination is still four or five times the cost of water supplied other ways \u2014 and that\u2019s in cities. For agriculture, it would be many times more.There is no question that scientists and engineers are looking for ways to make a quantum leap in desalination akin, say, to the leaps made in the cost reductions in computer processing. But what\u2019s clear is that there\u2019s plenty of incentive: The money to be made and the human misery to be reduced by making desalination super cheap are huge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sri Lankans Reject Ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa in Election, and Prosecution May Follow", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe election, held peacefully on Monday with high voter turnout, determined the makeup of Sri Lanka\u2019s 225-member Parliament. As expected, Mr. Rajapaksa easily won a seat in the chamber. But his political coalition fell short of winning a majority, which he had said would have earned him the right to be named prime minister, the second-most powerful job in the government.The final results showed that Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s coalition lost support in every region of the country, including areas long viewed as his political base.\u201cThe election very clearly demonstrated there is no wave of support for him,\u201d said Jayadeva Uyangoda, a professor of political science at the University of Colombo.Instead, the results strengthened his archrivals: Maithripala Sirisena, the president, and Ranil Wickremesinghe, the prime minister, odd-couple political partners who joined forces to oppose Mr. Rajapaksa.\u201cWe need to unite as one family to create a new political culture in this country,\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe said in a statement claiming victory on Tuesday. \u201cWith one heart, we should strive to ensure our country can meet the challenges of the modern age and rise to the top.\u201d\u201cThe majority of this country has voted to consolidate the gains of the Jan. 8 revolution and take forward the policies of good governance and consensus,\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe said.The result also increases the likelihood that there will be a careful accounting of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s decade in power. His opponents accuse him and his family of plundering billions of dollars from the treasury, a charge he has denied. \u201cWhatever you may say, we are not thieves,\u201d he told reporters last week.But the roster of his former ministers and close associates under investigation is steadily growing, and several inquiries are now aimed directly at Mr. Rajapaksa and his family.In April, the Sri Lankan police arrested his brother Basil, the former economic development minister, on charges of misappropriating public funds. The same month, another brother, Gotabhaya, the former defense secretary, was summoned to appear before the nation\u2019s Bribery Commission. In June, his wife, Shiranthi, was questioned by the newly formed Financial Crime Investigation Division.This month, government sources accused one of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s sons, Yoshitha, of ordering the killing of Wasim Thajudeen, a member of Sri Lanka\u2019s national rugby team, in a dispute over a woman. According to officials, three members of his father\u2019s security detail have been identified as the men who abducted, tortured and killed Mr. Thajudeen in 2012.As part of his campaign this summer, Mr. Rajapaksa had pledged to stop many of those investigations, portraying them as nothing more than a political witch hunt. The loss, though, means \u201calmost certain prosecution\u201d for Mr. Rajapaksa, said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, who runs an election monitoring group and a policy research organization in Sri Lanka.Mr. Rajapaksa had also sought to mobilize voters against a United Nations investigation into allegations of war crimes during the last stages of the war against Tamil separatists. United Nations officials have estimated that as many as 40,000 civilians died in the final assault on the Tamil-dominated north in 2009.Monday\u2019s results also have significant geopolitical ramifications. As president, Mr. Rajapaksa aggressively courted China, building economic and military ties that alarmed India and the United States. Neither country wants China to gain a larger presence on an island so strategically located along the maritime trade routes between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe have put the courtship on pause, saying the relationship with China needs to be \u201crebalanced.\u201dDharisha Bastians contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Business Aviation Market Zooms a Little Slower", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesChina\u2019s fast-growing business aviation market has hit a rough patch.During an eight-year run beginning in 2005, deliveries of new jets expanded by about 20 percent a year, according to industry data. But now the country\u2019s economy is growing at its slowest rate in nearly a quarter-century. Customers have less to spend. And those who can spend are afraid of becoming casualties in the government\u2019s anti-corruption austerity campaign.Growth hit only 15.5 percent in 2014, according to a report by the Asian Sky Group consultancy, released in mid-April. With deliveries lagging one to two years behind orders, the worst may be yet to come, one analyst said.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s been spared,\u201d said Jeffrey Lowe, managing director at the Asian Sky Group. \u201cIf you look at all the other high-end commodities that have been impacted as far as China sales, it\u2019s certainly not surprising that business jets are feeling the crimp.\u201dAsian Sky\u2019s report said the combined markets of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan were \u201cvery much in decline.\u201d The net number of aircraft added to the combined fleets was more than 100 in 2012, a number that dropped to 64 in 2013 and 59 last year, it said.Deer Jet, the largest charter operator in the region, was, in 1995, the first company to offer charter services inside China. The company has been forced to adapt as demand has evaporated, said Fang Xinyu, Deer Jet\u2019s vice president. Mr. Fang said the company had reduced its fleet by more than 30 percent in the last two years, because of a slowing economy and \u201csome factors not related to the industry itself.\u201dMr. Lowe estimated that China\u2019s large charter companies have had a 40 percent drop-off in business since President Xi Jinping began his austerity campaign after assuming power in late 2012.\u201cCharters have gone away, just like gift-giving and banquets,\u201d he said, noting that for most large Chinese charter operators, the central government had been one of the biggest sources of business. Chartering a large aircraft from Deer Jet for a domestic flight costs 60,000 to 80,000 renminbi, or $9,600 to $12,900, an hour. But even if government demand bounces back, Mr. Fang said, many challenges remain, particularly in terms of regulation and infrastructure.\u201cWe need more airspace, more flexible scheduling, more parking slots and more professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things will play a decisive role in China\u2019s business aviation development.\u201dThe industry\u2019s uncertainty was reflected in April at the three-day Asian Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai, a gathering of multinational manufacturers, charter and management companies, and other service providers.Recent installments have been upbeat affairs, often featuring announcements of large orders. At last year\u2019s exhibition, Minsheng Financial Leasing confirmed it had placed orders for 70 business jets. This year, there were no major jet orders.\u201cClearly, China is going through a time of change,\u201d said Ed Bolen, president and chief executive of the National Business Aviation Association, a Washington-based industry organization that co-hosts the Chinese aviation exhibition. \u201cIf you look at the past two years, it has cooled down a little.\u201dMr. Lowe of Asian Sky said the slowdown has touched all aspects of the market. He added that many of China\u2019s state-owned banks \u2014 including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China and the China Development Bank \u2014 had entered the business-jet leasing market following the lead of Minsheng, which placed its first order in July 2010.Now many of those banks are looking to sell underused aircraft, creating sales competition for manufacturers like Gulfstream, Bombardier and Dassault Falcon. But even without external pressures, the business-jet market may simply be hitting its natural level, Mr. Lowe said.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more financings, we\u2019re seeing more refinancings and a lot more pre-owned aircraft, too. But those are all the things that should be happening in a maturing market,\u201d said Mr. Lowe, who has worked in sales at Gulfstream and Bombardier. For plane manufacturers, \u201cI don\u2019t think China was their top-performing market last year, let\u2019s put it that way. Whether that\u2019s 50 percent down, I\u2019m not sure, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201dExactly how much new jet sales have cooled is difficult to pin down, as manufacturers would not disclose details of jet orders. China is not the only market that has slowed recently; Russian and Latin American demand has decreased as well, leading Bombardier to announce in May that it would slash 1,750 business-jet division jobs.Gulfstream is the most popular aircraft manufacturer in China, accounting for 32.3 percent of business jets there. Roger Sperry, the company\u2019s regional senior vice president for international sales for Asia Pacific, described the mood of the industry in China as \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\u201cCustomer interest continues to be strong \u2014 it\u2019s just taking longer to close deals,\u201d Mr. Sperry said. He added that Gulfstream\u2019s customers were primarily public and private companies, followed by individuals.Michael Han, regional vice president for sales for greater China at Bombardier Business Aircraft, which is close behind Gulfstream, declined to discuss specifics, but said his company had faced \u201csome challenges\u201d in the Chinese market in the last few years.Yet the slowdown in sales, leases and charters is hardly chasing anyone out of the Chinese market, analysts say. One is even predicting a comeback year.Jason Liao, chief executive of the China Business Aviation Group, said he expected orders to grow more than 15 percent this year on the back of China\u2019s most recent stock boom. He said he was aware of \u201cfive or six\u201d orders in recent months by people who had become rich on the bull market\u2019s high returns before sudden share price slumps in June and July.\u201cThe amount of wealth that has been created by the stock market in the past six months is staggering,\u201d Mr. Liao said in early June. \u201cWe have people calling us now saying, \u2018I\u2019ve made so much money on the stock market, now I want to buy a jet.\u2019\u00a0\u201dEven if stock market volatility continues or prices decline further, some data suggests China\u2019s business aviation market will continue to find new ways to make money. Most notably, business jets are still used at only a fraction of the rate they are in all other regions. According to Bombardier, greater China had four aircraft for every $100 billion of gross domestic product in 2013, compared with 23 in Africa, 42 in Latin America and 69 in North America. Bombardier is projecting 11 percent compound annual growth for aircraft delivery to greater China through 2023.\u201cThe Chinese business aviation industry is still in an early stage of development; the potential market is still huge,\u201d Mr. Fang said. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama, in New Orleans, Praises Results of Federal Intervention", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe project of rebuilding here wasn\u2019t just to restore the city as it had been,\u201d Mr. Obama said to several hundred people at a new community center in the once-devastated Lower Ninth Ward. \u201cIt was to build a city as it should be \u2014 a city where everyone, no matter what they look like, how much money they\u2019ve got, where they come from, where they\u2019re born, has a chance to make it.\u201d Along with his efforts to change the nation\u2019s health care market, the twin recoveries fit Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of a government that tackles tough problems with bold moves and big investments. To fix the economy early in his presidency, he pushed for an $832 billion stimulus package and a partial takeover of the banking and auto industries. To fix health care, he backed a 1,990-page bill that transformed the business of selling health insurance. And to fix New Orleans, he oversaw a huge, coordinated federal response that invested $71 billion in levees, hospitals and schools. His Republican critics generally see his efforts as worsening situations, not improving them, so he came to New Orleans to try once again to prove them wrong. Where a timid and delayed response by the Bush administration led to a widely acknowledged disaster, he argued that his own efforts had returned New Orleans not only to its pre-Katrina state but to an even better one. \u201cThere\u2019s been a specific process of recovery that is perhaps unique in my lifetime right here in the state of Louisiana, right here in New Orleans,\u201d he said in his speech.Have all the president\u2019s efforts worked?Even in New Orleans, that question is hard to answer.New Orleans\u2019s economy is improving; a new $1.1 billion hospital has opened, and another is being constructed; the school system has been overhauled; and the city is now protected against a \u201c100-year storm\u201d \u2014 one that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year \u2014 with a $14.5 billion levee system that is far better than its predecessor.Such racial divides are braided through this city\u2019s history like Creole and jambalaya, a past that Mr. Obama celebrated as he toured a series of new pastel-colored homes in a district, Trem\u00e9, that he said was a birthplace of jazz and one of the most important African-American communities in the country.The New Orleans of 2015 has been altered, and not just by nature. In some ways, it is booming as never before. In others, it is returning to pre-Katrina realities of poverty and violence, but with a new sense of dislocation for many, too.After holding babies, grinning for pictures and even singing a few bars of the theme song to the television show \u201cThe Jeffersons,\u201d Mr. Obama praised the partnerships among every level of government that had rebuilt the area, but acknowledged continuing problems.\u201cIn this community, obviously, there\u2019s still a lot of poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where young people still too often are taking the wrong path, not graduating from high school.\u201d He continued, \u201cBut the fact that we\u2019ve taken this many strides 10 years after a terrible, epic disaster is an indication, I think, of the kind of spirit that we have in this city.\u201dMr. Obama said that the lesson from Hurricane Katrina was that the vast human toll visited upon New Orleans could have been prevented. Some 1,800 people died, and hundreds of thousands were displaced.\u201cWe came to realize that what started out as a natural disaster became a man-made disaster: a failure of government to look out for its own citizens,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his speech at the community center, in an area once under 17 feet of water. And that failure was years in the making, he said.\u201cNew Orleans, like so many cities and communities across the country, had for too long been plagued by structural inequalities that left too many people, especially poor people, especially people of color, without good jobs or affordable health care or decent housing,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many kids grew up surrounded by violent crime, cycling through substandard schools where few had a shot to break out of poverty.\u201dWhile Mr. Obama spoke before a hugely admiring crowd, not everyone in the audience was entirely convinced by his talk of a rebirth. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some progress,\u201d said Gretchen Bradford, a community organizer. \u201cBut just try driving around here. The streets are torn up, and there\u2019s still a lot of blight.\u201dDeon Haywood, a criminal justice advocate, said: \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just what you see on the streets. The criminal justice system is worse than it was before.\u201dAs if to demonstrate the imperfect recovery efforts here, a huge, brightly painted banner of a steamboat traveling through a gorgeous downtown New Orleans peeled itself from the community center\u2019s wall and, amid a collective gasp, fell on the crowd just before the president spoke.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn certain ways this crisis resembles last summer\u2019s border surge in the United States, when a wave of juvenile migrants overwhelmed the border patrol\u2019s ability to cope. But mostly Calais highlights two major differences between the immigration issue in America and Europe, two ways in which migration \u2014 from Africa, above all \u2014 is poised to divide and reshape the European continent in ways that go far beyond anything the United States is likely to experience.The first difference is illustrated by the Calais migrants\u2019 desire to reach not only the European Union at large but the specific destination of Britain \u2014 because of its relatively stronger economy, because they speak English, because the U.K. doesn\u2019t have a national identity card, or for other reasons still.An immigrant desire to go further up and further in is entirely normal. (Mexican immigrants to the United States do not all settle down in El Paso or Tucson.) But it poses a major dilemma for the European Union, which allows free movement across its internal borders, but which is composed of nation-states that still want sovereignty over their respective immigration policies.America has a mild version of this tension: Witness the recent debate over \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d or state-federal conflicts over immigration enforcement. But it\u2019s understood that immigration policy is ultimately set nationally. Michigan isn\u2019t going to close its borders and impose identity-card checks; Maine isn\u2019t going to secede in order to set its own immigration quotas.And these pressures are only likely to increase, because of the second difference between immigration in Europe and America: Namely, the scale of the migration that may be coming to Europe over the next fifty years.That scale could be set by the staggering growth of Africa\u2019s population, and the native European population\u2019s stagnation and decline. Consider how much Latin American immigration has roiled U.S. politics (hello, Mr. Trump), when there are just over 300 million people in the United States and just under 600 million in all the countries to our south \u2014 a ratio that\u2019s unlikely to change much over the next few generations.If Africans were to migrate to Europe at the rate Mexicans have migrated to America since 1970, Millman notes, by 2050 a quarter of Europe\u2019s population would be African-born. That probably won\u2019t happen: The birthrate projections will be off, the migration patterns will be different, European countries will impose restrictions that actually succeed in keeping people out.But something significant is going to happen. In some form, a Eurafrican future is on its way. And judging by the stumbling response to a few thousand migrants at Calais, Europe is deeply unprepared.Advertisement"}

Safonova, the owner of the shop, which on a recent weekday was serving pies to a slow trickle of customers. \u201cWe used to have lines. Now look at it.\u201dMaking matters worse are the retaliatory bans that Russia placed on food imports after the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions for its actions in Ukraine, a policy that took a turn for the weird this month when the government destroyed thousands of tons of what it said were illegally imported foodstuffs including cheese and peaches.The reduced supply means that what remains costs more, even if it is locally produced. Russians are paying a third more for sunflower oil, a fifth more for yogurt and three-quarters more for carrots compared with a year ago, according to government statistics. (The Western sanctions have driven up the cost of borrowing for Russian companies, but they have not had a direct role in the inflation that is raiding Russian pocketbooks.)\u201cIt\u2019s horrible,\u201d said Elena Shcherbakova, a 47-year-old shoe saleswoman whose income, based in part on commissions, has fallen nearly a third since last year.

Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity ratings have remained high since last year\u2019s annexation of Crimea, which was wildly popular among Russians.Mr. Putin\u2019s opponents argue that the nationalist talk washing over Russia is being projected by his government to distract attention from the fragile economic situation. They describe it as a battle in every Russian home between the television (the source of government propaganda) and the refrigerator (whose shrinking contents could eventually prompt discontent).In Moscow, some in the educated upper classes agree.\u201cAll that Ukrainian noise covers up our internal problems,\u201d said Maria Novychkova, a manager in a textile company who was walking a foot scooter in a park last month. Her company has put employees on four-day workweeks. She cannot afford to vacation abroad because of the weak ruble. \u201cHe says we are an ideal country, but we are not,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Putin.The crisis in Ramenskoye is like a car crash in slow motion, gradual but destructive. The town has tried to modernize in recent years, with an airport for private jets and a PepsiCo juice factory. It is also a bedroom community for Moscow. Commuters are Arina\u2019s main customers.Ms. Safonova, the owner of the pie shop, first noticed a drop in business last fall. There were fewer commuters, and those who remained spent less freely. Once-packed minibuses emptied out. The checkout clerks at the nearby Kopeika supermarket had their wages cut. Then in March, PepsiCo announced that the juice factory in town was closing, citing the bad economy.Prices began jumping. Nescaf\u00e9 went to 389 rubles, about $5.96, from 220 rubles. Ahmad Tea jumped to 319 rubles from 191. Ms. Safonova knew about the sanctions, and that the falling ruble made imports more expensive, but sometimes the logic eluded her. A spike in the price of mushrooms this spring was particularly puzzling.\u201cI said, \u2018Why, why?\u2019 These are grown near Moscow, right here, not in Europe!\u201dBy summer, the pie shop\u2019s sales had dropped by nearly half, and Ms. Safonova had to lay off four of her eight employees. She now works 18-hour days to compensate. She gave up her big kitchen and now mixes dough five times a day instead of 10.\u201cThe cost of the crisis is being borne by everyone, spread around like butter on bread,\u201d said Vladimir Gimpelson, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at the Higher School of Economics.As business shrivels across the country, Moscow remains an economic beacon.Alexandra Vasilieva, the cashier at Arina\u2019s Hangout, is from the province of Smolensk in western Russia, where work had dried up so completely that her husband, a window installer, was making just a small fraction of his previous salary. So they came to Ramenskoye and now he commutes more than two hours each way to Moscow for mediocre money. Her son, an auto service worker in Smolensk, lost almost a third of his salary because fewer cars were being brought in for repairs and servicing.\u201cIn the provinces, the wages are too small to live on,\u201d she said. Her monthly salary in Ramenskoye \u2014 20,000 rubles \u2014 is sinking in value, worth just $305, down from $416 in May.As for Crimea, if she thinks about it at all, it is through the lens of economics.\u201cI\u2019m sick of Crimea,\u201d Ms. Vasilieva said. \u201cI\u2019m sad for people,\u201d she said, referring to Ukrainian refugees, \u201cbut why are they getting all this government assistance?\u201dFurther pinching Russians\u2019 pocketbooks are trims the government is making to benefits doled out when times were flush. Pensioners in the Moscow region can no longer ride free on the Moscow Metro, a change that affects more than a million people in one of the most densely populated regions in the country. Apartment owners across Russia must now pay a repairs fee every month, which has prompted protests in some regions.Lyudmila, 68, a retired accountant who declined to give her surname, said it was no longer worth it for her husband, an artist who works as a designer on housing projects, to commute into the city to supplement his pension \u2014 $153 a month.\u201cIf all you have is a pension, you can\u2019t afford to buy shoes,\u201d she said, sitting on a park bench next to her grandson, who was eating a tall white puff of cotton candy.Still, the discontent seems to bypass Mr. Putin.\u201cHonestly, we are so proud he is our president,\u201d said Vyacheslav, 75, a retired factory manager, who also refused to give his surname, as he steered a mostly empty grocery cart through a Kopeika supermarket here last week. \u201cThanks to him, we have all of this,\u201d he said, gesturing toward a glass display case of beet and potato salads, fried eggplant and pieces of chicken.Then he called his wife to tell her that they were out of the cheapest hot dogs.Alexandra Odynova contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

The main reasons are: You cannot really avoid the tax, and it doesn\u2019t depend on your income. Unfortunately, the same reasons become a drawback when you look at the issue from the taxpayer\u2019s side. In general the tax is disconnected from income and so from the ability to pay taxes. Even worse, in a recession you have to pay the same amount as in good times. So basically it is not just that taxpayers hate the property tax; it actually increases the probability of private or corporate bankruptcy \u2014 and also raises the question of whether a tax burden of this type is a fair one.Stefan Maucher, Bad Homburg, GermanyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Future Risks of an Iran Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Obama begins his three-week push to win approval of the Iran nuclear deal, he is confronting this political reality: His strongest argument in favor of passage has also become his greatest vulnerability.His problem is that most of the significant constraints on Tehran\u2019s program lapse after 15 years \u2014 and, after that, Iran is free to produce uranium on an industrial scale.\u201cThe chief reservation I have about the agreement is the fact that in 15 years they have a highly modern and internationally legitimized enrichment capability,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who supports the accord. \u201cAnd that is a bitter pill to swallow.\u201dEven some of the most enthusiastic backers of the agreement, reached by six world powers with Iran, say they fear Mr. Obama has oversold some of the accord\u2019s virtues as he asserts that it would \u201cblock\u201d all pathways to a nuclear weapon.A more accurate description is that the agreement is likely to delay Iran\u2019s program for a decade and a half \u2014 just as sanctions and sabotage have slowed Iran in recent years. The administration\u2019s case essentially is that the benefits over the next 15 years overwhelmingly justify the longer-term risks of what comes after.\u201cOf course there are risks, and they have to be acknowledged,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, who was undersecretary of state in the George W. Bush administration and has testified before Congress in favor of the deal. Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cmost convincing argument,\u201d he added, \u201cis that there is no better alternative out there.\u201dIn making the administration\u2019s case, Mr. Obama can underscore that economic sanctions on Iran begin to lift only as it reduces its current stockpile of low enriched uranium, to 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds. That is not enough to make a single nuclear weapon, and is a 98 percent reduction in its current stockpile of nearly 12 tons.The accord also calls for regular inspections at Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and includes arrangements to reimpose international sanctions if the Iranians are caught cheating.Critics say that by that time, Iran\u2019s economy would be stronger, as would its ability to withstand economic sanctions, and its nuclear installations probably would be better protected by air defense systems, which Iran is expected to buy from Russia.A short overview of highlights from the Iran nuclear pact.Some members of Congress and other experts are urging the administration to take fresh steps to deter Iran from edging dangerously close to a nuclear weapons capability after the main limits in the agreement expire.A Loss of LeverageThe duration of the agreement is the most important and complex issue. Under restrictions imposed by the accord, Iran would need a full year to produce enough nuclear material for a bomb; currently that timeline is two or three months, according to American intelligence agencies. But starting at year 10, that \u201cbreakout time\u201d would begin to shrink again, as Iran gets more centrifuges into operation.Administration officials argue that it would be obvious if Iran made weapons-grade fuel, and negotiators secured a permanent ban on the metallurgy needed to turn the fuel into a bomb.Supporters of the agreement are betting that improved intelligence would deter Iran from racing for a bomb. Under the agreement, inspectors will be able to monitor the production of rotors and other centrifuge components for up to 20 years and can monitor Iran\u2019s stocks of uranium ore concentrate for 25 years.Skeptics counter that, after 15 years, the United States would lose much of its leverage to stop a program. So Mr. Obama is trying to assure Congress that he and his successors will create that leverage.But Mr. Obama\u2019s letter was mostly a repackaging of previous assurances made to lawmakers, to Israel and to diplomats from Arab nations by the Persian Gulf.Some backers of the agreement are urging the White House and Congress to do more. Mr. Schiff and Mr. Ross suggested in interviews that the United States should put Iran on notice that its production of highly enriched uranium after the main provisions of the accord expire would be taken by American officials as an indication that Iran has decided to pursue nuclear weapons \u2014 and could trigger an American military strike.And both said the United States should also be prepared to provide bunker-busting bombs to Israel to deter Iran from trying to shield illicit nuclear work underground. Others have called for a long-term congressional \u201cauthorization to use military force\u201d if Iran violated the accord.Mr. Ross has also urged the White House to specify the penalties for smaller violations of the accord, an idea Mr. Obama rejected in his letter, saying he wanted to maintain \u201cflexibility\u201d to decide what responses might be needed.But some experts like Mr. Einhorn say that this warning should be conveyed directly, if privately, to Iran and that the United States should also increase intelligence sharing with the world\u2019s nuclear inspector, the International Atomic Energy Agency, about possible Iranian cheating.\u201cThe way to address challenges not covered by the agreement is to supplement it, not renegotiate it,\u201d Mr. Einhorn said.Accounting for the PastOne of the trickier issues for Mr. Obama, and for Congress, is how to assess whether Iran has truly come clean about its past nuclear activities, an enormously sensitive issue for the Iranians. And in the end, it is one that Secretary of State John Kerry decided not to press too hard during negotiations, for fear it would undermine the chances of getting stronger inspections for current and future activity.The job of assessing past activities is up to the I.A.E.A. It must certify on Oct. 15 that Iran is complying with a \u201croad map\u201d for cooperation and report in December on the agency\u2019s conclusions \u2014 especially about Iran\u2019s alleged work developing nuclear triggers and designing warheads.Critics of the accord note that Mr. Kerry and his chief negotiator, Wendy R. Sherman, said repeatedly that Iran must provide access to \u201cpeople, places and documents\u201d that would resolve those questions, something Iran has refused to do for years. But the I.A.E.A. has never publicly specified what it is asking, or whom it must meet.Mr. Einhorn, in his analysis, concluded that \u201ca full and honest disclosure by Iran of its past weaponization activities \u2014 which would contradict Tehran\u2019s narrative of an exclusively peaceful program as well the supreme leader\u2019s fatwa that Islam forbids nuclear weapons \u2014 was never in the cards.\u201dThat said, he concludes, that may not be a \u201cserious obstacle\u201d to concluding Iran\u2019s work has halted.Accessing Nuclear SitesWhile the accord calls for regular inspections at Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, the enforcement is of limited duration. For example, while the I.A.E.A. can request access to all declared nuclear sites under the agreements it has with all member states, the far more intrusive monitoring at Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment site at Natanz is not mandated after 15 years. At that point, Iran also would be free to carry out nuclear enrichment at other locations.But the issue that has garnered the most attention is a \u201c24-day\u201d rule for resolving disputes if Iran refuses to give inspectors access to a suspicious site \u2014 another measure that expires after 15 years. (After that, inspectors can still demand to enter sites, but under the existing rules, which do not set a deadline for compliance.) Critics say that is far different from \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d access \u2014 a phrase Mr. Moniz and others in the administration used a few months ago, and have come to regret.If Iran balks at an inspection, then a commission \u2014 which includes Iran \u2014 can decide on punitive steps, including a reimposition of economic sanctions. A majority vote of the commission suffices, so even if Iran, China and Russia objected, the sanctions could go into effect.That is the theory. In practice, reimposing sanctions could be politically challenging. Iran has warned that if sanctions are reimposed it will no longer be bound by the accord. The I.A.E.A., perhaps fearing its inspectors would be kicked out, might hesitate to start the 24-day clock.Mr. Moniz argues that the 24-day time frame is sufficient because Iran will not be able to cover up evidence of nuclear work during that period, since traces of nuclear materials could be expected well after three weeks. But some experts say that Iran could cover up smaller-scale illicit activities, including work on the specialized high-explosives that might serve as a trigger in a nuclear bomb.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Greek Debt Deal\u2019s Missing Piece", "Date": "2015-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt long last, European creditor nations and Greece have reached an agreement on a third bailout in five years.The bailout, which was approved by Greece\u2019s Parliament on Friday, included familiar details: In return for an infusion of 86 billion euros, or $95 billion, Greece has promised to increase taxes, cut spending and enact measures to make its economy function more efficiently.But there was one glaring omission. As it stands, none of that new money flowing into Greece will come from the agency that has, until now, played a crucial role in virtually every bailout, in Greece and elsewhere around the world: the International Monetary Fund.That is because the I.M.F. says that Greece was simply incapable of repaying its staggering debt. Yet the accord reached last week makes no effort to reduce that burden. If you agree with the I.M.F.\u2019s reasoning, you might have to conclude that despite all of the seemingly ironclad provisions of the agreement imposed by eurozone creditors, Greece will be no more able to honor the deal or to repay its new loans than it has been in other bailouts.\u201cI remain firmly of the view that Greece\u2019s debt has become unsustainable and that Greece cannot restore debt sustainability solely through actions on its own,\u201d the I.M.F.\u2019s chief, Christine Lagarde, said on Friday, following the accord\u2019s approval this week.The Greek debt drama has had its share of twists and turns. Alliances have shifted, rivalries have deepened, and the back-room maneuverings have been appropriately Byzantine.But the I.M.F. shift from being Greece\u2019s most persistent scold to its main advocate for a break on its debt has been among the most intriguing developments so far.In late June, representatives of European countries and the I.M.F. gathered at a private meeting at the European Union\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. The officials were racing against time to devise a plan to keep the country in the eurozone. But the dispute between Greece\u2019s two largest lenders was about to boil over.Poul M. Thomsen, the Danish fund official who served as the I.M.F. point person in the Greek talks, had been negotiating around the clock, and his voice was hoarse. Since early in the spring, he had been arguing that while Greece needed to follow through on tough economic measures, its debt was out of control. Europe, however, insisted that the Greek government had only to enact tough austerity measures to set itself on a prudent financial path.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Now the Europeans wanted to highlight their own, more sanguine view of Greece\u2019s debt prospects at a crucial meeting of the creditor countries\u2019 finance ministers the next day. And in doing so they took the I.M.F.\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that Greece could no longer repay its debt and that Europe might have to face losses on its exposure there \u2014 and presented it, in one throwaway sentence, as a long-shot scenario.For the I.M.F. it was a breaking point. Not only were officials frustrated that Europe was not accurately reflecting their view, but they also wanted to make sure that their non-European shareholders, many of whom had become very critical of the fund\u2019s aggressive lending in Greece, got the full picture of how their analysis had changed. So, in a highly unorthodox move, they decided to make their disagreement public. They released their full analysis \u2014 a 23-page document \u2014 a week later.Since then the fund has been adamant: Europe must provide significant debt relief in order for the I.M.F. to provide cash toward the next Greek bailout.A growing number of economists agree that Greece needs more than another dose of austerity policies to recover. But they are also asking why it took so long for the fund to reach that conclusion.\u201cI applaud the fund for releasing the report, but at the same time it was too late,\u201d said Gabriel Sterne, an economist at Oxford Economics in London who has closely studied the I.M.F.\u2019s role in Greece. \u201cFor right or for wrong, they are the only honest broker here so they really should have gotten this out sooner.\u201dFounded in 1944 as part of a broad mandate to ensure global financial stability after the end of World War II, the I.M.F. for many years primarily lent money to developing economies \u2014 largely in Latin America and Asia \u2014 that experienced a financial crisis.But after the 2008 financial crisis, the I.M.F. turned its attention to Europe. An astonishing 61 percent of the I.M.F.\u2019s loan book is now tied up in Ireland, Portugal and, of course, Greece.The standard prescription in a crisis is a dollop of loans in return for belt-tightening measures.When this analysis is done correctly, the endings tend to be happy. The economy recovers, and the country goes back to the usual method of meeting its financing needs by borrowing on global bond markets, as has happened with Ireland and Portugal.When the analysis is not done correctly, the results can be disastrous. The country goes bust. The I.M.F. is not paid back. And most acutely, citizens end up suffering from the failed policies.Arguably, then, the I.M.F.\u2019s most critical task is figuring out whether or not a country can pay back its loans. That calculation will determine how much the fund pushes pure austerity policies or whether it will also impose losses on lenders to return the economy to health.As an emergency creditor \u2014 the world\u2019s subprime lender, if you will \u2014 the I.M.F. has some failures. Before Greece, the fund\u2019s biggest debacle had been Argentina. The fund lent billions of dollars to the country just before it defaulted in 2001, leading to an economic tailspin. It took years for Argentina to come out of it.The rule decreed that the fund would hand out money only if there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that the applicant could make good on the loan.In May 2010, Greece would be the first test of this new rule.From the outset, most of the fund\u2019s senior staff concluded it was highly unlikely that Greece could pay the money back, given its voluminous debts and dysfunctional economy.Several top officials went so far as to push for an immediate debt \u201chaircut\u201d \u2014 a permanent loss to the lenders \u2014 in secret meetings with their European counterparts, according to Mr. Blustein\u2019s recounting of those events.But the fund, then under the leadership of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, wanted to get back into the bailout game. Having hit a low of $9 billion in 2007, I.M.F. lending had been slowly ticking up through 2010. Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was known to have his eye on the French presidency, was not going to miss an opportunity to play a central role in resolving the European debt crisis.So the I.M.F. made a last-minute adjustment to its \u201cno more Argentinas\u201d decree. It would approve the loan request under a new \u201csystemic exemption.\u201d That is, the fund could justify the loan if it would prevent a broad financial panic.Greece seemed to fit that exemption. The bailout request came less than two years after Lehman Brothers had failed. The global economy was still in a precarious state, and European debt markets had been rattled by Greece\u2019s troubles. With the European Central Bank not yet ready to use its ability to print money to intervene, the fund decided to back Greece in spite of its disastrous finances.It was a controversial decision. The bailout was a salvation for bond investors, namely large European banks, which owned the majority of Greek debt. But the Greek people would have to pay, as the country was required to institute severe budget cuts and tax increases to make the debt numbers add up. The immediate halt in government spending had a devastating effect in an economy dependent on state largess. Unemployment soared, suicide rates jumped, and pensioners took to begging on the streets.The fund, nonetheless, produced optimistic reports about the outlook for Greece. (Since 2010, the fund\u2019s growth estimates missed the mark by a cumulative 25 percent, a forecasting error of such a magnitude that the fund\u2019s chief economist was forced to acknowledge in 2013 that the I.M.F. had underestimated the extent to which austerity policies could sink an economy.)By 2012, Greece would need a second bailout, and this time fund officials were able to convince their European partners that bond investors must contribute to the rescue by accepting steep losses on their investments. In addition, they extracted a commitment from Europe that it would take steps to reduce Greece\u2019s debt in the coming years.With all the hoopla of the second bailout, this clause drew little notice, but for the I.M.F. it was a victory of sorts, as it gave voice to what officials had been saying internally: The time would come when Europe would have to take a hit on its Greek loans.By mid-2014, Greece had made some progress. Excluding interest paid on its debt, its budget had reversed from a 10 percent deficit to a slight surplus.The government was again able to tap global markets for cash, and Greek banks raised billions of dollars in New York and London.That July, Rishi Goyal, a senior member of the I.M.F.\u2019s Greek team based in Washington, hailed the achievement in a speech in Athens.Privately, however, fund officials were voicing doubts to their European partners over whether Greek politicians, notorious for their free-spending ways, could maintain fiscal discipline.Mr. Thomsen, the head of the I.M.F.\u2019s European department, was among the most skeptical. A career technocrat from Denmark with a blunt manner, he had put together the original Greek program in 2010 and had become frustrated with Greece\u2019s reluctance to follow through with reforms.In particular, Mr. Thomsen was infuriated when the Greek prime minister at the time, Antonis Samaras, fired Harry Theoharis, a crusading young reformer in the Greek finance ministry.Mr. Theoharis had the enthusiastic support of the I.M.F. to retool the country\u2019s deplorable tax system. With the government backtracking on reforms, the country\u2019s small surplus disappeared.In January of this year, the anti-austerity party of Alexis Tsipras came to power. By April, negotiations over debt repayment had stalled, the government was hemorrhaging cash, and the economy was at a standstill.On Easter Sunday, Yanis Varoufakis, who had become Greece\u2019s finance minister, flew to Washington to meet with Mr. Thomsen and Christine Lagarde, who became the I.M.F.\u2019s chief in 2011, and threatened to stop payment on more than a billion dollars in loans that were soon coming due.Relations between fund officials and the Greeks had reached their nadir. Mr. Tsipras said that the fund had \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the crisis, and Mr. Varoufakis was telling people that Mr. Thomsen\u2019s work in Greece would go down in history as the I.M.F.\u2019s greatest failure.Yet having run the numbers, the fund now accepted the central argument being made by Mr. Varoufakis: Greece was bankrupt and needed debt relief from Europe to survive.The fund was also feeling the pressure from the non-European members of its board who questioned the huge commitment to Greece (currently about $15 billion) relative to the small size of its economy.Ms. Lagarde and David Lipton, her top deputy, became more insistent, pressing European nations that economic reforms alone were not enough and that a debt restructuring would be needed as well.In late April, Mr. Thomsen took up the issue once more at a critical meeting of European finance ministers in Riga, Latvia.Two months later, Ms. Lagarde found herself at the Brussels meeting of European finance ministers, with the country\u2019s future in the eurozone hanging in the balance.The Europeans were pressuring Mr. Varoufakis to agree to an austerity-loaded debt deal that he was resisting.I have a question for Christine, he said. Can the I.M.F. formally state in this meeting that this proposal we are being asked to sign will make the Greek debt sustainable?She could not. And when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and lead negotiator for Europe, cut off all discussion of debt relief, the die was cast.Back at I.M.F. headquarters in Washington, the decision was unanimous: It would go public with its assessment that Greece\u2019s debt situation was hopeless.The 19 countries of the euro area make up the I.M.F.\u2019s largest shareholder base, but as the world\u2019s financial watchdog, the fund also represents 169 other nations.If the I.M.F. wants to be seen as an international, as opposed to a European, monetary fund, it must prove that it can speak with an independent voice. And if that means arguing that Europe, its senior partner in these talks, needs to take a loss on its loans \u2014 well, so be it.Many have commended the fund for going public with its views. But the release of its debt reports has not yet had any practical effect.The latest bailout is heavy on austerity measures like privatization of power companies and seaports, reduced pensions and tax increases in shipping and tourism, and says nothing about debt relief.\u201cThis is old wine in a new bottle,\u201d said Megan E. Greene, chief economist at Manulife in Boston. \u201cI see very little chance that the bailout will succeed \u2014 it\u2019s too much like the other ones.\u201dWould it have made a difference if the fund had officially broken with Europe in the spring, when it began to conclude that the Greek debt had become unmanageable?But she argues that by not forcing creditors to take a loss back in 2010, the pain has been borne almost exclusively by the Greeks themselves, and not by bond investors.\u201cThe fund should have pushed for a restructuring then,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, after all, is its job \u2014 to assess the risks and say whether or not the debt is sustainable.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year that Christine Lagarde became chief of the International Monetary Fund. It was in 2011, not late 2013. The article also misspelled the given name of the chief economist at Manulife. She is Megan E. Greene, not Meghan.Advertisement"}

This year, the youngest actor is 3, the oldest 72.\u201cIt\u2019s an obsession in Sordevolo,\u201d said Celestino Fogliano, the current director of the Passion, which is performed here every five years, consuming the town for the play\u2019s run and many months before. \u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA.\u201dThis year is the play\u2019s 200th anniversary in the town.Like most of Sordevolo\u2019s residents, Mr. Fogliano, an engineer, boasts a prestigious Passion pedigree, having started as a 5-year-old angel in the 1960 performance, then graduating to speaking parts.\u201cI am a former Christ,\u201d he said, adding that the lead role was \u201ca family thing.\u201d His great-grandfather played Jesus in 1870, and his son played Jesus in a children\u2019s version.Yes, there is a children\u2019s version of Christ\u2019s agony, the town\u2019s spring training camp for a tradition that remains very much alive despite Europe\u2019s shift toward greater secularism, which is palpable through declining church attendance in Italy.Passion plays continue throughout Europe, though the fortunes of this form of popular piety have ebbed since it was introduced in medieval times. Just last month, 90 Passion groups from 15 European countries met in Sordevolo for the 31st annual Europassion conference.Most Passion plays are linked to the week leading up to Easter, but in Sordevolo, the ritual gradually migrated to later in the spring, and then summer for an extended run.The text used for Sordevolo\u2019s Passion was written in the 15th century, and scholars still do not agree on how it arrived here. Though the story it recounts is familiar to many, the language is ornate and difficult to follow, even for some native Italian speakers.\u201cWe act with our hearts more than technique, but the value is in its popular nature,\u201d said Guido Galassi, a workplace-security expert by day and the actor portraying the Good Thief by night. Most Sordevolo residents know the text by heart, he added.A procession along the town\u2019s main street precedes each performance, and residents line the sidewalks to cheer on their neighbors. Devotion to Sordevolo\u2019s Passion remains strong even among people who move away.This is the second time that Marco Caldi, a surfing and scuba-diving instructor who plays Jesus, has returned to his hometown from Bali, Indonesia, where he has lived for the past six years, to take part in the Passion despite an almost paralyzing stage fright.\u201cI\u2019ve been attacked by 10-meter sharks, and I\u2019ve been tossed around in storms, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the fear I feel in front of the public,\u201d Mr. Caldi said. \u201cThe only time I really relax is when I die on the cross.\u201dOver the years, Sordevolo has heightened its showmanship with grander sets, more elaborate choreography involving charging horses, and the construction in 2004 of a 2,400-seat amphitheater to keep spectators out of the rain.\u201cOberammergau is a whole other ballgame,\u201d said Carlo Pedrazzo, the president of the Popular Theater Association of Sordevolo, which finances and coordinates the Passion and is the heir of the committees of residents that have been running the show since 1850. \u201cIt\u2019s big business; we know that goal is far away.\u201dOther locals point out, not always kindly, that Oberammergau\u2019s residents are paid to take part and that profits are divided at the end of the run. In Sordevolo, the only paid actors are the 14 horses used by the Romans to periodically charge across the stage, and the profits are used for charity.That said, Sordevolo admires how Oberammergau has been able to market its Passion, which drew about 500,000 visitors to its most recent staging, in 2010. Sordevolo\u2019s brought in 40,000.That same year, the Popular Theater Association of Sordevolo entered into a partnership with an American tour operator to increase foreign visitors, and so far, nearly 40 American groups have booked tickets for this year\u2019s shows.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money,\u201d Mr. Galassi said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making the Passion known outside Italy.\u201dMoney from tourists, local officials say, could also help offset the crisis that Sordevolo and surrounding towns have been facing since the textile industry that propped up the local economy took a downturn a few years ago.\u201cThe textile industry is dying, so we invested in culture,\u201d said Sordevolo\u2019s mayor, Riccardo Lunardon. \u201cWe said let the Passion grow, and with it the town will grow.\u201dOver the years, the city transformed a number of abandoned homes into bed-and-breakfasts, and a museum was created to house artifacts of past Passions.In off years, the Passion amphitheater is used for concerts. It has also become the site of an annual international motorcycle rally, which this year was titled \u201cBlood, Sweat, Beer, and Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll.\u201dThough the local church has always given its benediction to Sordevolo\u2019s Passion, the play is very much a civic affair. \u201cThe parish has always been marginal; this was set up as a lay institution,\u201d Mr. Pedrazzo said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t chosen to participate because they go to church.\u201dIn fact, casting is the only \u201cdelicate moment\u201d of the entire process, when the town\u2019s acclaimed harmony is put to the test.\u201cGossip is part of the history of the Passion,\u201d Mr. Pedrazzo said diplomatically.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Court Reinstates Home Care Pay Rules ", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe regulations, struck down by a lower court about nine months ago, were intended to remove an exemption in federal minimum wage and overtime laws for home care workers employed by third-party staffing agencies. A three-judge appellate panel in Washington ruled Friday that the Labor Department has the authority to eliminate the exemption.Labor law specialists, noting that Democratic administrations have been trying to eliminate the exemption since the early 1990s, called the ruling momentous. \u201cIt\u2019s not that surprising, since it\u2019s absolutely correct as a legal matter,\u201d said Kate Andrias, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. \u201cBut it has an extremely important effect on the home care industry, home care workers, which is a lot of people.\u201dProfessor Andrias added that the ruling represented a major victory in the administration\u2019s effort to revise labor regulations to reflect the economy today.Union leaders and advocates were also quick to embrace the decision. \u201cThis is an enormous step forward for home workers and for our country,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, which has pushed for the change for decades.The Labor Department created the exemption in 1975, while carrying out a law that Congress passed the year before. But the Obama administration argued that much had changed in the industry since the mid-1970s, when most patients received professional care in institutional settings, or received less-demanding care at home, known as \u201ccompanionship\u201d services, from workers they hired directly. Today, professional home care is widespread and is typically provided by employees of staffing agencies.\u201cWhat the court recognized is that Congress intended this exemption to apply to people who do casual work, not people doing home care work as a full-time vocation or job,\u201d said Peter Romer-Friedman, deputy director of litigation at the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.A lawyer for the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, one of the industry groups that challenged the new regulations, indicated that the plaintiff did not consider the fight over. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing the decision and considering all our options, including Supreme Court review,\u201d said the lawyer, William A. Dombi of the Center for Health Care Law, which is backed by the home care and hospice industry.But the circuit court decision may be difficult to reverse. In its opinion, the court relied on a Supreme Court case from 2007 explicitly ruling that the 1974 law gives the Labor Department discretion over how to define the exemption, as long as the department\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.The Supreme Court held that \u201cCongress had granted authority to the department to resolve the issue,\u201d the circuit court wrote in its opinion Friday. It also said that the Labor Department interpretation in question was reasonable.Instead of appealing directly to the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs could also file a motion with the District of Columbia Circuit for a so-called rehearing en banc, which would involve all of its active judges rather than simply a three-judge panel. But the circuit rarely grants such motions, and the unanimous ruling by the panel, which included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, suggests that the full court would be unlikely to reverse it, legal specialists said.While the decision does not directly affect the status of other administration regulations that are likely to face litigation \u2014 most prominently its recent proposed expansion of overtime benefits to millions of workers by narrowing exemptions to the law \u2014 it suggests that the legal basis for such regulations is sound.Mr. Romer-Friedman, a former labor counsel to Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said the opinion showed that the Labor Department, \u201cwhen interpreting statutory provisions not specifically defined\u201d by the Fair Labor Standards Act, \u201chas a lot of discretion and authority.\u201dIf anything, he said, the courts are more likely to uphold the proposed overtime rule than the Labor Department\u2019s home care worker regulation, because the department has been issuing similar changes in the overtime exemption for professional, managerial and administrative employees for decades, whereas in this case the major previous rule cut in the opposite direction.But more important than the narrow legal implications for other Labor Department regulations may be the way that politics and the law interact on such questions.\u201cFor the department\u2019s authority to interpret its own statutes to be affirmed in a highly contested case that\u2019s one piece of a series of important moves it has made to benefit low wage workers is a big victory,\u201d Professor Andrias said. \u201cPolitics matter a lot. Both this rule and the overtime rule are staunchly opposed by industry. That can affect the way the courts understand legal issues.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attracting Young, Diverse Mortgage Bankers", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesThe Radius Financial Group, a mortgage lender in Norwell, Mass., recently made a $1 million investment in its future. The outlay wasn\u2019t for technology, marketing or even office space. Rather, the company executives decided the future well-being of Radius depends upon its ability to attract younger employees from more diverse backgrounds. So they started what they call the Next Generation Independent Mortgage Banker training program, and hired a young Marine captain to lead the initiative. In May, about two dozen candidates became the first to enter the 12-week immersion program, which paid them a base salary. And this month, 13 of these candidates graduated. Of them, six are veterans from the military, one is black and two are Hispanic, according to Keith Polaski, the chief operating officer and a founder of Radius. \u201cFor about five years, the industry has been talking about the mortgage banking demographics: 55-plus-year-old white guys and gals,\u201d Mr. Polaski said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something about creating the next generation of mortgage bankers, we\u2019re going to old ourselves right out of business.\u201d\u201cThere are people of color and ethnicity who want opportunity in their jobs, who want to grow, and helping to train them is one area that we could do better in,\u201d said Jason Madiedo, the president and chief executive of Alterra Home Loans in Las Vegas, and a past president of the Hispanic real estate group. At Alterra, Mr. Madiedo has made a point of hiring a sales force that is predominantly Hispanic, with an average age under 40, to serve a largely Hispanic clientele. But the industry in general, he said, \u201cis very, very weak\u201d in terms of \u201cunderstanding the nuances and needs of the Hispanic consumer.\u201dJust getting young people interested in the business is a challenge, because of the stigma around mortgage bankers from the recent housing market collapse, Mr. Polaski said. \u201cThe entire world financial crisis was hung around our necks,\u201d he said, turning off many young adults who graduated from college during that time. Jethro Anilus, 22, said he used to associate mortgage banking with \u201can older generation, suits, ties, deception, lying, cheating, stealing.\u201d But coming out of college with no firm career plan, he saw the Radius training program as a welcome opportunity to develop new skills. Learning about the history of mortgage banking, its role in the economy and how a loan is produced gave him a more positive mind-set, Mr. Anilus said.

{"Headline": "Myanmar\u2019s Best Hope for Peace", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 Myanmar is one step away from a historic deal that could end seven decades of internal armed conflict. On Aug. 6-7 representatives of the Myanmar government, including from the armed forces, met with leaders of the country\u2019s ethnic armed groups and finalized the text of the Nationwide Cease-Fire Agreement.The N.C.A. took a year and a half of negotiations \u2014 I helped advise the government during that time \u2014 and required difficult compromises on all sides. It is no simple truce, but rather a complex set of military and political undertakings. It also provides early measures to begin comprehensive political talks about constitutional reform and the long-divisive issue of federalism, and about a formal peace agreement that would permanently end the war.The only outstanding question is which groups exactly will become parties to the N.C.A. The government insists that the agreement should initially be signed only by the 15 armed groups with which it already has bilateral cease-fire agreements. It also wants to exclude three small ethnic armed groups the army has clashed with recently, as well as a few unarmed ethnic organizations.Much now rests on the willingness of the 15 main groups to sign on to the plan. The Kachin Independence Army fought pitched battles with the government as recently as 2012 and feelings are still raw. The United Wa State Army, which enjoys full autonomy in the territory it controls, is worried about losing its privileges.At this critical moment, the international community should throw its full weight behind the N.C.A. and stand ready to assist in its speedy implementation. Myanmar cannot move forward, with either democratization or economic development, without a formal and permanent halt to the fighting.Myanmar (then Burma) achieved independence from Britain in 1948. The civil war broke out within months, pitting the government first against a communist insurgency, then against an array of other rebellions, mostly involving ethnic minorities. Today, there are hundreds of village militias and well over a dozen ethnic armed groups \u2014 the most powerful of which, the United Wa State Army, has at least 20,000 armed fighters. War has become a way of life along the borders with China and Thailand. Truces have been made and broken. Distrust still runs high on all sides.With Myanmar just a few months away from a general election, the window of opportunity to make peace may close soon. Political energy is already turning toward the campaign and the selection of presidential candidates. A collapse in the N.C.A. process could trigger an upsurge in violence, which is the last thing Myanmar needs with its democratic transition still in the balance and the economy only just moving forward. Were there to be a retreat now, it would take many years to get back to this point.On the other hand, if the N.C.A. is signed over the coming few weeks, the upcoming election could give the peace process more momentum. Certainly, a cease-fire and the beginning of comprehensive political talks would be a boon to Myanmar\u2019s next government.The N.C.A. will consolidate the 15 bilateral cease-fires already in place. Under the agreement, all sides undertake to adopt a military code of conduct and establish a Joint Monitoring Committee to investigate and adjudicate any future clashes. Some parts of the accord are designed to prevent fresh fighting by establishing liaison offices for the various armed groups and carefully demarcating their areas of control. Others are meant to improve living conditions for the hundreds of thousands of people in conflict-affected areas, through joint projects to promote health, education and even environmental conservation, and to manage the return of displaced people.As soon as the agreement is signed, the ethnic armed groups will no longer be considered illegal, allowing them to associate with political parties. Discussions on the comprehensive political dialogue could then begin, not just among the belligerents, but also within the political establishment, including civil society associations and opposition parties like the National League for Democracy.The N.C.A. states that the political talks will focus on the creation of a federal system of government. This, too, is a major accomplishment, considering that the army has long equated federalism with separatism and the word \u201cfederalism\u201d itself was virtually taboo in official circles until a few years ago.The one remaining hurdle is uncertainty about which groups may or will sign the N.C.A. Three small organizations that have no arms are not invited to join the N.C.A., although they will be able to participate in the political dialogue. The government fears that allowing them to sign the agreement would prompt similar demands from a slew of other political organizations.The government also insists that the Arakan Army, the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army \u2014 with which the army has been fighting over the past several months in the northeastern part of the country \u2014 each come to some bilateral agreement with the government (as the 15 main groups have done) before they can sign the N.C.A.Among the 15 groups that are invited to join the N.C.A., views vary. The Karen National Union, the oldest and one of the largest ethnic armed groups, has declared its intention to endorse the deal. So have the Restoration Council of the Shan State and two Karen groups. But the Kachin Independence Army and the United Wa State Army have seemed reluctant. The situation is changing daily, however, and a meeting of ethnic armed groups is expected to take place on Friday.At this precarious juncture, the international community needs to state, far more clearly and loudly than it has, that it supports the N.C.A. and stands ready to provide the assistance necessary for its full implementation. An array of activities, from clearing land mines to setting up the Joint Monitoring Committee, will require technical assistance and funding from abroad, and fast. There should be a coordinated response, involving not only the United Nations and Western donors like the European Union, Switzerland and Norway, but also China, India and Japan.The N.C.A. is a remarkable achievement. It is a major step toward ending one of the most intractable conflicts in Asia. And it comes at a sensitive time in Myanmar\u2019s progress toward greater democratization. It deserves far more attention and support than it has received so far.Thant Myint-U, a historian, has been an adviser to the Myanmar government on the peace process since 2011.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to Riyadh-Sur-Mer", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the 79-year old Saudi monarch, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, picked the French Riviera as his summer vacation spot this year, he probably had in mind a few quiet, secluded weeks in his sprawling mansion overlooking the Mediterranean.Overlooking, however, was the problem. Tucked on a long, narrow strip of land between the railroad and the sea, the Ch\u00e2teau de l\u2019Aurore, better known locally as King Fahd\u2019s Villa, towers over the water, which laps its foundation six meters below. This is where Rita Hayworth married Prince Aly Khan in 1949, well before King Fahd bought the estate in 1979.At the end of the estate, there is a tiny sand beach, but no private access to it. The only way to reach La Mirandole, as the beach is called, is to negotiate a spiral staircase off the road, then to walk through a small tunnel under the railway. Hardly a promenade fit for a king.So on July 10, two workers emerged at La Mirandole to pour a large concrete slab on the beach. Grilled by the locals, the workers disclosed plans for an elevator, so that the king could access the beach directly from his villa. The next day they drilled holes in the walls of the tunnel to close it off with a gate.Then all hell broke loose. Swimmers, sunbathers, fishermen and nudists who enjoy an even smaller beach close by rose up in arms against monarchical privilege. Somehow, the Saudi king\u2019s courtiers had forgotten how the French had disposed of their own royal family more than two centuries ago.The mayor of Vallauris, Michelle Salucki, requested the intervention of the sous-pr\u00e9fet of Grasse, the local representative of the French government. Like all beaches in France, La Mirandole is a public beach; in clear violation of the law, it was being commandeered for private use. So the sous-pr\u00e9fet, Philippe Castanet, dutifully ordered a halt to the construction work.This is how La Mirandole became an \u201caffaire d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d While in Vienna negotiators were closing in on a historic deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, in Vallauris crucial talks were under way to save French-Saudi relations. And as in Vienna, geopolitics were key. France is, after all, Saudi Arabia\u2019s new best friend.Ever since President Barack Obama bitterly disappointed America\u2019s Saudi ally on a dramatic August weekend two years ago by refusing to attack Syria, Paris and Riyadh have enjoyed a honeymoon of sorts. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande had also felt let down by Washington: He had been advocating a hard line on Syria, convinced that powerful new evidence of the use of chemical weapons by the regime of Bashar al-Assad justified an allied military intervention. Prime Minister David Cameron had to bow out after failing to get his Parliament\u2019s approval, and Germany had no interest in joining a military operation. Only French military jets were ready to take off. But then President Obama, in a spectacular U-turn, chose to forget his warning to Damascus that the \u201cred line\u201d of chemical weapons was not to be crossed. Military action was put on hold.Now the Saudis have a fresh reason to give the cold shoulder to America. For years they have been alarmed by the prospect of a multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran, the great Shiite rival of Sunni Saudi Arabia. It did not go unnoticed in Riyadh that in those negotiations France always displayed a firmer approach toward Iran than did the United States.As a Saudi minister once told me, after I pointed out how surprised I was to hear disparaging comments about the United States coming from such a staunch American ally: \u201cIt is not because we are in bed together that we have to enjoy it.\u201d So every time the Saudis don\u2019t find their relationship with Washington so \u201cenjoyable,\u201d they warm up to the French.And why should France reject them? There is a pro-Saudi tradition in French foreign policy, dating back to President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nicolas Sarkozy broke ranks to court Qatar, but Mr. Hollande has picked up the mantle of \u201cFran\u00e7ois of Arabia.\u201d As president, he has already visited the kingdom four times. On May 4 he became the first Western head of state to be invited to a summit of the Gulf countries in Riyadh. Ten days later, half of the same Gulf leaders, including the Saudi king, failed to attend a meeting in Camp David set up by Mr. Obama to try to mend fences.For France, the benefits of such a honeymoon are more than diplomatic: Commercial contracts have been pouring in. Airbus helicopters, Airbus airliners, infrastructure equipment, even a feasibility study into building nuclear reactors: It all looks pretty promising.The defenders of the French Republic in Vallauris appear to have reached the same conclusion. After all, the prospect of a royal entourage of 700 big-spending Saudis coming along for a few weeks cannot do the local economy any harm. The compromise, artfully negotiated, leaves \u201cfor security reasons\u201d the use of the beach to King Salman for the duration of his stay: \u201cWe are talking about the leader of a country at war, and an allied country,\u201d the sous-pr\u00e9fet argued, thus reminding the French that their country is also at war. But after the royal visit, La Mirandole will have to be returned to the regular beachgoers in its original condition, absent elevator and concrete slab.Still indignant, an ecologist local councilor, Jean-No\u00ebl Falcou, proclaimed, \u201cEverything is not for sale,\u201d adding, \u201cA public beach is an inalienable public property, like the \u2018Mona Lisa.\u201d\u2019 A petition to President Hollande he launched on change.org gathered more than 140,000 signatures in two weeks. But by the time King Salman arrived on July 25, protests had mostly died down. \u201cParis is well worth a mass,\u201d Henry of Navarre was reputed to have said in 1593, after converting to Catholicism in order to become Henry IV, King of France. Well, then Riyadh-sur-Mer is well worth a beach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Questions About Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt Troubles", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. How does Puerto Rico compare to Greece? Greece\u2019s financial crisis poses a serious threat to Europe. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund have lent the country hundreds of billions of euros. And the prospect that Greece may exit the eurozone has persistently threatened to destabilize Europe\u2019s economy and the euro currency, driving down global stock markets and sending world leaders scrambling for a solution.Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal problems, while painful to the island\u2019s 3.5 million residents, do not threaten to spill over as broadly. Even as Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds have lost value with a default looming, the larger United States municipal debt market has barely flinched, allowing cities and states on the mainland to keep borrowing. That stability may explain why the federal government, despite providing some technical support and advice to officials in Puerto Rico, has largely stayed on the sidelines of the debt crisis.Another big difference is in the comparative safety nets for these economies. Despite some cutbacks, the United States government continues to pump tens of billions of dollars into Puerto Rico to support health care, subsidized housing and policing. Puerto Rico\u2019s banks are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation plays an outsize role in local law enforcement duties.Greece, by contrast, has been falling with much less of a net. While European leaders have been willing to bail out Greece, their support pales next to the oversight and influence Washington exerts over San Juan. Despite its fiscal problems, the island will continue to benefit from the financial help and other forms of assistance of the United States, which should soften some of the fallout from a default.Q. How is Puerto Rico different from a state?But the lack of statehood is now hurting the island at its time of greatest need. Unlike states, which can authorize their municipalities to declare bankruptcy, Puerto Rico has no such access to bankruptcy courts for its government entities. That has left the island facing a chaotic debt restructuring with no legal referee.While there are proposals on Capitol Hill to give Puerto Rico bankruptcy powers, the island\u2019s status hurts here, too. Puerto Rico\u2019s lone representative in Congress has no vote, which has hampered the bills\u2019 progress.Bailing out a struggling Puerto Rico could create expectations that other troubled local governments around the United States will be saved by loans from Washington. Still, Congress may end up helping in other ways, including through passage of a bankruptcy bill. Even that effort has faced opposition from conservatives who say it amounts to a bailout.Puerto Rico officials have also floated the idea that the Treasury Department could guarantee the island\u2019s debt when it seeks to borrow in the market again \u2014 helping to lower the cost significantly.Q. How did Puerto Rico get here?But all that debt, now totaling $72 billion, couldn\u2019t solve the structural problems in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy: high labor costs and shipping costs, an exodus of educated people to the mainland United States and the expiration of a special federal tax credit meant to attract big corporations to the island and keep them there.Q. Who stands to lose the most from defaults?Another vulnerable group consists of Puerto Rico residents who have sunk much of their wealth into local bonds and decimated their retirement savings.Moreover, a default could prevent Puerto Rico from having access to the debt market for several years, forcing the government to put off projects to build or rebuild bridges, roads, schools and other crucial infrastructure.Advertisement"}

Candidates Take Aim at China as U.S. Markets Tumble", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican presidential candidates began shifting their focus on Monday from the dangers posed by illegal immigrants to a new target: China, whose currency devaluations and stock market plunges are starting to hurt the savings of American investors.One Republican candidate, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, called on President Obama on Monday to cancel his plans to meet in Washington next month with President Xi Jinping of China on what will be his first state visit to the United States. Mr. Walker accused Beijing of a range of offenses that have harmed American interests, including manipulating its economy and currency, carrying out cyberattacks and persecuting Christians.His remarks came after another Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, seized on the 1,000-point decline early Monday of the Dow Jones industrial average and took to Twitter and Instagram to warn that China will \u201cbring us down\u201d and that \u201cthis could get very messy.\u201dMarkets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.The criticism comes at a particularly delicate time for relations between the United States and China. Mr. Obama is expected to use the state visit to press Mr. Xi on such nettlesome issues as Beijing\u2019s aggressive military maneuvers in the South China Sea, cybersecurity, the treatment of American companies in China, and now the decline of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, which is likely to hurt exports.But for candidates like Mr. Walker and Mr. Trump, the criticism may be less politically costly than focusing on immigration. Mr. Trump, in particular, has faced harsh rebukes from others in the party for potentially alienating Latino voters who could be crucial in swing states in the 2016 general election.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican candidate who is a moderate on immigration, joined the criticism of China on Monday by saying that the federal debt \u201chas been given to us in large measure by the Chinese\u201d and that \u201cas the Chinese markets have a correction\u201d it will have an outsized impact on the United States.In calling on Mr. Obama to cancel Mr. Xi\u2019s state visit, Mr. Walker said, \u201cThere\u2019s serious work to be done rather than pomp and circumstance.\u201d\u201cAmericans are struggling to cope with the fall in today\u2019s markets driven in part by China\u2019s slowing economy and the fact that they actively manipulate their economy,\u201d he said in a statement issued Monday afternoon. \u201cRather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests.\u201dBut the issue is a complex and nuanced one. American companies including Apple and major carmakers have seen their fortunes rise recently by catering to the growing Chinese consumer market, with Midwestern manufacturers being a particular beneficiary.Mike Browne, deputy executive director of One Wisconsin Now, a liberal group that has been critical of the governor, noted that Mr. Walker has not canceled the mission. \u201cHe\u2019s paying so little attention to Wisconsin he probably doesn\u2019t know about it, so it would be fun to hear his response.\u201dMr. Trump, who made most of his money in real estate rather than investing, has noted in the past that he has personally benefited from Chinese wealth.\u201cHey, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re stupid. I like China,\u201d he said in announcing his candidacy in June. \u201cI just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them?\u201dIn visiting the United States, a trip agreed upon in February, Mr. Xi is reciprocating for a state visit Mr. Obama made to Beijing last November. There, the two leaders reached an ambitious agreement on controlling carbon emissions, a deal that was meant to provide new impetus for other nations to reduce greenhouse gases.Gerry Mullany reported from New York and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bets That the Fed Will Delay Interest Rate Rise Could Be Premature", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir conclusion is a striking rejection of the Fed\u2019s stated plans \u2014 and it appears premature.The Fed watches financial markets closely, of course. Investors are losing money they might have spent, and falling prices can be an indicator of broader economic problems.But the losses so far probably aren\u2019t big enough to crimp growth, and officials have plenty of time to see what happens next. The Fed\u2019s policy making committee doesn\u2019t meet until mid-September, and it has two more meetings scheduled later this year, in October and December.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.\u201cThe current bout of market turmoil, if it continues, might persuade the Fed to hold off on raising interest rates in September,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Monday. \u201cSince that volatility doesn\u2019t reflect any genuine economic slump, however, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it proved short-lived, leaving the way open for the Fed to begin raising rates at some point this year.\u201dJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said that the Fed wants to raise its benchmark rate slowly over the next several years, gradually reducing its long-running stimulus campaign to bring the economy back to good health. The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008.The Fed has repeatedly delayed the beginning of that process, as economic growth has fallen short of its expectations. But as recently as June, most members of the Fed\u2019s leadership \u2014 15 of the 17 senior officials \u2014 indicated they planned to start raising rates this year.That plan faced considerable skepticism even before the recent market downturn. Inflation has remained persistently sluggish since the Great Recession, even as job growth has strengthened. Some Fed officials cautioned that the central bank had not done enough to raise inflation toward its targeted 2 percent annual pace.Recent events have heightened those misgivings. The decline of oil prices and China\u2019s latest economic stimulus may further damp inflation. The fall of stock prices also reflects concern among some investors about the health of the domestic economy. The share of Americans without jobs remains unusually high and wage growth remains weak, problems that a premature rate increase could worsen.In addition, the International Monetary Fund has expressed concern that the Fed, by raising rates, could increase pressure on developing economies.And the market\u2019s decline helps mitigate worries that low interest rates encourage excessive speculation.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Against that backdrop, more investors are now concluding that the Fed will decide to wait a little longer before raising rates.Measures of expectations derived from asset prices have shifted sharply in recent days. The odds of a September rate increase, by one measure, fell by half, from about 48 percent last week to just 22 percent on Monday. Even more striking, the odds of a rate increase this year fell below 50 percent for the first time.Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, who had predicted a September lift until the recent stock market sell-off, said he now expected the Fed to wait until March.\u201cAlthough we continue to see economic activity in the U.S. as solid and justifying modest rate hikes, we believe the Federal Reserve is unlikely to begin a hiking cycle in this environment for fear that such a move may further destabilize markets,\u201d Mr. Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Fed officials may reach a different conclusion, but the shift in expectations still poses a challenge because officials have said they want markets to be ready for an increase. By minimizing the element of surprise, they hope to minimize volatility.If the Fed wants to convince investors that September is still on the table, time is running short. The most obvious opportunity comes this weekend, when central bankers will gather in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming for an annual policy conference. The Fed\u2019s vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, is scheduled to speak.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Devaluation Hints at China\u2019s Rising Distress Over Economy", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Whenever China\u2019s economy swooned in recent downturns, its currency never buckled. It held steady, or strengthened, even as China\u2019s neighbors or trading partners scrambled to cut the value of their own currencies to deal with the fallout.With the Chinese renminbi now taking its biggest plunge in decades, the worry is that the country\u2019s already slowing economy is even worse off than reported and that the government is panicking. On Thursday, China allowed the renminbi to weaken significantly for a third consecutive day.The situation is shaking the aura of supremacy surrounding President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, which has portrayed a sense of ultimate authority. But the Chinese government\u2019s response to the country\u2019s financial woes is creating concerns about its ability to manage a slowdown.\u201cPeople are used to growth and rising living standards,\u201d said Jonathan Fenby, an author and co-founder of the research firm Trusted Sources. \u201cBut now they are in a \u2018real\u2019 world, and the leadership has to convince them both that slower growth is in their long-term interests and that it is in control.\u201dBy the official measures, the economy is growing at 7 percent, right in line with government targets. It is a steady pace that the leadership has indicated can support decent job growth and put more money into consumers\u2019 pockets.But a look below the surface shows a different, more worrisome picture. Core parts of the economy, like construction, are weaker than ever as the real estate industry struggles. Consumer spending, which was supposed to pick up the slack, is not that strong. And financial services, a major driver of economic growth when the stock market was booming, are slipping.The data coming out of China, too, is somewhat suspect. Economists now wonder whether, despite official figures showing growth, some provinces and regions could be dealing with outright recessions.\u201cTo be honest, no one has a clue where the economy is, and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s properly measured,\u201d said Viktor E. Szabo, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.\u201cDefinitely there is a slowdown,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can have an argument about what level it is, but it\u2019s not 7 percent,\u201d he said, referring to the rate of growth.The government\u2019s aggressive action on the currency has brought the economy into sharp focus.The currency\u2019s official rate, at 6.4 renminbi per dollar, is down 4.4 percent over the last three days. On a typical day, the renminbi rises or falls just a small fraction of a percentage point.While the government said the decision was intended to make the currency more market-oriented, the devaluation also was largely a gift to exporters. In relative terms, it makes China\u2019s shipments of clothing or electronics to consumers in the United States or Europe more affordable.\u201cI don\u2019t see this mini-devaluation as some kind of outrageous act,\u201d said George Magnus, an economic adviser to the bank UBS and an associate at Oxford University\u2019s China center. \u201cBut it is part of an array of other economic and financial stimulus measures designed to shore up the flagging growth rate.\u201dThe government has taken the usual steps by cutting interest rates and freeing up more money for banks to lend. But the leadership has also turned to more unconventional means in recent months to try to cushion the blow as the economy\u2019s once-runaway expansion sinks back to earth.It relaxed a rule that banned investment companies tied to local governments from piling on debt. When the stock market slumped, it aggressively moved to halt the slide, by encouraging borrowing to buy stock and pouring money into the system. It has also pledged tens of billions of dollars in support to state-controlled policy banks for loans to favored projects.China\u2019s plan has been to wean itself off a debt-driven growth model that has led to wasteful, government-led investment. Instead, policy makers want consumers to become the main engine for the economy, but that will take time.They had hoped to maintain growth by keeping credit flowing to favored projects, a nationwide program that amounts to trillions of renminbi worth of investment in new infrastructure. The money is going to redevelop shantytowns and to build wastewater treatment facilities, as well as expand road and rail networks.In the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou, one of China\u2019s least affluent provinces, the local government is building its first subway line. Officials hope to bring in private investment to help finance the project, a 49-kilometer line expected to cost 10 billion renminbi, or about $1.6 billion.But such efforts have not been enough. While infrastructure investment is rising, it has failed to offset the nationwide pullback in spending on new factories and apartment block towers. In July, overall investment in fixed assets rose 11.2 percent, the slowest increase in 15 years.The troubles can be seen in mid-tier cities like Zhanjiang, on the southern coast, which is home to the navy fleet that patrols the South China Sea. While property prices in major metropolises like Shenzhen or Beijing have rebounded, those are exceptions. Prices of new homes in Zhanjiang fell 9.8 percent in June from a year earlier, the most recent data available.China\u2019s builders just are not building as much. For years, double-digit growth was the norm in construction materials, as cities across the country went on a building spree. That situation has reversed sharply, and output of many crucial materials has been declining this year.Cement output fell 5 percent by volume last month, while plate glass production declined 13.5 percent. Steel output fell 1.8 percent in July, the most on record. Exports of steel soared as mills, many of them operating at a loss and unable to find buyers at home, shipped their excess stock overseas.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.Consumers aren\u2019t yet able to shoulder the burden of driving the economy. While incomes are still rising, the job market has started to show signs of stress. Vacancies are declining across the market as companies reduce hiring in response to slowing business growth.The stock market slump has also taken a toll, with the main Shanghai index down about a quarter from its peak two months ago. Ordinary investors have poured money into the markets over the last year, and many are now sitting on losses.The overall result is that consumers are spending less. Retail sales grew 10.5 percent in July from a year earlier, near the slowest pace in a decade. Share prices of big multinationals that sell heavily into the China market, like LVMH, the spirits and luxury goods retailer, or Yum Brands, which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut fast food chains, have suffered since the renminbi\u2019s devaluation.Even homegrown e-commerce companies, held up by China\u2019s leaders as builders of a new economy, have not escaped the rout. Shares in Alibaba, in New York, and Tencent, traded in Hong Kong, have both declined over the last two days.The stock market slump is a double blow. In the first half of the year, the flurry of new share sales, strong brokerage business and other market-related activities helped mask some underlying issues.Without that boost, China\u2019s gross domestic product would have risen notably less than the 7 percent reported rate. Instead, it would have been about 6.2 percent in the second quarter and 6.5 percent in the first, economists at Standard Chartered estimated in a report last month.As the government pumps money into the market and the broader economy, it will help, along with moves like the devaluation. It is just not clear how solid the economy will actually be.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the quality of growth,\u201d said Victor Shih, a China scholar at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIf they want to, they can always achieve the right rate of growth.\u201dThe Chinese government, he added, just needs to find a group of people and \u201ctell them to go dig a ditch.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the decline in the official exchange rate of China\u2019s currency against the dollar over the past three days. It was down 4.4 percent, not 4.7 percent.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Sweden", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate16 PhotosAN ISLAND COMPOUND OFF THE WEST COAST OF SWEDEN20 MILLION KRONOR ($2.44 MILLION) This island property, which dates to 1870, has a total of five bedrooms and about 1,600 square feet of living space divided among a wood-frame main house, two guest cottages and a boathouse with a dock. The site of nearly a quarter-acre also has a private beach. In addition, the buyer will own a one-eighth share of the small island, called Flasko, said Malin Ryling, an agent with Skeppsholmen Sotheby\u2019s International, which is listing the property. The compound was once owned by Theodor Svedberg, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1926, and gave the main house the name of Flava. Mr. Svedberg bought the house in 1940 and decorated it in the style it retains today. He sold it to a colleague in 1963, and it has remained in that family since then, Ms. Ryling said.The island is reached only by boat, typically from the town of Fjallbacka, about a 15-minute trip, Ms. Ryling said. Visitors approach the property from a private dock with an 840-square-foot boathouse that has a sauna and a utility space on the first floor, and a cabinlike bedroom on the second floor with two single beds.The interiors of the two-story main house feature beadboard wainscoting, stained wood-plank flooring and wood paneling painted in soft colors that enhance the sense of being on the ocean. The house does not have central heating, but there is a wood stove on the second floor. The toilet facilities for the compound consist of a composting outhouse, as there is no sewage service on the island.On the first floor of the main house are a simple kitchen with an electric oven, a refrigerator/freezer and a sink; a dining area; a master bedroom and a guest bedroom. A corner window in the kitchen offers expansive views over the water. The open-plan second floor is one large room, with skylights, exposed ceiling beams and built-in shelving. The space is set up with areas for reading, dining or relaxing. An office nook looks out on the water.There are two guest cottages, one of which has a shower and sink, and a bedroom with water views. The other guesthouse has a simple kitchen and a bedroom/living area with a fireplace.Fjallbacka is about a 90-minute drive from Gothenburg, Sweden, and about two hours\u2019 drive from Oslo, Norway.MARKET OVERVIEWThe resort area on the west coast of Sweden \u2014 from the Norwegian border south to Gothenburg \u2014 is known for its rocky coves, innumerable islands and pocket beaches. It is dotted with former fishing towns characterized by clapboard houses that tumble down to the waters of the Skagerrak, the strait that borders Norway, Sweden and Denmark.The fishing industry has largely disappeared in the years since World War II, and the area is now a vacation spot, populated in the summer by Swedes from Gothenburg, Stockholm and other cities, as well as Norwegians from the Oslo area.The most desirable properties are older houses, perhaps built by prosperous fishing captains, with waterfront and boating access, agents said. However, strict regulations on waterfront development have kept the supply low, and properties tend to remain in families for several generations. As a result, waterfront prices are relatively high, starting at about $600,000 for small seasonal cottages and rising to several million dollars for more substantial year-round houses on larger plots.At the lower end, cottages inland can be had for under $100,000. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I like about this area: The market is so versatile,\u201d said Phillip Loewen, the owner of the Lysekil office of Fastighetsbyran, a real estate company. But, he said, \u201cAs soon as you come down to the water, the prices can shoot into the sky.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen interest rates this low,\u201d Mr. Loewen said. \u201cYou can get a loan for 1.2 or 1.3 percent\u201d for a 30- or 40-year term. During the recession, the government tightened lending standards and now requires a 15 percent down payment. But at the same time, the central bank has continued to cut key lending rates \u2014 pushing mortgage rates lower and lower.WHO BUYS IN SWEDENSwedes make up the primary market on the west coast, but it is also a favorite spot of Norwegians from Oslo, who can take advantage of an easy drive south, with Gothenburg about two hours away. Buyers in recent years have also come from Germany, Denmark and the United States.\u201cMost of our buyers are Swedish people who live abroad, from London, New York or Munich, for example,\u201d said Mathias Martinsson of Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cThey are buying vacation homes where they grew up or where they have family still.\u201dBUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers, agents said. However, those seeking to obtain a mortgage, which cannot be more than 85 percent of the house\u2019s value, will need a tax identification number. The main transaction cost is a 1.5 percent transfer tax on the sales price. Lawyers are not necessary, with real estate agents handling all aspects of the sale.\u201cAll real estate agents here have the education to make deals,\u201d said Leif Fourong of Svenskfast, a Swedish real estate company. \u201cPeople don\u2019t use lawyers. It\u2019s easy to buy property here.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESSwedish; krona (1 krona = $0.12)TAXES AND FEESTaxes on this property are about $800 a year, Ms. Ryling said.

But Puerto Rico is a territory, subject to the whim of the federal government. Congress has chosen to cap funding for Puerto Rico under programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance, and excluded Puerto Rico from other programs like supplemental security income and the earned income tax credit.Thus, it is not generally the case that more dollars flow from Washington to San Juan as need increases in the territory.The real-world consequences of Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis have been tempered only because my constituents, who are American citizens, are moving in huge numbers to the mainland, where they qualify for equal treatment under all federal programs.When will Mr. Krugman and others comprehend that the source of Puerto Rico\u2019s economic problems \u2014 which date back decades \u2014 is the inequality inherent in our territory status?PEDRO R. PIERLUISISan Juan, P.R. The writer, a Democrat, is Puerto Rico\u2019s delegate in Congress.To the Editor:Paul Krugman is right that Puerto Rico is not Greece. But he doesn\u2019t mention several important reasons this is the case.Even after engaging in deficit spending, the island and its municipalities spend less as a percentage of G.D.P. (about 11 percent) than all American states and their local governments. The results are deficient public investment in infrastructure, education, transportation, hygiene and public safety. These are all vital considerations for residents and investors.Lavish tax exemptions and absurdly low real property taxes are gaping holes in the territory\u2019s tax base. Multinationals and wealthy people are virtually untouched, so the government has borrowed its way into a deep hole.At the same time, the island government failed to develop alternatives to manufacturing. The most evident mistake is the lack of sufficient investment in infrastructure for tourism and entertainment, sectors that remain grossly underdeveloped but that hold immense untapped potential. DAVID R. MARTINTo the Editor:Paul Krugman notes that \u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s low rate of labor force participation probably has more to do with outmigration than with welfare: when job opportunities dry up, young, able-bodied workers move elsewhere, while the least employable stay in place.\u2019\u2019Then he asks, \u201cAnd how terrible is that, really?\u201dI would submit that is the problem with the modern welfare state. In the long term, this phenomenon of having the least employable stay in place will break the fabric of society, create a culture that most employers would not consider optimum: decreasing the likelihood of new employment opportunities.But then, John Maynard Keynes is famous for the quote \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d so I guess that the modern welfare state is concerned only with short-term consequences.BART BINNINGEdmond, Okla.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "V&A Asks, What Is Luxury?", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When thinking about luxury, what comes to mind? For some people, it is a pair of Rupert Sanderson\u2019s 24-karat gold-leafed shoes. For others, the time to take a bubble bath. For a child it might be ice cream seven times a week. For the mother, a week at a Canyon Ranch resort and spa.The notions of luxury and how they have altered throughout the ages is the subject of the \u201cWhat Is Luxury\u201d exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In partnership with Britain\u2019s Crafts Council, the show, which runs through Sept. 27, aims to challenge the perceptions of luxury, its curators say.Prompted by the widening disparity between the haves and have-nots, the exhibition questions whether luxury is still based solely on acquisition of objects with innate material value, or has society evolved to demand that luxury have some social responsibility, be it championing traditional skills in danger of disappearing, or encouraging innovation, or even making the world a better place for all? \u201cWith this exhibition, our intention is not to provide a definitive answer about luxury today,\u201d said Leanne Wierzba, one of the show\u2019s curators, \u201cbut rather to engage our visitors in this fascinating and open-ended subject and provide an opportunity to reflect on their own ideas about luxury and value.\u201dThe exhibition offers up more than 100 items, ranging from an 18th-century Portuguese gold crown with diamonds, emerald and rubies to a chandelier made in 2011 of bronze wires, LED lights and dandelion seeds.While in the past luxury could be defined by the cost of the materials used, these days it often rests on looser constructions \u2014 like time, craftsmanship and resourcefulness.\u201cPost-recession, we saw a resurgence of the luxury industry,\u201d Ms. Wierzba said of the years after the 2008 financial crash. She and her co-curator, Jana Scholze, also pointed out an increased \u201cproliferation of marketing around craftsmanship, with photography of things being hand-made,\u201d like stitching a leather handbag or assembling a watch.The show also looks at the foundations of luxury: creativity, craftsmanship and time.While the Portuguese crown of gold and gems is a traditional representation of luxury, the dandelion chandelier by Studio Drift, a design studio in Amsterdam, exemplifies the value of craft, innovation and the time spent to make the chandelier. Ms. Wierzba said the chandelier was part of the exhibition because \u201cit\u2019s an extraordinary object, unique and visionary. It\u2019s experimental and risk-taking. And it requires an investment of time.\u201dOther objects on display include a rhinestone-studded monkey astride a treasure chest, a 17th-century tea set, a modern-day leather briefcase inlaid with a floral design in brass that took 300 hours to make, a Venetian lace chasuble from 1670 to 1695, echoing back to a time when some luxury items first became available to the masses, \u201cduring the consumer revolution of the 17th century,\u201d Ms. Wierzba said.There are examples of modern-day luxury items as well, like a Vacheron Constantin watch and an Herm\u00e8s saddle, which were chosen for their hand-craftsmanship. The idea of time as a luxury is presented in an installation called \u201cTime for Yourself\u201d by Marcin Rusak. It shows a compass spinning in random directions and a watch without a dial. Mr. Rusak, who collaborated on the installation with the designer Iona Inglesby, said \u201cit is almost impossible to get truly lost these days. It would take a lot of effort to experience this luxury.\u201dThe show also explores the social and environmental costs of luxury. \u201cIssues related to global warming, over-extraction of resources and the growing pressures of economy pose a threat to our desire for precious materials and things,\u201d Ms. Wierzba said. \u201cDesigners today have an important role to play in identifying alternatives.\u201dA case in point is plastic. The designer Gangjian Cui imagines that once humans have depleted the world\u2019s petroleum resources, plastic will be considered a luxury. He has created a delicate side table, on view here, that uses it sparingly, by extruding slender strands of plastic. On another front, the British-Japanese design firm Studio Swine in London uses human hair combined with a resin to create a vanity set that looks as if it were made of endangered materials, like horn and tropical woods.For one of the exhibits, the museum\u2019s staff had to wear hazmat suits to install \u201cRare Earthenware,\u201d an installation of three urns made of radioactive mud taken from a lake in Inner Mongolia, around which about 2.5 million people live. The exhibit (created by Unknown Fields Division and the ceramicist Kevin Callaghan) is meant to highlight the amount of waste created in the production of technology.

{"Headline": "The V.C.s of B.C.", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyAt the city gate, Assur-idi ran into a younger acquaintance, Sharrum-Adad, who said he was heading on the same journey. He offered to take the older man\u2019s donkeys with him and ship the profits back. The two struck a hurried agreement and wrote it up, though they forgot to record some details. Later, Sharrum-\u00adAdad claimed he never knew how many textiles he had been given. Assur-idi spent the subsequent weeks sending increasingly panicked letters to his sons in Kanesh, demanding they track down Sharrum-Adad and claim his profits.These letters survive as part of a stunning, nearly miraculous window into ancient economics. In general, we know few details about economic life before roughly 1000 A.D. But during one 30-year period \u2014 between 1890 and 1860 B.C. \u2014 for one community in the town of Kanesh, we know a great deal. Through a series of incredibly unlikely events, archaeologists have uncovered the comprehensive written archive of a few hundred traders who left their hometown Assur, in what is now Iraq, to set up importing businesses in Kanesh, which sat roughly at the center of present-day Turkey and functioned as the hub of a massive global trading system that stretched from Central Asia to Europe. Kanesh\u2019s traders sent letters back and forth with their business partners, carefully written on clay tablets and stored at home in special vaults. Tens of thousands of these records remain. One economist recently told me that he would love to have as much candid information about businesses today as we have about the dealings \u2014 and in particular, about the trading practices \u2014 of this 4,000-year-old community.Trade is central to every key economic issue we face. Whether the subject is inequality, financial instability or the future of work, it all comes down to a discussion of trade: trade of manufactured goods with China, trade of bonds with Europe, trade over the Internet or enabled by mobile apps. For decades, economists have sought to understand how trade works. Can we shape trade to achieve different outcomes, like a resurgence of manufacturing or a lessening of inequality? Or does trade operate according to fairly fixed rules, making it resistant to conscious planning?Economists, creating models of trade, have faced a challenge, because their data have derived exclusively from the modern world. Are their models universal or merely reflections of our time? It\u2019s a crucial question, because many in our country would like to change our trading system to protect American jobs and to improve working conditions here and abroad. The archives of Kanesh have proved to be the greatest single source of information about trade from an entirely premodern milieu.In a beautifully detailed new book \u2014 \u2018\u2018Ancient Kanesh,\u2019\u2019 written by a scholar of the archive, Mogens Trolle Larsen, to be published by Cambridge University Press later this year \u2014 we meet dozens of the traders of Kanesh and their relatives back home in Assur. Larsen has been able to construct family trees, detailing how siblings and cousins, parents and spouses, traded with one another and often worked against one another. We meet struggling businessmen, like Assur-idi, and brilliant entrepreneurs, like Shalim-Assur, who built a wealthy dynasty that lasted generations. In 2003, while covering the war in Iraq, I traveled to many ancient archaeological sites; the huge burial mounds, the carvings celebrating kings as relatives to the gods, all gave the impression of a despotic land in which a tiny handful of aristocrats and priests enjoyed dictatorial control. But the Kanesh documents show that at least some citizens had enormous power over their own livelihoods, achieving wealth and power through their own entrepreneurial endeavors.The details of daily life are amazing, but another scholar, Gojko Barjamovic, of Harvard, realized that the archive also offered insight into something potentially more compelling. Many of the texts enumerate specific business details: the price of goods purchased and sold, the interest rate on debt, the costs of transporting goods and the various taxes in the many city-states that the donkey caravans passed on the long journey from Assur to Kanesh. Like most people who have studied Kanesh, Barjamovic is an Assyriologist, an expert in ancient languages and culture. Earlier this year, he joined some economists, as well as some other Assyriologists and archaeologists, on a team that analyzed Kanesh\u2019s financial statistics. The picture that emerged of economic life is staggeringly advanced. The traders of Kanesh used financial tools that were remarkably similar to checks, bonds and joint-stock companies. They had something like venture-capital firms that created diversified portfolios of risky trades. And they even had structured financial products: People would buy outstanding debt, sell it to others and use it as collateral to finance new businesses. The 30 years for which we have records appear to have been a time of remarkable financial innovation.It\u2019s impossible not to see parallels with our own recent past. Over the 30 years covered by the archive, we see an economy built on trade in actual goods \u2014 silver, tin, textiles \u2014 transform into an economy built on financial speculation, fueling a bubble that then pops. After the financial collapse, there is a period of incessant lawsuits, as a central government in Assur desperately tries to come up with new regulations and ways of holding wrongdoers accountable (though there never seems to be agreement on who the wrongdoers are, exactly). The entire trading system enters a deep recession lasting more than a decade. The traders eventually adopt simpler, more stringent rules, and trade grows again.Since Tinbergen first published his finding, others have tested it on thousands of trade routes around the modern world, as well as on trade records going back a couple of centuries. In extreme cases (for example, trade between warring countries or during periods of sanction), the formula can fail to predict the volume of trade, but over all the model works extremely well. It\u2019s a striking finding, suggesting that, for all the debate about trade agreements and currency rates, import duties and World Trade Organization disputes, trade tends to follow its own rules.Economists were drawn to the Kanesh archive because it offered an unprecedented chance to see how well the Gravity Model applied in an economy entirely unlike our own. This was trade conducted via donkey, through a land of independent city-states whose legal and cultural systems were totally dissimilar to any we know. But still, the model held up: Ali Hortacsu, a University of Chicago economist on the Kanesh team, says that the trade figures between Assur and Kanesh matched the formula almost perfectly. \u2018\u2018It was a very nice surprise,\u2019\u2019 he told me.The Gravity Model may seem like bad news for people who want the economy to be fairer. I have spoken to countless activists and concerned friends who see global trade as a choice, something a specific set of politicians and businesses decided to impose on the rest of us, through all those confusing acronymic trade deals: GATT, Nafta and (probably, soon) the T.P.P. To me, though, the model suggests that these deals have less impact than either their boosters or their detractors imagine. There is a natural tendency for different regions to trade at fairly predictable volumes. However much politicians might want to change those outcomes, they have only crude tools at their disposal: They can stop trade through blockades, slow it through tariffs or try to jump-start it with trade agreements. What they can\u2019t do, at least not reliably, is shape it with precision to achieve their preferred outcomes.But despite trade\u2019s intractability, we still have a lot of room to address the impact of trade on our economy. Trade with China and other nations may be all but inevitable, but growing wealth inequality and disproportionate pain (blue-collar workers losing their jobs, investors reaping a fortune) are not. There is much we can do within our borders to address the unequal impact of global trade. We can educate children for more competitive careers, train displaced workers for new industries or even directly compensate those who fail to benefit from global trade.That, in fact, is what the people of Assur did, 4,000 years ago, as Barjamovic pointed out to me. Trade brought enormous wealth to a dozen or so families. But rather than hold all of it for themselves, the wealthy were made to redistribute a high percentage of their earnings through taxes and religious foundations that used the money for the public good. This way, the wealth created by trading with Kanesh made nearly everybody \u2014 at least every free citizen \u2014 better off.Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing editor at the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Trump or Fiorina, There Was Wendell Willkie", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHistorySourceIf either Donald Trump or Carly Fiorina receives the 2016 Republication presidential nomination, it will be a rare achievement. Only once in American history has a major political party granted its prize to someone whose principal qualification was to have served as a corporate chief executive. That was in 1940, when Wendell Willkie was the Republican candidate against President Franklin Roosevelt, who was seeking a third term.\u201cI\u2019m in business and proud of it,\u201d the 48-year-old Willkie told a Nebraska crowd that spring. \u201cNobody can make me soft-pedal any fact in my business career. After all, business is our way of life, our achievement, our glory.\u201dWillkie\u2019s political fate, however, did not ultimately turn on his record as president of the Commonwealth & Southern, a large electric utilities holding company based in New York. In the late 1930s, Willkie\u2019s modest national fame grew mainly out of his public criticism of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal programs, which he said overregulated industries such as his own.Born in the small town of Elwood, Ind., the well-read, bighearted, chain-smoking Willkie was a lawyer. Before his promotion to chief executive, he had been the company\u2019s counsel. Until 1939, he had been a registered Democrat; he changed his party affiliation without fanfare. After Willkie made known his intention to run for president, James E. Watson, a Republican and former United States senator from Indiana, warned him that it would be difficult for a party switcher to be nominated. Watson said that in their home state, \u201cIt\u2019s all right if the town whore joins the church, but they don\u2019t let her lead the choir the first night.\u201dThe chief relevance of Willkie\u2019s background running a company seemed to be the degree to which it validated his leadership stature and his strong views on the American economy. But during the 1940 campaign the overwhelming issue was not economics but national security. Hitler\u2019s forces were marching across Europe.Republican contenders like Senator Robert Taft of Ohio and Thomas Dewey, a young district attorney from New York, were considerably isolationist in their views. By contrast, Willkie supported much of the president\u2019s call to strengthen America\u2019s defenses after the outbreak of war in Europe and to contemplate aiding a beleaguered Britain. Leaders of the Republican Party\u2019s Northeastern, internationalist wing saw him as an answer to their prayers. In June, as Americans witnessed the fall of France, Willkie Clubs sprang up across the country. The publisher Henry Luce used his magazines Time, Life and Fortune to help turn Willkie into a national celebrity.Soon Willkie was leading in national polls. Arriving in the convention city of Philadelphia, he boasted that he had been personally covering his travel and telephone expenses and said that if nominated, \u201cI will be under obligation to nobody except the people.\u201d He won the nomination on the sixth ballot, vaulting over Taft and Dewey.Willkie, who resided in an apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York, sought to make himself more voter-friendly by returning to Elwood for his formal acceptance speech. He also patched things up \u2014 at least for the campaign\u2019s duration \u2014 with his wife, Edith, from whom he had grown distant. Of her smiling public appearances with her newly nominated husband, Mrs. Willkie reputedly noted in private that \u201cpolitics makes strange bedfellows.\u201d In the Oval Office, Roosevelt accidentally recorded himself asking operatives to publicize what would now be called \u201copposition research\u201d on Willkie\u2019s secret paramour, Irita Van Doren, who was The New York Herald Tribune\u2019s book editor. Willkie would have preferred to fight the 1940 campaign over the president\u2019s managerial deficiencies and what he argued was the failure of New Deal economics, noting that more than a decade after the start of the Great Depression unemployment stood at almost 15 percent. But by September 1940, the Germans were bombing London. Willkie was, therefore, forced to argue that he would make a better commander in chief than Roosevelt during a time of possible global war.Willkie issued no public objection to the president\u2019s controversial decisions to seek a peacetime military draft and provide destroyers to Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime government. But aghast at his sagging poll numbers, Willkie then decided to do what it might take to win; he began feigning a strong streak of isolationism.For example, in St. Louis he proclaimed that if elected president, he would not send American troops to Europe, adding that if Roosevelt were re-elected he believed they would be sent. (After the election, Willkie dismissed another of his campaign claims, that Roosevelt would have the country enmeshed in war by April 1941, as \u201ca bit of campaign oratory.\u201d)Many Americans feared involvement in another world war, and Willkie\u2019s opportunism almost worked. In late October, The New York Times reported that his \u201cantiwar psychology\u201d had brought him \u201cwithin easy striking distance of victory.\u201d But that November, the issue was whether Hitler and the imperial Japanese might rule the world, and Willkie, with his business experience, seemed no match for the long-seasoned incumbent. He received 44.8 percent of the popular vote, compared with Roosevelt\u2019s 54.7.After his defeat, Willkie shed his isolationism as quickly as he had donned it. When he ran again for president in 1944, Republicans spurned him as an apostate. Denounced to his face during a donors\u2019 luncheon as \u201cAmerica\u2019s leading ingrate,\u201d Willkie replied: \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn. You\u2019re a bunch of political liabilities anyway.\u201d That October, he died of coronary thrombosis at 52.Since then, the two major parties have seldom sought out C.E.O.s for the White House. Some political consultants tried and failed to draft Lee Iacocca to run for president as a Democrat, on the heels of his best-selling autobiography, which described his success in reviving the Chrysler Corporation. In February 1992, the businessman H. Ross Perot pledged on the CNN program \u201cLarry King Live\u201d to attack the national deficit if he ran as an independent candidate, saying, \u201cMy strength is creating jobs and fixing things.\u201d A Gallup poll that June found Mr. Perot running ahead of the major party candidates, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. That November, after closing down (he later said he feared political \u201cdirty tricks\u201d) and then resuming his campaign, Mr. Perot won 19 percent of the popular vote. More recently, in 2012, Republicans nominated Mitt Romney, a founder and C.E.O. of Bain Capital who had also served as governor of Massachusetts.Unlike Mr. Romney, the C.E.O.s running for president in this election can wear their lack of political office-holding experience as a badge of honor that shows their distance from what many Americans now consider to be a dysfunctional system. Wendell Willkie, who was caught in the accelerating crosswinds of world war, had no such advantage, and would no doubt be astonished to see how the chief executive card is now being played.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do the Democrats Understand America\u2019s New Racial Politics?", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookThe subsequent scramble to mollify African-American activists with rote incantations has prompted derision from conservatives. Still, beneath the Democrats\u2019 fawning overtures lurks a reality that both parties understand well: In 2016, black votes matter, perhaps more than those of any other electoral group.But elections are very rarely won by major realignments; most of the time, they\u2019re won around the margins \u2014 and the margins of the black vote are more malleable than they might initially appear. Consider George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 campaign: Nationwide, Bush won just 11 percent of the black vote. But his aggressive appeal on social issues to African-American Christian conservatives in Ohio earned him 16 percent in that pivotal state \u2014 enough to ensure his re-election. (Using similar tactics, he won more than 13 percent of Florida\u2019s black voters and 16 percent of Pennsylvania\u2019s.)In their paper, Walter and Wasserman point out that in the 2012 election, the percentage of eligible black voters who went to the polls (66.2 \u2014 a 5.9 increase from 2004) exceeded the percentage of whites (64.1) for the first time. Obama won because of the exceptionally high turnout among African-Americans in seven battleground states \u2014 whereas \u201chad ZERO Latinos voted in 2012, Obama would have lost the popular vote but still would have won the White House with 283 electoral votes.\u201dWhat would happen in 2016 if black voters were less than inspired by the Democratic nominee and reverted to their 2004 turnout level? Or if a 2016 Republican candidate once again won over just enough people in a few pivotal African-American communities? \u201cTo be sure,\u201d Walter and Wasserman write, \u201ca return to pre-2008 African-American turnout levels wouldn\u2019t necessarily doom a Hillary Clinton candidacy, but it would leave her with a whole lot less margin for error in a host of swing states.\u201dI discussed Walter and Wasserman\u2019s argument with several African-American political hands, all of whom concurred with the basic assessment. \u201cI do think that the African-American vote may be the most important demographic as it relates to the presidential race,\u201d said Doug Thornell, a longtime Hill staffer who is now the managing partner of the high-powered Washington-based communications firm SKDKnickerbocker. Thornell warned, however, that candidates asking for the black vote will not succeed by speaking in rosy platitudes.\u201cWe did a poll last December in which African-Americans said that racism was the No. 1 issue in the country, ahead of the economy,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo the critical thing for any of the candidates, Democratic or Republican, is that they\u2019re going to have to talk about issues African-Americans really care about \u2014 things like economic opportunity, criminal-justice reform and voting rights. And it\u2019s not just what they say at black churches or in front of the N.A.A.C.P. that counts. It\u2019s also what they say in front of largely white audiences.\u201dCornell Belcher, a former Obama pollster, argues that Obama\u2019s presidency, combined with the recent rash of tragic race-related incidents, has permanently transformed the electorate. \u201cI reject this notion that we\u2019re going to see a wholesale decline in black turnout now that Obama\u2019s no longer running,\u201d he told me. Belcher cited the African-American turnout figures during the 2014 midterm elections in Southern states like North Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana, which represented a higher share of the overall electorate than in 2010. Still, Belcher agreed with Thornell\u2019s cautionary note, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them something to vote for.\u201dThat view was echoed by Rodell Mollineau, who worked for years with Senator Harry Reid and is now a political consultant. \u201cThe activists at Netroots Nation were saying what many in the black community already think and feel, just more loudly,\u201d Mollineau told me. \u201cAnd you saw how, within minutes of that unplanned event, it totally dominated social media. If you\u2019re a candidate and you\u2019re tone-deaf to these dynamics, you\u2019re going to face electoral problems.\u201dThe African-American Republicans with whom I spoke saw an opportunity for G.O.P. candidates to cut into the black vote now that Obama is no longer on the ticket. \u201cWe think the African-American vote will be key in this election,\u201d said Elroy Sailor, an adviser to Rand Paul. \u201cThe African-American community hasn\u2019t been this politically engaged since the \u201960s. President Obama did a really good job of energizing and mobilizing African-Americans. In this election cycle, however, we predict the Democrat nominee will not be able to take the African-American vote for granted.\u201dDoug Thornell is doubtful such overtures will bear any fruit for the G.O.P. \u201cYou look at how most of the Republican candidates have been in a rush to condemn Donald Trump for his recent comments,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear that fire when he demanded that President Obama show his birth certificate. And I can tell you, that was deeply upsetting to a lot of African-Americans. Republicans had to deal with that baggage in 2012, and I think they also will in 2016.\u201d\u201cThe fact that you\u2019ve got both Republicans and Democrats talking about issues like criminal-justice reform suggests a recognition that these issues are important,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the other reality is that some of these images we\u2019ve seen on television, like Eric Garner, have been so jarring that it\u2019s stirred people across racial lines.\u201dClinton\u2019s Urban League speech last Friday was well received. But she and her party still have a lot of work to do in reaching African-American voters, says Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, one of the most thoughtful Democrats on the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a messaging problem as a message-delivery problem,\u201d Ellison told me recently in his office in Washington. \u201cI think we have a whole lot of leading Democrats who are familiar faces around the country club, but not necessarily around the fast-food restaurants. And I\u2019m not against the wealthy \u2014 I hope to be one myself someday. But when you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ve got to try a little harder to step into the shoes of the people you say you\u2019re fighting for.\u201dIn Ellison\u2019s view, the Clinton campaign should not be content with approaching, or even matching, Obama\u2019s turnout numbers. \u201cThink what would happen,\u201d he said, \u201cif you made a concerted effort in Texas, all the way into Louisiana, Mississippi and up to Virginia. You would change the South.\u201dFirst, however, candidates and voters alike would have to change how they discuss racial divisions, Ellison said. \u201cHow do we talk about race in America? Blame and shame, an endless loop. Me making you feel awful \u2014 that and $4.50 will get me a latte.\u201dRobert Draper is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "The Creative Apocalypse That Wasn\u2019t", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureUlrich\u2019s trip to Washington coincided with a lawsuit that Metallica had just filed against Napster \u2014 a suit that would ultimately play a role in the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing. But in retrospect, we can also see Ulrich\u2019s appearance as an intellectual milestone of sorts, in that he articulated a critique of the Internet-\u00adera creative economy that became increasingly commonplace over time. \u2018\u2018We typically employ a record producer, recording engineers, programmers, assistants and, occasionally, other musicians,\u2019\u2019 Ulrich told the Senate committee. \u2018\u2018We rent time for months at recording studios, which are owned by small-\u00adbusiness men who have risked their own capital to buy, maintain and constantly upgrade very expensive equipment and facilities. Our record releases are supported by hundreds of record companies\u2019 employees and provide programming for numerous radio and television stations. ... It\u2019s clear, then, that if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable. All the jobs I just talked about will be lost, and the diverse voices of the artists will disappear.\u2019\u2019The intersection between commerce, technology and culture has long been a place of anxiety and foreboding. Marxist critics in the 1940s denounced the assembly-line approach to filmmaking that Hollywood had pioneered; in the \u201960s, we feared the rise of television\u2019s \u2018\u2018vast wasteland\u2019\u2019; the \u201980s demonized the record executives who were making money off violent rap lyrics and \u2018\u2018Darling Nikki\u2019\u2019; in the \u201990s, critics accused bookstore chains and Walmart of undermining the subtle curations of independent bookshops and record stores.Six creatives in the Los Angeles area are supporting themselves with gigs that would have been impossible 15 years ago.The trouble with this argument is that it has been based largely on anecdote, on depressing stories about moderately successful bands that are still sharing an apartment or filmmakers who can\u2019t get their pictures made because they refuse to pander to a teenage sensibility. When we do see hard data about the state of the culture business, it usually tracks broad industry trends or the successes and failures of individual entertainment companies. That data isn\u2019t entirely irrelevant, of course; it\u2019s useful to know whether the music industry is making more or less money than it did before Ulrich delivered his anti-\u00adNapster testimony. But ultimately, those statistics only hint at the most important question. The dystopian scenario, after all, isn\u2019t about the death of the record business or Hollywood; it\u2019s about the death of music or movies. As a society, what we most want to ensure is that the artists can prosper \u2014 not the record labels or studios or publishing conglomerates, but the writers, musicians, directors and actors themselves.Their financial fate turns out to be much harder to measure, but I endeavored to try. Taking 1999 as my starting point \u2014 the year both Napster and Google took off \u2014 I plumbed as many data sources as I could to answer this one question: How is today\u2019s creative class faring compared with its predecessor a decade and a half ago? The answer isn\u2019t simple, and the data provides ammunition for conflicting points of view. It turns out that Ulrich was incontrovertibly correct on one point: Napster did pose a grave threat to the economic value that consumers placed on recorded music. And yet the creative apocalypse he warned of has failed to arrive. Writers, performers, directors and even musicians report their economic fortunes to be similar to those of their counterparts 15 years ago, and in many cases they have improved. Against all odds, the voices of the artists seem to be louder than ever.The first thing that jumps out at you, looking at Group 27-0000, is how stable it has been over the past decade and a half. In 1999, the national economy supported 1.5 million jobs in that category; by 2014, the number had grown to nearly 1.8 million. This means the creative class modestly outperformed the rest of the economy, making up 1.2 percent of the job market in 2001 compared with 1.3 percent in 2014. Annual income for Group 27-0000 grew by 40 percent, slightly more than the O.E.S. average of 38 percent. From that macro viewpoint, it hardly seems as though the creative economy is in dust-bowl territory. If anything, the market looks as if it is rewarding creative work, not undermining it, compared with the pre-\u00adNapster era.The problem with the O.E.S. data is that it doesn\u2019t track self-\u00ademployed workers, who are obviously a large part of the world of creative production. For that section of the culture industry, the best data sources are the United States Economic Census, which is conducted every five years, and a firm called Economic Modeling Specialists International, which tracks detailed job numbers for self-\u00ademployed people in specific professions. If anything, the numbers from the self-\u00ademployed world are even more promising. From 2002 to 2012, the number of businesses that identify as or employ \u2018\u2018independent artists, writers and performers\u2019\u2019 (which also includes some athletes) grew by almost 40 percent, while the total revenue generated by this group grew by 60 percent, far exceeding the rate of inflation.What do these data sets have to tell us about musicians in particular? According to the O.E.S., in 1999 there were nearly 53,000 Americans who considered their primary occupation to be that of a musician, a music director or a composer; in 2014, more than 60,000 people were employed writing, singing or playing music. That\u2019s a rise of 15 percent, compared with overall job-\u00admarket growth during that period of about 6 percent. The number of self-\u00ademployed musicians grew at an even faster rate: There were 45 percent more independent musicians in 2014 than in 2001. (Self-\u00ademployed writers, by contrast, grew by 20 percent over that period.)It\u2019s true that most of that live-\u00admusic revenue is captured by superstar acts like Taylor Swift or the Rolling Stones. In 1982, the musical 1-\u00adpercenters took in only 26 percent of the total revenues generated by live music; in 2003, they captured 56 percent of the market, with the top 5 percent of musicians capturing almost 90 percent of live revenues. But this winner-\u00adtakes-\u00adall trend seems to have preceded the digital revolution; most 1-\u00adpercenters achieved their gains in the \u201980s and early \u201990s, as the concert business matured into a promotional machine oriented around marquee world tours. In the post-\u00adNapster era, there seems to have been a swing back in a more egalitarian direction. According to one source, the top 100 tours of 2000 captured 90 percent of all revenue, while today the top 100 capture only 43 percent.The growth of live music isn\u2019t great news for the Brian Wilsons of the world, artists who would prefer to cloister themselves in the studio, endlessly tinkering with the recording process in pursuit of a masterpiece. The new economics of the post-\u00adNapster era are certainly skewed toward artists who like to perform in public. But we should remember one other factor here that is often forgotten. The same technological forces that have driven down the price of recorded music have had a similar effect on the cost of making an album in the first place. We easily forget how expensive it was to produce and distribute albums in the pre-\u00adNapster era. In a 2014 keynote speech at an Australian music conference, the indie producer and musician Steve Albini observed: \u2018\u2018When I started playing in bands in the \u201970s and \u201980s, most bands went through their entire life cycle without so much as a note of their music ever being recorded.\u2019\u2019 Today, musicians can have software that emulates the sound of Abbey Road Studios on their laptops for a few thousand dollars. Distributing music around the world \u2014 a process that once required an immense global corporation or complex regional distribution deals \u2014 can now be performed by the artist herself while sitting in a Starbucks, simply through the act of uploading a file.The vast machinery of promoters and shippers and manufacturers and A&R executives that sprouted in the middle of the 20th century, fueled by the profits of those high-\u00admargin vinyl records and CDs, has largely withered away. What remains is a more direct relationship between the musicians and their fans. That new relationship has its own demands: the constant touring and self-\u00adpromotion, the Kickstarter campaigns that have raised $153 million dollars to date for music-\u00adrelated projects, the drudgery that inevitably accompanies a life without handlers. But the economic trends suggest that the benefits are outweighing the costs. More people are choosing to make a career as a musician or a songwriter than they did in the glory days of Tower Records.What about the economics of quality? Perhaps there are more musicians than ever, and the writers have collectively gotten a raise, but if the market is only rewarding bubble-\u00adgum pop and \u2018\u201850 Shades Of Grey\u2019\u2019 sequels, there\u2019s a problem. I think we can take it as a given that television is exempt from this concern: Shows like \u2018\u2018Game Of Thrones,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Orange Is The New Black,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019\u2019 and so on confirm that we are living through a golden age of TV narrative. But are the other forms thriving artistically to the same degree?Look at Hollywood, and at first blush the picture is deeply depressing. More than half of the highest grossing movies of 2014 were either superhero films or sequels; it\u2019s clearly much harder to make a major-\u00adstudio movie today that doesn\u2019t involve vampires, wizards or Marvel characters. This has led a number of commentators and filmmakers to publish eulogies for the classic midbudget picture. \u2018\u2018Back in the 1980s and 1990s,\u2019\u2019 Jason Bailey wrote on Flavorwire, \u2018\u2018it was possible to finance \u2014 either independently or via the studio system \u2014 midbudget films (anywhere from $5 million to $60 million) with an adult sensibility. But slowly, quietly, over roughly the decade and a half since the turn of the century, the paradigm shifted.\u2019\u2019 Movies like \u2018\u2018Blue Velvet,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019\u2019 that succeeded two or three decades ago, the story goes, would have had a much harder time in the current climate. Steven Soderbergh apparently felt so strongly about the shifting environment that he abandoned theatrical moviemaking altogether last year.Is Bailey\u2019s criticism really correct? If you make a great midbudget film in 2015, is the marketplace less likely to reward your efforts than it was 15 years ago? And has it become harder to make such a film? Cinematic quality is obviously more difficult to measure than profits or employment levels, but we can attempt an estimate of artistic achievement through the Rotten Tomatoes rankings, which aggregate critics\u2019 reviews for movies. Based on my analysis, using data on box-\u00adoffice receipts and budgets from IMDB, I looked at films from 1999 and 2013 that met three categories. First, they were original creations or adaptations, not based on existing franchises, and were intended largely for an adult audience; second, they had a budget below $80 million; and third, they were highly praised by the critics, as defined by their Rotten Tomatoes score \u2014 in other words, the best of the cinematic midlist. In 1999, the most highly rated films in these categories combined included \u2018\u2018Three Kings,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Being John Malkovich,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018American Beauty\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Election.\u2019\u2019 The 2013 list included \u2018\u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Her,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Zero Dark Thirty,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018American Hustle\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Nebraska.\u2019\u2019 In adjusted dollars, the class of 1999 brought in roughly $430 million at the box office. But the 2013 group took in about $20 million more. True, individual years can be misleading: All it takes is one monster hit to skew the numbers. But if you look at the blended average over a three-year window, there is still no evidence of decline. The 30 most highly rated midbudget films of 1999 to 2001 took in $1.5 billion at the domestic box office, adjusted for inflation; the class of 2011 to 2013 took in the exact same amount. Then as now, if you make a small or midsize movie that rates on the Top 10 lists of most critics, you\u2019ll average roughly $50 million at the box office.The critics are right that big Hollywood studios have abandoned the production of artistically challenging films, part of a broader trend since the 1990s of producing fewer films over all. (From 2006 to 2011, the combined output of major Hollywood studios declined by 25 percent.) And yet the total number of pictures released in the United States \u2014 nearly 600 in 2011 \u2014 remains high. A recent entertainment research report, The Sky Is Rising, notes that most of that growth has come from independent production companies, often financed by wealthy individuals from outside the traditional studio system. \u2018\u2018Her,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Dallas Buyers Club,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018American Hustle\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Wolf of Wall Street\u2019\u2019 were all funded by major indies, though they usually relied on distribution deals with Hollywood studios. At the same time, of course, some of the slack in adventurous filmmaking has been taken up by the television networks. If Francis Ford Coppola were making his \u2018\u2018Godfather\u2019\u2019 trilogy today, he might well end up at HBO or AMC, with a hundred hours of narrative at his disposal, instead of 10.This would be even more troubling if independent bookstores \u2014 traditional champions of the literary novel and thoughtful nonfiction \u2014 were on life support. But contrary to all expectations, these stores have been thriving. After hitting a low in 2007, decimated not only by the Internet but also by the rise of big-box chains like Borders and Barnes & Noble, indie bookstores have been growing at a steady clip, with their number up 35 percent (from 1,651 in 2009 to 2,227 in 2015); by many reports, 2014 was their most financially successful year in recent memory. Indie bookstores account for only about 10 percent of overall book sales, but they have a vastly disproportionate impact on the sale of the creative midlist books that are so vital to the health of the culture.How do we explain the evolutionary niche that indie bookstores seem to have found in recent years? It may be as simple as the tactile appeal of books and bookstores themselves. After several years of huge growth, e-book sales have plateaued over the past two years at 25 to 30 percent of the market, telegraphing that a healthy consumer appetite for print remains. To many of us, buying music in physical form is now simply an inconvenience: schlepping those CDs home and burning them and downloading the tracks to our mobile devices. But many of the most ardent Kindle converts \u2014 and I count myself among them \u2014 still enjoy browsing shelves of physical books, picking them up and sitting back on the couch with them. The trend might also reflect the social dimension of book culture: If you\u2019re looking for literary community, you head out to the weekly reading series at the indie bookstore and buy something while you\u2019re there. (Arguably, it\u2019s the same phenomenon that happened with music, only with a twist. If you\u2019re looking for musical community, you don\u2019t go out on a CD-\u00adbuying binge. You go to a show instead.)All these numbers, of course, only hint at whether our digital economy rewards quality. Or \u2014 even better than that milquetoast word \u2018\u2018quality\u2019\u2019 \u2014 at whether it rewards experimentation, boundary-\u00adpushing, satire, the real drivers of new creative work. It could be that our smartphone distractions and Kardashian celebrity culture have slowly but steadily lowered our critical standards, the aesthetic version of inflation: The critics might like certain films and books today because they\u2019re surrounded by such a vast wasteland of mediocrity, but if you had released them 15 years ago, they would have paled beside the masterpieces of that era. But if you scan the titles, it is hard to see an obvious decline. A marketplace that rewarded \u2018\u2018American Beauty,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Corrections\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018In the Heart of the Sea\u2019\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem glaringly more sophisticated than one that rewards \u2018\u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Flamethrowers\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018The Sixth Extinction.\u2019\u2019The biggest change of all, perhaps, is the ease with which art can be made and distributed. The cost of consuming culture may have declined, though not as much as we feared. But the cost of producing it has dropped far more drastically. Authors are writing and publishing novels to a global audience without ever requiring the service of a printing press or an international distributor. For indie filmmakers, a helicopter aerial shot that could cost tens of thousands of dollars a few years ago can now be filmed with a GoPro and a drone for under $1,000; some directors are shooting entire HD-\u00adquality films on their iPhones. Apple\u2019s editing software, Final Cut Pro X, costs $299 and has been used to edit Oscar-\u00adwinning films. A musician running software from Native Instruments can recreate, with astonishing fidelity, the sound of a Steinway grand piano played in a Vienna concert hall, or hundreds of different guitar-\u00adamplifier sounds, or the Mellotron proto-\u00adsynthesizer that the Beatles used on \u2018\u2018Strawberry Fields Forever.\u2019\u2019 These sounds could have cost millions to assemble 15 years ago; today, you can have all of them for a few thousand dollars.These new careers \u2014 collaborating on an indie-\u00admovie soundtrack with a musician across the Atlantic, uploading a music video to YouTube that you shot yourself on a smartphone \u2014 require a kind of entrepreneurial energy that some creators may lack. The new environment may well select for artists who are particularly adept at inventing new career paths rather than single-\u00admindedly focusing on their craft. There are certainly pockets of the creative world, like those critically acclaimed books dropping off the mainstream best-\u00adseller lists, where the story is discouraging. And even the positive trends shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as a mindless defense of the status quo. Most full-time artists barely make enough money to pay the bills, and so if we have levers to pull that will send more income their way \u2014 whether these take the form of government grants, Kickstarter campaigns or higher fees for the music we stream \u2014 by all means we should pull those levers.But just because creative workers deserve to make more money, it doesn\u2019t mean that the economic or technological trends are undermining their livelihoods. If anything, the trends are making creative livelihoods more achievable. Contrary to Lars Ulrich\u2019s fear in 2000, the \u2018\u2018diverse voices of the artists\u2019\u2019 are still with us, and they seem to be multiplying. The song remains the same, and there are more of us singing it for a living.Steven Johnson is the author of nine books, most recently \u201cHow We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Putting a Number to C.E.O. Pay Might Bring Change", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameIt is a confounding truth about outsize executive pay \u2014 all past attempts to rein it in have failed.I put that question to some experts on executive pay; several of them gave intriguing reasons to be optimistic that this rule may actually do something to curb over-the-top pay.Their thinking goes like this: Because the rule will generate an easily graspable and often decidedly shocking number, it may energize a cadre of new combatants in the executive pay fight. And because these newcomers \u2014 company employees, state governments and possibly even consumers \u2014 will most likely be more vocal on the matter than institutional investors have been, the executive pay bubble might actually start to deflate.The rule, which passed the commission on a 3-to-2, party-line vote, has been five years coming. Under the Dodd-Frank law, the S.E.C. had to come up with a regulation requiring large public companies to calculate the difference between what their top executives receive in compensation and the median pay level for their other employees.And yet, Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains, said the way the S.E.C. was requiring companies to calculate the rule would probably understate the true pay gap. That\u2019s because the calculation, which relies on what is known as the summary compensation tables in the annual proxy statement, does not include the total amounts executives have built up in their pensions and supplemental retirement plans.\u201cThe pension numbers baked into the summary compensation table are only year-over-year improvements and don\u2019t begin to capture how much the C.E.O. has on the table in terms of retirement money compared to how much the troops typically have on the table,\u201d he said.The S.E.C. has always contended that the rule will help inform shareholders, especially as they ponder how to vote on companies\u2019 pay practices.Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.But Mr. Foley doesn\u2019t think investors will pay much attention to the new rule. Neither does James Reda, managing director of executive compensation consulting at Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. \u201cIt is not clear how institutional investors or their advisers will use the pay ratio, if at all,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is conceivable that labor pension funds may use the number to consider an investment in a company.\u201dThis complacency could have a lot to do with the rising stock market. But it almost certainly does not reflect the views of 95 percent of investors. What it does reflect is the practice of large mutual fund companies like Vanguard and Fidelity to vote their clients\u2019 shares routinely in support of lush pay practices whether they like it or not. These voting policies help keep corporate boards clubby and executive pay aloft.\u201cIt makes a lot of sense to bring the C.E.O. pay ratio out of the shareholder realm and into the consumer\u2019s,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cThere\u2019s also interest at the state level to take this indicator of C.E.O.-to-worker pay and incorporate it into tax policy and procurement policy.\u201dThe bill did not pass with the two-thirds majority it needed, but one of its co-sponsors is working to move it forward, Ms. Anderson said.A companion bill may be introduced in the Rhode Island House of Representatives in the next session.It\u2019s possible, too, that some consumers, disturbed by the disparity between a corporate chief\u2019s pay and that of lower-level workers, will change their shopping habits to favor companies whose pay is fairer. If institutional investors won\u2019t vote with their feet on this matter, perhaps consumers will.\u201cEverybody is outraged about C.E.O. pay, but people feel they can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that this will give people something to do about it that\u2019s concrete.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Did China Devalue Its Currency? Two Big Reasons", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsHERE are two things that China\u2019s government wants very badly: first, for its economy to remain on an even keel, keeping growth and employment high. Second, for its currency, the renminbi, to become globally pre-eminent, helping promote the country\u2019s diplomatic goals and solidifying the country\u2019s centrality to the global economy.Frequently those goals are in conflict. But on Tuesday, China did something it thought would advance both at once.The immediate result was a de facto devaluation, with the Chinese currency falling 1.8 percent versus the dollar and 2.2 percent versus the euro on Tuesday. Those are big moves for the renminbi, considering that the government has had a policy of maintaining a strict trading band \u2014 enforced with both legal restrictions on the transfer of capital and the government\u2019s trillions of dollars in reserves. Usually, the renminbi will move only a few hundredths of a percent against the dollar in a given day; the largest move this year had been 0.16 percent.A roughly 2 percent shift in the value of a currency, even a major one, is not that big a deal, and certainly not the kind of thing that would earn blaring headlines about a devaluation. In the last year, the euro has dropped about 18 percent against the dollar and the Japanese yen has plummeted about 22 percent. What makes the Chinese move fascinating is what it says about China\u2019s approach to its currency and economy, and about the country\u2019s role in the global financial system in the future.But a hidden cost of the Chinese government\u2019s strategy of keeping the renminbi within a narrow trading band against the dollar is that China has been unable to take advantage of one of the crucial tools most countries use when they\u2019re in an economic slowdown.Linking the value of China\u2019s currency to the dollar has had benefits, but in the last year has also come at a big cost: It has resulted in the renminbi\u2019s rise against competitors and trading partners when the economic fundamentals of China would argue for it to fall.China is looking to assert more of a leadership role in the global economy, and an important piece of that is establishing the renminbi as a reserve currency. The dollar and the euro have a reach and a usefulness far beyond the borders of the countries that use them, and China would like the renminbi to have a similar sway in global trade and finance, especially in Asia.But you can\u2019t really be a global reserve currency when you maintain all the restrictions that China insists on in the interest of keeping control of its domestic economy. The dollar wouldn\u2019t play its central role in global finance if the American government made it illegal to exchange it for other currencies in many circumstances or used legal prohibitions and aggressive interventions to keep its value from fluctuating in response to market forces.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.In other words, China has wanted some of the diplomatic benefits it would gain if the renminbi became a more important currency abroad, without paying the price at home.That doesn\u2019t mean it was without cost. The cheaper renminbi will mean higher inflation and will create a greater burden for Chinese companies that owe money in dollars, potentially setting off a new round of failures. Perhaps more important in the long run, as China liberalizes its currency, it gives up a crucial tool that the government has used for years to manage the economy and protect itself from being buffeted by global economic forces. China\u2019s leadership has been reluctant to give up that power, and that\u2019s why Tuesday\u2019s announcement came as such a shock to global markets.But it isn\u2019t often that a policy choice helps achieve two big national goals at once. And when faced with such a choice, it appears China\u2019s leaders were willing to give up a little bit of power for, they hope, better economic results at home and a bigger role in the global financial system.Advertisement"}

We cannot \u2014 we must not \u2014 fail for a third time.\u201dHe promised to overhaul the city\u2019s health care infrastructure with new facilities and incentives for doctors, said he would rebuild schools and provide local children with better educations than ever, and vowed to rebuild the local economy.On Thursday, Mr. Obama will return to New Orleans to mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and face the kind of reckoning presidents must confront near the end of their tenure: How did reality stack up against his campaign promises?Many of Mr. Obama\u2019s promises have been fulfilled, according to political analysts and lawmakers in both parties, although he can take only partial credit. New Orleans\u2019s economy is thriving, a new $1.1 billion hospital has opened with another being constructed, the school system has been overhauled, and the city is now protected against a 100-year storm with a $14.5 billion levee system that is far better than its predecessor.But the recovery was also helped by a federal spending spree authorized during both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations \u2014 nearly $71 billion in assistance to fund projects both small and large across the region. South Louisiana received more money for capital projects than the entire state would normally spend in 60 years.\u201cDisasters are known to accelerate pre-existing trends,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cso that didn\u2019t bode very well for New Orleans, which was doing poorly prior to Katrina.\u201dThe New Orleans of 2015 has been altered, and not just by nature. In some ways, it is booming as never before. In others, it is returning to pre-Katrina realities of poverty and violence, but with a new sense of dislocation for many, too.Perhaps even more important, New Orleans became a center for jobs in technology, media and electric power generation, hot sectors that were scarce in pre-Katrina New Orleans. Start-up companies are flourishing, venture capital investment has increased substantially, and the tourism sector is doing well, with passenger traffic at Louis Armstrong International Airport up 22 percent from 2008 levels, compared with an increase of just 5 percent nationally.\u201cThis president has been spectacular in his partnership with me and the rest of the people of New Orleans in rebuilding this great American city,\u201d Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in an interview this week. \u201cFrom the day he stepped into office, this president has been all in.\u201dThe education secretary, Arne Duncan, called Hurricane Katrina \u201cthe best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans,\u201d a provocative remark that many say proved accurate.Former Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat from Louisiana and the mayor\u2019s sister who helped push through much of the legislation funding these efforts, said that after a poor start during the Bush administration, the coordination between the local, state and federal authorities for rebuilding efforts had improved substantially. That was because Mr. Obama instructed his cabinet to do everything it could for the area, she said.\u201cAnd to my knowledge, every single one of them did, and I worked closely with almost all of them,\u201d she said.Indeed, such praise is widespread and bipartisan. Even aides to Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a Republican now running for president, declined to criticize the president\u2019s rebuilding efforts.\u201cOnce Mitch Landrieu came in, you could really see things getting done,\u201d Mr. Chervenak said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rethinking Warren G. Harding", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHarding\u2019s reputation wasn\u2019t doing well to begin with. From the first poll of historians ranking the presidents, conducted in 1948 by Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., to the most recent one in 2015, Harding has always come in either at the very bottom of the list, or one above James Buchanan, thanks in large part to the scandals that rocked his administration, which tarnished his reputation even though he had nothing to do with them.But the low regard for Harding today stands in sharp contrast to how the country viewed him when he was president. He won the 1920 election in a landslide, receiving 60 percent of the popular vote, one of the highest totals ever obtained by any president. He won 37 of the 48 states, with 404 Electoral College votes out of 531. Republicans won on his coattails, gaining a 22-seat majority in the Senate and an unprecedented 168-seat majority in the House.Harding\u2019s victory was a rejection of the Democrats and President Woodrow Wilson, who had promised, then failed, to keep America out of World War I. During the war, Wilson had greatly expanded the federal government, including intrusive, powerful new agencies like the War Industries Board and a government takeover of the railroads.To pay for it, the Federal Reserve inflated the money supply, causing the nation\u2019s debt to grow from $1 billion in 1914 to $24 billion in 1920. To put a lid on dissent, Wilson introduced the nation\u2019s first \u201cred scare,\u201d when many antiwar dissenters as well as socialists, anarchists and union members were jailed. A Southerner, Wilson also introduced segregation into the federal government.By the time Harding was inaugurated, in March 1921, the nation was in the doldrums, experiencing a postwar depression. In 1918, four million doughboys came home from the war and many could not find jobs. Unemployment hit African-American soldiers especially hard, and race riots broke out in the Midwest industrial belt.Harding, much like Ronald Reagan in 1980, brought an upbeat message to Americans. The dour Wilson had ended the public\u2019s access to the White House. Harding opened the doors. Before the arrival of the Hardings, wrote The New Republic\u2019s Edward Lowry, \u201cThe social-political atmosphere of Washington\u201d was \u201cone of a bleak and chill austerity.\u201d Now, \u201cthe sunny side is up \u2026 The news has gone all over the country that the White House is open again.\u201dThanks to this openness, Harding \u2014 a former newspaper editor and publisher \u2014 had perhaps the best relationship with the press of any president before or since, and he inspired many newsmen to communicate his message. While Wilson had discontinued his news conferences, the accessible Harding held them twice a week, making him the first president to hold news conferences on a regular basis.Harding immediately stressed his commitment to equal opportunity for all Americans, men and women, \u201cwhatever color, blood or creed.\u201d A fiscal conservative, he pledged to right the nation\u2019s finances and resuscitate the economy by lowering taxes, reducing the debt, balancing the budget and making government smaller and more efficient.Harding appointed the businessman Charles G. Dawes, who had been President William McKinley\u2019s comptroller of the currency, to set up a new Budget Bureau. At the time each federal department submitted its own budget, without any coordination. Dawes worked magic: By the time he left office in June 1922, the federal budget had been balanced, revenues exceeded expenditures and the public debt had been reduced. Spending had been $6.3 billion in 1920; by 1922 it had dropped to $3.3 billion.Most telling was Harding\u2019s veto of the popular so-called bonus bill, which would have given veterans an expensive bonus paid over time through deficit spending. The country, he told Congress in a speech, simply did not have the money. He argued it would also set a precedent to use public funds to pay for anything if it was \u201cpublicly appealing.\u201dOddly, one reason for Harding\u2019s continued low reputation was a racist smear during the 1920 campaign, in which opponents charged that he had black ancestry \u2014 a fact that the recent DNA test disproved. Though such a heritage doesn\u2019t matter to us today, at the time it demeaned Harding in the minds of millions of Americans. More telling, though, is that while Harding denied the charge, he also told a reporter that for all he knew \u201cone of my ancestors may have jumped the fence.\u201dAnd indeed, Harding was a racially enlightened president, especially for the time. During the campaign and his presidency, he supported an anti-lynching bill proposed by Republicans. (It passed in the House, but the Southern Democrats in the Senate successfully filibustered it.)In October 1921, Harding traveled to Birmingham, Ala., where, in a powerful speech to a mixed-race (though segregated) audience, he demanded justice for African-Americans. In the first speech in the South by a sitting president on race, he argued for full economic and political rights for all African-Americans. Pat Harrison, a Democratic senator from Mississippi, was aghast. If Harding\u2019s views \u201cwere carried to its ultimate conclusion,\u201d he said, \u201cthat means that the black man can strive to become president of the United States.\u201dThe African-American community saw things differently. America\u2019s best-known black intellectual, W.E.B. Du Bois, wrote in the N.A.A.C.P. magazine Crisis: \u201cToday President Harding\u2019s speech, like sudden thunder in blue skies, ends the hiding and drives us all into the clear light of truth.\u201dHarding also stood out on civil liberties. On his first Christmas in office, Harding commuted the sentence of the Socialist Party leader Eugene V. Debs, who had been imprisoned under the Sedition Act under Wilson, and invited him to come straight to Washington so he could receive him in the White House. As Harding told a friend, he regularly heard \u201cmen in Congress say things worse than the utterances\u201d for which Debs was convicted.Over the opposition of both his wife and his attorney general, Harding said that Debs \u201chad never been guilty of any overt act; that he never countenanced destruction of government by force, and that probably I could persuade him to become a factor in contributing to tranquillity throughout the land.\u201d Later, Harding commuted the sentences of the remaining political prisoners still incarcerated.When Harding suddenly died of a heart attack in San Francisco on Aug. 2, 1923, at the age of 57, the country was shaken. As the train bearing his body made its way back to Washington, an estimated nine million people lined the railroad tracks to silently pay their respects.We\u2019ll never know what Harding would have achieved if he had finished out his term, or if that would have made a difference with how history has treated him. But he deserves better than he has received.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Warren G. Harding\u2019s 1921 speech in Birmingham, Ala. It was the first speech in the South by a sitting president on race, not the first speech anywhere by a sitting president on race.An earlier version of this article misstated the action taken by President Harding concerning the prison sentence of the Socialist Party leader Eugene V. Debs. Harding commuted Debs\u2019s sentence; he did not pardon him.Advertisement"}

But the resumption of trading was a necessary step as Greece tries to emerge from controls on financial activity that the government, confronted with a bank run, imposed at the end of June.Analysts said stock prices could begin to recover in the weeks to come, bringing much-needed capital into the country, as investors with an appetite for risk look for bargains.In yet another sign of trouble, though, new survey data on Monday showed a fall in Greek manufacturing activity since the government imposed controls in late June on the flow of money out of Greece.Much depends on the outcome of negotiations between government officials and representatives of the country\u2019s international creditors on a multibillion-euro bailout, Greece\u2019s third in five years. The talks entered a second week on Monday.\u201cIf the new deal with creditors is struck and ratified, Greek stocks could rebound nicely,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in an email. \u201cAnd if the deal then actually holds, with Greece implementing the structural reforms demanded by creditors, Greece could recover strongly.\u201dHe added: \u201cThat is a big if.\u201dAfter initial talks with foreign envoys on Friday that focused on Greece\u2019s finances, privatization of public assets and bank recapitalization, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said that \u201cthere was convergence on some points, less on others.\u201dThe resumption of trading in Athens was intended to be another step toward normalcy, but instead, investors used the opportunity to flee exposure to the Greek economy.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Shares on the exchange initially dropped nearly 23 percent as trading began on Monday, with bank stocks leading the rout. While the main index recovered somewhat by the end of trading, bank shares did not. They might have fallen even more on Monday, but selling was halted after the declines reached 30 percent, in accordance with Athens stock exchange rules.Banking has been among the hardest-hit sectors of the Greek economy, and lenders are dependent on emergency cash from the European Central Bank to stay afloat.Greek shares recovered slightly by closing and were down 16 percent, but the initial price declines showed that most investors were not yet willing to bet on the country again.Bank stocks \u201cwill fall quite a bit more and will take a while to rebound,\u201d said Nikos Pantelakis, chief executive of Pantelakis Securities, an Athens brokerage firm.Mr. Pantelakis said that shares of companies outside the financial industry, like the telecom company OTE, Aegean Airlines or the betting firm OPAP \u201cwill recover faster.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis reported from Athens and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

Adjusted for inflation, spending for those health care benefits rose 447 percent between 1987 and 2013. Medicaid spending rose a great deal as well, but not as much, 386 percent.Governments can either increase revenue or reduce benefits. But the Affordable Care Act offers a potentially attractive option. Instead of receiving retiree health insurance from their former state or local government employer, retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare could buy coverage on an exchange, which would be subsidized with federal dollars for those with incomes below a certain threshold.This would shift the cost of coverage \u2014 and future liability for it \u2014 off the books of state and local governments. Of course, to the extent that retirees would have to pay higher premiums, the governments might have to compensate them, perhaps by increasing paychecks during their working years.Whatever states do, they won\u2019t find a lot of help by skimping on Medicaid. It\u2019s already cheap, and it\u2019s not the biggest source of growth in health care spending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Effective Altruism: Where Charity and Rationality Meet", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewYou are lucky enough to have some money to give away: It could be $100 or $1 million. Whether you are prepared to make a small donation or a big one, you would like to accomplish something good with it.From the standpoint of effective altruism, the problem behind a lot of charitable giving is that individuals often make donations without doing much analysis. They simply think the best of charities that interest them and accept at face value that these charities are doing a terrific job. Accountability is never considered.What concrete advice does Professor MacAskill offer?Third, right now is an especially good time to give away money. Because some parts of the world remain so destitute, it may be possible to save a life for only a few thousand dollars of well-directed charity. That may not be the case in a future when the world is much wealthier and many fewer people live on the margins of subsistence. Professor MacAskill cites public health programs such as using drugs to rid people of dangerous worms, and eliminating malaria, as the Gates Foundation has tried to do.Neither Professor MacAskill nor the effective-altruism movement has answered all the tough questions. Often the biggest gains come from innovation, yet how can a donor spur such advances? If you had a pile of money and the intent to make the world a better place in 1990, could you have usefully expected or encouraged the spread of cellphones to Africa? Probably not, yet this technology has improved the lives of many millions, and at a profit, so for the most part its introduction didn\u2019t draw money from charities. Economists know frustratingly little about the drivers of innovation.In addition, donor motivation may place limits on the applicability of the effective-altruism precepts. Given that a lot of donors are driven by emotion, pushing them to be more reasonable might backfire. Excessively cerebral donors might respond with so much self-restraint that they end up giving less to charity. If they are no longer driven by emotion, they may earn and save less in the first place.Still, those objections aside, it is hard to believe that Americans cannot improve their practice of philanthropy. In a world of high income inequality, we will have a much better future if donations from the very rich can bring some of the social benefits associated with the past generosity of Mellon, Carnegie, Rockefeller and others. And donations from less wealthy people can help a great deal if they are well directed.Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stores Suffer From a Shift of Behavior in Buyers", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Americans spend more money on doing things, not buying things, department stores are losing out.Department stores made up one of just two categories tracked by the Commerce Department where spending declined, the latest in a choppy performance from them this year. Spending at electronics and appliance stores also fell 1.2 percent in July.Data released by the Commerce Department shows that American consumers are putting what little extra money they do have to spend each month into eating out, upgrading their cars or fixing up their homes, as well as spending on sports gear, health and beauty. Spending at restaurants and bars has jumped more than 9 percent this year through July compared with the same period last year, and on autos by more than 7 percent, according to the agency.Even back-to-school sales are failing to spur a summer shopping frenzy, though consumers may have delayed their spending this year after a number of states pushed back their three-day sales tax holidays from July into August.\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more about the experience \u2014 whether it\u2019s going to a festival or sharing a car ride or going to a new city,\u201d said Richard E. Jaffe, a retailing analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, the investment firm.\u201cThe religion of consumption has proven to be unfulfilling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018pile it high and watch it fly\u2019 mentality at department stores no longer works.\u201dThe shift in consumer mind-sets, especially among younger consumers, is hurting major department store chains like Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, which both reported tepid quarterly earnings this week.But even upscale retailers are facing some trouble. Foreign tourists are spending less in the United States, their purchasing power crimped by the strong dollar, which has risen by as much as 20 percent against major currencies like the euro and yen.\u201cAnd when they are here, they\u2019re not spending in our categories,\u201d Terry J. Lundgren, Macy\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said on CNBC on Wednesday, referring to Chinese tourists.\u201cWhere the consumer is spending,\u201d Mr. Lundgren said, \u201cis in automobiles. It\u2019s in housing. It\u2019s in health care. It\u2019s in certain apps that they\u2019re downloading.\u201dOf course, Americans have not stopped spending on goods \u2014 far from it. But when they do, they are increasingly buying online.Discount stores like T. J. Maxx, Ross Stores and Burlington are also taking a bigger share of shoppers\u2019 dollars, prompting department stores to jump into the same lower-priced space.This fall, Macy\u2019s will open the doors to four off-price outlet stores, called Macy\u2019s Backstage, in and around New York City, joining Nordstrom Rack and the Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th stores, both discount spinoffs. Kohl\u2019s also unveiled its first off-price store, Off-Aisle by Kohl\u2019s, in June.That is a risky strategy that could both cannibalize and devalue the department store chains\u2019 full-price offerings, analysts say. But the race into the off-price space, not to mention an increasingly packed sales calendar, shows just how hard it has become to persuade American consumers to buy more stuff.\u201cRetailers are discounting in so many ways now. And if one does it, they all have to do it,\u201d said Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of United States and global consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. \u201cThat\u2019s driven retail goods prices into negative territory.\u201dDepartment stores are striking back with other strategies besides discounting. Kohl\u2019s has been bolstering its sportswear offerings, with plans to open up new N.F.L., N.C.A.A. and M.L.B. stores at Kohl\u2019s locations. The retailer is also expanding its yoga-wear selection, as well as the outdoor Columbia brand.And the stores themselves are focusing on transforming shopping into the kind of experience that they say today\u2019s consumer craves. Macy\u2019s, for example, is rolling out beacons at its stores that beam deals and other information to shoppers\u2019 smartphones, and offer points for checking into different parts of the store, to create a more gamelike shopping experience.Still, selling more goods will only get harder as the economy recovers, said Rajiv Lal, professor of retailing at Harvard Business School.\u201cWith affluence, people have so much stuff in their closet,\u201d he said, adding that consumers are not looking to buy more material products but something that will strike their imagination.\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t see anything in stores they fancy, they\u2019ll seek out experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s experience versus the mundane.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Close the Gender Pay Gap", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Deloitte and Touche (now called Deloitte Consulting) in its widely admired \u2014 and copied \u2014 Women\u2019s Initiative required all of its offices to produce annual reports tracking their progress in advancing women into senior roles. Publishing this data motivated the entire organization to check unfounded assumptions about women\u2019s ambitions and limitations and assign women to accounts of equal value and prestige.Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that the public nature of these reports spurred competition among business units to make sure that their female employees were faring as well or better than those in other divisions. Barely 10 years after the launch of this initiative, Deloitte had tripled the number of female partners and directors in the organization and reduced a huge gender gap in attrition between male and female managers.So that\u2019s the efficacy part. As for the benefits, they go far beyond the issue of fairness. In that same 10-year period, Deloitte saved $250 million in hiring and training costs from reducing attrition.Since women control the majority of consumer spending and have been shown to reinvest more of their earnings in their own communities, getting more money into women\u2019s hands would also be good for the American economy. What\u2019s not to like about that?SARA LASCHEVERConcord, Mass.To the Editor:Joanne Lipman is right: Reporting pay gap information is an excellent idea. New Mexico instituted such a requirement for state contractors in 2009 through an executive order from Gov. Bill Richardson. Both worker privacy and company proprietary information are protected, since actual compensation amounts are not reported, only gender pay gaps by job category.The city of Albuquerque has recently instituted a similar requirement \u2014 the first in the nation at the municipal level. Contractors are given a premium in the bidding process if they are at or near parity in compensation. Such a system is an excellent example of transparency in government and accountability to taxpayers.MARTHA BURKCorrales, N.M.The writer, money editor for Ms. Magazine and host of \u201cEqual Time With Martha Burk,\u201d a public radio show, advised on the New Mexico and Albuquerque initiatives.To the Editor:Joanne Lipman describes the persistence of a pay gap of as much as one-third between what male and female workers earn. She calls on companies to publish the gender pay gap for their employees.There\u2019s another approach that is already part of the American experience: unionizing the work force. I am a bus operator with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and earn exactly as much as any of my male co-workers who have the same amount of time on the job.Why doesn\u2019t the M.T.A. pay male workers more than female workers, as do so many companies Ms. Lipman describes? The reason is the union\u2019s contract with the M.T.A., which awards pay strictly on the basis of seniority.

He didn\u2019t mean that the United States was exceptionally ennobled; he was \u2014 and is \u2014 diligent in calling out American violations. Rather, he meant that respect for human rights was our country\u2019s founding ideal, and we should judge ourselves as a nation by our fidelity to it. ELISA MASSIMINOPresident and Chief ExecutiveHuman Rights FirstWashingtonTo the Editor:Another example supporting Stuart E. Eizenstat\u2019s claim that President Jimmy Carter\u2019s greatest achievements were in foreign policy is SALT II.The strategic arms limitation treaty, an offensive nuclear arms pact between the United States and the Soviet Union, was signed in Vienna in June 1979. The full Senate never got to debate the draft treaty; after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan later that year, President Carter asked the Senate to delay consideration. Still, the terms negotiated were informally complied with beyond President Reagan\u2019s first term and into the tenure of the Soviet Union\u2019s last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.It was both militarily and symbolically significant that the SALT II framework continued to serve as a high-profile example of something Moscow and Washington could agree on \u2014 however informally \u2014 even when Cold War tensions were on the rise.WILLIAM E. JACKSON Jr.Davidson, N.C.The writer was executive director of the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament, a presidential advisory committee, from 1978 to 1980.To the Editor:Jimmy Carter certainly did some good things as president, as noted by Stuart E. Eizenstat, his former White House aide. One of the greatest impacts of his one-term presidency, however, was the setting of the stage for the election of Ronald Reagan and the imposition of the trickle-down/supply-side conservative policies that still adversely affect our economy.People forget that in 1976 Ronald Reagan was perceived by many Americans as a right-wing extremist. He was regularly lampooned on the hot new show \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as a doddering, out-of-touch reactionary. But after four years of the Carter administration, with double-digit inflation, gas lines and a general air of ineffectiveness emanating from the White House, voters rushed to the polls to elect Ronald Reagan as president. JOHN E. STAFFORDRye, N.Y.To the Editor:Stuart E. Eizenstat reminds us that Jimmy Carter worked tirelessly for many important achievements during his term in office. One not mentioned was the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.Those of us who witnessed the president signing this epochal public land law in the East Room on Dec. 2, 1980, realized that in that moment our national park system and our National Wildlife Refuge System doubled in size, the miles of rivers protected in our Wild and Scenic Rivers System vastly increased, and our statutorily protected wilderness areas grew by 57 million acres.As a leader in the citizen campaign working to persuade Congress to enact this law, I know just how engaged President Jimmy Carter was day to day in persuading members of Congress that this would be an achievement in which they, too, could take great personal pride.DOUG SCOTTSeattleTo the Editor:Jimmy Carter was a better president than most give him credit for, but airline deregulation is not one of his finer accomplishments.With deregulation came the hub system, forcing travelers to go from here to somewhere else much of the time before getting to there. Smaller airports lost service altogether. And speaking of service, airlines could now dispense with that, since pricing was all important rather than differentiation based on the quality and comfort of a particular flight.So, sorry, Mr. Carter, despite all the good you did, and have continued doing, I long for the days of a reasonably sized seat and some knee room, a menu from which selections could be made and, yes, even fewer passengers elbowing one another at the baggage carousel.RICHARD M.

The public is also concerned about unequal opportunity in the workplace for blacks, women and the disadvantaged.Many ordinary Americans are concerned about the loopholes that allow corporations to avoid paying taxes. And they wonder how the rich can keep accruing wealth while many working people find it hard to feed their families.Few politicians are foolish enough to advocate replacing capitalism with another system.

Perhaps when a country first becomes a capitalist society, as China or Vietnam have in my lifetime, unbridled capitalism leads to huge reductions in poverty.But the United States now has the luxury, and therefore the responsibility, to look after all of our citizens, especially those who have not been fortunate enough to benefit from unbridled capitalism. It is then that government should step in and ensure more equitable distribution of wealth.

{"Headline": "Twisting Words to Make \u2018Sharing\u2019 Apps Seem Selfless", "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnophoriaWhat I find problematic is the terminology itself and how it frames technology-enabled transactions as if they were altruistic or community endeavors.Let\u2019s begin with \u201csharing,\u201d a concept that implies something selfless \u2014 like giving a part of your liver to a relative who needs a transplant. Now, at least in industry parlance, the word has also come to denote just about any online venture that connects consumers seeking goods and services with people willing to provide them. That would include apps that charge a fee to stay in strangers\u2019 spare bedrooms or use their cars \u2014 ventures formerly known as \u201crenting.\u201dOf course, marketing by its very nature involves concocting the most appealing expressions to attract consumers. But start-ups that enable consumers to summon drivers, lunch deliveries or domestic help at the tap of an app have added incentives to portray themselves in feel-good terms.Against the backdrop of possible regulation, egalitarian-sounding words like \u201csharing\u201d and \u201cpartner\u201d distance start-ups, linguistically at least, from the traditionally regulated industries they seek to displace.Altruistic words may also lend an aura of incontestability to app-enabled transactions. After all, who wants to challenge services that invoke generous concepts like sharing?In a forthcoming study on the technology-mediated work experiences of Uber drivers, however, two researchers argue that terms like \u201csharing\u201d can put a gloss on business practices that may work against the interests of the supposed sharers \u2014 that is, the drivers themselves.Uber and Lyft, for instance, each set the prices passengers pay. But, the study notes, the Uber app is devised to require drivers to accept a ride request before knowing a passenger\u2019s destination and being able to determine if that fare would be financially worthwhile. The study also points out that Uber asks drivers to return passengers\u2019 iPhones and other lost items \u2014 a service that earns good will for the company \u2014 without automatically compensating drivers for their effort. Some drivers have also noted that the companies encourage them to provide bottled water, mobile phone chargers and other services to passengers at their own expense.These practices seem inconsistent with the idea of workers as partners who have a say in the business or autonomous, self-directed entrepreneurs, the authors write.\u201cI think that the biggest problem with the sharing-economy language is that it co-opts you into your own disempowerment,\u201d says Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at Data & Society, a research center in Manhattan, and a co-author of the study.(Disclosure: I am starting a part-time fellowship this fall at Data & Society.)Kristin Carvell, a spokeswoman for Uber, said the app was intended to provide \u201ctransport without discrimination\u201d wherever and whenever consumers choose. That is why, she said, drivers learn a passenger\u2019s destination only after accepting a ride request. She added that providing water or phone chargers was an optional customer service for drivers and that drivers could return forgotten items directly to a passenger or to Uber.And last month, Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, and Senator Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote a letter to the Labor Department about the industry without once invoking \u201csharing.\u201d The legislators asked labor regulators to examine whether business in \u201cthe new on-demand economy\u201d had the potential to misclassify workers as independent contractors and the possible ramifications of such a problem.

{"Headline": "Old Models Don't Fit the New Economy", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaWASHINGTON \u2014 When presidential candidates in the United States talk about the economy, they speak in terms that have the reassuring familiarity of an old shoe.Candidates on the left decry corrupt banks and waning unions and a government safety net with too many holes. Candidates on the right rail against excessive regulations and taxation. Many arguments could have just as easily been uttered, unadapted, in 1975. And so we get into a seesaw debate about the greatness of unfettered capitalism, on one hand, and the need to control it, on the other. We somehow ignore that capitalism, and the ways of governing it, are changing, making a mockery of Cold War arguments.In an economy increasingly dominated by network effects, peer-to-peer transactions, self-regulation and contract labor, the old frameworks are woefully irrelevant. In a world where Bitcoins threaten to be the new savings accounts, crowdfunding the new stock market, meet-ups the new unions and ratings the new consumer protection, the candidates are stuck in another era.This new economy, meanwhile, is blooming, with much new promise and many new excesses. Here, then, are some questions raised by this new economy that any serious presidential aspirant should be able to answer.\u2022America has two clear tiers of workers: contractors and employees. The former have few regulatory protections; the latter have many. The new economy is straining this division by creating a new class of employee, like the Uber driver, who seems to be more than a contractor and less than an employee. There are likely to be increasing numbers of these hybrid workers, who are a boon to consumers because they are paid, cheaply, as contractors, often at the expense of stability and predictability in their own lives. How should we protect this new class of in-between worker?\u2022Candidates still speak of curing the diseases they diagnose through government power, whether by adding or dismantling laws and programs. But there are new, peer-to-peer ways of galvanizing communities around a problem, from climate change to police violence, and they often begin from the premise that meaningful change begins locally and experimentally rather than nationally and rigidly. How does a 21st-century president propose to marry traditional powers to this new, bottom-up way of pursuing change?\u2022What will it mean to regulate a currency, tax citizens and carry out monetary policy in the age of Bitcoin, in which the government may not know where the money is and its security guarantees are outside programs like federally backed deposit insurance? \u2022How will an American economy so heavily dependent on consumer spending cope with the emergent sharing economy \u2014 specifically, with its rent- not-buy ethos that portends to decimate purchases of goods like cars, second homes, even clothes?What, in short, will it mean to be the American president in a new peer-to- peer age \u2014 to be the most powerful person on earth, in an era when such power matters perhaps less than ever?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Buybacks Draw Scrutiny From Politicians", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookShould corporate stock buybacks be regulated? Or made illegal?Those are the questions not-so-quietly being floated in Washington by a group of elected officials and others trying to get elected, including most recently, Hillary Rodham Clinton.Is the government really going to outlaw buybacks, which over the past decade have become one of the business world\u2019s favorite corporate finance tools?On its face, the issue may seem like a nonstarter. But a growing debate has emerged around the topic of buybacks that increasingly has Wall Street and corporate America worried.The buyback craze, in which virtually every big company from Apple to General Electric to Walmart has participated, has led to a backlash from some investors and government officials, who have questioned whether such use of profits is a productive way to deploy capital rather than reinvesting in businesses and jobs.A renewed focus on the issue has taken place recently as a result of one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches, in which she discussed all the money that companies are pouring into buybacks. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t leave much money to build a new factory or a research lab, or to train workers, or to give them a raise,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.She then offered what some think is her first salvo in the regulation of buybacks: \u201cOther advanced economies \u2014 like the United Kingdom and Hong Kong \u2014 require companies to disclose stock buybacks within one day. But here in the United States, you can go an entire quarter without disclosing. So let\u2019s change that.\u201dMrs. Clinton raises an interesting point about the disclosure rule, one that, if changed, would most likely make it much tougher \u2014 or at least more expensive \u2014 for American companies to buy back shares. Indeed, international companies have done a lot less of it.Her point tiptoes around a more explosive claim from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Tammy Baldwin that buybacks might be a form of market manipulation. Both senators have urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the practice.\u201cThese buybacks were treated as stock manipulation for decades because that is exactly what they are,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThe S.E.C. needs to recognize that.\u201dIndeed, it was that rule change that led to the surge in buybacks, which were considered shareholder friendly. And it\u2019s considered tax efficient: Unlike a dividend, there is no tax to be immediately paid.But companies were also driven to pursue buybacks by executives seeking to lift their pay. Buybacks enable companies to issue more stock to executives without diluting other shareholders because they can buy shares to offset the dilution that occurs when executives exercise their stock options.Buybacks are enticing for corporate executives, but they can create other problems, including the risk that they repurchase their companies\u2019 shares at the exact wrong time, when their stock prices are too high. Worse, some companies take on debt to buy their own shares.Still, Warren E. Buffett, the investor, has repeatedly said he is a big fan of buybacks \u2014 but only when used prudently: \u201cI favor repurchases when two conditions are met: First, a company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to the company\u2019s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated. We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test.\u201dSo what could the S.E.C. actually do about buybacks?Goldman\u2019s research note said that the two most obvious policy changes would be \u201csecurities rules related to the transactions themselves, or tax changes that increase the relative cost to corporations of buying back their own stock instead of paying dividends or making investments in productive capital.\u201dThose may be worthy goals. But it is hard to tell a company how it can or cannot spend its money. Ultimately, the pressure for companies to invest in their operations and new jobs is only going to come when managements see a real business opportunity \u2014 and shareholders demand it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Debate With Substance. No, Not That Debate.", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016Last night, I watched a really interesting political debate, in which the candidates engaged one another substantively about their vision for the country\u2019s future.The candidates demonstrated deep understanding of economic statistics. They talked about how to define a recession, whether rosy-looking job growth statistics ought to be adjusted for population growth, and whether more recent job market weakness could be ascribed solely to the effect of falling energy prices \u2014 a good trend in the long run.They had nuanced disagreements and offered economic rationales for their positions. A moderate candidate, the son of a respected former national leader, warned that raising corporate taxes would discourage job creation and called for higher personal income taxes on top earners instead; his farther-left opponent surprisingly argued that personal income taxes shouldn\u2019t be raised because they\u2019re already very high on top earners, and raising them more would make it hard to retain doctors.The candidates discussed the relative merits of competing policies, like balanced budgets and fiscal stimulus, without resorting to too much demagoguery. They acknowledged hard trade-offs; for instance, building pipelines might lead to more greenhouse gas emissions, but blocking their construction might just mean the shipment of oil by more environmentally risky means. They suggested creative means to expand the economy, like tearing down barriers to trade within the country.They mostly engaged in these exchanges directly, without much interference from the moderator, like adults who could civilly but sharply discuss their country\u2019s direction without the need for a buzzer to stop them from talking too long.The quality of the policy discussion in the Republican debate starring Donald Trump was lower.There were some efforts at substantive economic policy arguments. Mike Huckabee noted that Social Security is funded through taxes on wages, and he said that was unfair because an increasing share of income in the economy is earned as business profits and capital gains, not wages. O.K. But then he suggested abandoning wage taxes for a flat tax on consumption. This is a move that would shift the tax burden away from investors and onto wage earners \u2014 making the problem he identified worse \u2014 since wages ultimately are consumed, and a consumption tax effectively taxes investment income at zero.Mr. Huckabee also suggested that a sales tax is better than an income tax because people in illegal businesses, such as pimps (his example, not mine), would have to pay it on the things they buy. But a move to a sales tax does nothing to improve tax compliance on net unless you think pimps are more likely to charge sales tax on the prostitution services they sell than they are to report prostitution income on their tax returns now.In fact, sales taxes tend to have worse compliance problems than income taxes because they lack two-party reporting. That is, both you and your employer tell the I.R.S. what your salary was, which makes it hard to cheat; since only the retailer (or pimp) reports taxable sales and the shopper (or john) doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s easier to hide taxable sales than taxable income.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Meanwhile, Ben Carson promoted his plan to replace all federal taxes with a flat 10 percent tax inspired by tithing, without explaining how he plans to adjust a federal budget that currently consumes more than 20 percent of G.D.P. to a tax that would collect less than half that.Advertisement"}

In places, the cement walls next to the tracks are crumbling, exposing the electrical wiring that helps power and control the system. And even though Amtrak officials work every weekend to repair the two and a half-mile long tubes, they are alarmed by the rapid deterioration.Even before salt water flooded into the tunnels during Hurricane Sandy nearly three years ago, the tunnels were in trouble. Now the corrosive residue left by the flooding is steadily eating into the concrete and the mechanical and electrical equipment vital to the system.Each of these institutions will have to participate, and each will eventually \u201cwrite a check,\u201d as one expert on Gateway puts it. But the big check will have to come from Washington. This is not simply a local project; Congress has to recognize it as an important national priority and contribute accordingly.The price of the full Gateway Program is now estimated at $20 billion. The new rails and tunnel are expected to cost $14 billion, and the remaining $6 billion would pay for expanding Penn Station in New York City and replacing the 105-year-old Portal Bridge in New Jersey, a span all trains have to cross on the way to the tunnel. That bridge opens and closes three times a week to accommodate passing boats. Amtrak is already spending more than $300 million, primarily from federal sources, to plan the project and to create an underground path for trains to get from the new tunnel to Penn Station.Mr. Schumer and Amtrak should immediately start the process of creating the Gateway Development Corporation. It will take at least 10 years to build the tunnel, which means meeting the Northeast corridor\u2019s rail needs is already a decade behind.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Moveable Glut", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat caused Friday\u2019s stock plunge? What does it mean for the future? Nobody knows, and not much.Still, investors are clearly jittery \u2014 with good reason. U.S. economic news has been good though not great lately, but the world as a whole still seems remarkably accident-prone. For seven years and counting we\u2019ve lived in a global economy that lurches from crisis to crisis: Every time one part of the world finally seems to get back on its feet, another part stumbles. And America can\u2019t insulate itself completely from these global woes.But why does the world economy keep stumbling?On the surface, we seem to have had a remarkable run of bad luck. First there was the housing bust, and the banking crisis it triggered. Then, just as the worst seemed to be over, Europe went into debt crisis and double-dip recession. Europe eventually achieved a precarious stability and began growing again \u2014 but now we\u2019re seeing big problems in China and other emerging markets, which were previously pillars of strength.But these aren\u2019t just a series of unrelated accidents. Instead, what we\u2019re seeing is what happens when too much money is chasing too few investment opportunities.Of course, the boom became a bubble, which inflicted immense damage when it burst. Furthermore, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. There was also a flood of capital from Germany and other northern European countries to Spain, Portugal, and Greece. This too turned out to be a bubble, and the bursting of that bubble in 2009-2010 precipitated the euro crisis.So where does the moving finger of glut go now? Why, back to America, where a fresh inflow of foreign funds has driven the dollar way up, threatening to make our industry uncompetitive again.Whatever the precise mix of causes, what\u2019s important now is that policy makers take seriously the possibility, I\u2019d say probability, that excess savings and persistent global weakness is the new normal.My sense is that there\u2019s a deep-seated unwillingness, even among sophisticated officials, to accept this reality. Partly this is about special interests: Wall Street doesn\u2019t want to hear that an unstable world requires strong financial regulation, and politicians who want to kill the welfare state don\u2019t want to hear that government spending and debt aren\u2019t problems in the current environment.But there\u2019s also, I believe, a sort of emotional prejudice against the very notion of global glut. Politicians and technocrats alike want to view themselves as serious people making hard choices \u2014 choices like cutting popular programs and raising interest rates. They don\u2019t like being told that we\u2019re in a world where seemingly tough-minded policies will actually make things worse. But we are, and they will.Charles M.

Probably not. Still, the big market swings of the past week have been a reminder that the next president may well have to deal with some of the same problems that faced George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Financial instability abides.So this is a test: How would the men and women who would be president respond if crisis struck on their watch?Take, for example, Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin. Mr. Walker was supposed to be a formidable contender, part of his party\u2019s \u201cdeep bench\u201d of current or former governors who know how to get things done. So what was his suggestion to President Obama? Why, cancel the planned visit to America by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader. That would fix things!Then there\u2019s Donald Trump, who likes to take an occasional break from his anti-immigrant diatribes to complain that China is taking advantage of America\u2019s weak leadership. You might think that a swooning Chinese economy would fit awkwardly into that worldview. But no, he simply declared that U.S. markets seem troubled because Mr. Obama has let China \u201cdictate the agenda.\u201d What does that mean? I haven\u2019t a clue \u2014 but neither does he.Back to the deep bench: Chris Christie, another governor who not long ago was touted as the next big thing, was more comprehensible. According to Mr. Christie, the reason U.S. markets were roiled by events in China was U.S. budget deficits, which he claims have put us in debt to the Chinese and hence made us vulnerable to their troubles. That almost rises to the level of a coherent economic story.Did the U.S. market plunge because Chinese investors were cutting off credit? Well, no. If our debt to China were the problem, we would have seen U.S. interest rates spiking as China crashed. Instead, interest rates fell.And you can see why. \u201cObama is endangering America by borrowing from China\u201d is a perfect political line, playing into deficit fetishism, xenophobia and the perennial claim that Democrats don\u2019t stand up for America! America! America! It\u2019s also complete nonsense, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter.In fact, talking nonsense about economic crises is essentially a job requirement for anyone hoping to get the Republican presidential nomination.To understand why, you need to go back to the politics of 2009, when the new Obama administration was trying to cope with the most terrifying crisis since the 1930s. The outgoing Bush administration had already engineered a bank bailout, but the Obama team reinforced this effort with a temporary program of deficit spending, while the Federal Reserve sought to bolster the economy by buying lots of assets.And Republicans, across the board, predicted disaster. Deficit spending, they insisted, would cause soaring interest rates and bankruptcy; the Fed\u2019s efforts would \u201cdebase the dollar\u201d and produce runaway inflation.None of it happened. Interest rates stayed very low, as did inflation. But the G.O.P. never acknowledged, after six full years of being wrong about everything, that the bad things it predicted failed to take place, or showed any willingness to rethink the doctrines that led to those bad predictions. Instead, the party\u2019s leading figures kept talking, year after year, as if the disasters they had predicted were actually happening.Now we\u2019ve had a reminder that something like that last crisis could happen again \u2014 which means that we might need a repeat of the policies that helped limit the damage last time. But no Republican dares suggest such a thing.The point is that one side of the political aisle has been utterly determined to learn nothing from the economic experiences of recent years. If one of these candidates ends up in the hot seat the next time crisis strikes, we should be very, very afraid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Currency Move Clouds Its Policy Goals", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe currency, the renminbi, is part of the fabric of the global economy, providing a way for China to further its diplomatic and investment goals. The renminbi is also an important tool for the leadership\u2019s domestic agenda, namely supporting its economy.China now faces the difficult dilemma of trying to balance its needs at home and abroad.The United States and others have long called for Beijing to let the currency move more freely, rather than keeping it under such tight control. China\u2019s restrictions on the renminbi have also been a concern of the International Monetary Fund, which is weighing whether to include the renminbi in an elite group of world currencies along with the dollar, the euro and the yen.But China has another, seemingly contradictory, motive. In devaluing its currency, China is giving priority to its domestic needs. As China\u2019s economy slows, a weaker currency will help buoy the country\u2019s exporters and create jobs at home.Surging blue-collar wages in China coupled with recent declines in the currencies of rival exporters like South Korea and Taiwan have made it harder for Chinese companies to compete in labor-intensive industries like garment manufacturing and shoe production. Chinese exports fell 8 percent last month compared with a year ago.\u201cWhen the renminbi was appreciating, our customers, who are mainly from North America and Europe, had complained about our prices being too high,\u201d said Anna Cho, sales manager of the Shanghai Kaiyuan Pump Industrial Company, a maker of water and sewage pumps. \u201cThey will be happy about this new development,\u201d she said, referring to the currency devaluation.The coming months will provide a test of whether the leadership is focused more on reforms or on the nation\u2019s economy. While Beijing wants a weak currency, it does not want it to go too low.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.On Tuesday, traders bet heavily that the renminbi would continue to fall. If Beijing follows through on its pledge to let the market play a much bigger role, more declines will follow.\u201cIf they really do it, it may be going down and down and down,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Lombard Street Research, a consulting firm in London.Devaluing the renminbi weeks before President Xi\u2019s visit to the United States also poses clear political challenges at a time when China is trying to smooth over trans-Pacific disputes.The devaluation risks inflaming a seemingly dormant political issue in the United States: whether China manipulates its currency to gain a trade advantage. Critics in Congress have long argued that the renminbi is undervalued and that this dynamic has prompted many companies to move production to China.\u201cFor years, China has rigged the rules and played games with its currency, leaving American workers out to dry. Rather than changing their ways, the Chinese government seems to be doubling down,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.Under President George W. Bush and now under President Obama, the Treasury has been cautious about publicly criticizing China on currency policy. Treasury officials have not wanted to incite Chinese defiance, and they have tended to respect China\u2019s contention that its trade surpluses, though huge, have shrunk as a percentage of its growing economy.\u201cWe will continue to monitor how these changes are implemented and continue to press China on the pace of its reforms, including additional measures to transition to a market-oriented exchange rate and its stated desire to move towards an economy that is more dependent on domestic demand, which is in China and America\u2019s best interests,\u201d a Treasury representative said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny reversal in reforms would be a troubling development.\u201dChina\u2019s action could also factor into the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking.The Fed\u2019s leaders have been talking for months about raising interest rates as a way to curb the considerable monetary stimulus they have delivered to the strengthening American economy. But a weakened renminbi \u2014 and the possibility that other countries may follow suit \u2014 could mean further weakening of American exports and slower economic growth.\u201cIt could lower the odds of a Fed rate hike in the near term,\u201d said Thomas Lam, the chief economist for industrialized economies at RHB Securities Singapore, a unit of a Malaysian financial conglomerate, the RHB Group.The currency situation puts China in a tricky position.China has the means to stop any unwanted drop in currency. The country has $3.5 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, which it can use to buy back renminbi globally and push up the value.But the devaluation also comes at a time when China is pushing for broader acceptance of the renminbi, and the exercise of tight currency controls undermines that effort.The I.M.F., in particular, wants to see more evidence that the renminbi is being used outside China, notably for central bank reserves or bonds. The appetite among overseas central banks and bond investors for renminbi-denominated assets has gradually increased.But part of the demand has been a speculative bet that the renminbi will continue to rise against the dollar. Even small, occasional hints in the last 18 months that the renminbi might weaken have tended to erode such players\u2019 enthusiasm. So Tuesday\u2019s devaluation could damage China\u2019s bid to bolster international use of its currency.Senator Schumer warned that the devaluation might lower the chances that the renminbi will be recognized by the I.M.F. as a leading currency, as part of the fund\u2019s so-called special drawing rights.\u201cUnless and until China stops artificially devaluing their currency,\u201d he said, \u201cthe renminbi should be barred from consideration as a global reserve currency by the I.M.F.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Drought Is Made Worse by Global Warming, Scientists Say", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal warming caused by human emissions has most likely intensified the drought in California by 15 to 20 percent, scientists said on Thursday, warning that future dry spells in the state are almost certain to be worse than this one as the world continues to heat up.The paper on the California drought echoes a growing body of research that has cited the effects of human emissions, but scientists not involved in the work described it as more thorough than any previous effort because it analyzed nearly every possible combination of data on temperature, rainfall, wind speed and other factors that could be influencing the severity of the drought. The research, said David B. Lobell, a Stanford University climate scientist, is \u201cprobably the best I\u2019ve seen on this question.\u201d\u201cTo say you\u2019re going to ignore that there\u2019s a huge risk here, the way we\u2019re filling the atmosphere with heat-trapping gases, is folly, ignorance and totally irresponsible,\u201d Mr. Brown said Thursday in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd virtually the entire Republican Party in Congress is saying exactly that. It\u2019s inexplicable.\u201dChris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, said Thursday that political leaders confronting questions about climate change \u201ccan\u2019t stick their heads in the sand and pretend it isn\u2019t happening. Instead we need to be about the business of taking action, but action that doesn\u2019t throw the economy and jobs out the window at the same time.\u201dAs climate scientists analyze the origins of the drought, they have been tackling two related questions: What caused the dearth of rain and snow that began in 2012? And, regardless of the cause, how have the effects been influenced by global warming?The immediate reason for the drought is clear enough: For more than three years, a persistent ridge of high pressure in the western Pacific Ocean has blocked storms from reaching California in the winter, when the state typically gets most of its moisture. That pattern closely resembles past California droughts.Some scientists have argued that the ocean and atmospheric factors that produced the ridge have become somewhat more likely because of global warming, but others have disputed that, and the matter remains unresolved.On the question of the effects, scientists have been much clearer. Rising temperatures dry the soil faster and cause more rapid evaporation from streams and reservoirs, so they did not need any research to tell them that the drought was probably worse because of the warming trend over the past century. The challenge has been to quantify how much worse.The group led by Dr. Williams concluded that human-caused climate change was responsible for between 8 and 27 percent of the deficit in soil moisture that California experienced from 2012 to 2014.But, in an interview, Dr. Williams said the low number was derived from a method that did not take account of the way global warming had sped up since the 1970s. That led him and his colleagues to conclude that climate change was most likely responsible for about 15 to 20 percent of the moisture deficit.Since 1895, California has warmed by a little more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit. That increase sounds small, but as an average over an entire state in all seasons, scientists say, it is a large number. The warmer air can hold more water vapor, and the result is that however much rain or snow falls in a given year, the atmosphere will draw it out of the soil more aggressively.\u201cIt really is quite simple,\u201d said Richard Seager, a senior climate scientist at Lamont and a co-author on the Williams paper. \u201cWhen the atmosphere is as warm as it is, the air is capable of holding far more water. So more of the precipitation that falls on the ground is evaporated, and less is in the soil, and less gets into streams.\u201dDr. Williams calculated that the air over California can absorb about 8.5 trillion more gallons of water in a typical year than would have been the case in the cooler atmosphere at the end of the 19th century. The air does not always manage to soak up that much, however, because evaporation slows as the soils dry out.How much more California will warm depends on how high global emissions of greenhouse gases are allowed to go, but scientists say efforts to control the problem have been so ineffective that they cannot rule out another 5 or 6 degrees of warming over the state in this century, a level that could turn even modest rainfall deficits into record-shattering droughts.For politicians like Mr. Obama and Mr. Brown, the emerging question is whether Americans will awaken to the risks and demand stronger action before emissions reach such catastrophic levels.\u201cI don\u2019t think climate change is anywhere near the issue that it\u2019s going to be, but the concern is rising in the public mind,\u201d Mr. Brown said Thursday. \u201cThe facts can\u2019t be concealed forever.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The man\u2019s image was captured by a security camera as he placed a backpack in the spot where minutes later an explosion ripped through the crowded Erawan Shrine, killing 20 people.The Thai police released a sketch of the man with features they characterized as Caucasian, Arab or mixed race, saying he was about 20 to 30 years old and 5 feet 7 inches tall.Although a police spokesman raised the possibility that the man was Thai and in disguise, the warrant on charges of premeditated murder was issued for an \u201cunnamed foreign man who appears in the sketch drawing.\u201dA motorcycle taxi driver said in a phone interview aired by Channel 3, a Thai TV station, that he had picked up a man matching the police description at a taxi stand a quarter of a mile from the shrine after the bomb exploded.The driver, who gave his name as Kasem, said the man did not speak to him, just walked up and handed him a piece of paper with the words \u201cLumpini Park\u201d written on it in English. Lumpini Park is a well-populated area in the commercial heart of Bangkok, about two-thirds of a mile from Erawan.\u201cHe had a conversation on the phone,\u201d Kasem said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the language is. I don\u2019t know, but it is surely not Thai nor English language.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone at where I left him,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was dark. There are some trees and it\u2019s hard to see.\u201dThe Thai police spokesman, Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri, said the security camera footage showed two men who appeared to be accomplices at the shrine, including one who gave up his seat on a bench and then stood nearby as a backpack was being placed on the ground.Although the police said they were investigating a \u201cnetwork,\u201d General Prawut clarified that this meant that the police believed that the perpetrators had gotten assistance with logistics, including obtaining materials to make the explosive device in the backpack. \u201cWe are not saying this was an international network,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.The attack on Monday evening struck at the heart of Thailand\u2019s tourist economy. In addition to six Thais, the dead included four Malaysians, four mainland Chinese, two residents of Hong Kong, an Indonesian and a Singaporean. Two other victims remained unidentified on Wednesday, according to the Bangkok Emergency Medical Services. More than 100 people were wounded, and several were listed in critical condition.The shrine, which sustained only minor damage in the explosion, reopened on Wednesday. Workers filled in the small crater created by the bomb, but the gilded statue of the four-faced Hindu god Brahma at the center of the shrine was missing a large piece of chin.Thailand\u2019s chief of police, Gen. Somyot Poompanmoung, told reporters that it was too early to say what had driven the perpetrators to plant the bomb.\u201cWe haven\u2019t come to a conclusion on the motives of the case yet, whether it is terrorism or political,\u201d he said.General Somyot also announced a reward of 1 million baht, or about $28,000, for help leading to arrests.The Bangkok Post, in an editorial on Wednesday, called for Thais, who have been deeply divided by politics over the past decade, to unite in trying to find the bombers.Poypiti Amatatham reported from Bangkok, and Thomas Fuller from Yangon, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Out of Ashes,\u2019 by Konrad H. Jarausch", "Date": "2015-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A year ago we marked (rather than celebrated) the centenary of the outbreak of what was at the time the most terrible war in history. Then this year we not only marked but also celebrated the 70th anniversary of the end of an even more terrible war.Looking back on those three decades from 1914 to 1945, when a continent that had prided itself on being a cradle of civilization was torn apart by hideous destruction, by tyranny in the name of new ideologies and by mass murder, it\u2019s not surprising that some have seen the 20th century as \u201cthe most terrible .\u2008.\u2008. in Western history.\u201d Isaiah Berlin\u2019s words were quoted (among other epigraphs to the same effect) at the front of \u201cThe Age of Extremes,\u201d by E.J. Hobsbawm, itself one of a number of attempts to write a synoptic or panoramic history of that century. \u201cWorst of times\u201d has become a familiar phrase \u2014 platitude maybe \u2014 of our age.What made that descent into darkness so grim was that the century had begun in a spirit of optimism, \u201cwith high hopes for further material progress\u201d as Konrad H. Jarausch writes in his sweeping survey \u201cOut of Ashes,\u201d only to have its faith in progress \u2014 or merely in civilization \u2014 challenged, even shattered. First came the horrifying bloodshed of World War I, \u201cthe great seminal catastrophe of this century,\u201d in George Kennan\u2019s well-known words, from which all other disasters flowed.How to make sense of this seemingly inexplicable regression into barbarism \u2014 and also of that other astonishing story, the recovery of Europe after 1945? Bernard Wasserstein took the title of his excellent book on the same subject as Jarausch, \u201cBarbarism and Civilization,\u201d from Walter Benjamin\u2019s observation that \u201cthere is no document of civilization that is not simultaneously a document of barbarism.\u201d If nothing else, the age offered a corrective to na\u00efve faith that material advance in itself would make us better people.His previous books have been on German history, including a study of Bethmann Hollweg, the chancellor a century ago when Germany unhappily plunged into war, and \u201cAfter Hitler,\u201d which starts at the end of the descent into darkness and looks at how Germany recovered and \u201crecivilized,\u201d to become the most successful democracy, and economy, in Europe. \u201cOut of Ashes\u201d doesn\u2019t pretend to any overarching explanation, or to be a work of original scholarship. A narrative based on very wide reading in several languages, it might be called an old- fashioned book by an old-fashioned historian, which are not words of dispraise in this reviewer\u2019s vocabulary.When the 20th century began, the age of European empire was reaching its apogee, and imperial rivalry is one of many reasons often advanced for the catastrophe of 1914. As much ink has been spent on the question of how the Great War started and who bore responsibility for it as on any other historical topic, and to not much effect if that means finding a conclusive answer.One thing we may safely say is that none of the European powers would have embarked on the war if they had known how it would be waged, what its cost would be and how it would end: in exile for the kaiser, death for the czar and his family, over 1.3 million dead for the French. As for the British, Jarausch says, they \u201cwanted to eliminate German competition without too much upsetting the balance of power on the continent,\u201d though in fact they failed to eliminate the competition while utterly upsetting the balance.No consequence was so direct as the Bolshevik conquest of Russia, which would never have taken place without the war. Apart from anything else, had Karl Marx\u2019s prophetic schema been true, the October Revolution would not have occurred in such a backward country. \u201cThe Red October was therefore a minority coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that claimed to be a popular revolution from below,\u201d as Jarausch rightly says.If \u201cOut of Ashes\u201d can be said to have a single theme, it hinges on \u201cthe key concept\u201d of modernity, so that, for example, \u201cmodernization was deeply involved in the imperial project.\u201d Now modernity has become a fashionable concept, but it\u2019s a most elusive one, and it presents plenty of problems, especially in the early 20th century.Was Bolshevism modern? Was Fascism? Or was National Socialism? Mussolini and Hitler would have said so. In a chapter on \u201cModernist Provocations,\u201d Jarausch looks at art and architecture, but provocation or not, there was much advanced building in Germany and Italy as well as in Russia, during the 1930s. Or as Jarausch rather oddly puts it, \u201cThe Nazi rejection of modernism was itself a product of modernity since they also embraced it selectively.\u201dAfter 1918, democracy was fragile in much of Europe, and the Depression was the tipping point, in Germany and elsewhere. And yet, once again confounding Marxists, it was the radical right that often made a stronger appeal than socialism.If trying to attribute blame for the Great War is fruitless, there may be a more serious argument about who in the 1920s was responsible for the catastrophic failure of constitutional government, or even basic decency. And here is something Jarausch might have developed more from his cross-Atlantic perspective.He mentions in passing that the American government \u201cwas unwilling to forgive its loans to the Entente countries for the purchase of war mat\u00e9riel that had fueled a boom in the United States,\u201d but there was more to it. After World War I, the Americans withdrew into a shell. In an ugly period not merely of isolationism but of nativism and racism, they slammed the door shut to immigrants, while refusing to accept their international duty.At the beginning of the 1920s the French and the British longed for any kind of American security guarantee against German revanchism. And by the end of the decade a Foreign Office representative in London wrote forlornly that \u201cGreat Britain is still staggering from the effects of the superhuman effort made during the war, is loaded with a great burden of debt and is crippled by the evil of unemployment,\u201d while conscious of the total superiority of the United States, \u201c25 times as large, five times as wealthy, three times as populous, twice as ambitious, almost invulnerable\u201d \u2014 but determined to keep clear of Europe. That shortsightedness was something for which many young Americans would pay a heavy price after 1941, though not as heavy as the price Europe paid for its own follies and sins.Sometimes Jarausch\u2019s pen nods. The \u201920s sound more plodding than roaring from sentences like: \u201cIn the fast-paced metropolitan centers, a quest for romance drove flappers into dance halls to meet young men in search of diversion.\u201d He has already called Kaiser Wilhelm\u2019s order to his troops in 1900 to be as \u201cterrible as the Huns\u201d an \u201cill-advised injunction,\u201d when \u201cexterminatory\u201d or plain \u201crepulsive\u201d might have been better words. When he writes that the German Jews\u2019 \u201costentatious accumulation of wealth spurred widespread envy,\u201d he doubtless doesn\u2019t mean it to sound as it might to some ears, but to say that \u201cit was the compliance of most victims that made the Final Solution possible\u201d is a little worse than clumsy. What made it possible, alas, was the passive or active compliance of the Germans who carried out the great murder.No book of this length can be inerrant, but to say that \u201cseveral million tribesmen\u201d inhabited German South-West Africa (now Namibia) at the beginning of the last century when the actual number was less than one million \u2014 even before the genocidal German campaign against the Hereros \u2014 is careless. The great European newspapers of that age did not include Le Monde, which was founded in 1944; and Stanley Baldwin was not a \u201chard-liner.\u201dThe age of great European wars ended as abruptly as it had begun. Also unforeseen, the consequences for the decolonized countries were often disappointing or unhappy. Within the completely artificial borders left behind by the departing powers there were far too many disparate peoples unhappily stranded in someone else\u2019s country.Despite such problems, however, Europe itself was reborn after 1945 from the ashes of Jarausch\u2019s title. Economic and social revival was followed by the conception and birth of the European Economic Community or Common Market. These years were what the French called the trente glorieuses, the astonishing three decades of growing productivity and prosperity. Then, in the mid-1970s it all came to a grinding halt. In Eastern Europe, there was an even deeper problem, with \u201creal existing socialism\u201d ending in failure, frustration and implosion.According to Jarausch, change came once more in the years after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 as Europe took additional steps toward unification. \u201cEnding a period of prolonged stagnation,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe creation of the European Union (E.U.) was the result of a second relaunching of integration.\u201d Although awkwardly expressed, that seems to imply that developments springing from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty brought renewed prosperity, which he can scarcely mean.To the contrary, the years since Maastricht have been peculiarly bitter for Europe \u2014 and for \u201cEurope\u201d as a political concept. It proved impotent when the former Yugoslavia was torn apart, and by now it should be impossible to speak of a common foreign and security policy for the E.U. as anything but a fantasy.The recovery of Europe after the \u201cmost terrible\u201d century may be a wonder. And yet this is not a happy moment for Euro-enthusiasts. Although Jarausch dismisses \u201cfederalist celebrations of the \u2018superstate\u2019 of Europe,\u201d he cheerfully writes that \u201cthe European project is .\u2008.\u2008. very much alive,\u201d words that must sound hollow in Athens at present.Despite its comparative demographic decline \u2014 from about 25 percent of the world\u2019s population in 1914 to about 11 percent in 2013 \u2014 Europe is not dead or dying, as some neoconservatives gloatingly suggest. But to recover, it will need to revive once again, this time perhaps from the ashes of a doomed drive toward an unachievable \u201cever-closer union.\u201dOUT OF ASHESA New History of Europe in the Twentieth Century By Konrad H.

{"Headline": "A Cheer and a Half for Cheap Commodities", "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesCommodities markets have taken a beating this summer. Oil, coal, coffee, soybeans, copper, iron and nearly every other commodity has fallen sharply in price, upending currency markets and inflicting pain in large parts of the world economy.But few Americans are complaining. Unless you are trading soybeans or have been focused on the battered shares of companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, or on sinking currencies like the Brazilian real or South African rand, you may not have noticed the commodities debacle.For many of us, in fact, the commodities rout hasn\u2019t been perceived as a crisis at all: It has seemed to be welcome news. That is understandable, though that view may be shortsighted.Consider gasoline, probably the most closely monitored commodity in America, one whose price is posted prominently at filling stations all over the country. Compared with the recent past, gas is still very cheap.Declines in the commodities markets have already had a damping effect on inflation in the United States and are likely to restrain it in future data releases, said Azhar Iqbal, an econometrician with Wells Fargo Securities.How much of an effect has the decline in the commodities market had on inflation? As a rough guideline, note that the widely followed CRB Commodities index has declined more than 18 percent since May 2014. Every 10 percentage point drop in that index shaves 0.4 percentage point from the annual headline C.P.I. number in America, and a lesser amount, less than 0.1 percentage point, from the core inflation index, Mr. Iqbal\u2019s economic model shows. \u201cThe fall in commodity prices has had a measurable effect in the United States,\u201d he said.The price declines have complicated matters for the Federal Reserve, which has said that after nearly seven years it will begin to raise short-term interest rates from their near-zero level, if data on inflation and unemployment justify the move.The unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in July, its lowest level in years, the Labor Department said on Friday. \u201cThe low inflation rate, which is connected to commodities, may have induced the Fed to have waited this long to raise interest rates,\u201d said Jay Bryson, a global economist with Wells Fargo Securities. Low interest rates are generally thought to be bullish for the stock market, and while the shares of commodities producers have been hammered, the overall American stock market has undoubtedly been helped by that commodities market effect, he said.But even if Americans outside the oil patch haven\u2019t been hurt directly, there are important reasons for them to be concerned about the damage in the commodities markets.\u201cHistorically, commodities have been very sensitive indicators of global economic activity,\u201d said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist and strategist. Big declines in the CRB index have typically presaged recessions and bear markets in stocks, he said.He is not expecting that to happen now partly because the imbalances in commodities markets seem largely to have resulted from miscalculations that led to excess supply. \u201cIt\u2019s not that demand is that weak,\u201d he said, which would be more serious. \u201cThe problem is mainly with global supplies.\u201dChina is the world\u2019s biggest commodity consumer, HSBC figures show. It accounts for 12.8 percent of all global commodity imports. (The comparable figure for the United States, the second-biggest global consumer, is 10.3 percent.) And these days, when China sneezes, the commodity markets run for cover.Currency markets have responded to the changes in the terms of trade, weakening the currencies of commodity producers and strengthening the American dollar. (The Chinese renminbi, which the government keeps in a narrow band linked to the dollar, has strengthened against other currencies, too.) That will make imports to the United States cheaper, and it will make exports more expensive, helping rebalance global supply and demand, Mr. Yardeni said. It can be expected to slow American economic growth and speed up growth in commodity-producing countries that are in dire need of stimulus, he said. \u201cWe need to keep our fingers crossed and hope that all works out.\u201dHe added that there was a good chance that it would work out for the United States. Enjoy the quiet and the low prices, by all means, he said. But be aware that unstable and declining global markets can be quite dangerous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Former Hummer Plant in Indiana, Mercedes Turns Out S.U.V.s for China", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMISHAWAKA, Ind. \u2014 The steady comeback of the American auto industry has brought new life to underused factories, as carmakers across the country add shifts of workers to meet growing demand for new vehicles.But even in an industry on the rebound, the revival of a once-empty plant in northern Indiana stands apart.The plant was idle for years after G.M. went bankrupt in 2009 and had to shut down its Hummer brand and shrink other operations as a condition of its $49 billion government bailout.At the time, it appeared that the factory in this city of 48,000 might be another casualty on the long list of auto plants that closed their doors permanently in the last recession.Yet in an unusual turn of events, the old Hummer plant has been resurrected and, in the process, become an example of how a modest-size Rust Belt manufacturer can find its niche in an increasingly global automotive industry.AM General\u2019s hourly workers, who belong to the United Automobile Workers union, are building the German luxury S.U.V.s for a specific clientele: consumers in China.While a number of American auto plants export their products around the world, the factory is believed to be the only plant in the United States that ships its entire volume for sale in the Chinese market. Like other automakers, Daimler is not backing off its plans for China despite a recent sales slowdown there.\u201cWe are making German luxury vehicles in Indiana for export to China, and doing it with workers at the oldest U.A.W. local in the nation,\u201d said Howard B. Glaser, head of AM General\u2019s commercial division. \u201cYou basically have the entire global economy under one roof.\u201dThe plant\u2019s revival is only one piece of what has become a vibrant American auto manufacturing sector.The number of American-made vehicles exported to other countries has grown to more than 2.1 million in 2014, more than doubling from just over 1 million in 2009, according to federal data from the Commerce Department\u2019s International Trade Administration.Exports to China have particularly skyrocketed, jumping to 305,000 last year from barely 25,000 vehicles in 2009.According to the Center for Automotive Research, overall American vehicle production hit 11.66 million last year, up from 11.07 million in 2013. Bernard Swiecki, assistant director of the center\u2019s Automotive Communities Partnership, said that with auto sales booming, it was not surprising that factories that survived the downturn were now roaring.\u201cIt\u2019s pure supply and demand,\u201d Mr. Swiecki said. \u201cThe automakers have to produce vehicles for a robust market, and so they\u2019re squeezing every bit of production they can out of these locations.\u201dIn 2010 and into 2011, the center estimates that capacity utilization at North American auto plants \u2014 including Canada and Mexico \u2014 had fallen to about 70 percent, he said. In 2012, when the recovery began, that rose to 91 percent \u2014 and last year, it grew to 96 percent.Mr. Swiecki said that Mercedes-Benz\u2019s plans for the factory in Indiana was a sign of an industry with the wind at its back.\u201cIn a good economy like this, that plant is going to be very, very busy,\u201d he said.The workers at the plant, many of whom had endured long layoffs in recent years, are grateful to be back on the assembly line \u2014 and proud of their plant\u2019s status as a full-time exporter.\u201cYou do quality work and people will want to pay for it, no matter where they are from,\u201d said Jason Smith, a worker at the plant for 11 years.About 350 hourly workers staff the plant, down from a high of 1,000 employees during the glory days of the gas-guzzling Hummer brand at G.M.While it may not be operating at full capacity, the factory has become a bright spot in the Indiana economy, which lost many manufacturing jobs in the last recession.The nearby city of Elkhart, for example, lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in the recreational vehicle industry, and unemployment rates in the area approached 20 percent.The AM General plant was only eight years old when G.M. went bankrupt.\u201cThose were very tough times,\u201d said David Whitby, who heads commercial manufacturing for AM General. \u201cWe went from having about 1,000 workers in the plant down to just about zero.\u201dSome of the laid-off workers at AM General transferred to the company\u2019s military vehicle facility next door to the Hummer plant. But job security was tenuous there as well.\u201cWe just had to keep moving forward and hoping for the best,\u201d said Velgean Daniel, who has worked for the company for 15 years. The plant started its slow recovery in 2011, when it began building limited volumes of a handicapped-accessible van created by a start-up company called MV-1.Production was too small to allow AM General to begin recalling the bulk of the laid-off workers. And the plant itself was considerably larger than was needed just for the MV-1.A huge opportunity was on the horizon, though, as the auto industry in the United States started its revival.The German automaker Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, was running short on production capacity for S.U.V.s at its factory in Alabama.Last year, Mercedes officials started scouting for other possible sites to build one of the plant\u2019s S.U.V. models, the R-class.The R-class had never caught on with American consumers, and sales in the United States were discontinued a few years ago. But the sleek, station-wagon-shaped model was a hit in China, and Mercedes was determined to keep building it.Jason Hoff, the head of Mercedes operations in the United States, said it was not practical to relocate the supply base for the R-class from North America to China. \u201cThat would have been far too expensive,\u201d he said.Instead, Mercedes signed a multiyear contract to have AM General assemble the R-class in Mishawaka, using parts shipped into the facility from suppliers throughout North America and Europe.\u201cThey had a lot of experience here and a very good work force,\u201d Mr. Hoff said. \u201cAnd the facility is very flexible and can integrate our product quite well.\u201dAn AM General spokesman said the company did not need any financial incentives from state or local government to retool the plant for the new model.Now, the plant is building between 70 and 100 vehicles a day, mostly R-class S.U.V.s as well as a small number of MV-1 vans.There is enough space for more models in the plant, and Mr. Glaser of AM General said the company was hoping other manufacturers might send it products they could not build on their own.Mishawaka\u2019s mayor, David Wood, said the turnaround at the plant had had a profound impact on his community, and not just because much-needed jobs and paychecks have returned.\u201cThis is just a real momentum-builder for us and for the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThe auto industry has a long history here going all the way back to Studebaker, but bringing in Mercedes really puts us on the map.\u201dAaron M. Kessler contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Partnership Session Ends With Heels Dug In", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Tokyo was ready to extend major concessions on American truck tariffs but was blocked by Mexico, which wanted less competition for its own trucks in the United States market.Canada held firm on protecting its politically sensitive dairy market ahead of elections in October, but for New Zealand, a tiny country with huge dairy exports, that was unacceptable.And virtually all of the parties hated American protections of pharmaceutical firms, but a compromise on that issue could cost the support of Republicans in Congress.For President Obama, nailing down the largest regional trade accord in history would be a legacy-making achievement, proof that his foreign policy \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia was more than rhetorical \u2014 as well as a milestone in international economic cooperation. But Mr. Obama learned last week in his native state of Hawaii that his own administration does not always control its fate.Final negotiations over the trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are not like a checkers game with Congress, pitting two branches of government and two parties against each other. Rather, all 12 nations are asserting their particular economic and political interests in a multiple-dimension chess match, with one problem often setting off another.Whether all of those can be resolved is now a matter of will. But the disagreements are pushing any resolution of the trade deal further into the politically difficult presidential election season in the United States. At least one negotiator suggested privately that it soon may become easier to say \u201cno\u201d than \u201cyes.\u201d\u201cThe process of reaching a complicated trade agreement is to start with a huge number of uncertainties and slowly resolve them piece by piece until you can see one or two of the most difficult issues remaining,\u201d said Tim Groser, New Zealand\u2019s trade negotiator. \u201cNow that the undergrowth has been cleared away, we can see clearly that there are one or two really hard issues.\u201dFrom dairy and sugar to autos and pharmaceuticals, the issues number more than one or two.Vietnam is not ready to give up all the advantages that the communist country\u2019s state-owned enterprises enjoy. Japan is still worried about Australia\u2019s legal action against its treatment of marine mammals. And Chile, which already has free trade agreements sealed with each of the other members of the T.P.P., doesn\u2019t see much of a loss in letting it all fall apart.Still, Obama advisers and trade experts say, the president remains committed, and United States leadership could help bridge a lot of the divides.\u201cIt is still central to President Obama\u2019s policy in Asia and the Asia Pacific. It is the centerpiece of his economic legacy,\u201d said Jeffrey J. Schott, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Mexico\u2019s secretary of the economy, Ildefonso Guajardo, is taking a particularly hard line against Japan\u2019s automotive industry, a position that some negotiators said helped dash any hope of completing the trade deal in Maui.At issue is the definition of a car or truck from one of the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries. Mexico wants only vehicles with around 65 percent of their components made in the T.P.P. region to qualify for lower tariff barriers under the deal. That would favor Mexican trucks made with American and Japanese parts. Japan wants that \u201crule of origin\u201d threshold set closer to 50 percent, favoring its parts suppliers in China and Thailand.\u201cThe auto industry in Mexico is the seventh-largest producer in the world and the fourth-largest exporter,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said late on Friday. \u201cWhat you can accuse me\u201d of \u201cis putting myself to the front to really push the interest of my country.\u201d New Zealand and Canada are at loggerheads over dairy. While tiny New Zealand produces just 3 percent of the world\u2019s dairy products, it is the world\u2019s largest dairy exporter. Canada\u2019s government, embattled ahead of parliamentary elections in October, showed little inclination to let New Zealand\u2019s cheese and eggs compete with its own.Mr. Groser, the New Zealand negotiator, noted that his country was the first to propose a trade accord linking both sides of the Pacific Ocean. He wrote one of the first briefs championing it.\u201cI don\u2019t really feel emotionally in the space of wanting to leave the party. No, we will not be pushed out of this agreement,\u201d he said.With so many countries angered by Canada\u2019s closed-door stand on dairy, Ed Fast, Ottawa\u2019s minister of international trade, was left to defend his stance. \u201cCanada came to Maui ready to conclude a T.P.P. We were active, constructive partners at the table,\u201d he said.The biggest problem may be intractable differences over intellectual property protections, especially for pharmaceutical companies developing the next generation of medicines known as biologics. A copy of the still-incomplete intellectual property chapter, viewed by The New York Times, shows just how isolated the United States\u2019 position is.In one section, the United States and Japan want language saying a lack of enforcement resources is no excuse for failure to ensure compliance. That position is opposed by New Zealand, Vietnam, Mexico, Peru, Australia, Malaysia and Brunei.In another section, 11 negotiating nations propose language to ensure judicial authorities have the power to force a company that \u201cabuses enforcement procedures\u201d to compensate a party \u201cwrongfully enjoined or restrained\u201d if a case is lost. Only the United States opposes that.Much of the intellectual property dispute revolves around the protection of major pharmaceutical companies, which want the United States\u2019 12 years of data protection on new drugs expanded to the other 11 T.P.P. countries. Republicans in Congress, especially Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a key ally of the president\u2019s on trade, demand that the White House hold firm.But most of the other countries \u2014 and most international health groups \u2014 oppose that position strenuously. They say it would keep drug prices high, drain government coffers and put new biologic medicines out of reach for the developing world.\u201cThat is the toughest nut to crack,\u201d Mr. Schott said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Naftali Bennett on Israel\u2019s Jewish Terrorists", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel is under attack. This time though, the threat is not from Iran, Hezbollah or Hamas. It comes from a fringe group within Israel, which needs to be eradicated swiftly and forcefully.Last week, an ultra-Orthodox man brutally stabbed six participants at the Gay Pride Parade in Jerusalem, including 16-year-old Shira Banki who a few days later died of her injuries. The attacker, Yishai Schlissel, had been released from prison just weeks before for committing a similar attack at a gay pride parade a decade earlier. This should never have happened.A day later, Israelis awoke to news that an 18-month-old Palestinian boy, Ali Dawabsha, had been burned to death in a firebomb attack on his home in the West Bank village of Duma. His family is still hospitalized, fighting for their lives.Shira\u2019s murderer and the suspected perpetrators of the heinous and unforgivable firebombing that killed Ali are radical Jewish extremists who claim to act in the name of God but do the exact opposite \u2014 they desecrate God, our religion and the Jewish people.They represent no one but themselves. They are terrorists. And just as Israel has done in our previous wars on terror, we will defeat them with all the means at our disposal.I am the leader of Israel\u2019s right-wing camp and it is no secret that I have genuine disagreements with our Palestinian neighbors. I believe in the legitimacy of the settlements in the West Bank and I am opposed to conceding our national homeland and dividing Jerusalem. I believe that a Palestinian state, if established, would be taken over by ISIS, Hamas and Islamic Jihad and would turn into a launching pad for attacks against our citizens, just like what happened in Gaza. It is a risk Israel cannot take.But at the same time, I believe in coexistence and working together with our neighbors to create stability, economic prosperity and a safe, secure future for all of our children, Israeli and Palestinian, without regard for their religion or sexual orientation. We can do that by working together to improve our economies, the infrastructure we jointly use and in improving our bilateral ties.The terrorists who killed Shira and Ali do not represent Israel or its people. They are a fringe group, made up of radical extremists who do not only seek to kill. Their ultimate goal is the destruction of the State of Israel. They act against and threaten the very premise of what the Zionist movement envisioned when returning to the Land of Israel after 2,000 years in exile \u2014 a Jewish and democratic state committed to equality and freedom for all its citizens. They are anarchists, a fifth column within Israel and like Hamas and Hezbollah, they must face the full force of Israel\u2019s justice system and its defense establishment.But they are also a tiny group. They do not represent the 400,000 residents of Jewish communities throughout the West Bank, the overwhelming majority of whom are law-abiding citizens and have condemned these acts of violence.The government I am a member of has already authorized our security forces to use all measures \u2014 even extraordinary ones \u2014 to apprehend Ali\u2019s murderers. The model is very similar to how we combat terrorist groups that operate along and inside our borders \u2014 superior intelligence, legal action like administrative detentions and if needed, military force. Terror is terror even when it originates from within.As Israel\u2019s education minister, I also believe that the effort needs to be taken into our homes and schools. We need to teach more tolerance, respect and appreciation of all people. This can be accomplished by learning more about Arabs, their culture and history and by teaching Arabic to Jewish students.The same needs to happen on the Palestinian side. Textbooks there need to stop publishing maps that pretend there is no State of Israel. They need to stop praising martyrdom, stop naming town squares for mass murderers and begin teaching tolerance and coexistence. For attacks like this to stop, we need to speak respectfully about one another and appreciate the differences among us. That is the only real way to attain a genuine and durable peace.A few weeks ago, the Jewish people marked the ninth day of the Jewish month of Av, a fast commemorating the destruction of the Jewish Temple that used to stand in Jerusalem.The Roman destruction of the Temple also led to the loss of our people\u2019s previous commonwealth and it took us 2,000 years to re-establish an independent Jewish state.These extremists threaten Zionism, our future and our statehood. We must do everything in our power to stop them.Naftali Bennett is Israel\u2019s minister of education and diaspora affairs and the leader of the Jewish Home party.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall St. Policy Poses a Challenge for Presidential Candidates", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven seven years after the financial crisis, Wall Street has lost none of its ability to stir partisan rancor.The Republican presidential candidates are almost entirely unified behind repealing the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation approved by a Democratic-controlled Congress after the 2008 collapse, which was brought on by reckless mortgage lending. That rollback would undoubtedly allow for more unfettered trading and lending.Pushing in the opposition direction, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s two challengers for the Democratic nomination have made it a priority to bring back a Depression-era law that would force the biggest banks to break up.Mrs. Clinton has joined the chorus of Democrats demanding more oversight of Wall Street, recognizing that the issue has become a rallying cry among progressive activists and is bound up in the broader debate on income and wealth inequality.But Mrs. Clinton, who has won strong financial support from Wall Street in the past, has been piecing together a more unexpected set of policy proposals \u2014 including a change in the way capital gains, or profits on investments, are taxed. Her proposals so far strike a more moderate note than those of her fellow Democrats, but they also have a more realistic chance of becoming law if she is elected president.\u201cThe things she is talking about are very different than what the left is talking about,\u201d said Matt McDonald, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies who has worked on financial issues for the Republican candidates in the last two presidential elections. \u201cThe different ways that the candidates are approaching it are very interesting.\u201dThe array of views emerging from the presidential primaries suggests that the financial industry \u2014 as well as investors and consumers \u2014 could face sharply different futures depending on which party ends up in the White House.The most sweeping proposals have come from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s two challengers for the Democratic nomination. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley kicked off his candidacy in May with a speech that pointed a finger at the \u201cbullies of Wall Street\u201d and followed up with an open letter to the \u201cWall Street megabanks,\u201d which he labeled \u201ctoo big to fail, too big to manage, and too big to jail.\u201dMr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s primary policy proposal would bring back the Glass-Steagall Act, which was introduced as part of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and forced a separation between commercial and Wall Street banks. If that were re-enacted, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, among others, would all have to be essentially cleaved in two.Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist, has made a similar call for the return of Glass-Steagall in his proposals for changing finance, which is at the top of his campaign\u2019s list of issues.Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley are taking advantage of the surge in enthusiasm that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has captured through her own criticism of the biggest banks, which hold an even larger portion of American assets than they did before the financial crisis.While this has largely been an issue for the left, the populist appeal of the position across party lines was underscored when Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, also raised the prospect of separating the banks, along the lines of Glass-Steagall, in a speech he gave in late July as he tried to win more attention for his faltering candidacy.Last month, at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s first major speech on the economy, a heckler in the audience stood up and demanded to know if she, too, would push for a reimposition of the 1933 law. She did not answer the question at the time, but at a later event she said that the problems in the industry could not be solved by a single solution like a new version of Glass-Steagall.This is tricky territory for Hillary Clinton. For one thing, Bill Clinton signed off on the 1999 law that essentially did away with Glass-Steagall \u2014 a change that some have blamed for encouraging the consolidation of the financial industry and ultimately the government bailouts of 2008.Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that the continuing power and influence of the financial industry is a major issue. In her first speech on the economy, she said that \u201c\u00a0\u2018too big to fail\u2019 is still too big a problem.\u201d But perhaps more significantly, Mrs. Clinton hired, as her campaign treasurer, Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive who developed a reputation for cracking down on Wall Street \u2014 and allying himself with Ms. Warren \u2014 during his time as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.Last month, Mr. Gensler sent a fund-raising letter to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters emphasizing her drive to \u201cadvance Wall Street reform,\u201d and prosecute wrongdoing in the financial industry.But it is not clear what specific measures she would pursue on that front. While the Obama administration has been light on prosecution for wrongdoing, it has already put in place regulations that have forced banks to cut back their trading activities and holdings of risky assets. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals recognize the change that has already occurred and do not appear to be intended to cause a big shake-up of the industry.Her most concrete proposal introduced late last month would sharply increase the capital gains tax rate that investors pay on assets held for less than six years. A wealthy speculator who sells a stock after holding it for two years, for instance, would pay a 39.6 percent tax rate on any gains \u2014 the same top rate that is taxed on ordinary income. Currently, the top tax rate on capital gains held for more than a year is 20 percent, about half the rate on ordinary income.Mrs. Clinton, who cultivated close ties with Wall Street when she was a senator from New York, said the policy was part of her broader effort to end the intense focus on short-term profits, which has been pressed on corporate America by big investors. In the same vein, Mrs. Clinton has advocated rules that would encourage companies to share profits with employees as well as investors.William Gale, the co-director of the Tax Policy Center, said the tax change proposed by Mrs. Clinton would narrow a popular tax break and increase the amount of taxes paid by wealthy Americans. But in itself, the plan would not change much behavior on Wall Street.Many of the most powerful investors are pensions and endowments that don\u2019t pay capital gains taxes. For those that do pay taxes, Mr. Gale noted, the big and increasingly important private equity funds rarely engage in short-term trading, generally hold their investments for more than five years and would thus be unaffected by the proposed change.Mrs. Clinton and her Democratic challengers have also argued for policy that would help check extremely short-term investors like high-frequency traders who rely on complex computer programs.Mrs. Clinton, unlike Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley, has not called for a tiny tax on all financial transactions \u2014 a levy commonly used in Europe, including London, that would be likely to limit high-speed trading. But she has left open the door to such a move. In a speech she gave in New York in late July, she said she would be introducing more proposals for \u201creining in excessive risk on Wall Street.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s focus on so-called short-termism is unlikely to alienate most donors from the financial industry. Her policy suggestions pick up on proposals that have recently been made by overhaul-minded executives in the financial industry, including Warren E. Buffett and the chief executive of BlackRock, Laurence D. Fink, who have long bemoaned the fixation on quarterly financial results at the expense of long-term investment and growth.Even Republican executives on Wall Street suggest that given Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals so far, she is unlikely to turn into a foe of the industry. She is also avoiding some of the antagonistic rhetoric \u2014 like references to \u201cfat cat bankers\u201d \u2014 that won President Obama enemies in the industry.\u201cThere\u2019s an overarching sense among the senior people at the banks that she\u2019s not going to be too harsh about us,\u201d said a politically connected Republican executive at a large financial institution, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating other Republicans.But industry analysts are alert for any shift in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tone, particularly given the changing flow of donations from the industry toward Republican candidates over the last six years. So far, Mrs. Clinton has raised slightly less money from the big banks than the Republican Jeb Bush and is more reliant on progressive-minded political action committees.Mr. Bush, a paid adviser to Lehman Brothers and Barclays immediately before the financial crisis, is now seen as the favorite among Wall Street Republicans.He has largely avoided talking about the financial industry, though he has criticized the Dodd-Frank law for allowing the largest banks to get even bigger. The Republicans Marco Rubio and Scott Walker have gone even further, calling for a full repeal of Dodd-Frank.Still, none of the Republican candidates have shown any sign of wanting to ally themselves with Wall Street. Republicans like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Walker have explained their opposition to Dodd-Frank by pointing to the harm they claim it has done to smaller banks. But their position is likely to be popular among big banks as well, who have borne most of the costs of the new law.While many working-class Republicans share a distrust of Wall Street, Mr. McDonald said that pro-business sentiment among most Republican voters would limit attacks on big banks during the primary. The same won\u2019t be true on the Democratic side, however.\u201cThis is the challenge for Hillary,\u201d Mr. McDonald, the Republican adviser, said. \u201cHer challenge and her limitation is her ability to come across on these issues where people want to hear a certain type of anger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trucks Are Killing Us", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorACCIDENTS like the one that critically injured the comedian Tracy Morgan, killed his friend and fellow comedian James McNair, known as Jimmy Mack, and hurt eight others on the New Jersey Turnpike last year are going to continue to happen unless Congress stops coddling the trucking industry.More people will be killed in traffic accidents involving large trucks this year than have died in all of the domestic commercial airline crashes over the past 45 years, if past trends hold true. And still Congress continues to do the trucking industry\u2019s bidding by frustrating the very regulators the government has empowered to oversee motor carriers.In recent months, Congress has pursued a number of steps to roll back safety improvements ordered by federal regulators. It has pushed to allow truck drivers to work 82 hours a week, up from the current 70 hours over eight days, by suspending a rule that drivers take a 34-hour rest break over two nights in order to restart their work week; discouraged the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration from investing in wireless technology designed to improve the monitoring of drivers and their vehicles; and signaled its willingness to allow longer and heavier trucks despite widespread public opposition. Congress also wants to lower the minimum age for drivers of large trucks that are allowed to travel from state to state to 18, from 21.All of these concessions to the trucking industry have gained traction in Congress even though the industry has consistently resisted safety improvements. The death toll in truck-involved crashes rose 17 percent from 2009 to 2013. Fatalities in truck-involved crashes have risen four years in a row, reaching 3,964 in 2013, the latest data available. Those crashes are killing not only car drivers but also, during 2013 alone, 586 people who were truck drivers or passengers.And while a more than 3 percent drop in car deaths over the same period was largely accomplished by technological improvements like airbags, electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes, the trucking industry has resisted most of those safety devices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the annual cost to the economy of truck and bus crashes to be $99 billion.A number of changes that will inevitably make us all less safe are tucked into the pending highway bill, currently stalled because of differences between the House and Senate versions. In fact, Congress has failed to adopt a comprehensive highway funding bill for years, relying instead on dozens of temporary extensions since 2009 to keep any semblance of a federal road construction program moving. In July, the House and Senate passed another temporary patch, good through the end of October.The crash involving Tracy Morgan shows why Congress needs to toughen its oversight of trucking, not loosen it. The driver who caused the crash was in a modern 18-wheeler that was well maintained and managed, owned and operated by Walmart. As detailed in the causation report on the crash released earlier this month, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the driver had been on duty for about 13 and a half hours; federal rules allow a 14-hour workday. About a mile before the crash, the driver ignored work-zone warning signs on the New Jersey Turnpike of likely delays ahead. About a half-mile later, the posted speed limit dropped to 45 m.p.h. from the usual 65, which the driver also ignored.Mr. Morgan\u2019s Mercedes van was moving at less than 10 m.p.h. because of the construction. The truck driver, fatigued and slow to react, according to the N.T.S.B., was unable to stop in time, and slammed into the van, turning it on its side and jamming the passenger door closed. According to the board, if the driver had slowed to 45 when warned to do so, he should have been able to stop before crashing. But before his official work day began, the driver, the board found, had spent 12 hours driving his own vehicle from his home in Georgia to pick up his truck at a Walmart facility in Delaware, and had been awake for 28 consecutive hours at the time of the crash.Large trucks are disproportionately involved in fatal accidents. While heavy trucks accounted for less than 10 percent of total miles traveled in the United States during 2013, according to federal data, the N.T.S.B. recently reported that they were involved in one in eight of all fatal accidents and about one-quarter of all fatal accidents in work zones, like the crash that injured Mr. Morgan.Many accidents involve trucks rear-ending vehicles that have stopped or slowed because of accidents or roadwork. Technology to prevent or lessen the impact of such crashes is available from all of the manufacturers of heavy trucks in North America. Yet only about 3 percent of the Class 8 trucks \u2014 the heaviest ones, including most tractor-trailers \u2014 are equipped with any version of this collision-avoidance technology, according to safety advocates.Most automakers now include or offer anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control, airbags and collision-avoidance devices in their vehicles, and the technology is included in many of the heavy trucks sold in Europe. But the United States trucking industry has largely avoided using the safety technologies available for vehicles sold here, because of their cost.The truck that injured Mr. Morgan was one of the few tractor-trailers that had a collision-detection system. But the N.T.S.B. was unable to prove that the system issued a warning to the driver. The board said it could not fully assess the performance of the device because the unit does not store enough system performance data. (The board has suggested all safety-system makers should ensure that their products store more data in the future.)The trucking industry, through its chief trade group, the American Trucking Associations, insists that it needs longer work weeks and bigger vehicles so that more trucks will not be needed on the road, which it says could result in more accidents. That logic is laughable, but Congress seems to be buying it.The industry also bases its opposition to safety-rule changes on money, saying that increasing costs will hurt profits and raise rates for shippers and, ultimately, consumers.Higher safety standards and shorter work weeks may increase freight costs, but some of those standards should save carriers money in the long run through lower insurance rates and damage claims. And since trucking generates more than $700 billion a year in revenue, according to the trucking association, a small increase in safety costs would not put a large financial strain on carriers.The trucking industry is vital to the nation\u2019s economic well-being \u2014 it carried almost 69 percent of all domestic freight last year \u2014 and its executives have done an excellent job in keeping costs down. But Congress must make it clear to all parties that safety has to be a higher priority than penny-pinching.Congress must pass a comprehensive highway funding bill and ensure that safety regulators have sufficient resources and political support to do what must be done in order to reduce the continuing carnage on our highways.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a recent change to a federal regulation. To restart their workweek week, drivers must take a rest break of 34 hours; Congress suspended a requirement that the 34 hours include two consecutive early morning periods. (There was no rule requiring drivers to take a two-day rest break each week.)Howard Abramson is a freelance writer who was an executive at American Trucking Associations from 1998 to 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine and Top Creditors Agree to Restructure $18 Billion in Foreign Debt", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUkraine and its main creditors agreed on Thursday to restructure $18 billion of the country\u2019s foreign debt, in a rare deal between bond funds and a wobbly, emerging-market government.If the deal is approved by the Parliament of Ukraine, it would write off 20 percent of the nation\u2019s foreign debt, helping to avoid a drawn-out, Greek-style negotiation with large bondholders. The terms would also offer financial relief to Ukraine during a deep recession and an armed conflict with pro-Russia separatists.But it leaves unanswered whether lenders not represented in the negotiating committee \u2014 including, critically, Russia \u2014 would comply with the deal. The committee of creditors backing the proposal represents holders of about half of the debt.Under the proposal, bondholders, including the California-based Franklin Templeton fund, Ukraine\u2019s largest lender, would accept an immediate loss on the principal. The deal would allow Ukraine to delay repayments for four years, though interest rates would rise slightly. The creditors might recoup some losses after 2021 if the country\u2019s economy returns to growth faster than expected.In only three other instances in the last 15 years did creditors agree to reduce principal amounts without a country heading first into default, according to Ukraine\u2019s minister of finance, Natalie A. Jaresko. The previous cases involved Greece, the small Central American nation Belize, and St. Kitts and Nevis, in the Caribbean.\u201cIt\u2019s a benchmark for emerging markets\u201d that might serve as a template for other countries bogged down by debt, Ms. Jaresko said on Thursday in a telephone interview. \u201cIt is every sovereign\u2019s dream.\u201d\u201cI would hope that it shows that you don\u2019t need to rush into a default, even having the willingness to use a moratorium if needed,\u201d she said, adding that a country can end up \u201cworking with creditors\u201d and \u201cnot on opposite sides of the table.\u201dBig bond investors, like Michael Hasenstab at Franklin Templeton, poured money into Ukraine before President Viktor F. Yanukovych was ousted last year. The Yanukovych government had lobbied Franklin Templeton to hold its bonds, sending a first deputy prime minister to the fund\u2019s offices in San Mateo, Calif., even as Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy swiveled away from the West toward Russia and the economy started to skid.After the power change, the cash-poor Ukraine started pushing for debt relief. The government asked for an immediate 40 percent reduction and threatened to default. Officials in Kiev, the capital, had been hinting strongly that the creditors should accept the loss given the glaring signs of corruption in the government of Mr. Yanukovych, who kept a private zoo and golf course at his residence.The Ukrainian officials argued that an initial bailout might not have worked, if bondholders had held out. If that had happened, Ukraine faced being back at the table with creditors again and again \u2014 much like Greece.But big investors initially resisted, arguing instead for extending the repayment period. They figured Ukraine\u2019s economy would recover quickly enough to make the payments by dipping into gold and foreign currency reserves.Eventually, they compromised, agreeing to a 20 percent loss. Franklin Templeton\u2019s bonds, once worth $7 billion, are now worth roughly $4.6 billion. Franklin Templeton declined to comment.Under a concession, the government will pay the creditors bonuses under a value recovery instrument, if Ukraine\u2019s economy bounces back faster than expected.If gross domestic product rises faster than 3 percent after 2021, for example, Ukraine must pay creditors part of the total value of the economic growth. It would be based on a sliding scale from 15 percent to 40 percent, depending on how quickly things pick up.The deal also helps Ukraine meet a requirement of the International Monetary Fund to save $15.3 billion by reducing payments to commercial creditors over four years. Ukraine had to do so as a condition of receiving $34.7 billion in I.M.F. loans and aid from the United States and other Western nations.\u201cLess of the government\u2019s scarce financial resources will be spent servicing high debt levels taken on by previous governments,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Finance said in a statement. \u201cAnd more will be available for critical social spending and national defense.\u201dThe Ukrainian Parliament must vote on the deal and, if it is approved, creditors not represented in the committee would have to decide whether to participate.That could be complicated, given that Russia is a major creditor.Russia is unlikely to be swayed by the Ukrainian government\u2019s arguments to lenders that the agreement would free money for the military to fight the separatists in the east of the country. A protracted legal dispute could ensue.Anton G. Siluanov, the Russian finance minister, said on Thursday that he expected Ukraine to repay its debt to Russia in full.And the deal hardly solves Ukraine\u2019s broader economic problems. Besides its debt, Ukraine is plagued by high inflation. The inflation rate peaked at 60 percent in April and was still at 55 percent in July.The central bank raised an important interest rate significantly in March, in an attempt to curb inflation, which had been made worse by a decline in the value of the currency, the hryvnia.But the situation is showing signs of stabilizing. On Thursday, after the government announced the debt-reduction agreement, it cut the rate by 3 percentage points, to 27 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Killing of Cecil the Lion, Delta Joins Airline Ban on Game Trophies", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateThe recent killing of a popular lion named Cecil by an American dentist in Zimbabwe sparked considerable outrage on social media and elsewhere against safari hunting. The event has also brought to light the role that airlines play in transporting trophy kills as cargo, and may have contributed to changing airline policy.\u201cAirlines and other large travel corporations would be foolish to ignore the public reaction to the killing of Cecil the lion, and growing concern about the plight of endangered species,\u201d Mr. Ferris said.Such a ban was initiated by South African Airways in April, and Emirates, Lufthansa and British Airways later joined. These airlines pledged not to carry big game trophies, including elephants, rhinos, lions and tigers as cargo.\u201cEffective immediately, Delta will officially ban shipment of all lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo trophies worldwide as freight,\u201d according to a statement by Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesman. \u201cPrior to this ban, Delta\u2019s strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species. Delta will also review acceptance policies of other hunting trophies with appropriate government agencies and other organizations supporting legal shipments.\u201dAmericans make up the bulk of non-African hunters. About 15,000 American tourists visit Africa on hunting safaris every year, according to Conservation Force, a nonprofit group that advocates responsible hunting. Currently, 11 African countries issue lion-hunting permits, including Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and Tanzania.Of those, South Africa\u2019s hunting industry is the biggest, estimated to be worth around $675 million, according to the Professional Hunters Association. And just as important, it is woven into the luxury sector of the travel industry, with fees that can reach $55,000 to hunt lions, for example.Many of the ranches in Africa where big game is hunted have their own luxury accommodations. Such is the case with Bushman Safaris, the outfitters used by Walter Palmer, the Minnesota dentist.Many conservationists are concerned that the laws regulating trophy hunting can be ambiguous and often lead to poaching.African lion population numbers vary, but many estimate there were about 100,000 a century ago. Today, there are around 35,000. Lion populations had been stable, but because they dropped noticeably in the last three years, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing the lion as a threatened species.While this would not eliminate trophy hunting, it would regulate it through a permit system for importing sport-hunted trophies into the United States. Opponents to the listing are concerned that the agency\u2019s proposal would hamper conservation funds raised by the fees collected for trophy hunting. A decision is expected by January 2016.But while the pace of federal regulation moves slowly, conservationists said airlines like Delta and other travel corporations are in a much better position to press for change.An article last Sunday about airlines that are outlawing hunting trophies as cargo omitted one American carrier that offers direct flights to Africa. United offers flights from Houston to Lagos, Nigeria; Delta is not the only carrier with direct service.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fragile Burundi Casts a Wary Eye on Rwanda", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the guns fell silent, they have charted very different courses as they try to move beyond their bloody pasts. But trouble in one seems inevitably to spill into the other, and their politics are becoming intertwined again, in dangerous ways.Then on Sunday, a top general close to the president was assassinated, threatening to further inflame a volatile situation.The general, Adolphe Nshimirimana, had an outsize personality. He was feared for his brutal tactics and a linchpin in the president\u2019s control of his security forces. He played a major role in crushing protests in the spring, leaving scores of people dead, and was credited with helping foil the coup. No one has yet claimed responsibility for his death.There is no suggestion that Rwanda had any hand in it. But top Burundian officials say that Rwanda played a part in the failed coup.\u201cWe know that some of the coup leaders now live in Rwanda, at least three of them,\u201d said the foreign minister, Alain Nyamitwe, in an interview on July 22, the day after the presidential election.Mr. Nyamitwe said the disaffected officers, who have called for open rebellion, present a clear threat to Burundi, and he castigated Rwanda for allowing them to find sanctuary there.He was careful to say that there was no evidence of official Rwandan state support for the rebels, but there were many indications, he said, that Rwanda was being \u201cunhelpful.\u201dRwandan officials categorically deny that the coup leaders are in their country and said Burundi\u2019s problems were of the government\u2019s own making. \u201cWhen you have a deep crisis, looking for a scapegoat is normal,\u201d a senior Rwandan official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity about diplomatic matters.Rwanda has concerns about how the crisis next door could embolden another group of rebels who pose a threat to its own government. The remnants of the losing side in its long civil war, a Hutu militia force known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or F.D.L.R., fled to the forests in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. For a while, Burundi cooperated with Rwanda in hunting the rebels, but according to the Rwandan government official, that cooperation stopped suddenly last year.Mr. Nyamitwe denied that Burundi was assisting the group and said there was not \u201ca single F.D.L.R.\u201d soldier in Burundi.Against a backdrop of deepening distrust, the assassination of General Adolphe, as he was widely known, sent tremors throughout the region. President Nkurunziza went on state radio to urge calm, calling on \u201cevery Burundian, in the hills and the capital, to stay united.\u201d And the State Department issued a statement calling \u201con all sides to renounce violence and to redouble their efforts to engage in a transparent, inclusive and comprehensive political dialogue.\u201dIn another ominous turn, the leading human rights lawyer in Burundi, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, was shot by unknown assailants outside his home in Bujumbura on Monday night and was hospitalized in critical condition.The United Nations condemned the attack.Filip Reyntjens, a professor of African law and politics at the University of Antwerp, said that if history was a guide, the current crisis could quickly spread to engulf the region.He said Rwanda and Burundi \u201care really false twins\u201d that \u201chave always had perverse influences on one another.\u201dIn Rwanda, where Tutsi rebels won a clear victory in the civil war, the Tutsi-led government \u201cfollows a policy of what you could call ethnic amnesia,\u201d Mr. Reyntjens said, by essentially making it illegal to talk about ethnicity. But under the surface, he said, some field research suggests that ethnic divisions are worse now than in the 1990s.Rwandan officials call that analysis deeply flawed and say the country has worked hard to encourage citizens to see themselves as Rwandans, not Hutu or Tutsi, and to hold perpetrators from both groups to account for atrocities committed during the war.But in Burundi, there was no clear victory, and peace was achieved only through painstaking negotiations over power-sharing along ethnic lines. Mr. Nkurunziza, who came from the Hutu side of the conflict, often points out that in the decade of his leadership since the peace agreement, there has been no ethnic killing.Scores of interviews in the capital and in the countryside of Burundi suggest that people are aware of the dangers of allowing old ethnic scars to be ripped open. But outside experts worry that those vying for power in Burundi could try to manipulate ethnic divides in dangerous ways.Though many countries condemned Mr. Nkurunziza for evading the two-term limit in the peace agreement, Rwanda has notably not objected on that ground. Instead, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda said Mr. Nkurunziza should not run again because he had failed his people, a remark that angered Burundian officials. Mr. Kagame appears likely to seek a third term of his own, after the Rwandan Parliament recently amended the constitution to allow it.Mr. Kagame, 57, has led Rwanda since 1994, when an offensive by his Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels put an end to a genocide campaign by Hutu extremists. He is widely credited with helping bring peace, stability and what the World Bank has called \u201cimpressive development progress,\u201d visible in the spotless streets of Kigali, the capital, and the construction cranes dotting the skyline.Burundi, on the other hand, remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a fragile economy and a dependence on foreign aid for half the national budget.The experience of Evode Nkeshima, 31, offers a glimpse at the complexities in Burundi. When he was 14 in 1993, the rest of his family was slaughtered in Cibitoke, a part of Burundi where there were clashes last month.\u201cThey were all sleeping when the rebels came in and took my father, three brothers and two sisters,\u201d he said, adding that he survived only because he was sleeping somewhere else that night.His family was Tutsi, and its members were killed by Hutu. But Mr. Nkeshima is now the president of a local branch of the governing party\u2019s youth wing, the Imbonerakure, in Bujumbura.Rwandan officials view the Imbonerakure as a danger and compare it to the youth militia known as the Interahamwe, which carried out some of the worst atrocities in the genocide. Western officials have accused the Burundian government of arming the group and using it to stifle dissent.Mr. Nkeshima said ethnicity had nothing to do with his support for the president.While Rwanda might view Mr. Nkurunziza with suspicion, stemming from his days as the leader of a Hutu militia group \u2014 he was accused and sentenced to death in absentia for murdering Tutsi civilians, and then pardoned under the peace accords \u2014 Mr. Nkeshima said that since then the president had helped the country heal.\u201cWe are all the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all people.\u201dEven so, he said there could still be war. And when he expressed worry about Rwanda\u2019s role, he cast it in ethnic terms.\u201cRwanda is a bad country,\u201d Mr. Nkeshima said. \u201cThe Tutsis in the government there are helping the Tutsis in the Burundi opposition. We cannot allow the opposition to take our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unicorns Hunt for Talent Among Silicon Valley\u2019s Giants", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recruiting is not confined to the best engineers; sometimes it spills over to nontechnical employees too. Two of the chefs who prepared meals for Googlers, Alvin San and Rafael Monfort, have been hired away by Uber and Airbnb in the last 18 months.\u201cIt\u2019s an employee\u2019s market right now,\u201d said Rodrigo Ipince, 28, a software engineer who recently left Google and was pursued by unicorns, but chose to join a mobile gaming video start-up, Kamcord. Mr. Ipince, who worked at Google for five years, said he received at least one to two emails from recruiters daily, asking if he was eager for a new job.\u201cIt was fairly easy to get my foot in the door of whatever company I want,\u201d he added.There are now more than 124 unicorn companies, according to CB Insights, a research firm that tracks start-ups.While the unicorns typically pick off small groups of engineers at a time, making little impression on a large company\u2019s total employee numbers, the poaching attacks are often aimed at siphoning off the best talent in strategic technologies. That can sting the likes of a Google, where executives have said one skilled engineer can be worth many times the average.To snag employees from large rivals, unicorns have a simple recruiting pitch: They are on a path to success, as illustrated by their rising valuations. Many offer generous equity packages of restricted stock units that can later translate to big paydays for employees if the unicorn goes public or is sold \u2014 a lure that neither Google nor any other public tech company can dangle. Also, the unicorns say they are far more fleet-footed and cutting-edge than large organizations.\u201cThe things that excite young tech workers are high growth and fast execution,\u201d said Dave Carvajal, founder of Dave Partners, a tech recruiting company. \u201cIt\u2019s not that tough for the new unicorns to swing by these big, older tech companies and pick up busloads of talent.\u201d\u201cThese people think quite a bit about what our future growth potential is, what kind of impact we will have on the world, and, yes, what that would mean in terms of their equity,\u201d Mr. Curtis said in an interview.The company said that it was having to spend more to hire sales representatives, and that recruiting was not happening as fast as Yelp would like because of the competitive environment.\u201cWe will do what we can to hold the dam on that whole thing and ride it out,\u201d Mr. Donaker added.Representatives of Twitter and Yelp said their total employee numbers had risen on an annual basis.\u201cThis competition for talent has a better chance at being solved if tech companies work together to increase the talent pool,\u201d said Shannon Eis, a spokeswoman at Yelp. \u201cWe have to encourage students to train for careers in the fields that are growing our industry and our economy.\u201dAmong the most aggressive unicorn recruiters is Uber, the ride-hailing company based in San Francisco, which has expanded operations to 59 countries. Uber promises a fast-paced work environment and \u201cworld changing\u201d ambitions, according to multiple people who have been approached by the company or work for it. Uber has more than 3,500 employees, up from roughly 1,300 a year ago, not counting its so-called driver partners, who are contract workers.Uber does not shy away from dangling generous compensation packages to important hires, especially in engineering. In the case of some highly sought-after engineers from Yelp last year, Uber offered millions of dollars in restricted stock units, according to two people with knowledge of the recruiting practices, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. McClendon declined to comment, as did an Uber spokeswoman. Google declined to comment for this article.Google is not letting its employees go without a fight. Offers from a short list of companies \u2014 including Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Palantir \u2014 will often produce counteroffers, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.The most senior Google employees may get a one-on-one meeting with Larry Page, a Google co-founder, to try to persuade the executive to stay, according to one of these people. Google is often willing to go \u201cover the top\u201d to keep top talent, the two people said.In addition, a nimble recruiter from a much-talked-out start-up can still move faster than even the most competitive companies like Google. And sometimes, moving fast enough is all it takes.\u201cIn one case, I replied to a recruiter on Thursday. I was interviewing on-site by Saturday, and I had an offer by Monday,\u201d said Mr. Ipince, the software engineer.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s how I earn my living.\u201dThis ancient desert city has been a principal departure point for Africans desperate to leave the continent for years. More than half of all West African migrants who reach Lampedusa, Italy, pass through here \u2014 up to 80,000 last year \u2014 and the International Organization for Migration expects that number to double this year.Recent arrests, roundups and repatriations under the government\u2019s tough new anti-trafficking law have done little to end the lucrative migrant trade in Agadez, whose permanent population is around 90,000.But a \u201cconnections man\u201d \u2014 the English words are used in this former French colonial outpost \u2014 can earn $50 or more per migrant, so an entire economy has revolved around them. Behind dozens of iron gates here, in what locals call ghettos, the migrants are hiding, in groups of 20 to 30, waiting for the next convoy of pickup trucks across the desert.\u201cMany are eating off these migrants,\u201d said a deputy mayor, Ahmed Koussa, \u201cthe drivers, the fixers, the landlords.\u201dAnother deputy mayor, Aboubacar Ajoual, said that without even firmer action, \u201cthe Ivorians and Gambians will invade Europe.\u201dStreets in Agadez bustle with rare vigor for a provincial town in Niger, one of the world\u2019s poorest nations.

For them, it\u2019s a business.\u201dFurtively, groups of two or three migrants enter banks on the dusty main street for Western Union transfers, under the noses of law enforcement officers who often do not question them, despite the new law.\u201cThe police are eating, too,\u201d Mr. Koussa said. Payoffs to corrupt officials, as he gingerly acknowledged, along with the migrants\u2019 fierce determination to reach Europe, continue to drive the trade.\u201cHere in Africa, my friend, there is no work,\u201d said Mamadu Aliu, an unemployed truck driver from Guinea-Bissau. \u201cWe\u2019ll work like dogs if you let us come.\u201dEven those at risk of arrest say the money that trafficking generates is more powerful than any crackdown on connections men.\u201cIt\u2019s not the real ones who get arrested; the real ones are in complicity with the authorities,\u201d grumbled a smuggler wearing an orange turban revealing only his eyes, who refused to give his name.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.A connections man from Senegal named Mamadou, dressed in a shiny blue tracksuit that looked brand new, unlike much of the clothing worn here, and sporting a Bluetooth headset, looked around nervously and said he did not want any trouble from the authorities. His uncle had been arrested twice already, and he insisted he had left the business behind. But he was ready to point out the locations of many up-and-running \u201cghettos\u201d in town.\u201cMany, many. You can\u2019t even count them,\u201d Mamadou said. Indignantly, he exclaimed: \u201cThis new law is saying what, exactly? It\u2019s making us criminals?\u201dThe connections men here were edgy for good reason, and not just because they faced arrest. Each link in the chain leading to Europe had to be tightly organized, they explained, because any mistake \u2014 a truck breakdown in the desert, for instance \u2014 could mean death for their charges.\u201cIt\u2019s all about having the good drivers, the Toubous\u201d \u2014 a local ethnic group reputed for its toughness \u2014 \u201cguys I\u2019ve got confidence in,\u201d said Mahamadou, the connections man in the polo shirt. \u201cI turn them over to those guys.

He said he had tried to migrate to Europe twice himself, only to fail. \u201cAll I do is, I facilitate the voyage, so that they can cross the desert in confidence.\u201dA particular frame of mind is required for the risky passage.\u201cIt is not just about courage; it\u2019s loss of hope,\u201d Mahamadou said of the circumstances driving migrants to leave their homes, families and countries to undertake the perilous journey to uncertain futures in Europe, if they make it that far.\u201cWhen you lose hope, it\u2019s better to try anything,\u201d he said, describing himself as \u201cthe living dead\u201d and saying that his work was \u201cnot a proper job.\u201dAt a so-called ghetto at the edge of town, the faces were anxious and weary.

{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Tumble 6.2% Amid Government Intervention Efforts", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Mainland Chinese stock markets unexpectedly slumped again on Tuesday, with the Shanghai market plunging by 6.2 percent.Following a yearlong boom, stocks have been volatile of late, prompting aggressive action by the government to help stabilize the market. There was no obvious catalyst for the drop in stocks on Tuesday.The sudden drop on Tuesday came just one week after China sent a jolt through global financial markets with a surprise devaluation of its currency, the renminbi, in an attempt to reinvigorate the country\u2019s exports. The state intervention in mainland stocks and currency markets has raised concerns that China\u2019s economy could be in worse shape than official data suggests.Trading volumes in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been relatively light since early July, when the government introduced several remarkable measures in an attempt to support plunging share prices. Those included ordering government agencies to buy stocks with funding from state banks and preventing shareholders who own more than 5 percent of a company\u2019s stock from selling.The Shanghai index closed Tuesday at 3,748.16 points \u2014 7 percent above the low it reached on July 8, before the state\u2019s market rescue efforts began to kick in. The market is down more than a quarter from its peak in mid-June.Xinhua, the Chinese state-owned news agency, wrote on Twitter that investors were \u201cin stampede again!\u201d The agency noted that shares in about 1,000 companies fell by the 10 percent daily limit, and the post was accompanied by an illustration of a giant hand dangling the grim reaper over a group of people heading for an exit.The stock market sell-off came as new signs showed that volatility was creeping back into China\u2019s currency markets.

{"Headline": "Luxury Shoppers in London Seem Unfazed by Market Free Fall", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLondon \u2014 Twenty-four hours after the world\u2019s financial markets sustained a temporary free fall, wiping out almost $3 trillion in value from global stocks over three days, the dark clouds had yet to dampen the spirits of luxury shoppers on the streets of London.On a typical wet and windy British midsummer day on Bond Street, home to some of the most expensive retail square footage in the world, groups of Chinese tourists armed with Nike sneakers, Burberry umbrellas and Gucci bowling bags braved the downpours.Few appeared spooked by the dramatic market activity of recent months.\u201cWe have been looking forward to this trip for so long, we would never have changed our plans because of what the headlines in the newspapers say,\u201d said one visitor from Beijing laden with bags from Tod\u2019s, Tory Burch and Smythson, who declined to give her name.Down the road in another store, an immaculately dressed Mandarin-speaking sales assistant quietly agreed that the global market seemed to be far from shoppers\u2019 top concern.\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of American families over for the summer holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from the Middle East, too. The demand from Asia is still there, as far as I can see, maybe slightly slower this season but stronger than ever from other markets. Things didn\u2019t slow down in the wake of 2008,\u201d he added, before leaping to attention to assist a hijab-clad mother and daughter wearing matching Fendi sunglasses.On the other side of Hyde Park Corner in Knightsbridge, the gilded halls of Harrods, one of Britain\u2019s most opulent department stores, continued to surge with shoppers. From the crowds snaking up the exotic escalators, weighed down by new purchases, to the throngs gathered in the cool and cloistered accessories rooms, visitors remained plentiful.\u201cI come every summer with my family from Kuwait from May to October and have done so for years,\u201d said Faisal Said, 36, who was sporting a Panerai watch and Supreme baseball cap while walking briskly through the food court. \u201cWe base ourselves here in London but travel around the continent also.\u201dMr. Said, who has a portfolio of investments, said he had seen mobile alerts about the domino effect of the felling of global markets in recent days, but noted that what goes down also comes up, and that consumer shopping habits don\u2019t always sync with the peaks and troughs of equities in foreign countries.\u201cWhen the oil price fell, that was a disaster for many people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not lots of shoppers in America. Didn\u2019t they spend less on gas for their cars but more in their stores? To me, these things don\u2019t always have immediate or obvious effects.\u201dHe\u2019s not the only one to think so.Most industry observers suggest that, while worrisome, currency devaluations and recent market declines will not be enough to offset the long-term compounding of global economic growth and consumers\u2019 appetite for luxury goods.In the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, the financial sector boomed. And while the slump in Hong Kong spending has exacted a level of damage for some brands over the last 12 months, the malls of mainland China have never been engines of growth, given the hefty import taxes and the savings to shoppers going abroad \u2014 to South Korea, Singapore or even Europe.\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d said Michael Ward, the managing director for Harrods. \u201cThe bulk of luxury consumption by value is made by high-net-worth individuals who can afford to lose some money on the stock market without changing their lifestyles too much or thinking twice about purchases.\u201dHe said a slowdown by Chinese shoppers to Britain over the last year had more to do with international travel hassles than the shuddering Chinese economy. \u201cThe Chinese have been spending less here because of the difficulty of applying for a U.K. tourist visa,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cMany just head over to Paris, instead, to make their purchases.\u201dThere will have to be quite a balancing act in the coming months given the macro uncertainty on the horizon, said Luca Solca, an analyst at the investment firm Exane BNP Paribas. \u201cThis business is based on alchemy, not science,\u201d Mr. Solca said. \u201cThings could be better, but they could also be far, far worse.Advertisement"}

In July, there were 60 against and five abstentions \u2014 one of the biggest blows to Ms. Merkel during her nearly 10 years in office.But the measure ultimately passed by a substantial margin, 453 to 113. Leading the way was Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, who at 72 is Parliament\u2019s longest-serving deputy and has held virtually every top post in Germany, save that of chancellor.\u201cA big chunk of the German public believes he has their concerns in mind, that when he conducts negotiations he works for Germany, so that it is not cheated on,\u201d said Harald Schoen, a professor of politics at Mannheim University.Ms. Merkel, who is nothing if not pragmatic, likely had all this in mind when she ceded the parliamentary leadership role to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble on Wednesday.In any case, the 25-year-old dance between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble remains a complex political relationship, and interpreting it is one of Berlin\u2019s most popular parlor games. While some senior officials speak of a deep rift, another official familiar with both politicians insisted: \u201cThere is a deal. She gives him space, freedom to act. And he is loyal.\u201d But few people truly know.Both politicians were prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. After Mr. Kohl lost power in 1998 and then, tarnished by a party finance scandal, stepped down as leader of his Christian Democrats, it was Ms. Merkel who bested Mr. Sch\u00e4uble in the ensuing power struggle.\u201cHis relationship with Ms. Merkel is not completely unburdened by the past, but overall, he enjoys a great deal of respect, and that is why working with Mr. Sch\u00e4uble helps her,\u201d said Uwe Jun, a professor in politics at the University of Trier.The finance minister, a lawyer, is a man of such strong will that he was back at work months after an assassination attempt in 1990 left him unable to walk and having to use a wheelchair.Germans see in him a disciplined, smart negotiator; polling shows that 40 percent to 50 percent of avowed supporters of the far-left Left party admire Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, said Michael Kunert, of Infratest/dimap, one of Germany\u2019s foremost pollsters. \u201cThis is really crazy,\u201d he said.\u201cHe is the uncomfortable figure who speaks the difficult truth, and thus makes the overall result better,\u201d said Detlef Seif, one of the conservative lawmakers who nonetheless voted against the Greek deal on Wednesday.That image starkly contrasts with one held in southern Europe and beyond, where he has been lampooned as the ugly German \u2014 daubed with a swastika on the cover of Greek magazines.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble, who in public has shrugged off the cartoons, is in fact probably the most pro-European figure in Germany\u2019s government. He belongs to a generation that remembers how the United States and Europe helped Germany to recover after 1945, to accumulate wealth and \u2014 through the European Union \u2014 play a prominent role in the Continent\u2019s affairs. He hails from the very southwest of Germany, near the border with France.\u201cThe French ministers, the government,\u201d said Barbara Kunz, a research fellow on French-German relations at the French Institute for International Relations, \u201cknow he is a Francophile and is fluent in French. He embodies the French-German couple almost naturally, or at least more naturally than Merkel, who has less ties with France.\u201d She added: \u201cSch\u00e4uble embodies this old, western Germany, Bonn\u2019s Germany.\u201dDespite their different backgrounds, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and Ms. Merkel, 61, who grew up in the Communist East, work closely together.Before Wednesday\u2019s vote, the two made no public appearances together. But first Ms. Merkel and then Mr. Sch\u00e4uble granted 20-minute interviews to German television, each following Ms. Merkel\u2019s maxim from July \u2014 to \u201clook ahead.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Elian Peltier from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Officials Say a September Rate Increase Is Still on the Table", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 The Federal Reserve will give serious consideration to raising its benchmark interest rate in mid-September, particularly if volatility subsides in financial markets, a number of Fed officials said Friday.The comments, uncoordinated but generally consistent, suggested that some investors and analysts had been too quick to discount a September rate increase, particularly as global markets finished the week on a relatively quiet note on Friday.\u201cWe haven\u2019t made a decision yet, and I don\u2019t think we should,\u201d Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman and a close adviser to the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said in an interview with the cable network CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time to wait and see the incoming data and see what exactly is going on now in the economy.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s policy-making committee is scheduled to meet Sept. 16 and 17.Mr. Fischer offered an upbeat assessment of the domestic economy. He described job growth as \u201cimpressive\u201d and said there had been a \u201cpretty strong case\u201d to raise rates in September before the latest round of global turmoil. He did not sound inclined to wait much longer than September to start raising rates.\u201cWe\u2019re getting back to normal and at some point we will want to show that, by beginning to normalize interest rates,\u201d he said, speaking during a break at the annual conference hosted here by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a centrist on the Federal Open Market Committee, told Bloomberg that he saw roughly even odds of a September rate increase. But if the Fed did choose to wait, he said it wouldn\u2019t be for long \u2014 he suggested that it could raise rates at its next meeting in October.James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in an interview that he was reserving final judgment, but that he did not see strong reasons for the Fed to delay. \u201cI would like to see the whole panoply of data before I make a decision but I\u2019m certainly leaning in that direction,\u201d Mr. Bullard said.The march toward higher rates has inflamed some critics who argue that the central bank should continue or even expand its stimulus campaign.Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and Nobel laureate, said Thursday that the Fed was on the verge of repeating an old mistake by raising interest rates sooner than necessary to control inflation. He pointed out that the share of Americans with jobs remained unusually small and wages were rising only slowly.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a recovery for the majority of Americans and so to me this is a no-brainer,\u201d Mr. Stiglitz told a coalition of community groups who call themselves \u201cFed Up\u201d that met just outside the main conference to advocate against a rate increase. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re talking about\u201d tightening monetary policy, he said.Mr. Stiglitz said the Fed should try to keep inflation at about 4 percent a year. Even with a stated target of 2 percent a year, he said, actual inflation is significantly lower. \u201cWe wind up with a monetary policy that has been consistently too tight,\u201d he said.Most Fed officials say they expect inflation to increase as the economy expands. Mr. Fischer said on Friday that his confidence was \u201cpretty high\u201d that inflation would rebound.Still, Mr. Fischer said there was a continuing \u201cdiscussion\u201d among Fed officials, some of whom see the strength of domestic growth as a reason to raise rates, while others argue the sluggishness of inflation means there is no reason to rush.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Mr. Bullard, a member of the first camp, said that he viewed recent global economic developments as unlikely to change his economic forecast. The sharp fall of oil prices and the decline of long-term interest rates should increase growth, while a stronger dollar and a weaker global economy are likely to have an offsetting impact.Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, reiterated his contrasting view that the Fed should not raise interest rates this year. Instead, he argued, the central bank should consider expanding its stimulus campaign to address the persistence of low inflation, which can harm consumer spending and business plans for expansion. Mr. Kocherlakota said the volatility of financial markets should be seen as further evidence of the weakness of the economy.Both camps, however, agree that the Fed should not start raising rates in the middle of market volatility. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said this week that the gyrations of financial markets made the case for raising rates in September \u201cless compelling.\u201dMr. Fischer in his interview Friday said he did not want to judge the current situation, because it was new. But if volatility persisted, the Fed would be less likely to move.\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand the market volatility, and I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t fully understand it now \u2014 there are many, many analyses of what\u2019s going on \u2014 then yes, it does affect the timing of a decision you might want to make,\u201d he said.Both Mr. Dudley and Mr. Fischer, however, noted that the current situation might be fleeting. Mr. Fischer said markets \u201ccould settle down fairly quickly.\u201dAnd Mr. Fischer emphasized that Fed officials could not afford to wait until all of their questions were answered and all of their doubts resolved. \u201cWhen the case is overwhelming,\u201d he said, \u201cif you wait that long, then you\u2019ve waited too long.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A.: Calais Has Become Flashpoint in Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhere exactly is the migrant camp?The camp, nicknamed the \u201cjungle\u201d by residents, is next to a highway bridge about two and a half miles northwest of the center of Calais, in northern France. It is about nine miles from the perimeter of the Channel Tunnel that connects France with Britain. Migrants from the camp often walk that far twice a day in their attempts to cross the Channel.How many migrants are in Calais?Estimates differ widely. From 3,000 to 5,000 migrants are currently housed in the camp. That is a fraction of the number of immigrants and asylum seekers arriving in Britain, where last year net migration reached 318,000. It is also small compared with the number of migrants that other, poorer countries have absorbed.Where do the migrants come from?How do migrants get to Calais?Most migrants have stories that involve many months of perilous travel across hazardous seas and encounters with human traffickers. Those coming from East Africa often come via Sudan and Libya to Italy before making their way across Europe on foot and by train. Those coming from Afghanistan and the Middle East often travel through Turkey. They cross the Mediterranean by boat to Greece and then travel across the Balkans and Eastern Europe.What happens to migrants who get through?Some migrants who make it to Britain try to remain undetected and find work in the informal economy. It can be easier if they have friends or family already in Britain, which, unlike France, has no national identity cards.Those who get picked up by the border police face a criminal investigation for \u201cclandestine entry\u201d and could be deported. If they fear persecution in their own country, migrants can apply for asylum. While their application is processed, they are either held in a detention center or granted temporary release and can legally remain in Britain.Why are they trying to go to Britain?Some migrants in Calais want to stay in France. They have applied for asylum and have started learning French at a new school set up by a Nigerian migrant in the camp. But many want to make it to Britain \u2014 some because they speak some English and already have some family there, others because they believe job prospects are better on the other side of the Channel. A few mentioned the strong British pound, relative to the euro.Is there a solution?But so far European governments have taken a short-term view, offering piecemeal measures and pointing fingers. France wants Britain to issue identity cards. Britain wants France to better police its border. Both have called on other European countries for help.Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has promised more sniffer dogs and money for high-tech security fences around the Channel Tunnel entrance. The bishop of Dover has been among the voices demanding more generosity toward the migrants. But there is little appetite among British voters to take them in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tale of an Anxious Economic Recovery, Told by a Revived Textile Mill", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe mill went dark for 18 months in 2009 and 2010, and liquidators tagged its looms for shipment overseas. All its workers were laid off.Faribault has staged a remarkable comeback, though, as consumer demand has increased for its blankets and throws. The company has won new customers like Bloomingdale\u2019s and Restoration Hardware, said Bruce Bildsten, Faribault\u2019s chief marketing officer.While virtually all the laid-off workers have been brought back and 30 new positions have been filled this year, employees still sometimes find it difficult to shake off the trauma. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t keep us awake at night, but we all think about it,\u201d said Mr. Bildsten, who joined the company during its recovery. \u201cWe\u2019re growing slowly and steadily. But we\u2019re prepared for the inevitable downturn.\u201dThe company\u2019s trajectory parallels the course of the overall American recovery in the last six years. Growth has resumed and hiring has picked up, but a lingering unease remains, with workers in particular wondering how long the good times will last, and whether this is as good as it gets.By some measures, the economy is doing just fine.Unemployment stands at 5.3 percent, the lowest since the dark days of 2008. Economists are expecting another healthy report on Friday, when the Labor Department announces the latest data on hiring in July.Last week, the government estimated that the economy grew by 2.3 percent in the second quarter. In late August that figure is likely to be revised higher in light of new data showing healthy factory orders and construction spending in June.The numbers tell only part of the story, however. Wages for most workers have barely kept up with inflation, even though inflation has been very low since the recession, and even many experienced employees outside specialized fields have little bargaining power when it comes to securing raises.\u201cTotal employment and consumption is rising but that\u2019s different from everybody\u2019s average income rising,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.\u201cMore people are finding jobs, but nobody feels optimistic about their income prospects,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s likely why it doesn\u2019t feel like the economy has really recovered even though the statistics say it has.\u201dAnother big cloud has been the economy\u2019s consistent inability to grow by more than 2.5 percent annually. That is a far cry from the 4.5 percent growth rate of the late 1990s, or the 3.5 percent annual gains recorded a decade ago.Even otherwise optimistic economists do not expect the American economy to see a sudden pickup in momentum.Onetime bright spots like Brazil, Russia and China have also experienced slowing growth.The absence of overseas stimulus means the United States is largely on its own in terms of finding ways to increase overall economic output, Mr. Gapen said.Domestic consumer consumption has been growing at about a 3 percent annual rate. But that has been dragged down by sharp cuts in spending by energy companies as oil prices have fallen, along with lackluster exports.\u201cYou\u2019d need domestic consumption to be at 3.5 percent or 4 percent to get us over 3 percent, given the international backdrop,\u201d Mr. Gapen said.Patterns of economic growth and retrenchment are notoriously hard to predict. Few economists foresaw the tech-led boom of the late 1990s or that the unemployment rate would fall below 4 percent by 2000. Similarly, even the most astute seers on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve failed to anticipate just how great the damage from the bursting of the housing bubble a few year later would be, or the depth of the recession that followed.Some academic experts have suggested that for all the promise of the Internet and digital technology today, the current economic shift will not yield the kind of growth or job gains brought about by earlier industrial transformations.What is more, most mainstream economists concede that the bulk of the gains from the current expansion are going to wealthier Americans, especially those with large holdings of assets like stocks and real estate, rather than those simply earning salaries.\u201cFairly large chunks of the population have a job, but it\u2019s not a great job, or their income has barely grown,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said. A recent analysis by IHS shows that consumer confidence since 2010 has been closely correlated with income. Households earning more than $100,000 feel very optimistic, while those earning $24,000 to $34,000 remain much more cautious.In Faribault, Minn., about 50 miles south of the Twin Cities, employees did not expect the roller coaster ride that awaited them when the family that had controlled the Faribault Woolen Mill for five generations sold it to an investment group in 1998.An expansion binge followed, with the new owners buying mills in other parts of the country, only to see demand plunge and credit dry up in the recession. The Faribault mill closed and century-old looms and other equipment were being boxed up to be sent to Pakistan, a growing destination for textile manufacturers, Mr. Bildsten recalled.\u201cYou have to be aware that there are ups and downs,\u201d said Dennis Melchert, 60, who has worked at the mill for more than 40 years and is now vice president for product development and research. \u201cThe worst part of what we went through was when the company was unable to pay its bills. Everything in textiles is based on trust.\u201d\u201cThe overall economy is picking up,\u201d Mr. Melchert added. \u201cBut we\u2019re more grounded in our decision making, and we\u2019re not growing whole-hog. The biggest challenge is that you should grow slowly and not go kaboom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Do the Amazon\u2019s Last Isolated Tribes Have a Future?", "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionHIS name is Shuri, but everyone calls him Epa, which means father in the indigenous Pano language family. His wizened face and bare, gnomish feet are familiar to the villagers who live along the Curanja River, which flows through some of the densest rain forest of Peru\u2019s vast Amazon region.Most of Epa\u2019s tribe remains deep in the jungle, unclothed, hunting with bows and arrows, picking medicinal plants to ward off illness, and avoiding outsiders. But such isolated peoples can no longer depend on the forest as a refuge. In the past year, throughout the Amazon, they have begun to emerge in settled areas in unpredictable, disturbing and occasionally violent ways, often because of hunger or desperation.Last October, the villagers traveled in wooden canoes to vote in local elections. When they returned, one hut had burned to the ground and many of the machetes, clothes, pots and pans, mosquito nets, hammocks and drying fruits and nuts in villages along the river were gone. Epa, who had stayed behind, admitted that he had set fire to the hut, saying it was an accident, but denied any other involvement. Villagers blame his tribe for the raid.Villagers have spotted the people they call \u201cthe nakeds\u201d stealing fruit from orchards. Even the clothes on scarecrows go missing. Some villagers suspect that the mild-mannered Epa is a spy, feeding intelligence to his tribe.In other parts of the rain forest, violence by and against once-isolated people is suddenly on the rise. In May, just outside the Man\u00fa National Park south of the Curanja, a man from the isolated Mashco Piro tribe shot an arrow that killed a 20-year-old indigenous villager. Last year, several members of Peru\u2019s isolated Xinane group waded across a river to seek help at a Brazilian settlement. A few of their relatives, they said, had died when they were attacked, possibly by drug traffickers.There are other groups living beyond the reach of the global economy, in places like the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean and the mountains of New Guinea. But the planet\u2019s largest and most diverse isolated cultures are centered in the Amazon, primarily in western Brazil and eastern Peru. They lack immunity from many Western diseases, modern weapons to defend themselves from armed intruders like drug smugglers and illegal loggers, and a voice in national politics.They have good reason to stay hidden. European and African diseases killed tens of millions of Native Americans after Columbus landed. A century ago, thousands were coerced into working for the rubber barons. Even seemingly benevolent outsiders proved angels of death. In the 1950s, a visiting German ethnographer left behind a pathogen that killed some 200 people.Anthropologists and nongovernmental organizations warn that drug trafficking, logging, mining and petroleum extraction, along with a changing climate, vanishing species and a shrinking forest, put these tribes at risk. Even TV crews searching for \u201cuncontacted\u201d natives pose a threat; according to a 2008 report by a Peruvian anthropologist, one crew that strayed beyond its permitted area has been implicated in the deaths of some 20 native people from flu.The indigenous people who remain appear to be fighting among themselves for dwindling resources, like turtle eggs and piglike peccaries. Lifting his shirt, Epa showed me a scar on his torso \u2014 inflicted during an attack by tribal enemies, he said. He and his two wives and a mother-in-law live part time in their camp, close to a guard post staffed by indigenous people. He said he had avoided having children because he was always on the run.Brazil and Peru have taken radically different approaches toward isolated peoples. For Brazil, which has pursued the sort of engagement pioneered by late 19th-century missionaries, the Amazon has long been a frontier to be tamed. Officials built small frontier posts in the jungle, planted gardens and let tribes gather the harvest. Enticed into contact, the isolated people would trade ornaments and forest products for metal tools and objects, and be drawn gradually into the labor force.Recently, however, Brazil has slashed funding for Funai. Angry Brazilian anthropologists, indigenous groups and sertanistas cite the Amazonian land rush as the reason. Once land is protected, it cannot be sold to private or public developers. Under President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s leadership, approval of applications to set aside land for indigenous peoples \u2014 both isolated and not \u2014 has virtually ceased.Peru, by contrast, has only recently admitted that its isolated peoples even exist. It traditionally looks to the Pacific rather than its rain forest hinterland. Nine out of 10 Peruvians live in the Andes or along the coastal plain, but most of the country\u2019s land is within the Amazon basin. As recently as 2007, Alan Garc\u00eda, then the president, dismissed \u201cthe figure of the uncontacted native jungle dweller\u201d as a fiction created by zealous environmentalists.Since then, as evidence of their existence has become impossible to dispute, the government has moved to set up five reserves, covering an area larger than Massachusetts, as safety zones for the tribes, with more planned. But even if a reserve is created and adequately policed, petroleum companies can explore for and extract oil if it is considered in the national interest. \u201cThe region has seen massive death of isolated peoples due to contact with oil prospectors,\u201d said the Peruvian anthropologist Beatriz Huertas.Both nations see the Amazon as a treasure house of oil, timber and gold. Two continentwide projects crossing Brazil and Peru \u2014 the $2.8 billion, 1,600-mile Interoceanic Highway and the Chinese-sponsored $10 billion, 3,300-mile Twin Ocean Railroad \u2014 will no doubt stimulate both economies, but at a steep cost. The railroad, which China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, lobbied for during a May visit to South America, would plow through tropical savanna and thick forest, cutting across Peru\u2019s remote Madre de Dios region, home to hundreds of indigenous communities.Development can\u2019t be halted, but it can be carried out more intelligently and humanely than what happened in the 19th century in the United States. We know what works. Small frontier posts on rivers can protect reserves from intruders. Immunized health care workers can provide emergency care and snuff out potential epidemics among isolated peoples who emerge for help. Illegal loggers and miners can be prosecuted. Road and railroad construction and oil prospecting can respect the borders of reserves and parks. None require a huge financial investment. They do require an inclusive political approach and an awareness of history.Last month the Peruvian government announced that it would help a small group of Mashco Piro that has appeared more than 100 times in the past year on the banks of the Madre de Dios River, the same group responsible for the May death of a villager. Tribe members accepting food and clothing from tourists and missionaries are at serious risk of disease and death, and villagers fear more violence. Advocates of isolated peoples are watching closely to see if Peru can ensure the long-term health of the Mashco Piro while protecting their land from outsiders.Half a millennium after Columbus arrived, we have an opportunity \u2014 really one last chance \u2014 to avoid repeating the catastrophes endured by so many native peoples in the Americas. This is no longer the 19th century: We have more than enough information. We understand pathogens and can immunize those who might contact isolated peoples. We can acknowledge that some people don\u2019t want to join the global economy. And we can protect them until they are ready to enter the modern mainstream, while extracting the resources that we need. We don\u2019t have to commit another genocide.Andrew Lawler is a contributing correspondent for Science Magazine and the author of \u201cWhy Did the Chicken Cross the World: The Epic Saga of the Bird That Powers Civilization.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Puerto Rico has been one of the company\u2019s top five selling destinations for several years and continues to remain so, said Mr. Marmontello. In July, about 1,200 people booked trips to the island through the site, the same as this time last year. Most of the reservations are for travel from now until the end of this year, and in line with 2014, the average cost per person for a four-night package inclusive of airfare and hotels is between $550 and $600 a person. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the economy is having zero effect on our clients traveling there,\u201d he said.\u201cPuerto Rico is still on the radar,\u201d said Margie Hand, a travel adviser for Andavo Travel in Birmingham, Ala., who specializes in luxury Caribbean trips.

Her top request is Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, where room rates start at $1,500 a night during the peak season. Also, her Puerto Rico trips with airfare and accommodations still run about $5,000 for a family of four going on a five-night getaway.Still, It\u2019s Too Soon to Tell.Adam Weissenberg, the head of travel, hospitality and leisure at Deloitte & Touche, said the financial crisis in Puerto Rico might have an impact, but it is too early to say whether tourism to Puerto Rico will dip. Countries with financial woes, such as Greece or Russia, have witnessed a decline in vacationers, he said. While hotels will likely start offering attractive deals to keep travelers interested in the destination, the long-term concern is whether the island\u2019s infrastructure will stay intact. And if tourism does drop, it may not necessarily bounce back. While Greece has somewhat rebounded, Russia and Venezuela continue to struggle.Advertisement"}

Two of 14 chapters are devoted to Malthus; one covers family planning and the demographic transition, and fully half of the 408-page book focuses on both practical and radical solutions to the most daunting challenge we have ever faced. These include a \u201cpink revolution\u201d for women that begins with free universal education through high school for girls, and free family planning services, equal land rights and access to farm credit for all women. I also call for immediate curbs on deforestation and grain-based biofuels, the transition to a low-carbon economy and the wholesale transformation of world agriculture from the source of a third of global carbon emissions to a carbon-sequestering sink covering nearly 40 percent of the planet. Though these may not be the solutions Patel endorses, there is nothing easy, moderate or \u201cGoldilocks\u201d about any of them.JOEL K.

Transit Train Riders May Become \u2018Norm,\u2019 Amtrak Official Warns", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmtrak\u2019s proposed Gateway project would ease that and allow for the projected doubling in the number of cross-Hudson train commuters over the next 25 years, by creating a new tunnel for trains, expanding New York\u2019s Pennsylvania Station and repairing other infrastructure now prone to breakdown. Ideally, he said, the railroad would build the Gateway tunnel by 2025, then shut down the existing tunnels for repairs to be completed by 2030. But that presumes that funding for Gateway comes soon \u2014 and that the existing tunnels hold up, despite age and damage caused by flooding from Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Amtrak has committed $300 million to the project, which is estimated to cost about $14 billion, but Mr. Gardner said it could do no more without help from the federal government and New York and New Jersey.\u201cWhen you have assets of this age, under this level of service and stress it\u2019s not feasible really to imagine that you\u2019re going to get perfect performance,\u201d Mr. Gardner said. Given the damage caused by time and the storm, and the constant travel of trains making it hard to find more than a couple of hours here and there to do repairs, he said, \u201cit\u2019s quite possible these delays will become the norm.\u201dMr. Gardner showed legislators a piece of paper-insulated copper feeder line from the 1930s, which was among the elements that failed and caused the delays in July. It looked like charred wood, something better suited to roasting marshmallows than assisting the movement of 450 trains and 200,000 daily commuters along one of the nation\u2019s busiest corridors.Legislators at the hearing here were rapt as he explained the domino effect of failures that led to the week of delays in July, when it took many commuters three hours to travel just 15 miles. They agreed on the urgency of the Gateway project, calling it a competitive factor for the regional economy. \u201cAt some point, people will simply move and employers will seek locations where passenger transportation is less arduous,\u201d said Senator Robert Gordon, a Democrat from northern New Jersey and the chairman of the Senate legislative oversight committee.But it was unclear what the legislature could do, given resistance from the governors. Mr. Gardner and New Jersey legislators, Democrat and Republican, argued that the project benefits the entire region, and indeed the national economy, given the number of passengers traveling between Boston and Richmond, Va.Mr. Gardner proposed that the federal government pay 80 percent of the cost of Gateway, with the states and other local entities \u2014 like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \u2014 paying 20 percent. That split was common for aviation projects, he said, and Amtrak carries three times as many passengers between New York and Washington as all the airlines put together.The Obama administration, however, has not committed to that financing. The office of Anthony Foxx, the transportation secretary, said on Monday that he would meet with Mr. Christie and Senator Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, a Democrat, on Aug. 18 and has asked to meet with Mr. Cuomo.Mr. Cuomo said on Monday, \u201cIf they\u2019re serious, I\u2019ll come to the table.\u201d Emma G.

Investors haven\u2019t much challenged its founder\u2019s free rein so far. A weakening business and over $100 billion of lost market capitalization since the shares hit a high in November may change that.Revenue in the three months to June grew 28 percent year-on-year \u2014 the slowest in three years \u2014 to $3.27 billion, missing the expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Gross merchandise value, the sticker price of goods transacted on Alibaba\u2019s shopping platforms, increased 34 percent \u2014 just over half the rate of two years ago. In comparison, transactions on the much smaller rival JD.com soared 82 percent in the same quarter.

Alibaba once simply matched buyers and sellers; now it is part of an \u201conline-to-offline\u201d empire that extends to movies, health care, cloud computing and even a bank. Just two days ago, a $4.6 billion investment in the retailer Suning took Alibaba into the struggling electronics superstore sector.

{"Headline": "The Tough Love of \u2018Austerity\u2019", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsAusterity, diet of our lives, girder of our loins. At the moment, the word brings to mind the continuing crisis in Greece and, by extension, the power of the Germans holding the purse strings. \u2018\u2018Austerity\u2019\u2019 has become the catchall word for the cost-cutting a government enacts in order to balance its books: Cut pensions, cut the public payroll, cut social services \u2014 cut whatever and wherever. Shrink spending, shrink debt, shrink deficits. The idea is to inspire confidence and make the place more attractive to investors, who prefer a government that\u2019s tough and lean to one that\u2019s marbled and tender.This shrewd (and, it must be said, mythical) household would become a favorite muse for austerity\u2019s proponents, even when they began talking about the economies of entire countries: the thrifty state as a bigger version of the thrifty household, taking care never to spend more than it takes in, scrimping and saving and carrying little to no debt. Unlike the household, though, which has been venerated ad nauseam, the state has historically been an object of suspicion, especially in classical economics. Mark Blyth, a political economist at Brown University and the author of \u2018\u2018Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea,\u2019\u2019 traces the concept of fiscal austerity back to the 17th-century British philosopher John Locke and an ambivalence toward state power. Locke and his fellow liberals recognized the need for government to overthrow the divine right of kings, but they also feared government, worrying it could give with one hand and take away with the other. Instead, Blyth writes, the market was to be the \u2018\u2018antidote to the confiscatory politics of the king,\u2019\u2019 and the bond market of creditors would keep the state in check. The smaller the government, the better; it should protect property rights and otherwise get out of the way.In other words, the market was to be left alone \u2014 \u2018\u2018laissez faire\u2019\u2019 \u2014 so that it was free to operate according to its natural laws. Recessions and downturns were the market\u2019s way of correcting itself. When government intervenes, it invariably distorts. During World War I, deficits in the United States ballooned, and a succession of American presidents in the 1920s were committed to slashing government spending. Warren G. Harding created a Federal Liquidation Board, whose purpose was the shuttering of government offices. \u2018\u2018We are going to cut the garment to fit the cloth,\u2019\u2019 he explained. His successor, Calvin Coolidge, once received a gift of two lion cubs and named them Tax Reduction and Budget Bureau. But it was the Treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who would perhaps become best known for an almost fanatical adherence to austerity. After the crash of 1929, President Herbert Hoover recalled in his memoirs, Mellon insisted that he knew what the country needed: \u2018\u2018Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.\u2019\u2019 The market had overindulged in speculation and borrowing, and it was issuing its own emetic. \u2018\u2018It will purge the rottenness out of the system,\u2019\u2019 Hoover remembered Mellon saying. \u2018\u2018People will work harder, live a more moral life.\u2019\u2019 Austerity was the natural consequence of the market returning to its purer, laissez-faire state. The ensuing Depression therefore gave laissez-faire a terrible name. In 1931, Business Week asked, \u2018\u2018Do You Still Believe in Lazy-Fairies?\u2019\u2019Austerity, however, could still bring to mind stiff upper lips and moral rectitude. In 1942, when wartime Britain was rationing items like cigarettes, soap flakes, eggs and tea, The Times ran an article called \u2018\u2018We, Too, Need Austerities\u2019\u2019 that praised what might be described as austerity chic: \u2018\u2018It is an \u2018austerity\u2019 that pots and pans and crockery and cutlery are of standard material and pattern.\u2019\u2019 The sacrifice may feel unpleasant, but the results induce envy. \u2018\u2018More cold and exercise have made the British tougher,\u2019\u2019 the writer marveled. \u2018\u2018The rationing diet is not only adequate for maintaining life and strength but it does not foster gluttony or put weight in the wrong places.\u2019\u2019A Marshall Plan and seven decades later, austerity is associated more with faceless technocrats imposing economic reform than families in threadbare sweaters making their meat ration last the week. The quaint image of household belt-tightening, however, continues to inspire some of the counterparties to Greece\u2019s $360 billion (and counting) debt. After Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, Merkel tut-tutted about the spendthrift banks and governments that had gorged on borrowed money. The \u2018\u2018Swabian housewife,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u2018\u2018would have told us her worldly wisdom: In the long run, you can\u2019t live beyond your means.\u2019\u2019Even those who are sympathetic to austerity may have a harder time with the word now. John Cochrane, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, told me that it \u2018\u2018started as bad marketing for some sensible policy\u2019\u2019 and has since become a \u2018\u2018general-purpose insult.\u2019\u2019 He tries to avoid it: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m in favor of \u2018growth-oriented policies\u2019 \u2014 isn\u2019t that a much prettier term?\u2019\u2019 Yes, though what it loses in insult, it perhaps makes up for in euphemism. \u2018\u2018Growth-oriented\u2019\u2019 is as irresistible to an American sensibility as sparen, \u2018\u2018to save,\u2019\u2019 is to a German one: It sounds like a no-brainer.It also masks something that the word \u2018\u2018austerity\u2019\u2019 does not. Austerity is often promoted as not only economically but morally necessary too \u2014 Greece, according to this argument, needs to be taught a very painful lesson, or else it\u2019s going to continue to do silly things with other people\u2019s money. Blyth told me that austerity policies, whatever we want to call them, turn an economic situation into \u2018\u2018a morality tale of saints and sinners,\u2019\u2019 leading to punishment rather than problem-solving. Besides, he says, this morality tale gets it backward. Austerity programs have historically been enacted in reaction to a banking crisis: A government goes into debt in order to rescue the banks, and so private debt is transferred onto the public balance sheet. Public spending is slashed as a result.Given that the poor benefit more from the kind of government spending that is cut, Blyth writes in his book, austerity \u2018\u2018relies on the poor paying for the mistakes of the rich.\u2019\u2019 Greece\u2019s people are becoming poorer: Last year, Unicef calculated that more than 40 percent of Greek children were living in poverty, a doubling from four years earlier. The conversations about Greece sound depressingly familiar, mimicking the ones we have here about the poor, the rich and who \u2018\u2018deserves\u2019\u2019 what. The setting might change, but the moral stays the same: Those with less are expected to be the ones to do without.Jennifer Szalai is an editor at The New York Times Book Review.

People waved giant red flags at the Great Wall and performed dragon dances near the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, built for the 2008 Summer Games.While the celebration was more muted this time, many residents showed the same strident nationalism that prevailed in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Games, a milestone in China\u2019s efforts to be accepted as a world power. And for China\u2019s leaders, the decision provided another validation of the country\u2019s growing clout as it increasingly challenges the West\u2019s power and spends billions overseas to win allies.\u201cWe will deliver every promise we made,\u201d President Xi Jinping said in a video played at a meeting of Olympic delegates in Malaysia. \u201cThe Chinese people will deliver a wonderful, extraordinary and remarkable Winter Olympics for the world.\u201dTo win its bid, China made a series of extraordinary promises. Officials said they would turn the dry hills outside Beijing into a winter wonderland, despite the fact that the region receives little snow. They also pledged to substantially reduce Beijing\u2019s air pollution, which remains a serious health risk, especially in the winter.Chinese citizens on Friday reacted with cool confidence.\u201cMoney can solve all the problems, and we have the money,\u201d said Zhang Zhaoshi, 76, a retiree.China has estimated the Games will cost about $3 billion, though analysts expect the total will be much higher. The government is already investing in winter sports like snowboarding and skiing to build interest, as well as a reserve of talent.Some residents said they were concerned the government might spend money on the Olympics at the expense of other programs. But mostly, people seemed giddy at the prospect of a jolt to China\u2019s economy, which has showed signs of slowing recently.\u201cThey surely have to spend some money in their pockets to improve our lives,\u201d said Guo Yiwei, 55, a Beijing taxi driver, referring to government leaders. \u201cWe simply would not allow the foreigners to see how unhappy our Beijingers are, right?\u201dGuo said hosting the Winter Games would give China the opportunity to showcase its power.\u201cWe can\u2019t always sit on the side and let the Americans dominate like a boss, since we also want to be the boss,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like a doormat when you are number two.\u201dMany people rejected criticism that Beijing lacked the climate and the infrastructure to host the Winter Games.

{"Headline": "Oliver Sacks, Casting Light on the Interconnectedness of Life", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn AppraisalIt\u2019s no coincidence that so many of the qualities that made Oliver Sacks such a brilliant writer are the same qualities that made him an ideal doctor: keen powers of observation and a devotion to detail, deep reservoirs of sympathy, and an intuitive understanding of the fathomless mysteries of the human brain and the intricate connections between the body and the mind.Dr. Sacks, who died on Sunday at 82, was a polymath and an ardent humanist, and whether he was writing about his patients, or his love of chemistry or the power of music, he leapfrogged among disciplines, shedding light on the strange and wonderful interconnectedness of life \u2014 the connections between science and art, physiology and psychology, the beauty and economy of the natural world and the magic of the human imagination.In his writings, as he once said of his mentor, the great Soviet neuropsychologist and author A.\u00a0R. Luria, \u201cscience became poetry.\u201d Dr. Sacks depicted such people not as scientific curiosities but as individuals who become as real to us as characters by Chekhov (another doctor who wrote with uncommon empathy and insight). He was concerned with the impact that his patients\u2019 neurological disorders had on their day-to-day routines, their relationships and their inner lives. His case studies became literary narratives as dramatic, richly detailed and compelling as those by Freud and Luria \u2014 stories that underscored not the marginality of his patients\u2019 experiences, but their part in the shared human endeavor and the flux and contingencies of life.Those case studies captured the emotional and metaphysical, as well as physiological, dimensions of his patients\u2019 conditions. While they tracked the costs and isolation these individuals often endured, they also emphasized people\u2019s resilience \u2014 their ability to adapt to their \u201cdeficits,\u201d enabling them to hold onto a sense of identity and agency. Some even find that their conditions spur them to startling creative achievement.Animated by a self-deprecating sense of humor and set down in limber, pointillist prose, Dr. Sacks\u2019s autobiographical accounts are as candid and searching as his writings about his patients, and they suggest just how rooted his compassion and intuitive understanding \u2014 as a doctor and a writer \u2014 were in his youthful feelings of fear and dislocation. He tells us about the lasting shock of being evacuated from London as a boy during the war, and being beaten and bullied at boarding school. The rest of his life, he writes, he would have trouble with the three B\u2019s: \u201cbonding, belonging, and believing.\u201dHe also writes about the frightening psychotic episodes of his schizophrenic brother, Michael, and his own feelings of shame for not spending more time with him \u2014 and his simultaneous need to get away. Science, with its promise of order and logic, provided a refuge for young Oliver from the chaos of his brother\u2019s madness, and medicine promised both family continuity (his father was a general practitioner; his mother, a surgeon) and a way to study and try to understand brain disorders like Michael\u2019s.Dr. Sacks once described himself as a man with an \u201cextreme immoderation in all my passions,\u201d and his books pulsate with his \u201cviolent enthusiasms\u201d and endless curiosity: his fascination with ferns, cephalopods, jellyfish, volcanoes, the periodic table \u2014 for all the marvels of the natural world; as well as his passion for swimming, chemistry, photography and perhaps most of all, writing. Known as Inky as a child, he began keeping journals at the age of 14. For the shy boy, writing was a way to connect with the world, a way to order his thoughts; and he kept up the habit throughout his life, amassing nearly a thousand journals, while using his books and essays to communicate to readers the romance of science and the creative and creaturely blessings of being alive.Inclined to living \u201cat a certain distance from life,\u201d Dr. Sacks writes that he unexpectedly fell in love \u2014 \u201c(for God\u2019s sake!) I was in my 77th year\u201d \u2014 with the writer Bill Hayes, which meant relinquishing \u201cthe habits of a lifetime\u2019s solitude,\u201d like decades of meals that consisted mostly of cereal or sardines, eaten \u201cout of the tin, standing up, in 30 seconds.\u201d\u201cAbove all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure.\u201d His patients have lost an erudite and compassionate doctor. The world has lost a writer of immense talent and heart, a writer who helped illuminate the wonders, losses and consolations of the human condition.Advertisement"}

The Advent of Artisanal Cash", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI wanted something old-fashioned looking,\u201d Mr. Deller said. \u201cSomething almost pre-currency.\u201dOne hundred and twenty miles west of Brixton, in the city of Bristol, a pound note issued after a design competition that was open to locals displays a colorful lemur striding atop a vibrant cityscape. The back has magenta-hued, hand-cut stencil illustrations of accomplished denizens, including the author J. K. Rowling and Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States.Many of the new alternative currencies have the look and feel of the regular legal tender accepted at such places. Most include anticounterfeiting measures like holograms and serial numbers. But they are more eye-catching.At the Effra Social, a Brixton pub, Ewan Graham, 31, an architect, was impressed upon examining one of the district\u2019s special pound notes for the first time. \u201cI\u2019d be more inclined to save money if it all looked like that,\u201d he said.The local currency, though, is intended not as collectible but to encourage trade at the community businesses where they are accepted, rather than chain stores, where money taken in tends to flow out of town and into the coffers of multinational corporations. (Compare it to the farmers\u2019 market: Homegrown lettuce now has a whole new meaning.)Unfortunately, Mr. Wolman noted, farmers\u2019 markets are an easier sell to consumers. \u201cYou have to work really hard to teach people what on earth your alternative currency is and convince them to jump on board, whereas anyone driving by a farmers\u2019 market will be like, \u2018Oh, look, some fresh strawberries!\u2019 \u201dThe bills themselves are adorned with pastoral landscapes, cavorting native fauna and still-life paintings of turnips, evoking the bucolic scenery of the region.\u201cThe idea of creating a currency that has our landscape and has our values right on the bill, that\u2019s creating a sense of place that we don\u2019t always have in America,\u201d said Alice Maggio, the program coordinator of BerkShares Inc. \u201cParticularly as we move towards a more globalized and homogenized culture.\u201d\u201cBerkShares allowed that idea of buying local to crystallize,\u201d Ms. Maggio said. \u201cI think people are drawn to them for the same reason they\u2019re drawn to handmade things and local food.\u201d\u201cWhen some people hold a bank note, it makes them furious about fiat money and the debt,\u201d Mr. Wolman said, \u201cbut for others, those symbols embedded in that paper mean a lot \u2014 the note conjures feelings of togetherness or nationalism \u2014 and the state wants you to have that feeling.\u201d\u201cIt functions the same as the BerkShare, but with a bigger impact,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re specializing in organic food and cheese. So I buy Chiemgauers with euros, but I know these currencies will circulate in my community, specifically with organic products, and this gives motivation to produce more and have more organic producers.\u201dSince its debut, according to the organization in charge of the Chiemgauer, 14 million euros have been exchanged into the currency, which operates in both cash and electronic formats.\u201cIf a Greek person wants to buy a German car, he would have to buy it in euros, at the exchange on the currency that\u2019s accepted with the euro,\u201d Mr. Lietaer said. \u201cAt the same time, for a haircut? I don\u2019t see any reason to use euros.\u201dRegardless of whether it can solve major debt crises, there is an appeal to smaller, homespun, physical money, starting with the greater privacy it affords.\u201cAs the government and corporations try to soak up more information from consumers, there are still going to be people that adhere to the good old medium of handing over dollar bills to exchange for goods and services,\u201d said John Bush, 31, a so-called liberty activist and the owner of Brave New Books in Austin, Tex.\u201cMore people want to move away from mediums where the government can track your every purchase,\u201d he said, adding that he prefers Bitcoin, barter or precious metals, though his store does accept credit cards.Though as Mr. Deller, the artist behind the latest Brixton pound, said, \u201cAs long as there are drug deals and criminality, there\u2019ll be a need for cash.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Making Life Too Hard for Millennials", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTO some, millennials \u2014 those urban-dwelling, ride-sharing indefatigable social networkers \u2014 are engaged, upbeat and open to change. To others, they are narcissistic, lazy and self-centered.I\u2019m in the first camp, but regardless of your opinion, be fretful over their economic well-being and fearful \u2014 oh so fearful \u2014 for their prospects. The most educated generation in history is on track to becoming less prosperous, at least financially, than its predecessors.They are faced with a slow economy, high unemployment, stagnant wages and student loans that constrict their ability both to maintain a reasonable lifestyle and to save for the future.Longer term, rising federal debt payments and increased spending on Social Security and Medicare will inflict a tremendous financial burden on them, threatening their own prospect of receiving promised retirement benefits.To a considerable extent, that\u2019s the fault of my generation, the baby boomers. We were the children of the Greatest Generation, but we may also be the most irresponsible generation.Americans between 18 and 34 are earning less today (after adjustment for inflation) than the same age group did in the past. A typical millennial averaged earnings of $33,883 (in 2013 dollars) between 2009 and 2013. That was down 9.3 percent (after adjustment for inflation) in just a decade and is the lowest since 1980. Older Americans have fared considerably better; earnings of all full-time workers were roughly flat between 2000 and 2011.Still more striking is that millennials have endured falling earnings even though they have attended college in record numbers.So what\u2019s going on? A major reason is the recession. Those who graduate in weaker economic times typically earn less than those who enter the work force during more robust periods. Starting behind often means never catching up.Millennials who didn\u2019t attend college have found their wages particularly squeezed, perhaps because of the decline of middle-skilled jobs in sectors like manufacturing, a clear consequence of globalization.The wealth of millennials has been hit even harder than their incomes. Their median net worth was just $10,400 as of 2013, down 43 percent from the $18,200 that Gen Xers had in 1995 when they were under 35. With incomes squeezed, millennials are not only not saving much; they are dipping into whatever savings they do have.That\u2019s worrisome when combined with weak incomes and low net worths. Millennials also participate less frequently in 401(k) plans and, scarred by the recession, invest less and keep more than half their money in cash \u2014 not a great long-term strategy.Another huge drag on the finances of younger Americans is the mountain of student debt that has been piled up in recent years. Members of this year\u2019s graduating class left their campuses owing an average of $35,051, about twice the levels borne by their counterparts two decades earlier (after adjusting for inflation).That\u2019s in large part because college is becoming less affordable even as it has become increasingly necessary. Since 1993, average tuition has risen by 234 percent, far above the 63 percent overall inflation rate.Saddled with debt and thin paychecks, millennials are delaying purchasing cars and new homes, low mortgage rates notwithstanding. By June of this year, homeownership among Americans under 35 fell to 34.8 percent, down from a high of 43.6 percent in 2004.Some of this may be cultural \u2014 younger Americans seem less interested in major possessions like cars and homes. But they are also delaying marriage and having children, which I believe is an indicator of strapped finances.Just to complete a dismal picture, millennials will also be the victims of the irresponsible fiscal policies pursued in large part by members of my generation. The massive budget deficits of recent years and projected needs to meet future obligations to retirees will result in a steady increase in federal debt, from less than 80 percent of gross domestic product today to an estimated 181 percent of G.D.P. by 2090.Rising national debt levels may threaten the ability of millennials to collect on promised Social Security and Medicare benefits. That\u2019s not lost on millennials \u2014 only 45 percent expect to receive Social Security benefits during retirement (compared with 68 percent of baby boomers).We can\u2019t completely undo the financial obstacles younger Americans face, such as their weak earnings. But we can start to put in place policies that will ease their burden. First and foremost would be to get the nation\u2019s economy onto a stronger growth trajectory.That\u2019s a daunting challenge that would require revamping federal outlays to emphasize areas like education, infrastructure and research and development. Spending more on these areas would require higher taxes on my generation, which is getting a lot more from government than we are paying into it.As part of redressing this imbalance, we need to reform the entitlement programs, for example, by reducing Social Security benefits for the highest income Americans. And important steps could be taken to both ease the burden of student debt for those who have already graduated and provide less expensive college opportunities for the rising generation.Let\u2019s at least start with a greater acknowledgment of the plight of millennials and the role that we \u2014 in many cases, their parents \u2014 played in creating it.A Wall Street executive and contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Twist, Europe May Find Itself Relying on Success of Alexis Tsipras of Greece", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreece never fails to surprise, and Mr. Tsipras\u2019s turbulent eight-month tenure has proved he is rarely predictable. But the man many European leaders once regarded as a populist wrecking ball is now presenting himself as a figure who can deliver pragmatism and stability \u2014 and carry out the sort of austerity program he once inveighed angrily against.\u201cI\u2019m sure that he has talked to European leaders, and they are O.K. with what he is doing now,\u201d said Harry Papasotiriou, a professor of international relations at Panteion University in Athens, adding that Mr. Tsipras was staking his political life on a bailout deal that includes the kind of taxes and pension cuts he once opposed. \u201cHe\u2019s taking ownership of it.\u201dAt the same time, analysts cautioned that the new election, and the continuing political maneuverings in Athens, could further complicate and slow implementation of the 86 billion euro bailout program, worth about $98 billion at Friday\u2019s exchange rate, signed by Mr. Tsipras in July. An initial progress review by creditors, scheduled for October, may be delayed, which would delay discussions between Greece and its lenders over possible restructuring of the country\u2019s crippling sovereign debt.Some economists also warned that the uncertainty surrounding the elections, including the possibility that the proposed Sept. 20 election could be pushed back, could revive the sort of public anxiety that earlier this year destabilized the broader economy and spurred a run on Greek banks.Across Europe, some commentators and European officials framed Mr. Tsipras\u2019s election gambit as a positive step to improve the odds that the bailout deal will be given a public mandate. Annika Breidthardt, a European Commission spokeswoman, said the commission \u201crespects the decision\u201d by Mr. Tsipras to call the vote and \u201cconsiders it important\u201d that the bailout package has public support.Few analysts predicted that the deep rifts between Mr. Tsipras and other European leaders would be suddenly be resolved, especially in Germany. But many agreed that Mr. Tsipras was not likely to go anywhere, given his continued popularity, despite his policy reversals. If European leaders want to see Greece truly put economic structural reforms into effect, Mr. Tsipras may now have the best chance of getting anything done, some analysts say.In Athens, political analysts note that Mr. Tsipras, at the moment, has no political rival capable of challenging him and that his party, Syriza, is almost certain to finish first in the election, with the question being by what margin. Those who left Syriza on Friday morning to form the Popular Unity Party are 25 lawmakers led by a former energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis. But analysts are skeptical that their anti-euro message will resonate with voters.Despite his policy reversals, Mr. Tsipras has retained his popularity by moving slowly to the political center after waging a defiant, unsuccessful fight to win Greece a better deal. Indeed, the surreal quality of recent Greek politics is hard to overstate.But European creditors did not budge, and only days later Mr. Tsipras reversed course and soon signed the country\u2019s third bailout package despite previously vowing not to do so. He only managed to pass the program through Parliament with the help of opposition parties, as hard-liners in Syriza refused to support it, setting the stage for the split and the call for an election.The head-spinning chronology has left many Greeks weary of political upheaval, if still seeming to trust Mr. Tsipras. In Athens, Maria Stasinopoulou, 22, an engineering student, endorsed the snap election, arguing that Mr. Tsipras had no other alternative. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best thing for the country right now, but he has to deal with Syriza before he can govern,\u201d she said, alluding to the party\u2019s insurgents.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m disappointed with Tsipras, but he did what could, and no one could have done more,\u201d she added. \u201cI think he deserves another chance. He\u2019s the only realistic, noncorrupt politician in Greece right now.\u201dBut Angelos Handris, 55, who manages a street kiosk near central Athens, bemoaned the election as \u201cthe last thing we need,\u201d and sharply criticized Syriza. \u201cThey promised the world, they messed up, they closed the banks, and now they want to drag us to elections,\u201d said Mr. Handris, a supporter of the conservative New Democracy Party.Mr. Tsipras has submitted his resignation to Greece\u2019s president, who will appoint an interim prime minister to oversee a caretaker government until the election. This means that for the third time in eight months, Greece will hold a national vote. Mr. Tsipras won the first two and is counting on a third.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, Victor Homola from Berlin, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Iraqi Prime Minister\u2019s Gamble", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIraq\u2019s politicians are known for settling disputes violently, injecting ancient grievances into modern-day disputes, bickering endlessly and putting off tough choices. They are not known for reaching consensus.That makes the widespread support for Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi\u2019s plan to overhaul the country\u2019s government extraordinary and somewhat bewildering. After weeks of street protests, and a nod from Iraq\u2019s supreme Shiite religious leader, Mr. Abadi announced over the weekend that he would slash layers of the bloated central government, eliminating several posts that have historically been assigned by quota to Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds in an effort to have an inclusive government.Securing the backing, at least in principle, of virtually every constituency in the disjointed political system is a good start. But the challenge of political reform is daunting with large parts of the country under the control of the Islamic State, a terrorist organization, and the tumbling price of oil battering Iraq\u2019s economy.For the plan to succeed, Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, must ensure that the overhaul does not deepen the disenfranchisement of the Sunni minority. Two of the politicians who stand to lose their jobs, Vice President Osama al-Nujaifi and Saleh al-Mutlaq, a deputy prime minister, are among the most influential Sunnis in Baghdad. Eliminating layers in a government that has been run like a collection of fiefs is certain to anger those who have benefited from the patronage system and ceremonial posts.To counter that, Mr. Abadi will have to reach out to Sunni leaders from violence-plagued provinces west and north of the capital and give them a meaningful say in governance. The government\u2019s failure to address the grievances of Sunnis \u2014 which include joblessness, abuses by Shiite-led security forces and unjustified imprisonment \u2014 set the conditions for the Islamic State, a Sunni group, to take control of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, last summer. It also controls key parts of western Anbar Province.A wild card in the Abadi plan is former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who became a vice president when he was forced to cede power last year and now stands to lose his post. Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, expressed support for the plan, perhaps because it would have been untenable to criticize a move endorsed by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered religious figure in Iraq.Mr. Maliki, a deeply sectarian politician, has remained a corrosive figure even in his diminished role. It is hard to believe that he intends to fade away quietly. Indeed, many Iraqis assume he\u2019s plotting a comeback. To make that dreadful scenario less likely, Mr. Abadi must find ways to build cooperation in a country that has seen little of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Wealth Secrets of the One Percent,\u2019 by Sam Wilkin", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom all appearances, Sam Wilkin\u2019s \u201cWealth Secrets of the One Percent\u201d could not be more timely. The book, its jacket copy explains, arrives \u201cwhen 1 percent of the world\u2019s population owns half of its wealth.\u201d Stipulated. \u201cSam Wilkin uncovers the economic principles that enable a fortunate few to get really rich.\u201d I\u2019m game.Inside, we discover that Wilkin, a senior adviser to Oxford Economics, a research consultancy, is a knowledgeable guide to the world\u2019s greatest fortunes, from those built during the Roman Empire through America\u2019s Gilded Age to the Internet boom. His ruminations on how these fortunes were made are offered in thoughtful, playful prose that, the marketing materials promise, are supposed to read like \u201c\u200a\u2018Freakonomics\u2019 meets Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u2018Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\u2019\u200a\u201dAfter I finished the book, however, one problem nagged at me: I do not understand what this book is supposed to be.Here\u2019s what I mean. Wilkin takes almost 400 pages to identify the \u201cwealth secrets\u201d of business titans such as John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and Bill Gates. These are his major conclusions: First, many of the world\u2019s richest people created their fortunes by changing the rules \u2014 more on this in a moment. Second, others did it by entering businesses with little or no regulation. Or by creating businesses in countries with little or no regulation.Third, and most important, they did it by creating monopolies for themselves, and by ruthlessly eliminating any and all possible competition. Many years ago I interviewed F. Ross Johnson, the C.E.O. of the bygone conglomerate R.J.R. Nabisco. Johnson had a pet phrase he used for these kinds of insights: \u201cB.G.O.,\u201d which stood for \u201cblinding glimpse of the obvious.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to be too hard on Wilkin. He is a pithy economist, which can\u2019t be easy, and he seems to understand that none of this is to be taken too seriously. So is the book supposed to offer actual insights into how great fortunes are made? Wilkin certainly spends a lot of time explaining just that. Or is it intended as a sly commentary on capitalist excess? In his notes, Wilkin says \u201cWealth Secrets\u201d was inspired by Schopenhauer\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Always Being Right,\u201d a sarcastic \u201cmanual\u201d to winning arguments. \u201cWhether you read the book as a guide to earning great riches or a social critique is your choice,\u201d he writes. Ah. Both. I think. Either approach works best if it includes original analysis. Several parts of the book certainly qualify as original. Take Chapter 2, \u201cWealth Secrets of the Ancient Romans.\u201d (First subhead: \u201cRoman Bling.\u201d) Here, in 36 pages, littered with anecdotes of Roman orgies and ephemera, Wilkin describes how Marcus Crassus \u2014 yes, that Crassus \u2014 built one of the greatest Roman fortunes by choosing the winning side in a civil war, eradicating his political opponents and then seizing their assets. He did this by exploiting laws and devising new ways to profit from slave labor. \u201cThe life of Marcus Crassus,\u201d Wilkin writes, \u201cillustrates a principle inherent in most wealth secrets, past and present: In a competitive market economy \u2014 especially in a competitive market economy \u2014 the way to get rich is to change the rules.\u201d I\u2019m not entirely certain how many students down at Wharton business school are emotionally prepared to win a Roman civil war. In all seriousness, though, if this is meant as social critique, yes, well, a lot of rich guys play dirty. Is that the point? Wilkin\u2019s book climaxes with Chapter 7, \u201cSeven Secrets of Spectacularly Rich People.\u201d I suspect several of these might draw a rude comment from F. Ross Johnson. Secret No. 1: \u201cDon\u2019t be the best. Be the only.\u201d Here Wilkin tells the story of the Thurn and Taxis European postal monopoly and how it crushed a potential rival in the 17th century. \u201cGrowth isn\u2019t the ultimate achievement of business strategy,\u201d he writes. \u201cHaving one\u2019s competitors hanged is the ultimate achievement of business strategy.\u201d Secret No. 2: \u201cBigger is still better.\u201d In this section Wilkin concludes that monopolies and economies of scale are wonderful ways to make money. Well, yes. Secret No. 3: \u201cThe worst place to do business is really the best.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s easier to make big money in countries with corrupt regimes, such as post-\u00adSoviet, \u201990s-era Russia, or in a fledgling third-world country. \u201cIt is much better to go for a large share of a tiny market,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere, you can turn the screws.\u201d Memo to Wharton grads: Somalia now open for business! Secret No. 4: \u201cWhen lenders can\u2019t lose, you win.\u201d This summarizes a section in which Wilkin retells the familiar story of how too-big-to-fail banks get bailed out. Secret No. 5: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to own it, baby, own it.\u201d It\u2019s good to own property. My father told me this when I was 9. I\u2019m sure Schopenhauer\u2019s did as well.Secret No. 6: \u201cSpin laws into gold.\u201d On the importance of creating helpful laws, especially those too complex for others to fully understand.Secret No. 7: \u201cIf you want to succeed in business, network, network, network.\u201d Wherever possible, control all related networks, such as supply and transportation.Wilkin concludes by ticking off some personal characteristics many of his titans shared. Many loved math. Many loved money and had \u201cthe desire, expressed from a very early age, to possess it.\u201d Many cut out their partners. \u201cA final characteristic .\u2008.\u2008. is that wealth secrets masters tend to be ruthless,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a lot of the people profiled in this book are rather unpleasant, hard-as-nails kinds of people.\u201dAll probably true, but even offered as social critique, there\u2019s a chance this falls somewhat short of Wilkin\u2019s Schopenhauerian goals. Several times I wondered whether Wilkin was attempting to chart some groundbreaking new wealth analysis and coyly disguising it as something else. But there\u2019s no new data or real theories here I could identify. Rather, most of the book reads like a familiar history of rich guys gone wild, as told by your garrulous economist uncle.Which is all a bit of a shame. Because there are sections in \u201cWealth Secrets\u201d where Wilkin, when his mind is not roving over Roman civil wars and medieval postal monopolies, shows he can pick apart the working of an actual modern company and come up with something like true insight. The book starts with just such an example, the fall of the electronics retailer Circuit City. Wilkin traces its decline to a series of ruinous long-term building leases signed years before. If he had stayed on this path, the book might have been useful \u2014 a book that explains, as that first chapter puts it, \u201cWhy Is It So Hard to Get Rich?\u201dRemember Tom Cruise as the budding entrepreneur Joel Goodson in the movie \u201cRisky Business\u201d?

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Vice President Sees Influence Grow as Scandal Engulfs Dilma Rousseff", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cTemer is clearly positioning himself for a range of scenarios including those in which he takes over as the next president of Brazil,\u201d said David Fleischer, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Bras\u00edlia. \u201cHe\u2019s using his skills as a discreet negotiator in the meantime, enhancing his own power while others tighten the noose around the president.\u201dThe political turmoil in Brazil reflects a souring of the national mood in Latin America\u2019s largest country, which had risen in the previous decade as an economic and diplomatic powerhouse in the developing world. With stunning claims of graft surfacing almost on a weekly basis, Brazilians are now examining the possibility that two of the four presidents elected since democracy was re-established in the 1980s after a long dictatorship could fail to finish their terms.But in public statements, Mr. Temer seems to be signaling that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s days as president may be numbered, and that his time may be coming. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary for someone to have the capacity to reunify everyone,\u201d Mr. Temer said this week about the tension gripping Bras\u00edlia, without mentioning Ms. Rousseff as being that unifying figure. \u201cOtherwise, we could enter into a disagreeable crisis for the country.\u201dMr. Temer, whose office did not respond to several requests for an interview, publicly expressed support for Ms. Rousseff after that statement, contending that the president would soon have the \u201cextraordinary support of the population\u201d and reverse a plunge in her approval ratings. But many observers still see Mr. Temer positioning himself for what comes next in Bras\u00edlia.\u201cTemer threw the president to the lions when he said that we need someone to unify the country,\u201d C\u00e1ssio Cunha Lima, an opposition senator, told reporters this week.\u201cPost-impeachment risks being even more tumultuous than the actual moment,\u201d the columnist Roberto Pompeu de Toledo wrote in Veja, a magazine that has staked out a position opposing Ms. Rousseff.Either way, Ms. Rousseff faces various legal challenges complicating her presidency.The Federal Court of Accounts, an auditing body tied to the legislative branch, is examining whether Ms. Rousseff improperly used funds in 2014 from giant state banks to cover budget shortfalls. A ruling against Ms. Rousseff could open the way for impeachment proceedings, potentially allowing Mr. Temer to take her place, though she could appeal at the Supreme Court.Separately, the Superior Electoral Court, which oversees national elections in Brazil, is reviewing claims that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s re-election campaign in 2014 accepted illicit donations from construction companies ensnared in the Petrobras scandal. A ruling by the court could call for Ms. Rousseff to step down along with Mr. Temer since they ran on the same ticket.Meanwhile, opposition legislators are seeking to start impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff. For the time being, congressional leaders appear to be resisting these efforts, emphasizing that the president has not explicitly been linked to any illegal activity.Some in Bras\u00edlia say that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents may merely be biding their time as the political crisis simmers and the president\u2019s coalition comes under stress, afflicting her capacity to govern. Two parties, the Democratic Labor Party and the Brazilian Labor Party, bolted this week from the coalition in Congress with Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers Party.In some ways, this leaves the president even more reliant on Mr. Temer, whom Ms. Rousseff named as her chief negotiator with the fractious Congress this year. Before becoming her vice president in 2011, he was the leader for a decade of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which has anchored Ms. Rousseff\u2019s coalition and controls both houses of Congress.On Friday, Mr. Temer publicly denied speculation that he was dropping the job of negotiating with Congress.Some observers are questioning how Mr. Temer can speak of unifying Brazil when powerful figures in his own party, known as the PMDB, have actively been sabotaging Ms. Rousseff\u2019s efforts to win approval of austerity measures.Standing 5 feet 7 inches tall, Mr. Temer, the youngest of eight children of Maronite Christians who emigrated from Lebanon to S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1920s, cuts an unusual figure in Brazilian politics. Married three times, he has five children of his own; several are older than his wife, who sometimes towers over him in photographs.Mr. Temer has remained relatively unscathed in a scandal-plagued political culture. He reportedly figured on a list of politicians who received illicit campaign donations in the 1990s from Camargo Corr\u00eaa, a construction company, but the investigation failed to produce charges against him, according to news reports.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Trump on Down, the Republicans Can\u2019t Be Serious", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis was, according to many commentators, going to be the election cycle Republicans got to show off their \u201cdeep bench.\u201d The race for the nomination would include experienced governors like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, fresh thinkers like Rand Paul, and attractive new players like Marco Rubio. Instead, however, Donald Trump leads the field by a wide margin. What happened?The answer, according to many of those who didn\u2019t see it coming, is gullibility: People can\u2019t tell the difference between someone who sounds as if he knows what he\u2019s talking about and someone who is actually serious about the issues. And for sure there\u2019s a lot of gullibility out there. But if you ask me, the pundits have been at least as gullible as the public, and still are.For while it\u2019s true that Mr. Trump is, fundamentally, an absurd figure, so are his rivals. If you pay attention to what any one of them is actually saying, as opposed to how he says it, you discover incoherence and extremism every bit as bad as anything Mr. Trump has to offer. And that\u2019s not an accident: Talking nonsense is what you have to do to get anywhere in today\u2019s Republican Party.The point is that while media puff pieces have portrayed Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals as serious men \u2014 Jeb the moderate, Rand the original thinker, Marco the face of a new generation \u2014 their supposed seriousness is all surface. Judge them by positions as opposed to image, and what you have is a lineup of cranks. And as I said, this is no accident.Or to put it another way, modern Republican politicians can\u2019t be serious \u2014 not if they want to win primaries and have any future within the party. Crank economics, crank science, crank foreign policy are all necessary parts of a candidate\u2019s resume.Until now, however, leading Republicans have generally tried to preserve a facade of respectability, helping the news media to maintain the pretense that it was dealing with a normal political party. What distinguishes Mr. Trump is not so much his positions as it is his lack of interest in maintaining appearances. And it turns out that the party\u2019s base, which demands extremist positions, also prefers those positions delivered straight. Why is anyone surprised?Remember how Mr. Trump was supposed to implode after his attack on John McCain? Mr. McCain epitomizes the strategy of sounding moderate while taking extreme positions, and is much loved by the press corps, which puts him on TV all the time. But Republican voters, it turns out, couldn\u2019t care less about him.Can Mr. Trump actually win the nomination? I have no idea. But even if he is eventually pushed aside, pay no attention to all the analyses you will read declaring a return to normal politics. That\u2019s not going to happen; normal politics left the G.O.P. a long time ago. At most, we\u2019ll see a return to normal hypocrisy, the kind that cloaks radical policies and contempt for evidence in conventional-sounding rhetoric. And that won\u2019t be an improvement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Halting Response to Migrant Crisis Draws Criticism as Toll Mounts", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith tens of thousands of people leaving war-torn or impoverished countries to seek asylum or a better life in Europe, criticism of the bloc\u2019s division and dysfunction is now accelerating, as the number of deaths mounts, crossing 2,500 this year.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said that the migration crisis is a bigger test for the European Union than even the Greek financial meltdown. She said on Friday that European interior ministers meeting this weekend would be looking into \u201crapid changes to the asylum system,\u201d and that European leaders could hold an emergency summit meeting \u201cif the preliminary work is done.\u201dAnd none too soon. There is no European Union standard for asylum; no common list of countries regarded as in conflict, and thus more likely to produce refugees; and no collective centers where asylum seekers can be met, housed, fed and screened.Instead, with much of Brussels still on vacation, a kind of free-for-all has set in, with some countries welcoming and others not, some taking legal responsibility for refugees and others flouting international law.Front-line states like Greece, Italy and now Austria and Hungary are \u201coverwhelmed and increasingly unwilling to take more responsibility,\u201d Mr. Betts said. \u201cSome European states are failing to keep to international law, and there needs to be a more equitable sharing of responsibility.\u201dUnder the convention, the countries where migrants first enter are supposed to screen them to decide who is a legitimate asylum seeker or refugee, but those countries are overwhelmed.The question of immigration is a visceral issue in a way the euro is not, dividing European governments from their electorates, member states from one another and the European Union from the values on which it was founded, said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, an analyst with the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.The divisions among member states \u201care growing unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Heisbourg said, with Germany taking about 40 percent of new asylum seekers, while France is taking only 8 percent and Britain, 4 percent.One of the European Union\u2019s fundamental principles is freedom of travel, especially within the borderless \u201cSchengen area,\u201d which includes much of Continental Europe.But that achievement is in danger now, said the Austrian foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, in an interview on Friday, demanding an urgent meeting of heads of state and government.On the Greek crisis, \u201cwe had one meeting after another at the highest level,\u201d Mr. Kurz said. \u201cHere, weeks, months go by \u2014 and nothing!\u201cWe need a European response,\u201d he added, sounding a common plaint. \u201cEurope must wake up at long last and recognize that this is a serious problem.\u201dThe German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said on Thursday that \u201cwe must reform the Dublin Convention immediately, and find a way of creating binding and objective refugee quotas that take into account the ability of all member states to bear them.\u201dEuropean Union officials struggle to cope with the growing crisis.The Dublin agreement was negotiated along with Schengen, Ms. Hermanin said, to balance freedom of movement for citizens with protections against migrants. \u201cBut after 25 years, it doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d she said.Still, she said, the situation is evolving rapidly now. \u201cSix to eight months ago it would have been completely unthinkable that states would call for a complete revision of E.U. asylum policy, as the Germans are doing,\u201d she said.But both Ms. Hermanin and Mr. Betts of Oxford University said that sharing even 310,000 people among the 28 countries of the European Union \u201cshould not be unmanageable,\u201d and that the numbers pale when compared with the 3.5 million Syrian refugees that Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon alone are hosting.\u201cEurope needs a comprehensive global refugee policy,\u201d Mr. Betts said, which should include more help to those neighboring countries to conflict that bear the brunt of the problem, so that refugees are better protected closer to home, making it more likely that they can return.A more generous and law-abiding European response would encourage countries like Jordan and Lebanon not to close their own borders, he said. Ms. Hermanin said that tougher refugee policies now in those countries are prompting some refugees to leave and head for Europe.Babar Baloch, the United Nations refugee agency spokesman for Central Europe, said that \u201cEurope\u2019s asylum mechanisms are dysfunctional\u201d without proper reception facilities in most countries.\u201cThey need to bring in a system in which wherever these people arrive they\u2019re helped on the spot,\u201d Mr. Baloch said. And given \u201cthe lack of legal avenues\u201d for refugees to come to Europe, there is instead a growing network of criminal people smugglers along dangerous routes.In a larger way, the migrant crisis is also a failure of geopolitics and the European Union\u2019s own \u201cneighborhood policy,\u201d designed to stabilize the countries of North Africa and the Balkans with economic aid and advice. The point of the policy is not simply altruistic, but to encourage the people who live there to stay there.The overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, which European nations assisted in, has produced a chaotic Libya. The result has been in essence a failed state very close to Europe, even as the Continent has been reluctant to deal with consequences it helped create.Those effects have included large numbers of migrants and asylum seekers, both Libyan and foreign, who now use the territory as a launching pad, and a major criminal economy built on people smuggling.Similarly, the West\u2019s inability to stanch the long civil war in Syria is generating its own blowback, creating a security nightmare that has sent nearly half the country\u2019s population fleeing for security.That has also complicated arguments in Europe, because fear of migrants has been coupled with likely exaggerated fears that radical Islamic jihadists will mix with the migrant flow and bring terrorism into a borderless Europe.Together with the long and unfinished euro crisis, these concerns are feeding right-wing and populist parties in Europe and undermining the credibility of the European Union, not just in Britain but in crucial member countries like France and Italy.Steven Erlanger reported from London, and Alison Smale from Vienna.

{"Headline": "Captain\u2019s Death Rattles a Marina in New Jersey", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELFORD, N.J. \u2014 He was a retired construction worker who turned his fishing hobby into a low-pressure business, taking a delight in almost anything he brought back.Unshackled from the industry\u2019s harsh economy, he came and went on his own hours, defying some of the mantras of professional trawling. There are no sick days. Never get on the water alone.Fishermen at the Belford Seafood Co-Op, where Mr. Andresen docked El Jefe and sold conch, sand sharks and lobsters, said they could not recall a boat\u2019s taking such a sudden plunge on smooth waters. A private diving team recovered his body from inside the boat\u2019s engine room on Friday, his family said. The United States Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the sinking.A latecomer in an industry that starts cultivating captains at ages in their single digits, Mr. Andresen was greeted warily by fishermen whose livelihoods depended on a good catch. He had spent decades fishing off small recreational boats as he worked construction jobs in New York City, including the rebuilding at ground zero, and he took up commercial fishing three years ago as much for the pleasure as the small payouts.\u201cHe liked the peacefulness and solitude,\u201d his brother-in-law, George Brickfield, said by phone on Sunday. \u201cIf the fish were biting, he\u2019d go out. If they weren\u2019t, he\u2019d stay home.\u201dStill, Mr. Andresen\u2019s death has rattled even the most hardened lifers, casting an uneasy silence over a marina that has been slowing down as business idled.\u201cIt\u2019s been quiet, you know?\u201d Brian Boyce, 34, said on Friday about the days since Mr. Andresen\u2019s disappearance, sitting in the co-op\u2019s cramped wooden office. Mr. Boyce grew up fishing out of the co-op and is the captain of a 50-foot boat, the Mary Virginia.Mr. Andresen was an outsider in this community of 1,800 that revolves around its docks. He lived with his wife in Bridgewater, N.J., about 45 minutes west of the co-op, after growing up swimming in the ocean off Rockaway, Queens. Fishing was an escape during his 30 years with the Local 731 construction union and, tempted by the chance to make some money in retirement, he bought El Jefe.\u201cHe turned his hobby into a business and was enjoying his retirement,\u201d Mr. Brickfield said, describing Mr. Andresen as a \u201csalt-of-the-earth guy.\u201dHe arrived at the co-op\u2019s docks with little of the intimate knowledge of the area\u2019s tricky currents and good fishing spots that his dock mates had absorbed over a lifetime, they said.\u201cHe was learning as he went,\u201d Mr. Boyce said, adding, \u201cHe didn\u2019t take advice all the time.\u201dThat occasionally concerned David Tauro, the dock manager, who emphasized the risks of being on the water alone. But in a profession that draws people who want to make their own luck, each captain was relied upon to stay safe and not get in other people\u2019s way.\u201cEverybody\u2019s an individual around here,\u201d Mr. Tauro said, standing in a cavernous warehouse among plastic crates packed with sand sharks and flukes.By his own standard, Mr. Andresen thrived. Mr. Tauro recalled him once arriving at the co-op with a bucket half full of fish, and asking what to do with them.\u201cYou could throw it overboard,\u201d Mr. Tauro replied, dryly. But Mr. Andresen\u2019s pride was undimmed.On another occasion, he returned with around a dozen lobsters to show for his day\u2019s work, a total that would have disappointed a full-time fisherman, and yet was wearing \u201ca smile ear to ear,\u201d Mr. Tauro said. \u201cHe was always happy,\u201d he added.At a time when many fishermen feel quotas are choking the life out of the industry, the casual attitude of part-time fishermen created some distrust, even if they were helping marinas bring in a bit of extra money.The quotas, put in place to address overfishing, have shortened species-specific fishing seasons and forced fishermen to risk taking boats out in bad weather for fear of skipping a permitted day, Mr. Tauro said.Mr. Andresen, whom dock mates said they rarely saw in the winter, encountered some jealousy.\u201cSome people frown on part-timers,\u201d Mr. Boyce said. \u201cThey can leave when it\u2019s bad, and come when it\u2019s good.\u201dThe Andresen family was on edge for days as divers struggled to find his body, Mr. Brickfield said. The lead role in recovery efforts was passed back and forth between the Coast Guard and the New Jersey State Police, with no one giving the family clear information until Friday, he said.State Police divers had trouble reaching the boat because of dangerous currents and a tangle of nets around the vessel, Capt. Stephen Jones said last week. So the Andresen family hired a private diving team, which retrieved his body from the engine room on Friday only 30 minutes after setting off, Mr. Brickfield said.Late Friday afternoon, as dozens of boats sat at Belford Seafood Co-Op \u2014 the next season does not open until early September \u2014 Mr. Tauro got word of the discovery from a television reporter.He relayed the news matter-of-factly to his co-workers.But as he explained why he thought emergency responders had not shown enough urgency in looking for Mr. Andresen\u2019s body, he showed signs of embracing him as part of the breed.\u201cJust another fisherman,\u201d he said of Mr. Andresen.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mississippi\u2019s Recovery After Katrina Holds Lessons for Policy Makers", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the hurricane roared in from the Gulf of Mexico, it crushed pretty beachfront towns like Pass Christian and Waveland under a 28-foot surge and wrecked the cities of Gulfport and Biloxi, ripping up the Port of Gulfport and tossing around the floating casinos. It spun off tornadoes, wreaking destruction far from the coast. All told, 238 people died in Mississippi, an appalling number but one mostly overshadowed by the far grimmer toll in New Orleans.Now, it is easy to see the rebuilt and the missing: the empty lots where stately beachfront homes once stood and the new civic buildings in otherwise modest coastal communities. The population on the coast has rebounded but shifted inland somewhat, driven by safety concerns and flood insurance costs.New Orleans may have gotten most of the attention, but the experience here may be just as instructive for those debating the weighty policy questions raised by the nation\u2019s costliest natural disaster: what a 10-year recovery truly feels like, how to split up resources between grand ambition and pressing reality, and who is ultimately deserving of government help.The New Orleans of 2015 has been altered, and not just by nature. In some ways, it is booming as never before. In others, it is returning to pre-Katrina realities of poverty and violence, but with a new sense of dislocation for many, too.\u201cLet me tell you, it wasn\u2019t easy some days,\u201d said Tommy Belk, who has lived for nearly all of the past 10 years in a trailer with enormous holes in the roof, the scars left by Hurricane Katrina. On rainy days here among the pines, 15 miles from the Gulf, Mr. Belk, 51, hauled in garbage bins to catch the downpour. Sometimes it worked.On July 4, Mr. Belk received a new trailer through a state program. He was among many whose wait for post-Katrina housing only recently came to a close.That he received the new trailer at all traces back to one of the more controversial episodes of the recovery, and one that is in some ways still unfolding. In 2007, Haley Barbour, then the governor, set off a tempest when he requested that $600 million of federal disaster relief be directed toward renovating and expanding the Port of Gulfport, a project long on his wish list. Activists, lawmakers and some federal officials balked, saying the money was intended for housing.But the Barbour administration insisted that housing needs had been overestimated and were being fully met \u2014 at least by the state\u2019s determination. The state\u2019s definition of need arose from pledges Mr. Barbour made to Republican members of Congress in 2005, when he was lobbying for disaster assistance that would eventually reach $5.4 billion.Many lawmakers were deeply skeptical of compensating thousands of homeowners for housing damage, Mr. Barbour said on Thursday, recalling those negotiations. Compensation for homes destroyed by storm surge was one thing, flood insurance being the government\u2019s business, but critical lawmakers were dead set against giving aid to people who, in their minds, should have been insured against wind damage.With the housing programs coming in under cost, Mr. Barbour asked to direct the unused money toward restoring and expanding the port, an aim the state called \u201ccrucial to the economy and the long-term recovery.\u201d In its proposal, state officials projected 2,586 permanent maritime jobs by 2015.HUD reluctantly acquiesced. And civil rights groups filed suit.\u201cEvery year starting in 2007, we pointed out big groups of people left out of the existing programs,\u201d said Reilly Morse, the president of the Biloxi-based Mississippi Center for Justice. \u201cTheir houses deteriorated further and further, so people who started living in half their house would end up living in just one room.\u201dEventually, Obama administration officials began to exert pressure as well, but, Mr. Morse said, Mr. Barbour remained resistant to any changes.But in 2010, as part of a deal with the federal government, Mr. Barbour agreed to reallocate $132 million to aid poor and uninsured homeowners regardless of how their homes were damaged. With this agreement reached, Mississippi\u2019s post-Katrina housing efforts ultimately came to be seen as a success. Under the new program, 5,200 homes were repaired or replaced, including Mr. Belk\u2019s. And because of other programs, there is considerably more subsidized housing on the coast than before Hurricane Katrina.The grand goals for the port are another story. According to its most recent federal filing, the port has roughly 470 fewer jobs than it had at the time of Mr. Barbour\u2019s 2007 request. Of the 1,300 direct new jobs the port is supposed to have created, it can claim 99. Less than half the money has been spent.To be sure, renovating a port is a complicated enterprise, and the initial goals were quite lofty.\u201cHad it worked quicker, everybody would be saying, \u2018What a magnificent thing,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Gerald Blessey, the Biloxi city attorney.But litigation thwarted part of the plan, a major tenant of the port unexpectedly decamped to New Orleans, and the grandest hopes for expansion were dashed when, in the post-earmark era, Mississippi could not obtain the funding to deepen the port\u2019s ship channel. Mr. Barbour\u2019s successor as governor, Phil Bryant, ordered ambitions scaled down and directed the port to focus on finding jobs, even those not in the maritime industry.Mississippi officials now say the target number of 1,300 new jobs will be met by 2019, a new deadline recently agreed to by HUD, which is pressing the state to penalize the Mississippi State Port Authority if the goals are not met. The port has picked up some new tenants, celebrated the opening of an on-site hotel, and begun in earnest the work of expanding its footprint.\u201cFrom the time that we\u2019ve actually started construction, we\u2019re moving very rapidly,\u201d said Jonathan Daniels, the port authority\u2019s executive director.Indeed, a dozen cranes can be seen from the beach now, saluting the casinos that have fought their way back from storm and recession, the lots still empty in the old working-class neighborhood of East Biloxi, the bustling downtown of Gulfport and, miles to the north in the piney woods, a brand new trailer with a satisfied occupant.\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have a roof,\u201d Mr. Belk said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cadillac Has New Boss, New Address and Big Plans", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsCan a South African-born former Audi executive, who recently spurned Japanese masters in Hong Kong, lead a Detroit luxury brand back to greatness \u2014 and from a new base in Manhattan?Johan de Nysschen and Cadillac are about to find out.After a string of failed revival attempts through the \u201970s and \u201990s \u2014 think the Cimarron \u2014 Cadillac harnessed aggressive design and performance to put its old-timey image largely in the past. Yet its comeback has stalled. Cadillac\u2019s American sales have slumped 2 percent in 2015, even as its German rivals Mercedes, BMW and Audi set one sales record after another.For General Motors, another post-bankruptcy executive shake-up was in order. Last fall, it hired Mr. de Nysschen, one of the industry\u2019s most prominent leaders, who helped lead Audi of America to sales heights before Nissan chose him to lead its Infiniti division from offices in Hong Kong.But Mr. de Nysschen cast his gaze eastward. After more than a century in the Motor City, Cadillac is revamping as a separate G.M. unit, moving to new Manhattan headquarters in SoHo to take the pulse of this luxury-crazed international city.G.M. will also invest $12 billion by 2020 to develop eight new Cadillac models, including the crossover sport utility vehicles that have been conspicuously absent from the lineup.\u201cHow is it possible that we have so few crossovers from this iconic American luxury brand?\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said. \u201cThe Germans have more than I can count on two hands.\u201dOne answer, he suggests, is that Cadillac has often been overshadowed in G.M.\u2019s Midwest empire. Cadillac design and engineering will remain in the Eero Saarinen-designed G.M. Technical Center in suburban Detroit, itself the recipient of a $1 billion investment and up to 2,600 new jobs. But Mr. de Nysschen insists that the relocation isn\u2019t window dressing.Staying in Detroit, \u201cWe\u2019d be such a small part of the constellation that we\u2019d get whittled down to the lowest common denominator,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said. \u201cBy changing geography, you force a change.\u201dMichael Harley, editor in chief of Autoweb, said that \u201cCadillac has tried to revive themselves over and over, but it was always a halfhearted effort. But by splitting the brand off, they\u2019re taking a more serious approach.\u201dThe less-provincial outlook includes another bid to make Cadillac an international player by tailoring cars to buyers in China and Europe. To become a true \u201cchallenger brand,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said, it must also beat the Germans at the global luxury game they dominate.Cadillac models like the ATS and CTS sedans have received awards and critical praise for outperforming those German rivals. The buyers haven\u2019t always followed. When the price of the enlarged and lavishly re-engineered CTS shot into BMW and Mercedes territory, at more than $60,000 for loaded versions, not enough consumers were prepared for the richer version, Mr. de Nysschen said. Cadillac was forced to idle a Michigan assembly plant for three weeks to trim bloated inventories of the slow-selling ATS and CTS.In hindsight, Mr. de Nysschen said, Cadillac might have simply renamed the CTS to make clear that it was more deluxe, ambitious and, yes, expensive than before.Mr. Harley said that the CTS\u2019s struggles show how hard it is to compete against German brands that sell not just on design or performance, but also on their badges and status.\u201cDe Nysschen has to sell the image, the idea that you want a Cadillac in your driveway instead of a Mercedes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a tough road.\u201dThat disconnect between Cadillac\u2019s critical standing and its lagging reputation and sales helped drive the change of perspective for its sales and marketing teams. One goal, Mr. de Nysschen said, is to draw on luxury experts beyond the auto industry and to \u201csee and live the lifestyle of actual luxury customers.\u201d\u201cNew York isn\u2019t where American trends begin; this is where global trends begin,\u201d he said.Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com, said that Cadillac continued to suffer from a perception issue. \u201cCadillac is making pretty compelling cars, but the sales needle hasn\u2019t moved too much,\u201d she said \u201cIt can be turned around, as Audi has done, but it takes a long time.\u201dIndustry watchers, especially in Detroit, have expressed skepticism over the corporate move, which could eventually see perhaps 200 employees on the leased top two floors of 330 Hudson Street in Manhattan. But Ms. Caldwell said the relocation could help revive Cadillac by attracting young talent from top Eastern universities who cannot be lured to struggling Detroit.\u201cAt this point, Cadillac has to take some risks,\u201d she said.Some risks have paid off. Others have not. A redesigned Escalade, that club-friendly, high-wattage sport utility vehicle, scored an unexpected hit in an era of bargain gasoline prices. Those same fuel prices did no favors for the ELR: The $75,000 plug-in hybrid coupe bombed so badly in showrooms that Cadillac had to chop $9,000 from its price. And the brand\u2019s CUE infotainment system has been reviled by critics.Mr. de Nysschen said Cadillac must continue to take calculated risks and even accept setbacks \u201cthat the old G.M. wouldn\u2019t have contemplated.\u201d\u201cIf you punish setbacks, you stifle innovation,\u201d he said.To that end, Cadillac is developing its own twin-turbocharged 4- and 8-cylinder engines that won\u2019t be shared with other G.M. brands.Late this year, Cadillac will introduce the XT5, a midsize crossover, to replace the aging SRX. That will be followed by the CT6, a full-size luxury flagship in the vein of the formidable Mercedes S-Class. The rest of the cavalry, including critical small cars and crossovers, will arrive from late 2018 through 2020.It is a long view, but as Mr. de Nysschen sees it, a healthy Cadillac is crucial to G.M.\u2019s success. Around the world, he said, luxury cars deliver only 10 to 12 percent of industry sales but 50 percent of its profits. Cadillac is G.M.\u2019s only luxury brand, and without its high profit margins, G.M. will struggle to fund critical technology and the low-margin economy cars that it must sell to meet rising fuel economy standards.\u201cIf we wait even 10 years, it will be too late,\u201d Mr. de Nysschen said.To woo buyers in Europe, where Cadillac has struggled to gain a foothold, the brand will develop diesel engines and right-hand-drive models. As Cadillac styles and engineers its global cars, the enormous Chinese market will never be far from mind. In the United States, Cadillac will tolerate lower sales volumes for now to bolster its image and the values of new and used models.That effort is beginning to pay dividends, Ms. Caldwell said. Cadillac\u2019s average retail transaction price has risen 6 percent over the last year to $53,700, far beyond those of Audi or Lexus and close to Mercedes and BMW at around $55,000.As Mr. de Nysschen moved from temporary quarters in Detroit to Brooklyn, he got his own taste of rising prices \u2014 for New York real estate. Over dinner at a Japanese restaurant in the Williamsburg neighborhood, Mr. de Nysschen said he had been outbid on multiple properties, mainly in Manhattan, before buying a home in Hoboken, N.J., that he and his wife, Anna, who hails from suburban Detroit, are renovating.\u201cSomeone clearly has a lot more money than me,\u201d he said, bemoaning his luck.Spoken like a true New Yorker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Neighborhood Car Service Companies Adopt Their Own Apps to Fend Off Uber", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chatty, frenetic dispatch hubs of neighborhood car services are getting quieter.When the phone rings at High Class Limousine and Car Service in the Bronx, the conversation comes and goes in fleeting bursts as the dispatcher turns not to an old two-way radio but to computer screens that silently blink with color-coded letters and numbers tracking the fleet of cars and their calls.Somewhere on the road, an app on a driver\u2019s smartphone lights up with an address to go to. A fading corner of the industry lives another day.Phone calls are fewer and fewer as customers shift to smartphone apps. Popularized by the ride-hailing company Uber, apps are being adopted, if not entirely embraced, by more and more of the local car services that have long been as much a part of city neighborhoods as the local parish or the corner bodega.High Class began using a smartphone app in December, and since then, a small but growing number of ride requests have been made through it.\u201cWe have to offer this thing or we\u2019re going to be left behind,\u201d said Antonio Cabrera, who co-founded High Class in 1995.Uber\u2019s rapid expansion has fed industry unease, especially among yellow-taxi owners and drivers, who see the ride-hailing apps as a threat to the value of the medallions that, at a considerable cost, have long provided entry into the tightly controlled business.Little discussed in all the debate over the changes roiling the market are neighborhood car services. Most are small businesses that have been sustained by generational loyalty and a touch of personal service.But after years of independence, some companies are joining forces, powered by an app to create a car service network in hopes of fending off Uber.Issac Yehuda, a co-founder of Limosys Software, which has catered to the limousine industry since 1989, devised a network where each company could have its own app with its own brand, but that would link all of the bases to one software system so that companies could effectively pool their cars and serve more customers.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see competitors who didn\u2019t speak together in 20 years are sitting in one room learning to talk to each other even when they\u2019re two blocks away,\u201d Mr. Yehuda said.High Class is part of Mr. Yehuda\u2019s network of over 75 companies \u2014 a total of 10,000 cars, across the five boroughs, with apps for Apple and Android devices. Collectively, the apps have around 250,000 downloads. Among all of the companies in the network, a few thousand rides are placed a week. Perhaps that is not a threat to Uber, which has about 20,000 for-hire vehicles in the city, according to the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission, but it is a leap into a new world.And they have at least one notable edge: They take cash. Uber relies exclusively on credit cards \u2014 and customers with the means to have credit cards.\u201cWe have a big cash market because Uber doesn\u2019t use it,\u201d said Junior de la Cruz, a manager at First Class Car and Limo Service in Manhattan, who started his company\u2019s app in early 2014.Old habits die hard in University Heights, the Bronx neighborhood where about three-quarters of High Class\u2019s rides from its Bronx and Manhattan bases are still requested by phone. But as Mr. Cabrera\u2019s customer base ages, he sees the app as a way to cater to those who in the increasingly on-demand economy expect to summon a ride in seconds.\u201cThey\u2019re always in the area,\u201d Levi Jimenez, 39, said in Spanish. A longtime customer of High Class, he now exclusively uses the app to book rides from his home in Upper Manhattan to work as an engineer in University Heights.For a growing number of the city\u2019s car service companies, an app was not only a way to hold onto customers but also to appeal to drivers, who, seeing the power of Uber, had been leaving neighborhood car services to experiment with the newcomer. High Class was hit hard, Mr. Cabrera said, losing about 50 drivers.Mid Island Car Service on Staten Island saw its fleet dip to 16 drivers from 21 as Uber expanded, said Artie Grover, a co-owner of Mid Island and the president of the NYC Fleet Livery Owners Association.\u201cThe driver has become the free agent,\u201d Mr. Grover said.In Bayside, Queens, Kelly\u2019s Car Service, a fourth-generation family-owned company founded in 1914, has a prime location next to a Long Island Rail Road station. The dispatch center operates much as it did 50 years ago: green and orange cards for account and credit card charges, and white cards for walk-ins and call-ins, all posted along the wall. The dispatch microphone is always hot, and the corresponding car\u2019s two-way radio works without a smartphone in sight.Soon, bits of electronic data will supplant slips of paper. Eileen Kelly, an owner, is finally giving in to the app craze. It is expected to go live within a year, though Ms. Kelly and her family are hardly heralding the change.\u201cIt\u2019s only because everyone has them and that\u2019s the way to go,\u201d she said.As drivers are witnesses to the wildly unpredictable nature of cab culture, the shift from paper to pixel is viewed as just one more change. John Donahue, a driver for Kelly\u2019s who has 40 years of driving experience, shrugged at the idea of tossing his flip phone for a smartphone.\u201cYou try to stay flexible,\u201d Mr. Donahue, 74, said.On a recent Monday, Mr. Donahue chauffeured Bridie Gauthier, a principal at a Manhattan preschool, and her 3-year-old foster son, Kai Saucedo, from Queens to summer camp at Ms. Gauthier\u2019s school in the financial district. Ms. Gauthier strapped her son into his car seat, which is provided at no additional cost by Kelly\u2019s, and fed him edamame during the commute. The railroad, she said, was not ideal for toting a toddler into Manhattan every day.\u201cEvery dispatcher knows my name and every dispatcher knows my credit card,\u201d Ms. Gauthier, 43, said. \u201cNow I\u2019m extremely spoiled.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Statement by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, we must calmly reflect upon the road to war, the path we have taken since it ended, and the era of the 20th century. We must learn from the lessons of history the wisdom for our future.More than one hundred years ago, vast colonies possessed mainly by the Western powers stretched out across the world. With their overwhelming supremacy in technology, waves of colonial rule surged toward Asia in the 19th century. There is no doubt that the resultant sense of crisis drove Japan forward to achieve modernization. Japan built a constitutional government earlier than any other nation in Asia. The country preserved its independence throughout. The Japan-Russia War gave encouragement to many people under colonial rule from Asia to Africa.After World War I, which embroiled the world, the movement for self- determination gained momentum and put brakes on colonization that had been underway. It was a horrible war that claimed as many as ten million lives. With a strong desire for peace stirred in them, people founded the League of Nations and brought forth the General Treaty for Renunciation of War. There emerged in the international community a new tide of outlawing war itself.At the beginning, Japan, too, kept steps with other nations. However, with the Great Depression setting in and the Western countries launching economic blocs by involving colonial economies, Japan\u2019s economy suffered a major blow. In such circumstances, Japan\u2019s sense of isolation deepened and it attempted to overcome its diplomatic and economic deadlock through the use of force. Its domestic political system could not serve as a brake to stop such attempts. In this way, Japan lost sight of the overall trends in the world.With the Manchurian Incident, followed by the withdrawal from the League of Nations, Japan gradually transformed itself into a challenger to the new international order that the international community sought to establish after tremendous sacrifices. Japan took the wrong course and advanced along the road to war.And, seventy years ago, Japan was defeated.On the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, I bow my head deeply before the souls of all those who perished both at home and abroad. I express my feelings of profound grief and my eternal, sincere condolences.More than three million of our compatriots lost their lives during the war: on the battlefields worrying about the future of their homeland and wishing for the happiness of their families; in remote foreign countries after the war, in extreme cold or heat, suffering from starvation and disease. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the air raids on Tokyo and other cities, and the ground battles in Okinawa, among others, took a heavy toll among ordinary citizens without mercy.Also in countries that fought against Japan, countless lives were lost among young people with promising futures. In China, Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands and elsewhere that became the battlefields, numerous innocent citizens suffered and fell victim to battles as well as hardships such as severe deprivation of food. We must never forget that there were women behind the battlefields whose honour and dignity were severely injured.Upon the innocent people did our country inflict immeasurable damage and suffering. History is harsh. What is done cannot be undone. Each and every one of them had his or her life, dream, and beloved family. When I squarely contemplate this obvious fact, even now, I find myself speechless and my heart is rent with the utmost grief.The peace we enjoy today exists only upon such precious sacrifices. And therein lies the origin of postwar Japan.We must never again repeat the devastation of war.Incident, aggression, war \u2014 we shall never again resort to any form of the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. We shall abandon colonial rule forever and respect the right of self- determination of all peoples throughout the world.With deep repentance for the war, Japan made that pledge. Upon it, we have created a free and democratic country, abided by the rule of law, and consistently upheld that pledge never to wage a war again. While taking silent pride in the path we have walked as a peace-loving nation for as long as seventy years, we remain determined never to deviate from this steadfast course.Japan has repeatedly expressed the feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war. In order to manifest such feelings through concrete actions, we have engraved in our hearts the histories of suffering of the people in Asia as our neighbours: those in Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and Taiwan, the Republic of Korea and China, among others; and we have consistently devoted ourselves to the peace and prosperity of the region since the end of the war.Such position articulated by the previous cabinets will remain unshakable into the future.However, no matter what kind of efforts we may make, the sorrows of those who lost their family members and the painful memories of those who underwent immense sufferings by the destruction of war will never be healed.Thus, we must take to heart the following.The fact that more than six million Japanese repatriates managed to come home safely after the war from various parts of the Asia-Pacific and became the driving force behind Japan\u2019s postwar reconstruction; the fact that nearly three thousand Japanese children left behind in China were able to grow up there and set foot on the soil of their homeland again; and the fact that former POWs of the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia and other nations have visited Japan for many years to continue praying for the souls of the war dead on both sides.How much emotional struggle must have existed and what great efforts must have been necessary for the Chinese people who underwent all the sufferings of the war and for the former POWs who experienced unbearable sufferings caused by the Japanese military in order for them to be so tolerant nevertheless?That is what we must turn our thoughts to reflect upon.Thanks to such manifestation of tolerance, Japan was able to return to the international community in the postwar era. Taking this opportunity of the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, Japan would like to express its heartfelt gratitude to all the nations and all the people who made every effort for reconciliation.In Japan, the postwar generations now exceed eighty per cent of its population. We must not let our children, grandchildren, and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with that war, be predestined to apologize. Still, even so, we Japanese, across generations, must squarely face the history of the past. We have the responsibility to inherit the past, in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.Our parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations were able to survive in a devastated land in sheer poverty after the war. The future they brought about is the one our current generation inherited and the one we will hand down to the next generation. Together with the tireless efforts of our predecessors, this has only been possible through the goodwill and assistance extended to us that transcended hatred by a truly large number of countries, such as the United States, Australia, and European nations, which Japan had fiercely fought against as enemies.We must pass this down from generation to generation into the future. We have the great responsibility to take the lessons of history deeply into our hearts, to carve out a better future, and to make all possible efforts for the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world.We will engrave in our hearts the past, when Japan attempted to break its deadlock with force. Upon this reflection, Japan will continue to firmly uphold the principle that any disputes must be settled peacefully and diplomatically based on the respect for the rule of law and not through the use of force, and to reach out to other countries in the world to do the same. As the only country to have ever suffered the devastation of atomic bombings during war, Japan will fulfil its responsibility in the international community, aiming at the non- proliferation and ultimate abolition of nuclear weapons.We will engrave in our hearts the past, when the dignity and honour of many women were severely injured during wars in the 20th century. Upon this reflection, Japan wishes to be a country always at the side of such women\u2019s injured hearts. Japan will lead the world in making the 21st century an era in which women\u2019s human rights are not infringed upon.We will engrave in our hearts the past, when forming economic blocs made the seeds of conflict thrive. Upon this reflection, Japan will continue to develop a free, fair and open international economic system that will not be influenced by the arbitrary intentions of any nation. We will strengthen assistance for developing countries, and lead the world toward further prosperity. Prosperity is the very foundation for peace. Japan will make even greater efforts to fight against poverty, which also serves as a hotbed of violence, and to provide opportunities for medical services, education, and self-reliance to all the people in the world.We will engrave in our hearts the past, when Japan ended up becoming a challenger to the international order. Upon this reflection, Japan will firmly uphold basic values such as freedom, democracy, and human rights as unyielding values and, by working hand in hand with countries that share such values, hoist the flag of \u201cProactive Contribution to Peace,\u201d and contribute to the peace and prosperity of the world more than ever before.Heading toward the 80th, the 90th and the centennial anniversary of the end of the war, we are determined to create such a Japan together with the Japanese people.August 14, 2015 Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of JapanAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rhode Island Church Taking Unusual Step to Illuminate Its Slavery Role", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 One of the darkest chapters of Rhode Island history involved the state\u2019s pre-eminence in the slave trade, beginning in the 1700s. More than half of the slaving voyages from the United States left from ports in Providence, Newport and Bristol \u2014 so many, and so contrary to the popular image of slavery as primarily a scourge of the South, that Rhode Island has been called \u201cthe Deep North.\u201dThat history will soon become more prominent as the Episcopal diocese here, which was steeped in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, establishes a museum dedicated to telling that story, the first in the country to do so, according to scholars.Many of the shipbuilders, captains and financiers of those slaving voyages were Episcopalians. The church, like many others in its day, supported slavery and profited from it even after the trans-Atlantic slave trade was outlawed and slavery had been banned in the state. Among the most notable Episcopalian slaveholders were Thomas Jefferson, who was active for some time in the church, and George Washington.The Diocese of Rhode Island, like many others, has been slow to respond. But under Bishop W. Nicholas Knisely, who became the Episcopal bishop of Rhode Island in 2012, it is taking steps to publicly acknowledge its past. They include the establishment of a museum focused on the trans-Atlantic slave trade, slavery and the North\u2019s complicity, as part of a new center for racial reconciliation and healing. \u201cI want to tell the story,\u201d Bishop Knisely said, \u201cof how the Episcopal Church and religious voices participated in supporting the institution of slavery and how they worked to abolish it. It\u2019s a mixed bag.\u201d He is helping to plan the museum and reconciliation center, which are still in the organizing and fund-raising phases. They are to be housed at the 200-year-old stone Cathedral of St. John, the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island. Because of dwindling membership, the majestic but deteriorating cathedral was closed in 2012. The idea for the museum and reconciliation center grew out of community discussions over what to do with the shuttered cathedral; it has gained new urgency in recent months as numerous cities have erupted in racial unrest.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move in concert with what\u2019s happening around the country,\u201d said the Rev. David Ames, who is helping to establish the center for reconciliation. \u201cEvents like the massacre in Charleston have really focused us on the dire need to improve race relations in this country.\u201dDiocesan officials have already begun conversations with the public, including African-American church leaders, about the goals of the reconciliation center. While the cathedral is being renovated, planners have worked with local universities and organizations to sponsor speakers and programs that delve into racial issues. They have scheduled more forums for the fall at Episcopal churches throughout the state where slave traders once worshiped.The museum, scheduled to open in 2017, will aim to illuminate the church\u2019s role in the trade and the extensive but often-ignored history of slavery in New England. The region\u2019s economy was inseparable from the slave trade starting in the 1600s, when the earliest settlers bartered Native Americans they had captured for slaves brought from Africa. Later, merchants and suppliers who grew wealthy from the slave trade founded and endowed several Ivy League colleges; soon, Northern textile mills were humming with Southern cotton picked by slaves.In a sign of how this history is only slowly coming to light, a ceremony was held Sunday in Boston, where the first slave ship in New England is believed to have arrived in 1638; a historic marker, to be placed later, will mark where it would have docked. The ceremony Sunday was part of a larger project commemorating the two million slaves who died and the 10 million who survived the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Tiny Rhode Island played an outsize role in the trade, thanks to the state\u2019s financiers, a seafaring work force and officials who turned a blind eye to antislavery laws. While many slave ships were built in Boston, they were supplied, manned and dispatched from Rhode Island ports. Between 1725 and 1807, more than 1,000 slaving voyages \u2014 about 58 percent of the total from the United States \u2014 left from Providence, Newport and Bristol. Those vessels brought more than 100,000 Africans to the Americas as part of the triangle trade. They traveled to West Africa carrying rum, which was traded for slaves. The human cargo was then transported to the Caribbean in the infamous Middle Passage of the triangle. There, the ships were emptied of slaves and loaded with sugar, which was brought back to Rhode Island distilleries to make more rum to take back to Africa and repeat the cycle.Bishop Knisely said his research had revealed shameful episodes in church history. For example, he said, when Quakers and Baptists in Newport began turning against slavery, some slave owners in those churches switched to the Episcopal Church, where they were welcomed and their slaveholding was not challenged. \u201cWe sounded an uncertain trumpet,\u201d Bishop Knisely said. \u201cWe were happy to receive their financial support. We allowed ourselves to be convinced by the prejudice of the time and didn\u2019t speak out.\u201dThe DeWolf family alone imported more than 12,000 Africans. The profits from the slave trade by James DeWolf \u2014 speaker of the Rhode Island House, United States senator, banker, merchant, privateer and owner of numerous rum distilleries \u2014 were so vast that, according to newspaper accounts at the time of his death, in 1837, he was the second-richest man in the United States. One of his descendants, James DeWolf Perry III (1871-1947), became the bishop of Rhode Island, the first bishop of the cathedral here and later the 18th presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church of the United States.The current generation of DeWolfs began digging into their family heritage a decade ago. One of them, Katrina Browne, a seventh-generation descendant of Mark Anthony DeWolf, the family\u2019s first slave trader, organized a journey for 10 family members to trace their legacy from Bristol through slave forts in Ghana and old family sugar plantations in Cuba. \u201cThe experience of seeing black audiences respond to a white family acknowledging these things \u2014 that\u2019s a powerful starting point,\u201d Mr. Perry said. Before he began retracing the steps of his ancestors, \u201cI had no idea just how bad my family history was,\u201d said Mr. Perry, 47, who left an academic career to start the Tracing Center. Although he was appalled by that history, he nonetheless decided to name his son, who was born in March, James DeWolf Perry VII.\u201cI want my child to remember our family history, both good and bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is how we need to approach our shared history as a nation, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These luxuries all come at no extra cost.With a little planning and a little bit of luck, this can happen to you on your next flight.I have empty-seat syndrome, a near manic obsession with trying to secure the best possible spot on a flight. I study airplane configurations. I check seating maps. I sweet-talk gate agents.While the chances are low, the payoff can be significant. The middle seat next to me was empty on a nearly 15-hour trip from New York to Johannesburg on South African Airways. Going to Rome, I had a whole row to myself on an American Airlines flight.The airlines would prefer this never happened. An empty seat to them means a lost fare and lower profit.In recent years, they have become pretty good at making sure their flights are packed to capacity. The industry\u2019s load factor, airline terminology for the percentage of seats that are filled, has been largely rising over the last decade to nearly 80 percent last year, according to the International Air Transport Association.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to game the system,\u201d said John F. Thomas, an industry analyst with L.E.K. Consulting in Boston. \u201cAirlines are running at record load levels.\u201dFor me, the game begins before I even book a ticket. When I traveled to Latvia and Lithuania last year, my main options from New York were connecting through Frankfurt, Moscow or Warsaw. Frankfurt had the most options with Lufthansa. That\u2019s where I went because my assumption is that multiple carriers and departure times to the same destination will increase my chances.In the same vein, I look for flights at odd hours, which are less popular with travelers. The middle of the day, for instance, is generally a quieter time for the hourly shuttle flights that operate between New York, Boston and Washington.On an international flight, I prefer a nine-seat row in coach, where seats are grouped in threes. This means most rows have three middle seats, the least appealing piece of real estate on any plane and the last to fill up. An eight-seat configuration (with a two-four-two layout) has only two middle seats. Simple mathematics.Then, when I book the flight, I choose an aisle seat toward the back of the plane. The front tends to fill up faster, and the back last because passengers generally want to get off quickly. I also aim for a row where the middle seat is empty, but where the window or aisle is already booked. Groups of two or more will have to look elsewhere. And typically passengers traveling alone will pick a middle seat only if nothing else is available.On international flights, where the planes are usually bigger, I also stick to the center section. Those middle seats are the farthest from the window, which to others can feel the most claustrophobic on cramped flights.After picking my seat, my behavior turns toward the obsessive. I check the carrier\u2019s website again and again to see how the plane is filling up, sometimes multiple times a day as the departure date approaches. If the middle seat next to me is suddenly occupied, I try to move to a better spot.A week out, the carrier\u2019s seat map can change frequently. Elite fliers are upgraded. Airlines unblock seats. The 24-hour mark, when many airlines allow passengers to check in online, can set off a whole new wave of changes.\u201cThat is when you really have the most movement, and the seats you don\u2019t have to pay for open up,\u201d said Jami Counter, the senior director of flights for TripAdvisor.I make one last attempt at the airport. Agents can tell you how close to full a flight is and the likelihood that an empty seat will stay empty once passengers on standby are taken care of. Politeness pays. So does a plaintive plea.If you finally board the plane and see an empty seat in your row, don\u2019t get too confident. Everything can still change in the last 30 minutes before the plane leaves. Some frequent fliers may try to catch an earlier flight. Or passengers from a canceled flight are rebooked on yours. Until the cabin door closes, that empty seat can always disappear.Next month, I\u2019m headed to Thailand on vacation, and the panic has already set in. My cheap fare on Cathay Pacific doesn\u2019t allow me to pick a seat until two days out.Needless to say, I plan to log on exactly 48 hours beforehand (setting my alarm clock for 1:30 a.m.) to make sure I can choose the best seat on the plane.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Effort to Issue Driver\u2019s Licenses to Immigrants Receives Surge of Applicants", "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 When Alberto Fraire drives past a police car these days, he no longer worries about steep fines, or perhaps being hauled to jail and tangling with the immigration system. When California began issuing driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants this year, he was one of the first in line.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge sense of relief now; it\u2019s a psychological thing,\u201d said Mr. Fraire, 37, who came to the United States with his parents from Mexico more than 25 years ago and recently leased a new black BMW to celebrate receiving his license in May. \u201cI am not completely secure, but I don\u2019t have to worry every time I get into my car.\u201dMr. Fraire is part of an extraordinary milestone. In the first six months of this year, more than half of the new driver\u2019s licenses issued by California went to undocumented immigrants like him.Even now, months after the program went into effect, lines regularly begin at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles by 6 a.m., a sign of the continuing changes in the state\u2019s population. D.M.V. officials predict that they will issue nearly 1.5 million licenses to undocumented immigrants within three years. Of the 883,000 total licenses issued from January to the end of July, 443,000 were granted to undocumented immigrants, the officials said.Many in the state applaud the license program, as well as other efforts by California to integrate undocumented immigrants into the economy, saying it simply reflects the demographic reality. California is home to nearly three million illegal immigrants, about 25 percent of all such immigrants in the country. More than half of the state\u2019s residents are immigrants or children of immigrants, with Latinos making up the largest ethnic group.Mr. Fraire, for example, works as an electrician and plans to apply for a contractor\u2019s license so he can open his own business.Most of the immigrant drivers who are now getting their licenses have been on the roads for years, usually driving registered cars with insurance to minimize the possibility of steep fines or of having their cars impounded.But critics say that with measures like the driver\u2019s license program, the state is interfering with federal policy. They argue that such laws will only entice more immigrants to enter the country illegally, increasing the need for public spending.\u201cIt creates even more of a magnet in what is already basically a sanctuary state,\u201d said Joe Guzzardi, a spokesman for Californians for Population Stabilization, which advocates stricter immigration policies. \u201cThese are very tangible rewards to people who have knowingly and willingly violated the law.\u201dCalifornia is hardly alone in offering benefits to undocumented immigrants; a dozen states allow them to get driver\u2019s licenses, and more offer in-state tuition rates at public universities. But no other state\u2019s efforts come close to the breadth of those California officials have pursued.Under the budget approved this year, children from low-income families, regardless of their immigration status, will receive subsidized health care. Lawmakers are also considering legislation to allow undocumented immigrants to pay for health insurance through the state\u2019s public exchange. And a bill that would give agricultural workers permits and protect them from deportation, the kind of policy that has historically been in the federal domain, cleared its first legislative hurdle with nearly unanimous support. Huntington Park, a suburb of Los Angeles, is moving this week to appoint undocumented immigrants to two unpaid advisory board positions.\u201cIf Congress isn\u2019t going to act, this state will find its own way,\u201d said Assemblyman Luis Alejo, a Democrat and the author of the driver\u2019s license legislation and the agricultural bill.The shift in public opinion also reflects the demographic transformation of the state.\u201cMost Latinos know somebody who is undocumented, and we\u2019re not some marginal community,\u201d said Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, which has lobbied for many of the state programs. \u201cWe\u2019re really just going to some level of common sense. We\u2019ve done in-state tuition and professional licenses for more than a million people. Lives have changed significantly, and the sky has not fallen.\u201dIn other states, there has been greater resistance. For example, in Connecticut, which began offering driver\u2019s licenses to undocumented immigrants this year, there was an initial surge in applicants, leading to complaints about long delays for permits and driver\u2019s license exams. The state\u2019s General Assembly expected 54,000 applications in the first three years; nearly 50,000 were submitted in the first six months.Maryland has issued roughly 60,000 licenses to undocumented immigrants since January 2014, while Colorado has given out about 10,000.In 2013, after California\u2019s Legislature approved the plan to issue the licenses, officials spent nearly a year working out the details, including what the licenses would look like and what identification documents would be accepted. Initially, officials worried that eligible immigrants would not try to obtain licenses for fear that it was a trap. Instead, in January, when the licenses became available, the morning lines of applicants stretched around D.M.V. offices. The state hired 1,000 new workers and opened four offices that are intended specifically to help with the new licenses and that remain open as late as 10 p.m.\u201cRight now, we only drive if there is no other choice, but that is often,\u201d said Roberto Tadeo, 40, as he waited to take his written exam one recent morning. Mr. Tadeo had spent the last hour driving from his home in South Los Angeles to a new D.M.V. office in the city\u2019s northern suburbs. Clutching the Mexican passport he used to prove his identity, he looked over his road sign flashcards one more time. \u201cNow I have to prove I\u2019ve been doing it safely all this time.\u201dAn article on Sunday about a surge of undocumented immigrants applying for driver\u2019s licenses in California misstated the percentage of all illegal immigrants living in the state. It is about 25 percent, not 40 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malaysia\u2019s Many Scandals", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Malaysia\u2019s ruling party is facing its greatest crisis of legitimacy yet. Long seen as a modern and moderate Muslim democracy, Malaysia has been riding on its economic growth and good diplomacy for years, and the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), which has led coalition governments for nearly six decades, has been claiming the credit.But rampant corruption, curbs on freedom of expression, a slowing economy and a currency in free fall have eroded public trust in the government\u2019s stewardship. It hasn\u2019t helped that Prime Minister Najib Razak recently reshuffled the cabinet, and sacked the deputy prime minister and the attorney general for asking uncomfortable questions. Or that once again the ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional (BN), is using its influence over government agencies to bypass or manipulate electoral rules to its advantage, most recently through gerrymandering in the eastern state of Sarawak.The last general election, in 2013, was criticized for many irregularities: flawed voter lists, gags on the media, the malapportionment of seats in Parliament and state legislatures. Although the Constitution highlights the importance of having a national Election Commission that \u201cenjoys public confidence,\u201d the commission has been doing the government\u2019s bidding for many years. BN won just over 47 percent of the popular vote in 2013, compared with nearly 51 percent for the opposition. But it gained control of about 60 percent of the seats in Parliament.The latest financial scandal to rock Mr. Najib also bears on electoral improprieties. The state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), whose advisory board is chaired by the prime minister, is fending off allegations of mismanagement; critics say it cannot account for some 27 billion ringgit in debt (about $6.6 billion). In early July, the U.K.-based Sarawak Report website and The Wall Street Journal reported that nearly $700 million had been transferred into personal accounts of Mr. Najib just before the 2013 election, suggesting a connection to entities linked to 1MDB. The anti-corruption agency claims instead that the money was a donation from the Middle East.Last week, Tourism and Culture Minister Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz explained that \u201ca brotherly nation\u201d had made the contribution \u201cto see certain parties win in the general election because we\u2019re friendly to them,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong.\u201d But the opposition People\u2019s Justice Party has filed a suit against Mr. Najib, 1MDB and the Election Commission alleging that these donations were illegal, and as a result the 2013 election should be \u201cdeclared null and void.\u201dThe Election Commission has a long history of manipulating the electoral system to the benefit of the powers that be. After the 1999 general election, it came under attack for enabling and covering up a vast vote-buying scheme in the eastern state of Sabah, in which local authorities distributed identity cards to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who then used them to vote \u2014 usually, anecdotal evidence suggests, for BN.The Election Commission also oversaw the delineation of voting districts in much of the country in 2002-2003. A study by the Center for Research on Inequality, Human Security and Ethnicity at Oxford University found that the process revealed a political bias in favor of the ruling coalition. \u201cIf the BN itself had redrawn the constituency boundaries to its own benefit,\u201d the report found, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have done a much better job than the Election Commission.\u201dOne of the Election Commission\u2019s tactics was to break up constituencies that were BN strongholds so as to increase the number of seats allotted to them in Parliament, and thus bolster the BN\u2019s potential gains. At the same time, it clumped together constituencies dominated by the opposition, reducing those constituencies\u2019 total number of representatives and the opposition\u2019s chances.In a survey of elections in 127 countries between 2012 and 2014, the Electoral Integrity Project, an independent academic study, ranked Malaysia\u2019s 2013 election 114 on its scale of perceived integrity. Yet today, nearly the same Election Commission that oversaw the voting in 2013 \u2014 all but two of its seven members remain \u2014 is in charge of redelineating voting districts again. And instead of correcting the system\u2019s existing flaws, it appears to be exacerbating them.The boundaries of Malaysia\u2019s voting constituencies are to be redrawn ahead of the next general election, planned for late 2017 or early 2018, ostensibly in order to increase the representativeness of both Parliament and state legislatures. The effort started in Sarawak because the state is due to hold local elections by August 2016. So far, the Electoral Commission\u2019s recommendations would increase the representation of less populated rural areas relative to that of more populated urban areas, which favors BN because it tends to fare better than the opposition in Sarawak\u2019s rural parts.A member of the state assembly from the People\u2019s Justice Party and an individual representing a group of voters have challenged the Sarawak redistricting in court, claiming, among other things, that its lack of transparency violates their constitutional rights. The High Court of Sabah and Sarawak in Kuching agreed, but its decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal. That decision is now being appealed before the Federal Court, Malaysia\u2019s court of last resort. (I have been involved with both appeals, helping represent the parties questioning the redelineation.)Despite this challenge and civil society\u2019s longstanding complaints that the Election Commission is not independent, Shahidan Kassim, a minister in the prime minister\u2019s office, recently declared being \u201csatisfied\u201d with its performance. This stands to reason: Mr. Najib, who is under growing pressure to resign over financial improprieties, could use a big win in the Sarawak election, to steady himself before the national election.Once again, the people of Malaysia risk being cheated out of an election. To prevent this, a citizens\u2019 movement known as Bersih (which I once co-chaired and is now led by Maria Chin Abdullah) is calling for a peaceful mass rally on Aug. 29-30 to demand free and fair elections and a clean government \u2014 starting with Mr. Najib\u2019s resignation.In addition to Bersih\u2019s demands, redistricting should be suspended, and the Election Commission should be dismantled. A new commission should be appointed in consultation with civil society.Malaysia is a country adrift. The government is failing us. The Election Commission is compromised. The rule of law is eroding. The people of Malaysia must take to the streets to reclaim our democracy and the soul of our nation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thai Police Announce Arrest in Bangkok Shrine Bombing", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Thai security forces raided an apartment building in a Bangkok suburb just before dawn on Saturday and arrested a foreign man the authorities believe was involved in the deadly bombing of a Bangkok shrine nearly two weeks ago. The police said they had found bomb-making materials and stacks of fake Turkish passports in the apartment. They did not announce the nationality of the suspect, or his name.The seizures and arrest were possibly the first major breakthroughs in an investigation that has been criticized for its missteps and slow pace.Gen. Somyot Poompanmoung, the head of Thailand\u2019s national police force, said he was confident that the suspect was linked to the bombing and said he appeared to be part of a larger network. \u201cWe believe some of them are on the run in the country and some of them may have fled the country,\u201d he said. General Somyot declined to discuss the motives of the group but said its members were driven by a \u201cpersonal grudge on behalf of their friends.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not transnational terrorism,\u201d he said. The Thai authorities have openly said that they are reluctant to describe the attack as terrorism over fears that it would hurt the country\u2019s tourism industry, a growing part of an economy that has struggled in recent years. More than 20 million visitors have come to the country so far this year. The shrine is especially popular among ethnic Chinese tourists from across East Asia and more than half of the dead in the bombing were ethnic Chinese, raising questions about the motive for the attack. The repatriation was widely criticized at the time by the United Nations and Western governments because of the prospect that the Uighurs would face persecution in China. Thailand\u2019s consulate in Istanbul was attacked soon after the Uighurs were sent back.But any Uighur connection to the blast remained far from certain on Saturday. Copies of the passport used by the arrested suspect circulated on social media Saturday and appeared to be a crude counterfeit of a Turkish passport. There was no date of issue; instead \u201cDate of Expiry\u201d was repeated twice. Among at least four misspelled words was Istanbul, using the wrong Turkish letters. Thailand is a major production hub of fake passports, an underground industry that churns out a wide range of travel documents.The Thai authorities said they were contacting \u201cdiplomats\u201d about the arrest on Saturday but did not say from which country. They also said they had trouble communicating with the suspect and were seeking interpreters.Before Saturday, the police had said that they had few leads in the investigation. Security cameras show a man in a yellow shirt placing a bag under a bench at the shrine shortly before the explosion, which occurred during the evening rush hour.The man\u2019s movements across Bangkok were partly reconstructed by the authorities, based on footage from other security cameras and interviews with taxi drivers.The arrest on Saturday was made at an apartment in a predominantly Muslim neighborhood in the northern suburbs of Bangkok. The police showed images of numerous fuses, metal pipes and bags of ball bearings that resembled those used in the blast. The suspect began renting the apartment on July 31, the police said. The bomb-making equipment recovered seemed to raise the possibility that the group was planning further attacks.The suspect was charged with possession of bomb-making materials and put under military custody. Thailand has been under military rule since May 2014.Poypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move to Fight Obama\u2019s Climate Plan Started Early", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the early months of 2014, a group of about 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists and Republican political strategists began meeting regularly in the headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, often, according to some of the participants, in a conference room overlooking the White House. Their task was to start devising a legal strategy for dismantling the climate change regulations they feared were coming from President Obama.The group \u2014 headed in part by Roger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, and Peter Glaser, a prominent Washington lobbyist \u2014 was getting an early start.By the time Mr. Obama announced the regulations at the White House on Monday, the small group that had begun its work at the Chamber of Commerce had expanded into a vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican governors and congressional leaders. And their plan was to challenge Mr. Obama at every opportunity and take the fight against what, if enacted, would be one of his signature accomplishments to the Supreme Court.Within minutes of the announcement, West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, stepped before a bank of cameras for a news conference at the Greenbrier resort in his home state. Flanked by Mike Duncan, the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, one of the nation\u2019s top coal lobbying groups, and Greg Zoeller, the attorney general of Indiana, Mr. Morrisey announced that a group of at least 15 Republican state attorneys general were preparing to jointly file a legal challenge to Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal.\u201cThe final rule announced Monday blatantly disregards the rule of law and will severely harm West Virginia and the U.S. economy,\u201d Mr. Morrisey said. \u201cThis rule represents the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation\u2019s history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats and based on an obscure, rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act.\u201d\u201cOur coalition, in short order, will comprise of many states, consumers, mine workers, coal operators, utilities and businesses who are united in opposition to this radical and illegal policy,\u201d he added.In devising its strategy, the group worked closely with the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader whose coal-producing home state also stands to suffer under the regulation. While Mr. McConnell opposes the climate change regulations, his advisers knew that he had little chance of enacting legislation to block them in Congress. Instead, Mr. McConnell has taken the unusual step of reaching out directly to governors and attorneys general, urging them to refuse to submit compliance plans for the regulations, and encouraging a state-by-state rejection of the rules.Mr. Morrisey, whose coal-producing home state is also struggling with the nation\u2019s highest unemployment rate, was chosen as the public face of the suit. But key strategists joining the original planning were Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a former attorney general there, and Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma. Both already had experience suing the Obama administration over major Clean Air Act regulations.An important ally in the effort was the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative advocacy group that pushes policy through state legislatures. Typically, the council\u2019s committees of corporate members will craft a model bill designed to push through policies it supports, such as rolling back environmental regulations.At a July meeting in San Diego, ALEC\u2019s energy committee \u2014 which includes Mr. Duncan, the coal lobbyist who also worked closely with Mr. McConnell on his tactics \u2014 enacted a model bill designed to directly support state attorneys general who legally challenge the climate change plan. According to a person present at that July meeting, the bill would allow states to create funds, which could be funded by corporate donations, to support legal challenges to the climate change rules.While it is not unusual for major corporations to sue the federal government over environmental regulations, people involved in the effort to craft a legal strategy against the climate change rules said the time, labor and coordination of the effort were unusual. That effort reflects the sweeping scope of climate change regulations, which, unless struck down in the Supreme Court, could transform huge sectors of the economy, potentially crippling the coal industry and other industrial sectors whose economic well-being relies on coal.The Obama administration contends that despite the massive scale of the challenges trained against it, the climate change plan is legally sound. \u201cThe final rule is built on a rock-solid legal foundation,\u201d said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the agency.\u201cE.P.A. is using its clear authority under the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for air pollutants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rule is wholly consistent with the law, and we are confident it will withstand any and all legal challenges.\u201dBut Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has worked closely with the group, says that the attorneys general will not back down. \u201cThis rule was more aggressive than any of us could have imagined,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no lack of state attorneys general who would like to put a bullet in this thing.\u201d The rules, a final, stricter version of a plan that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2012 and 2014, assigns each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants. States will be allowed to create their own plans to meet the requirements and will have to submit initial versions of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018.The most aggressive of the regulations requires that by 2030, the nation\u2019s existing power plants must cut emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels, which is an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation.Even as Mr. Obama acknowledged the steep resistance from coal-producing states and industry critics, he said it was up to the United States to adopt tough standards so that other countries like China would feel compelled to take similar steps.But Mr. McConnell made it clear he would do everything in his power to combat the rules, which he said the president had crafted because he was \u201ctired of having to work with the Congress the people elected.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why the administration is now trying to impose these deeply regressive regulations \u2014 regulations that may be illegal, that won\u2019t meaningfully impact the global environment, and that are likely to harm middle- and lower-class Americans most \u2014 by executive fiat,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt represents a triumph of blind ideology over sound policy and honest compassion,\u201d he added.An article on Tuesday about groups who are challenging President Obama\u2019s climate change regulations misspelled the surname of a prominent Washington lobbyist who has worked to devise one of the legal strategies. He is Peter Glaser, not Glazer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Hypocrisy on Iran", "Date": "2015-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhat should be a thoughtful debate has been turned into a vicious battle against Mr. Obama, involving not just the Republicans but Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The unseemly spectacle of lawmakers siding with a foreign leader against their own commander in chief has widened an already dangerous breach between two old allies.Policy considerations aside, what is most striking about the demagoguery is how ahistorical, if not downright hypocritical, it is. Negotiating with adversaries to advance a more stable world has long been a necessity, and Republican presidents have been among its most eager practitioners.Richard Nixon normalized relations with China when it was considered a Communist menace. Ronald Reagan signed a landmark missile agreement with the Soviet Union, which had fomented unrest worldwide and persecuted Jews. The agreement eliminated an entire category of missiles. Mr. Reagan even negotiated with Iran after the Islamic Revolution, selling it arms to use in its struggle with Iraq and using the proceeds to arm Nicaragua\u2019s contra rebels in defiance of Congress.Critics complain that the nuclear deal fails to eradicate all of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, even for peaceful energy production, and provides sanctions relief, including access to $50 billion in Iranian assets frozen in foreign banks.But what these critics do not mention is that the basic bargain Mr. Obama agreed to \u2014 benefits in exchange for nuclear limits \u2014 was endorsed by President George W. Bush and the other major powers in 2006. Though Mr. Bush was certainly opposed to allowing Iran to build a nuclear weapon, the proposal did not demand that Iran totally dismantle its nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities (as critics now do); it instead offered assurances that Iran would have fuel for its civilian energy program and be integrated into the international economy. Two years later, the proposal was further enhanced, but talks with Tehran never went anywhere.Negotiating with enemies is an essential component of statecraft and can be a crucial alternative to war. Even when America was at the height of its powers, its leaders \u2014 including Republicans \u2014 knew that any successful deal would involve some compromise with the other side, not complete capitulation. Yet that is exactly what the Republicans are demanding of Iran today as they lay plans to repudiate Mr. Obama\u2019s hard-won accord in pursuit of some mythical \u201cbetter\u201d deal.The accord has shortcomings, as all do, and there are risks in any decision. But a preponderance of responsible opinion \u2014 the five major powers, the United Nations Security Council, most American nuclear experts and scores of leading American diplomats \u2014 have endorsed the pact as the best way to ensure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.America is stronger when important national security decisions have bipartisan consensus. None of that seems to matter to the accord\u2019s opponents, many of whom never intended to vote for the deal and made clear during congressional hearings last week that facts will not change their minds.Advertisement"}

Though it is privately held, the company releases its financial records each spring. The Economist\u2019s circulation has increased to about 1.6 million in 2015 from around a million in 2006. It largely reaches the kind of affluent, educated people who travel to international conferences on private jets, and its many admirers include the former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg.The impending ownership change is unlikely to settle the debate. A 50 percent stake in The Economist Group, which includes CQ Roll Call, has been put up for sale by the education company Pearson, which recently sold The Financial Times to Nikkei of Japan as part of an effort to streamline its businesses. Pearson is negotiating, according to two people briefed on the matter, with the publication\u2019s current shareholders \u2014 including Exor, the investment company controlled by the Agnelli family, which has declared its interest publicly.Others who had coveted the publication, including Mr. Bloomberg, have not been mentioned as contenders, perhaps because the company has a complex trust system that essentially ensures it cannot be taken over by an owner keen to impose his or her whims.The Economist Group has four kinds of shares: Ordinary ones, for employees, past employees and founding members of the company. \u201cA\u201d shares, held by illustrious names like the Cadburys, Rothschilds and Schroders. \u201cB\u201d shares, which represent about half, are the ones for sale. And trust shares, which control transfer of \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d shares, and are held by trustees who are responsible for ensuring \u201cthe continued independence of the ownership of the company and the editorial independence of The Economist.\u201dIt has, in other words, carefully shielded itself from the free market forces it so vociferously defends. (Mr. Emmott argued that the position was consistent, as The Economist has no objection to private companies managing themselves as they see fit.)The newspaper, founded in 1843, is put together in offices in the heart of London, a short stroll from the Ritz and a slightly longer walk from Buckingham Palace. The newsroom staff declined to move to Canary Wharf, a modern office development favored by financial firms, when its business staff did. Journalists usually either stay for a short period, and find The Economist is not for them, or for years, even decades, Mr. Crook said.Its culture, said Mr. Anderson, who went on to edit Wired magazine, is based on debate. During his tenure, every Monday morning the staff would gather in the editor\u2019s office, to figure out, by means of argument, the leader articles that would form the backbone of the next issue. \u201cIt was the classic Oxford debating society style,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen more of an intellectual meritocracy. It was a classic example of sink or swim. How did people end up with The Economist voice? That\u2019s it right there.\u201dIt has also been shaped, said Mr. Crook, who rose to deputy editor, by the lack of bylines. \u201cThere is a genuine sense that we\u2019re all in it together,\u201d he said. Writers edit, and editors write, which makes each considerate of the other. And writers can contribute on unexpected subjects \u2014 a recent article, headlined \u201cGirlfriend in a Conga,\u201d focused on the popularity of the singer Morrissey in Mexico \u2014 because readers do not associate their names with one topic.It appeals so widely, Mr. Emmott suggested, because it has responded to the spread of the English language, the end of the Cold War, the rise of China and other world economies, all multiplied by the effects of the Internet. It has become, he said \u201cthe house magazine of globalization.\u201dMr. Crook suggested that economy of expression might be the key. \u201cThe main thing\u201d he said, \u201cis not to waste the readers\u2019 time.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the potential sale of The Economist misstated Eric Schmidt\u2019s affiliation with The Economist. Mr. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, is on the publication\u2019s board; he is not a trustee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Stock Market Is So Turbulent", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsLast week, global financial markets were churning, but it really only mattered if you were an oil trader, a Chinese bureaucrat or a hedge fund manager.Now it\u2019s starting to get scary for everyone.What\u2019s fascinating is that there is no clear, simple story about what is different about the outlook now for interest rates, for United States and European corporate profits or for economic growth compared with one week ago, when the S.&P. 500 index was 10 percent higher.Here\u2019s how to make sense of what is a truly global story, stretching from the streets of Shanghai, where stock investing has become a middle-class sport in recent years, to the oil fields of both the Middle East and Middle America, to the hallways of power in the Federal Reserve in Washington.The immediate cause of the outburst of global volatility was China, where the sharp drop in stocks on Monday continued a rout that has been underway \u2014 with periodic pauses because of government interventions \u2014 all summer.The Chinese economy is slowing, and the 38 percent drop in the Shanghai composite index since June 12 is indeed a huge number. There is no question that this giant economy is struggling with a transition from the investment-and-export-led boom of the last generation toward something more sustainable.But a few facts make China\u2019s problems a less than completely satisfying explanation for the turmoil across world markets. The Chinese stock market has risen sharply over the past year as millions of middle-class Chinese citizens took to making investments. Even after its steep drop this summer, the Shanghai index is down less than 1 percent for the year and still up 43 percent from one year ago.In other words, the sell-off in Chinese stocks may not matter much in isolation. But it tells us much about the inability of Chinese leaders to bring the country\u2019s economy in for a soft landing. And that is something scarier.Some of the key evidence for the \u201cthis is about more than China\u201d story comes from other emerging markets, stretching from Malaysia to Mexico, that are also taking it on the chin. Their currencies and stock and bond prices have fallen sharply over the last week. Some of that drop most likely reflects exposure to the Chinese economy. But some of it reflects something bigger.Call this the Taper Tantrum 3.0.The original taper tantrum happened in June 2013. It is a cute name for what occurred when global financial markets collectively went berserk over the realization that the Fed was serious about tapering its program of quantitative easing \u2014 or put more plainly, that the Fed would wind down its injections of money into the financial system over time. There was a second, similar explosion of volatility in October 2014, as the Fed\u2019s intentions to raise interest rates in 2015 became clearer.In effect, the Fed\u2019s easy money policies had led global investors to search for higher-yielding securities, which they found in many faster-growing emerging markets. Money gushed into these countries in search of better returns from 2010 until 2013, driving up asset prices.The turmoil in financial markets has had a particularly big impact of the price of commodities, including oil, the most economically significant commodity of them all.The price of a barrel of oil fell from around $60 in late June to under $40 on Monday. Over time, that will be good news for American and European energy consumers, but there are complex feedback loops that probably make the commodity sell-off both a cause and a result of the broader emerging markets panic.When oil prices first plummeted in the second half of last year, there were widespread forecasts that the price drop would cause oil exploration to shutter around the world, helping keep the market in balance. Instead, American producers have kept up production, keeping supplies high despite lower prices.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Here\u2019s the feedback loop: The slowdown in China and other emerging markets lowers demand. High supplies and weak demand equals lower prices \u2014 which feeds back into weaker economic conditions for energy-producing countries like those in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia.In the background of all of this is a crucial decision looming for the United States Federal Reserve. Fed officials have expressed confidence that the domestic economy is on track and that the time is right to raise interest rates after nearly seven years of keeping them near zero. It could make that move at its policy meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.Fed officials have indicated a determination to base interest rates on what is most appropriate given the state of the American economy and not to overreact to fluctuations in markets. The latest volatility will test that resolve.Futures markets are increasingly betting that the Fed will indeed hold off to assess the damage to the economy, if any, from the latest global financial strains. On Monday, the market priced in a 24 percent chance of a rate increase in September, compared with a 48 percent chance just a week ago.And the value of the dollar on currency markets fell 1.6 percent on Monday (as measured by the dollar index) as investors priced in greater likelihood of the Fed\u2019s keeping rates lower for longer.Commentators have long accused the Fed of overreacting to the latest financial market moves, a complaint that makes Fed officials bristle; they argue they are making their decisions based on measures of the real economy like inflation and employment data. If markets remain volatile heading into the next meeting but economic data remains consistent with recent solid readings, that will make for a tough decision.Of course, it is the Fed\u2019s job to set policy based on where the economy is going, not where it has been. If markets keep falling, that could endanger American growth prospects. On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s job isn\u2019t to try to protect investors from the risks of a downturn.And if the last few days have taught anything, it is that global markets will be poised for a big reaction, no matter what the central bank does.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "False Alarm on a Crisis in China", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorServices, not industry, are driving China\u2019s growth, as has been the case for three full years. This is likely to continue since per capita incomes in China are reaching a level where a growing share of spending is on entertainment, travel and other services rather than on goods.Naysayers question government economic data, continuing to focus on weakness in China\u2019s industrial sector and the extremely slow growth of electric power output. But steel production, for example, is significantly more energy intensive than entertainment, so the demand for electricity has fallen sharply as the structure of the economy has evolved.Assuming that electric power growth is a good proxy for China\u2019s overall economic expansion is like trying to drive a car by looking in the rearview mirror.Some economists watching from abroad believe that the country is in the midst of a financial crisis because of the excessive debt burden it incurred in recent years. But that view is even less well supported. After a very modest two-day depreciation earlier this month, the exchange rate of the renminbi has changed little against the dollar for eight consecutive trading days; capital outflows continue at a moderate, very sustainable pace; bank liquidity remains strong. This does not yet look remotely like a financial crisis.Rather than a financial and economic meltdown, China is experiencing an overdue correction in its equity market. And the connection between China\u2019s equity market and China\u2019s real economy has always been tenuous.By my tallies, from June 2014 to June 2015, prices increased more than 150 percent on the Shanghai exchange, and even more on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen ChiNext board, a Nasdaq-style marketplace. An unusually large part of this run-up was fueled by retail investors who borrowed to buy equities. The market was priced way beyond perfection. Once prices fell even slightly, many of these investors found themselves needing to sell, leading to a sharp market correction.At first, the government unwisely intervened to stem the rout for a time, but the sharp sell-off continued earlier this week. There is likely to be more of the same to come. Even at Tuesday\u2019s much lower prices, the Shenzhen market was trading at a still-lofty 39 times earnings.Despite what many think, not all debt is the same, nor are all equity market slides. There have been many more corrections in both the United States and China than there have been financial crises. Allowing those corrections to take place is part of letting markets determine outcomes, which is a good thing.And that is what the government of China is now doing, both with respect to the exchange rate and belatedly in more recent days, to a surprising extent, with the equity markets. There remain concerns over Chinese real estate and state-owned enterprises. But recent events should be seen as part of the conscious liberalization and rebalancing of the Chinese economy. Even if that means a sell-off in stocks, it is not a sell-off in the fundamentals of the Chinese economy. In fact, this may strengthen those fundamentals by going further down the path to reform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Documents Reveal New York State Agency\u2019s Role in Adirondacks Mining Proposal", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 In 2013, New York voters were asked to consider an unusual constitutional amendment that could allow a private company, NYCO Minerals, to clear the middle of a forest in the Adirondack Mountains and create an open pit for mining.Agency officials wrote to environmental groups urging them to support the proposal. They worked with the resolution\u2019s sponsors in the Legislature to develop the bill\u2019s language. And they asked lawmakers to lobby their colleagues to allow the measure onto the ballot.Board of Elections staffer John Conklin emailed Associated Press reporter Michael Gormley, explaining that the Department of Environmental Conservation asked for changes to two different 2013 constitutional amendments.The conservation department said it did nothing improper. Marc Gerstman, the department\u2019s acting commissioner, said government agencies routinely lobby the Legislature on issues they determine are in the state\u2019s interest, and NYCO\u2019s proposal to mine state land easily met that standard. NYCO, according to the agreement, is not only required to eventually return the 200-acre parcel to the state, but it is also required to give additional land it owns in the Adirondacks to the state.Furthermore, the conservation department said the section of the State Constitution that prohibits state funds from going to aid a private corporation applies only to actions aimed directly at voters to advocate for a position, not lawmakers during the legislative process.Mr. Gerstman acknowledged that the agency worked with the governor\u2019s counsel\u2019s office to achieve ballot language that was \u201cbalanced,\u201d but disputed the notion that the conservation department called the State Board of Elections directly, or made calls on NYCO\u2019s behalf.\u201cWe thought given the overall net benefit to the forest preserve, which was unambiguous, and the ability to have a community retain jobs which are very important in the Adirondacks, that this was a no-brainer from an environmental and human perspective,\u201d Mr. Gerstman said.No matter the motivation, the several thousand pages of emails and other correspondence obtained by Protect the Adirondacks offer unusual insight into how the referendum got onto the ballot, and the lengths to which state officials assisted in that process.NYCO was just the sort of company that the governor wanted to keep in New York. Revitalizing the upstate economy has long been one of the governor\u2019s top priorities and, as of 2011, NYCO employed roughly 150 people at two mines in the Willsboro area, where they excavated wollastonite, a mineral used in the production of plastics, paints and other goods.Peter Goodwin, the president and chief executive of NYCO Minerals during that process, said in an interview that in early 2011, during one of the periodic meetings he would have with various officials from the conservation department, it was telegraphed to him that the \u201cpolitical environment was right\u201d to pursue a constitutional amendment that could allow NYCO to mine on state land near an existing company mine. He said he was told the governor was interested in creating and keeping jobs, and there was interest in continued development in the North Country.In April 2011, Mr. Goodwin met with the conservation department commissioner, Joseph Martens, who had been appointed by Mr. Cuomo just months before the meeting.The state-owned land was protected by the \u201cForever Wild\u201d provision in the State Constitution, which guarantees that New York\u2019s forest preserve lands will not be leased, sold or taken by a corporation without an amendment to the Constitution. It can be a cumbersome process \u2014 two successively elected Legislatures and then voters must give their approval.Peter Goodwin, the chief executive of NYCO Minerals, thanked two senior Department of Environmental Conservation officials for the agency\u2019s support of the proposed constitutional amendment.Changes to the Forever Wild provision are rare; there have been approximately only 15 since 1941. Voters last said yes to such a change in 2009, when the state accepted 10 acres of forest in a trade that gave the power company National Grid six acres for a new power line.William C. Janeway, the current executive director of the Adirondack Council, said its decision was consistent with the council\u2019s principles on land swaps, which states that a land exchange must have a net benefit to the preserve.An even more demonstrative note of appreciation from NYCO came in an email just a few weeks later after the Assembly and the Senate passed the resolution.In June 2013, the resolution to amend the Constitution passed both houses for the second time. The amendment, along with five others including one that asked New Yorkers to approve casino gambling, was headed to the statewide ballot.The department was quick to respond. \u201cWe are very concerned with this language,\u201d Mr. Davies wrote to Mr. Goodwin. \u201cWe are doing what we can on this,\u201d Julia Tighe, the department\u2019s director of legislative affairs, added later.Joseph Martens, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, wrote to Brian Houseal, executive director of the Adirondack Council, urging the group to reconsider its opposition to the proposed amendment.Ultimately, the changes to the successful amendment did not reflect the concerns raised in NYCO\u2019s Aug. 1 email, but the changes did seem to benefit NYCO. Instead of the phrase \u201cmining the land,\u201d the new language had the company \u201cexpanding an existing mine that adjoins the forest preserve land.\u201d\u201cThis was a very unique set of circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Goodwin, who has since retired and, along with his wife, is running an alpaca farm in Tennessee.NYCO conducted exploratory drilling on the land over the winter, and said it was in the process of determining whether to go forward with the new open-pit mine, and the land swap. In an email, a company spokesman defended the amendment process, characterizing the department as the state\u2019s \u201cnegotiating agent.\u201d\u201cIt was essential for NYCO to work with D.E.C. on this proposal because D.E.C. oversees the forest preserve and, realistically, no exchange of forest preserve land could be considered without the agency\u2019s involvement,\u201d the spokesman, John Brodt, said.Peter Bauer, executive director of Protect the Adirondacks, said the coordination between NYCO and the conservation department turned the state into \u201ca de facto lobbying arm for a private corporation.\u201d The agency, he said, \u201cput its hand on the scale at every step of the process to benefit NYCO Minerals.\u201dAn article on Monday about the New York Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s role in a proposal to allow a mining company, NYCO Minerals, to operate on state-owned land in the Adirondacks misidentified the entity to which a NYCO spokesman was referring when he said that the department was acting as someone\u2019s \u201cnegotiating agent.\u201d He was referring to the state\u2019s negotiating agent, not to NYCO\u2019s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Liberal Arts, a Lost Cause?", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTalking HeadWhat does the trend away from liberal arts tell us about America?I don\u2019t think one should get melodramatic about this, but we are drifting toward turning college into a trade school. And that is ultimately harmful. The original ethos of education was that it prepared people for citizenship, for enlightened leadership, enhanced their creativity. There was a tradition going back to Jefferson, who founded the University of Virginia, that a liberal arts education was the core of our democracy. If we lose an educated populace, we\u2019re open for demagogy. We need broadly educated people.Most of the very fine liberal arts schools are going to survive. But some of them are verging more into professional fields. In 15 years, the number of liberal arts colleges might be down to 120 because of the pressure to add more practical offerings. And the closure of small private colleges that morphed out of liberal arts long ago is going to continue.Why are students turning their backs on the liberal arts?The cost of college has soared and students are having to borrow more. These things tend to make the liberal arts look like a luxury. The economics profession has had a severe influence on this. Gary Becker, the University of Chicago economist, used the term \u201chuman capital.\u201d He looked at education as an investment, like buying a machine. He won a Nobel Prize. We\u2019ve got a whole way of thinking about college that focuses on the rate of return. And that dismisses the intangible benefits.Do you see a remedy? I don\u2019t see this turning around any time soon. States are spending less and less on higher education and that pushes up tuition. What matters are the big universities. Private liberal arts colleges are a blip in the ocean. It takes 15 of them to equal one state university.And what about Sweet Briar?Sweet Briar has had to deal with all of these issues. But our problems were compounded by being a single-sex school. Very few young women want to go to a women\u2019s college: 45 or 50 years ago there were 230. Today there are fewer than 50. Sweet Briar has been a rarefied place. One of its attractions was a horseback-riding program.It\u2019s fought this image all along, as sort of a finishing school. The riding program was, to some degree, a recruiting device. When I got on the board they had to build another stable because we\u2019d run out of places to park horses. And if you didn\u2019t stable a horse, you didn\u2019t get the girl.A Virginia judge ruled that alumni can revive Sweet Briar this fall. This was after the board had voted unanimously to close. What was the tipping point for you?We just couldn\u2019t get the enrollment. If you can believe this, we started an engineering and a business program. And we were trying to keep the 25 or 30 academic disciplines we had always offered. We had outstanding bond indebtedness and a $10 million note. We didn\u2019t see a path forward. I don\u2019t know that the new group has a very clear path either. But God bless them. I hope they succeed.Joseph B.

{"Headline": "A Climate Plan Businesses Can Like", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWITH the release of President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, a flood of legal challenges will begin. Already, opponents have denounced the new rule limiting carbon pollution as unconstitutional. Behind the rattling sabers, however, there\u2019s a quieter story worth noticing. Many big players in the electric power industry will gain more with the rule in place than if the courts strike it down.In fact, many power companies have worked with the administration to get the best possible deal, and with states to discuss compliance strategies. Given their financial interests, some of these utilities may even wind up helping the government defend the rule.The plan sends a clear market signal that low-carbon energy will be profitable. Many of the country\u2019s most powerful investor-owned utilities, including MidAmerican, Southern Company and Exelon, have made big investments in low carbon sources like wind, solar or nuclear power. Their decision to do so was driven by a mix of market opportunities, investor preferences, tax credits and state and federal air pollution standards.In the last several years, utilities also have begun shifting away from coal toward cheaper natural gas. What they want now is a clear and predictable federal plan that will help them profit from these investments, and reward them for making more.The president\u2019s plan does just that. It limits carbon pollution at the nation\u2019s oldest and dirtiest power plants and allows them to meet those limits in a variety of ways; for example, by becoming more efficient, operating less often or investing in cleaner energy sources.Any utility that already owns cleaner forms of energy, or hopes to build them, can profit \u2014 whether it is Southern Company constructing new nuclear reactors and steadily expanding its portfolio of renewables, or MidAmerican, a national leader in installed wind power that may look to expand its market.Stand-alone solar and wind companies are expected to publicly back the plan because the demand for their renewable power will only increase.In an era of flat electricity demand, utilities have been hard-pressed to get approval from state regulators to build new power projects. But the plan\u2019s clean-energy incentives offer utilities the opportunity to make investments that will enable state utility commissions to justify rates so utilities can recover their costs.What\u2019s more, knowing there will be new demand for wind and solar energy will encourage investors to build new transmission lines. Meanwhile, utilities like Calpine, which own efficient natural gas plants, will be winners because the plan creates financial incentives to switch from coal to less-polluting gas.Finally, utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric that design innovative ways to reduce energy demand, or offer energy retrofit and appliance rebate programs, also stand to gain, because energy efficiency now will be a valuable commodity.Understanding these behind-the-scenes dynamics makes it clear that much of industry opposition to the rule is really just posturing. In any case, the legal jockeying is only part of the story.Many power companies are fully prepared to implement the rule. And they are well positioned to press their states to help them, for instance by adopting statewide caps on carbon pollution, and allowing polluters to trade credits to let them cut emissions in the most economically efficient way. States could enlarge these markets to lower costs by joining regional trading schemes. Similar trading programs have already proved highly successful in addressing other pollution, like acid rain.The question is whether some utilities will vocally support a rule that is in their financial interest, or remain on the sidelines. Clearly, it would bolster the government\u2019s legal defense for major power companies to reinforce the argument that the new carbon standards are achievable at a reasonable cost without jeopardizing the electricity system\u2019s reliability.And just as it will be important to have supportive states on the government side to counter states that challenge the plan, it will also be crucial to have some industry players there. For conservative judges who may be skeptical of regulation, industry voices can make a big difference.In any event, even companies that oppose the rule will continue to work quietly with the Environmental Protection Agency and the states on implementation. The legal challenges will drag on, and politicians will take their stands. The coal industry will say the sky is falling. But behind the scenes, real work is being done and progress is being made toward a lower carbon future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Economy Is Not Ready for an Interest Rate Increase", "Date": "2015-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Federal Reserve talked up the economy last Wednesday, in a statement that emphasized improvements in employment, housing and consumer spending. Unfortunately, the optimism is misplaced.In 2014, for instance, when bad weather also reduced first-quarter growth, the economy grew at an annual pace well above 4 percent for the next two quarters. In comparison, the economy\u2019s recent performance is not a rebound but rather a resumption of the sluggish growth that has long characterized the economy.If significant or sustained, such increases would be cause for the Fed to raise interest rates. But so far, no such increases have appeared, and, as a result, most working people have not yet recovered all of the lost ground from the recession or raised their living standards.But an increase, however small, would signal that Fed policy makers are basically satisfied with the economy\u2019s performance. Coupled with Congress\u2019s long failure to provide adequate fiscal support to the economy, that message would be a setback for Americans who are still not getting ahead.In recent years, the Fed has generally been good at communicating the reasons for its actions. If it really intends to move ahead soon with interest-rate increases, it needs to explain how an economy in which wages are stagnating is as good as it gets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Race to Escape Risk in Once-Booming Emerging-Market Bonds", "Date": "2015-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe large mutual funds that helped fuel rapid growth in developing countries have begun hastily retreating from those investments, contributing to the recent sharp decline in global markets.In the last week alone, investors pulled $2.5 billion from emerging-market bond funds, the largest withdrawal since January 2014.The world\u2019s fastest-growing economies \u2014 led by China \u2014 have been propelled by soaring commodity prices, robust currencies and access to cheap loans, primarily through the sale of high-yield, high-risk bonds. But China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency has set off a chain reaction of panicked selling around the world that contributed to the biggest one-week loss on Wall Street since 2011, sending the Dow Jones industrial average into correction territory (10 percent below its recent peak). The index was down 531 points on Friday and nearly 6 percent for the week.The currency devaluation increased concerns that growth in China was slowing and that other countries might follow with their own devaluations. The notion unnerved bond investors, who began to retreat out of fear they would not be repaid. General uneasiness about a global economic slowdown spread to stocks, which many have believed to be overvalued and due for a decline.\u201cThe growth rates for many of these countries were vastly overstated,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who has studied the impact of foreign capital flows in developing economies. \u201cIt was all very unsustainable.\u201dThe selling spree has raised concerns among regulators and economists about a broader contagion that could make it difficult for individual investors to withdraw money from their mutual funds.While these funds do not use borrowed money, as did the banks that failed during the mortgage crisis, they have invested large sums in a wide variety of high-yielding bonds and bank loans that are not easy to sell \u2014 especially in a bear market.If investors ask to be repaid all at once \u2014 as happened in 2008 \u2014 a run-on-the-bank scenario could unfold because funds would have difficulty meeting the demands of people wanting their cash back.During previous global investment booms and busts, large commercial banks were the dominant overseas lenders. These institutions were just as prone to making bad lending decisions as bond investors, but they also tended to have longer-term relationships with their borrowers and were less likely to cut and run.Because large global banks suffered significant losses during the financial crisis and were forced to rein in their lending, more nimble \u2014 and fickle \u2014 bond investors stepped in.What struck the authors most was that this growth was coming not from global banks but from American mutual funds buying the bonds of emerging-market issuers.Large fund companies like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Pimco and have been inundated with money from investors eager to invest in the high-yielding bonds of emerging-market corporations and countries.One of the more extreme cases of this bond market frenzy was Mongolia. In 2012, with expectations high that the relatively tiny economy would reap the benefits from China\u2019s ceaseless appetite for raw materials, the government sold $1.5 billion worth of bonds, with demand from investors reaching $10 billion.That meant, in effect, that the country was in a position to borrow an amount twice the size of its $4 billion gross domestic product.Three years later, the International Monetary Fund is warning that Mongolia may not be able to make good on these loans \u2014 14 percent of which are owned by Franklin Templeton, according to Bloomberg data \u2014 and the yields have shot up to about 9 percent from 4 percent.Of course, a Mongolian bond deal gone bust does not spell disaster. But it illustrates the risks global mutual fund investors were willing to take on in their desire to load up on high-yielding securities.Now the reverse is occurring, led by a slowing Chinese economy, and as that money heads for safety, local currencies are plunging.For example, there has been explosive growth in so-called unconstrained bond funds, which operate somewhat like a hedge fund, with a mandate to buy any security in any part of the world.According to Morningstar, these funds have increased to $154 billion from $9 billion in 2009, with many of them invested in emerging-market bonds. Because these funds tend to take on more risk and buy securities that are harder to sell \u2014 such as emerging-market bonds \u2014 the fear is that the managers of these funds will not be able to provide cash to investors when they demand it.Exchange-traded funds, a type of mutual fund that trades like a stock and promises instant liquidity, have also been large investors in emerging markets.What worries many regulators and economists is how much mutual fund money is now tied up in these hard-to-sell bonds \u2014 an amount that far exceeds the exposure investors had to these markets in earlier emerging-market crises.EPFR Global, a fund-tracking company, calculates that global bond funds have allocated 16 percent of their holdings to emerging-market bonds. Relative to the 2.5 percent recommended benchmark for these securities suggested by the Barclays aggregate bond index, that is a very aggressive bet.Ricardo Adrogue, an emerging-markets-debt investor at Babson Capital in Boston, says it is the extreme declines in the currencies of Malaysia, Mexico, Russia and Turkey that worry him \u2014 not so much the Chinese devaluation.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I want out,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to see the bottom with all these depreciating currencies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Providence, R.I., Is Building on a Highway\u2019s Footprint", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 A real estate initiative involving 19 acres of vacant land made available after the relocation of Interstate 195 is attracting interest from developers after a sluggish start.Most of the new parcels became ready for development last year, after considerable infrastructure work was completed in the newly formed I-195 Redevelopment District. Among other things, the state laid new underground power lines and realigned streets to attract developers.Now three projects are going forward on the area called LINK land, named for the way that its development will reunite sections of the city formerly cut off by the old highway. And other projects have been proposed, among them a multimillion-dollar life sciences complex on five acres and a riverfront stadium for the Triple A Pawtucket Red Sox baseball team.The first project, at least in terms of a groundbreaking, was for Johnson & Wales University, which four months ago began building a three-story, 71,000-square-foot engineering and academic center on one of two parcels the college bought from the state for $3.9 million. The $40 million project, on the west side of the Providence River, is scheduled to be completed in 2016 and will house the university\u2019s new biology program and its School for Engineering and Design.The university, which has 10,000 undergraduates enrolled at its location here, bought 1.7 acres as soon as the former highway land became available, John J. Bowen, the university\u2019s chancellor, said. Its plans for the second parcel will depend on what happens with the rest of the I-195 land, he said.In the same vicinity as that project, Dallas builders are planning to develop suite-style housing for students and faculty on a 1.25-acre parcel that the companies agreed to buy last year for $2.7 million. Preliminary plans by the Lincoln Property Company and its sister entity, Phoenix Property Company, call for a six-story building that can house 400 to 500 residents, with 18,000 square feet of retail space on the first floor.Then, across the Providence River, on the east side of the city, a local development company is planning a $20 million mixed-use project with 4,500 square feet of retail space, rental housing and office space. Royal Oaks Realty, headed by Richard P. Baccari II, agreed to buy the site for $750,000 in January. It is about one-third of an acre and is strategically situated at the base of the Fox Point neighborhood.The land freed up by the relocation of I-195 is creating a \u201cwhole new neighborhood\u201d at the base of Fox Point, which is close to India Point Park on the waterfront, Mr. Baccari said. He called being able to develop a high-density project in such a highly visible location a \u201cphenomenal opportunity.\u201dJoseph Azrack, chairman of the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission, an authority created by Rhode Island to market the former highway land and to oversee its development in a way that generates economic activity for the state, said he would be surprised if \u201cwe didn\u2019t have commitments for all of our land within the next five years.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on a mission to create more high-wage jobs in Rhode Island,\u201d the governor said.Additionally, the state worked closely with the city\u2019s newly elected mayor, Jorge O. Elorza, to create a tax stabilization agreement for developers interested in the I-195 land. The lack of a standard agreement, which provides predictability and stability to developers, was discouraging developers submitting proposals from coming to the fore, Mr. Azrack and others said. But now, with the agreement in place, and word getting out to developers about the new incentives, more proposals for the land are coming in, he said.For example, a plan was presented to the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission two months ago by Wexford Science & Technology of Baltimore and CV Properties of Boston to create a life sciences complex on five acres. Hailed by Ms. Raimondo as just the sort of innovative, job-creating proposal she wanted to see, the complex would include research laboratories, a hotel, housing and retail space.A subsidiary of BioMed Realty Trust, Wexford specializes in creating research parks near universities. CV Properties is converting an old power station here into a nursing education center for the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College. Brown University will also open administrative offices in the building. That project, the South Street Power Station project, is being financed by Wexford, which has developed research parks that include Philadelphia\u2019s University City Science Center and the University of Maryland BioPark.The proposed complex here would cost $400 million to $500 million to develop, according to Richard Galvin, CV Properties\u2019 president and founder. If all goes as planned \u2014 the proposal still has to be approved by the I-195 commission \u2014 there could be a groundbreaking next year, he said.Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Wexford, said the company was eager to proceed if the commission believed the project was good for Providence.He and Mr. Galvin said the city and state\u2019s new political leadership had energized the development atmosphere, creating excitement about the potential for the I-195 land.One of the most-talked-about and contentious proposals is the pitch by new owners of the Pawtucket Red Sox to build a stadium on the west side of the city, near where the life sciences complex has been proposed. It is drawing criticism because it would mean the elimination of McCoy Stadium in nearby Pawtucket, a funky ballpark that has been the team\u2019s longtime home, and would require a degree of public financing, which many Rhode Islanders oppose.An initial financing plan proposed by the owners, a group that includes Larry Lucchino, Red Sox chief executive, asked too much of the state\u2019s taxpayers; lawmakers rejected it this year. But the owners are reworking their numbers and still want to build a new home for the Pawtucket team in the I-195 District, saying they believe that investing in a new stadium would be more cost-efficient than refurbishing McCoy, said Charles Steinberg, a Red Sox executive vice president.Mr. Steinberg has been visiting senior centers, libraries and other forums throughout the state this summer to listen to taxpayers and to explain the stadium plan.\u201cThere have been and continue to be discussions on this subject,\u201d said Stefan Pryor, the state\u2019s new commerce secretary.\u201cWe believe this land could be one of the drivers of Rhode Island\u2019s future economy,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe should not underestimate its potential.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture with this article omitted a credit. The rendering of the pedestrian bridge was by inForm Studio.An article on the Square Feet page on Aug. 19 about redevelopment of land in Providence, R.I., that was formerly occupied by an interstate highway paraphrased incorrectly a comment by Joseph Azrack, chairman of the I-95 Redevelopment District Commission. He said he would be surprised if the commission did not have commitments for all of its land within five years \u2014 not that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d be surprised if that were the case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Petrobras Oil Scandal Leaves Brazilians Lamenting a Lost Dream", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlberto Youssef, a convicted money launderer and former bon vivant, sat in a Brazilian jail cell in March of last year, getting ready to tell his lawyers a story. It was about an elaborate bribery scheme involving Petrobras, the government-controlled oil giant. He opened with a dire prediction.\u201cGuys,\u201d Mr. Youssef said, \u201cif I speak, the republic is going to fall.\u201dTo those lawyers, Tracy Reinaldet and Adriano Bretas, who recently recounted the conversation, this sounded a tad melodramatic. But then Mr. Youssef took a piece of paper and started writing the names of participants in what would soon become known as the Petrobras scandal. Mr. Reinaldet looked at the names and asked, not for the last time that day, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cWe were shocked,\u201d he recalled, sitting in a conference room in his law office in downtown Curitiba, the capital of the southern state of Paran\u00e1, one morning in June. \u201cIt was kind of like, in Brazil, we know that corruption is a monster. But we never really see the monster. This was like seeing the monster.\u201dWhat Mr. Youssef described to his lawyers, and then to prosecutors after he signed a plea agreement last year, is a fraud that has destabilized the country\u2019s political system, helped tilt the economy into recession and left thousands unemployed. It has all but devastated Brazil\u2019s status as an up-and-comer on the world stage.The Petrobras scandal would read as pure tragedy were it not filled with a cast of Hollywood-ready characters and their lavish props. The latter include a huge inventory of gifts \u2014 Rolex watches, $3,000 bottles of wine, yachts, helicopters and prostitutes. There were also staggering sums of money, most of it flowing through a network of phantom corporations, some of it hand-delivered by an elderly gentleman who flew around the world with bricks of cash, shrink-wrapped and strapped beneath thigh-high socks and a Spanx-like vest.At the core of the scandal is an old-fashioned kickback scheme. Starting in 2004, according to prosecutors, a small number of top Petrobras officials colluded with a cartel of companies to overcharge the oil company for construction and service work. The cartel would decide which of its member companies would win a contract to, for instance, service an oil rig or build part of a refinery. This fake competition was overseen by Petrobras confederates, who were rewarded with bribes. They kept some of the money but shared much of it with political figures. (The company, while publicly traded, is 51 percent government-owned, and more than a few Petrobras executives owe their jobs to elected officials.)What has stunned Brazilians isn\u2019t the novelty of this fraud but its epic scale. The first of many national gasps was emitted in December when a former Petrobras employee named Pedro Barusco pledged to give back every cent of his ill-gotten gains \u2014 all $100 million.It was just the beginning. Mr. Barusco told authorities in February that the ruling Workers Party had pocketed up to $200 million over the years, money that was supposedly used to finance political campaigns.To date, 117 indictments have been issued, five politicians have been arrested, and criminal cases have been brought against 13 companies. Petrobras officials have pegged the total of all bribes at nearly $3 billion, a figure that makes the scandal at FIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body, seem like the work of amateurs.If you don\u2019t live in Brazil, the Petrobras mess has probably registered, to the extent that it has registered at all, as an esoteric swindle perpetrated by people and corporations whose names you don\u2019t recognize. In Brazil, it has convulsed the country with fury and a stinging sense of betrayal.In the last decade, Brazil seemed to be on the verge of the kind of sustainable economic boom that its leaders had predicted for years. Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predecessor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, had boldly predicted Brazil would rise to greatness in the 21st century, a forecast that seemed entirely plausible when, in 2010, the country\u2019s economy expanded at the rate of 7.5 percent, its greatest performance in 24 years. Brazil, along with China, India and Russia, was regarded as among the world\u2019s most promising emerging markets.Oil was central to Brazil\u2019s strategy, and that gave Petrobras a leading role in the nation\u2019s growing influence \u2014 and pride of place. At one time it was the sixth-largest company in the world by market capitalization and accounted for roughly 10 percent of Brazil\u2019s gross domestic product. For perspective, Apple, which has twice Petrobras\u2019s peak market cap, represents 0.5 percent of the United States\u2019 gross domestic product.The company has lost more than half its value in the last year, about $70 billion in market cap. Part of that stems from the worldwide decline in oil prices, but none of the company\u2019s rivals have been punished as severely. That plunge has had repercussions for investors worldwide. Petrobras had been a favorite investment for big emerging-market bond funds sold to United States investors, for instance.All of this has provoked something that transcends outrage. Brazilians are in the midst of an identity crisis. Much of Brazil\u2019s recently acquired cachet looks as if it was the product of fraud, and for an added touch of humiliation, a fraud cooked up at a company long regarded as an emblem of Brazil\u2019s success and aspirations.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my countrymen so angry,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political science professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. \u201cWe have this sense that the dream is over.\u201dBrazilians have a saying when the rich and powerful are arrested: \u201cIt always ends with a pizza party.\u201d The words, invariably uttered with disgust and resignation, are meant to suggest that the justice system is rigged in favor of the elites. The accused are said to avoid prison and then celebrate by ordering pizza.If any good has come from the Petrobras debacle it is the flickering sense that this time could be different. Part of the reason is the work of Judge S\u00e9rgio Moro, who is overseeing the investigation, officially known as Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash. In Brazil, judges have wide latitude to define both the direction and scope of criminal inquiries, and Judge Moro\u2019s willingness to pursue even the eminent and influential has made him a folk hero. During a recent visit to the courthouse where he presides in Curitiba, ribbons of yellow and green, the national colors, were tied around trees, quiet expressions of solidarity and support.Another source of public optimism can be found on the eighth floor of an office building a few miles away, in rooms that could pass for a low-budget telemarketing operation. This is home to the team of nine prosecutors working on Lava Jato, as everyone here calls it.The lead prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, is 35 and has a degree from Harvard Law School. A prodigy of sorts, he became a prosecutor at 22, and joined Brazil\u2019s anticorruption task force three years later.The prosecutors\u2019 investigation has its origins 670 miles north of Curitiba, in Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, courtesy of a peculiar stroke of luck.\u201cYou needed a lot of improbable factors aligned for this case to begin,\u201d Mr. Dallagnol said, sitting at a conference table one afternoon. \u201cIt was like the gods giving us a window of opportunity.\u201dIn 2012, the federal police were conducting a money-laundering investigation, which included surveillance of the owner of the Tower Gas Station. (This undistinguished institution once housed a carwash, since closed, which gave the investigation its name.) An officer on a wiretapped conversation realized that he was listening to Alberto Youssef.\u201cYoussef had been a pilot for many years, and the cop was once an air traffic controller,\u201d said Mr. Reinaldet, Mr. Youssef\u2019s lawyer. \u201cAnd the cop, he said to himself, \u2018I know this guy.\u2019 Pretty soon, they were tapping Youssef\u2019s cellphone.\u201dMore than a few federal officers would have recognized Mr. Youssef\u2019s voice. By then, he had been arrested at least five times, in connection with crimes as varied as smuggling electronics and embezzlement. But amazingly, Mr. Youssef had spent little more than 15 months in prison. He kept signing plea agreements, spouting information and names in exchange for reduced sentences.You might think a reputation as a serial informant would eventually impinge on his criminal opportunities, but he apparently has enough charisma and connections to disarm just about anyone. That includes people he has already helped land in prison. When a lawmaker at a Brazilian congressional hearing in May asked Nelma Kodama, who had been sentenced to 18 years for her role in Lava Jato, about her relationship with Mr. Youssef, she broke out into \u201cBeloved Lover,\u201d a popular 1970s-era love song.Mr. Youssef was raised in straitened circumstances in Londrina, a town in Paran\u00e1, and as a teenager he helped his mother at a food concession at a local airport. It was there that he was befriended by Jos\u00e9 Janene, a businessman, pilot and future member of Congress.After earning his license to fly, Mr. Youssef smuggled expensive electronics into Brazil from Paraguay, where taxes were much lower. He graduated to the higher-margin business of money laundering. In late 2006, he became part of the Petrobras bribery scheme. He later told Judge Moro and prosecutors that his involvement had been at the invitation of Mr. Janene, who died in 2010.The big break in the Petrobras case came when surveillance discovered an email from Mr. Youssef describing a Range Rover purchased for a Petrobras executive named Paulo Roberto Costa. From 2004 to 2012, Mr. Costa was Petrobras\u2019s director of supply, a job that put him in the ideal position to approve major contracts. The four-wheeled gift led, eventually, to a warrant to search Mr. Costa\u2019s office and to his arrest. He became the first Lava Jato insider to talk.Soon after, Mr. Youssef decided to yet again turn state\u2019s evidence. With two leading-role cooperators, prosecutors quickly realized, as Mr. Dallagnol put it, \u201cwe had a case that was 100 times bigger\u201d than their original investigation.As one of the world\u2019s largest oil companies, Petrobras spends more than $20 billion a year expanding its capacity, building new plants and servicing facilities. That means huge sums of money are spent on a variety of work, much of it subcontracted to companies that have long fought one another for the business.But about a decade ago, according to prosecutors, these companies stopped competing and started to collaborate. They formed a cartel and decided, in advance, which of them would win a particular deal. A charade competition was orchestrated, and the anointed winner could charge vastly more than it would in a free market.The cartel called itself \u201cthe club,\u201d according to depositions and documents submitted to the court. It had 16 members by 2006, including blue-chip behemoths like Odebrecht and Camargo Corr\u00eaa. They often met in the offices of a S\u00e3o Paulo-based engineering company called UTC Engenharia, occasionally summoned via a text message from UTC\u2019s owner, Ricardo Pessoa. (Mr. Pessoa has since become a cooperating witness and is under house arrest.)A document obtained by prosecutors laid out what it called the \u201crules of the game.\u201d The trumped-up bidding process was labeled a \u201csports tournament,\u201d with an assortment of rounds and a \u201ctrophy.\u201d There was a no-sore-loser codicil, too: \u201cThe teams that participate in a round should honor the rules that have been agreed on, even when they are not the winner.\u201dClub members were soon landing all major Petrobras contracts, with an assist from Petrobras insiders like Mr. Costa and Jorge Zelada, the director of the company\u2019s international division, who was arrested in July. From 1 to 5 percent of the value of a given contract was diverted to those on the receiving end of the scheme, a group that included 50 politicians from six parties, according to prosecutors.Money from cartel members took a circuitous route to politicians\u2019 pockets, passing through ghost corporations whose owners made bribes look like consulting fees. They kept a small percentage for their efforts and then passed funds on to one of a handful of doleiros \u2014 the word translates, imperfectly, as money changers \u2014 who shuffled funds in the scheme. The doleiros, among them Mr. Youssef, would keep a cut, spreading the bulk around to politicians and accomplices.Enter Rafael Lopez, the money mule. He took hundreds of trips, according to his lawyer, Andr\u00e9 Pontarolli, with portable fortunes cinched under his clothing. (\u201cFive hundred thousand euros was his record,\u201d Mr. Pontarolli said.) He wore the sort of socks favored by soccer players, and, when the haul was especially large, an orthopedic undershirt.Mr. Youssef became a public face of Lava Jato, helping move $444 million to foreign bank accounts in more than 3,500 transactions from 2011 to 2014 alone. This yielded enough cash for Mr. Youssef to acquire luxury cars, homes and a number of hotels. But the work was tedious, stressful and infuriating. Much of his time was spent nudging executives for bribes that were late, or placating politicians asking variations of \u201cWhere\u2019s my money?\u201d It was a nightmare of logistics and diplomacy in a realm of big egos and outstretched palms.In an obscenity-filled conversation that the police secretly taped in 2013, Mr. Youssef vented his frustrations to a construction company executive: \u201cNo one here knows how to do the math!\u201dThe land near Itabora\u00ed, an hour\u2019s drive northeast of Rio de Janeiro, was once known for its orange groves, but it became a boomtown when Petrobras broke ground on an immense refinery and petrochemical plant called Comperj six years ago.Today, Itabora\u00ed looks as if it was hit with the magic wand of prosperity by a wizard who had second thoughts. New office buildings and high-end hotels sit empty and covered in dirt. There\u2019s a nearly barren field where a federal technical school was supposed to open. Billboards along the winding road to Comperj, which is a mile or so outside town, are blank, except for an ad for a company that removes industrial equipment.No one can say exactly how much the kickback scheme cost Petrobras itself \u2014 the prosecutors assume that if companies were willing to pay $2 billion in bribes, it had to be at least that much \u2014 but the broader losses to the country can be seen in places like Itabora\u00ed.Some 20,000 workers flocked to the area when Petrobras started building Comperj, hoping to land jobs for a project originally estimated to cost $6.1 billion, according to a report in O Globo that cited internal Petrobras documents. (A state audit later put the figure closer to $50 billion, citing delays, cost overruns and reckless management.) But as Lava Jato came to light, Petrobras ceased construction.Thousands of men are now jobless. One of them, Jucelio Nascimento, had just left an employment agency one morning in June and was leaning against a nearby wall.\u201cI wanted to look the guy in the eye and ask, \u2018Is there work?\u2019 \u201d he said, through a translator. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of waiting.\u201dClad in a red-and-white soccer jersey, Mr. Nascimento said he moved here last summer and found work doing maintenance on pipes, earning 2,600 reais a month \u2014 then worth about $1,150, a better-than-decent wage in this country. But Lava Jato happened, and one day his supervisor showed up to say everyone was laid off, the supervisor included. Since then, to save money, Mr. Nascimento has spent most nights in his car.Petrobras officials who illegally enriched themselves were, of course, bounced from the company and into the justice system. There is also a new C.E.O., who took over in February, and many new faces in upper echelons, part of a campaign to prove that Petrobras understands the gravity of this crisis and will ensure it never happens again.The job of changing the company culture has fallen to Jo\u00e3o Elek, Petrobras\u2019s newly appointed head of compliance. He says that for years, nobody questioned top-tier managers, even if they approved transactions that seemed odd. A more robust whistle-blower program is also being established with an outside firm.\u201cIf someone has a suspicion that their boss isn\u2019t capable, that\u2019s enough for an investigation,\u201d Mr. Elek said. \u201cThe boss has good relations with a politician, with God, with the pope \u2014 we don\u2019t care.\u201dThere was no mention, however, of efforts to alter the decades-long connection between the political class and the corner offices of Petrobras. The company employs many highly respected engineers and managers, but for years, critics argue, it has also been a place for politicians to park friends and allies. (Paulo Roberto Costa was appointed to his job, for instance, by members of the Progressive Party.) Proceeds from Lava Jato were spent on campaigns, according to court documents; by officials of the Workers Party, to which President Rousseff belongs; and other parties in her coalition.\u201cThis crisis goes to the heart of Brazilian state capitalism, the blurring of lines between state economic policies and state benefactors,\u201d said Matthew M. Taylor of the American University School of International Service. \u201cWhat is being demonstrated is the cost of the intertwined relationship between business and the state, and the types of corruption that can lead to.\u201dIt\u2019s a relationship that goes back hundreds of years. When Mr. Costa decided last year that he needed to cut a deal with prosecutors, he opened his first interview with a bit of historical context.\u201cHe sat at a table,\u201d recalled Mr. Dallagnol, the prosecutor, \u201cand he said, \u2018What I\u2019m going to tell you is a story that began in 1808, when the royal family of Portugal came to Brazil and they were guests in the house of a slave trafficker.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Costa was talking about the man who would become King Jo\u00e3o VI, who fled Europe after Napoleon\u2019s troops invaded.\u201cHis point was, all the interchange between the public and private worlds in Brazil began a long time ago,\u201d Mr. Dallagnol said. \u201cAt the time I was thinking, tell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Dallagnol frames this paradox in the starkest possible terms: \u201cIf you look at studies of corruption, you see that it actually kills. With money we lose here, we could spend three times as much on public health. We could multiply the amount spent on education. We could lift 10 million Brazilians out of poverty.\u201dIt takes surprisingly few insiders to pull off such schemes. Judge Moro and the prosecutors have officially described Petrobras as a victim, citing its immense financial losses and the small number of conspirators, a point Mr. Elek was quick to reiterate. \u201cThere are 86,000 people in this company,\u201d he said, \u201cand an insignificant percent of them caused this problem.\u201d\u201cFor Petrobras to say, \u2018We\u2019re the victims,\u2019 when their executives were perpetrating this scheme suggests that they haven\u2019t learned their lesson,\u201d said Jeremy A. Lieberman of the Pomerantz law firm, which has been appointed lead counsel in the case. \u201cThis is not just an incident of a few rotten apples on an otherwise pristine tree.\u201dFor all of its malign effects, Lava Jato has underscored that Brazil has a robust and independent group of federal police officers, judges and prosecutors, a rarity in nations plagued by corruption. Last month, for instance, the police searched the home of Fernando Collor, a former president and current senator, leaving with a Ferrari, a Lamborghini and a Porsche. (Mr. Collor has not been charged and denies involvement in Lava Jato.)Mr. Dallagnol and another prosecutor flew to Washington a few months ago to visit officials in the Justice Department, hoping to interest the United States in lending a hand. He says that he and his team could, if unhindered, investigate Lava Jato for years.Still, does he expect this case to end with a pizza party? You might expect Mr. Dallagnol to scoff at the prospect, but he knows the system too well.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict,\u201d he said. \u201cStatistically, when you have cases against the rich and powerful, things tend to end with pizza. We have no illusions. No aspirations to be superheroes. We are only a group of guys determined to do our best.\u201dOne person who will be celebrating before too long is Alberto Youssef. Stress and jail have turned his hair gray, slimmed him down by 40 pounds and landed him last year in the hospital with a heart attack. His wife divorced him and he is said to be destitute. His days as a nexus of cash and gifts are over.But Judge Moro determined that his assistance had been so helpful that he was given the minimum sentence allowed in his plea agreement. With the time he has already served, he will be free by the beginning of 2017.Catherine Osborn contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Aren\u2019t India\u2019s Women Working?", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Usually, economic growth in lower-middle-income countries creates more jobs for women. But as India\u2019s economy grew at an average of 7 percent between 2004 and 2011, its female labor force participation fell by seven percentage points, to 24 percent from 31 percent. Despite rapidly increasing educational attainment for girls and declining fertility, the International Labor Organization in 2013 ranked India 11th from the bottom in the world in female labor-force participation.Research shows why this matters: Working, and the control of assets it allows, lowers rates of domestic violence and increases women\u2019s decision-making in the household. And an economy where all the most able citizens can enter the labor force is more efficient and grows faster.For India\u2019s government to maintain the country\u2019s progress into the ranks of middle-income countries, it needs to understand why female labor force participation is falling, and develop an effective policy response.Data shows a complex and puzzling picture: Women are becoming more educated but, simultaneously, the positive labor market effects typically associated with higher education are declining.It\u2019s not that women don\u2019t want to work. Our analysis of data from India\u2019s latest labor survey shows that over a third of women engaged primarily in housework say they would like a job, with that number rising to close to half among the most educated women in rural India.Much of the reason they don\u2019t work appears to lie in the persistence of India\u2019s traditional gender norms, which seek to ensure \u201cpurity\u201d of women by protecting them from men other than their husbands and restrict mobility outside their homes.Home-based wage work or entrepreneurship, even when it exists, rarely transforms and liberates the worker. In our work with young women targeted by vocational training programs in rural India, we have witnessed men refusing to allow their daughters, wives and daughters-in-law to leave the village for training and subsequent job placements. Trainers, whose pay depends on employment outcomes of their trainees, are reluctant to work with women who may be more likely to refuse job placements. In urban India, the jobs are geographically closer but women struggle with lack of access to traditional male-dominated job networks.So, women often end up in lower-paid and less-responsible positions than their abilities would otherwise allow them \u2013 which, in turn, makes it less likely that they will choose to work at all, especially as household incomes rise and they don\u2019t absolutely have to work to survive.This picture may seem daunting. Yet seemingly immutable norms can crumble when labor markets begin to properly value women\u2019s work. The garment industry in neighboring Bangladesh accounts for over 75 percent of national export earnings and, strikingly, nearly 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s four million garment-sector workers are women. The explosive growth of that industry during the last 30 years caused a surge in large-scale female labor force participation. It also delayed marriage age and caused parents to invest more in their daughters\u2019 education. Those changes, in turn, very likely reinforced Bangladesh\u2019s strong growth record in the garment sector.In India, in professional sectors where there has been sharp expansion, and where working conditions are clearly good, women have done very well. One example is financial services: While only one in 10 Indian companies are led by women, more than half of them are in the financial sector. Today, women head both the top public and private banks in India.Another example is India\u2019s aviation sector, which positioned itself early on as a female-friendly profession. Today, 11.7 percent of India\u2019s 5,100 pilots are women, versus 3 percent worldwide.These successes, though, represent a few thousand women in a country of hundreds of millions. India needs policies that will create a rapid and widespread demand for women\u2019s work similar to what happened in Bangladesh. In the absence of a fast-growing manufacturing sector that creates jobs for women, the answer for India may be expanding gender quotas in the labor market.India has already successfully used such quotas in local elections. Research shows that in places with quotas, more women ran for office and more women won, even after the quotas were no longer in place. The quotas raised parents\u2019 aspirations for their daughters, and the girls\u2019 aspirations for themselves. The increase in female elected leaders also resulted in better outcomes for women overall: More funds were spent on public goods and services that benefit women, and women were more likely to speak out about acts of violence. The economy benefited too, as, more women took out business loans in villages that had a quota.India\u2019s other big experiment in gender quotas, starting in the 1980s, was with female teachers in schools. Again, using data from India\u2019s labor surveys, we find that education is the largest sector employing women in urban areas and the largest, except for agriculture, in rural areas. Introducing, and rigorously evaluating, quotas in other sectors that are accessible to young educated women and that offer them an attractive career in a safe workplace is a promising next step.Moreover, to ensure that the supply of able and trained women meets the new demand, the establishment of quotas needs to be supported by safe and effective job training and placement programs.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Independence Day speech last year emphasized the need to transform India\u2019s gender norms. Little, though, has changed in the year since.What is needed is obvious: Mr. Modi and his advisers should make wider use of the policy tools already available, including quotas and training, to ensure that all of India\u2019s women have the opportunity to undertake rewarding work \u2014 work that will allow them to determine the course of their own lives, those of their families and that of their country.Rohini Pande is a professor of public policy and co-director of the Evidence for Policy Design Initiative at Harvard, where Charity Troyer Moore directs the India program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Civil War of Words", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 CONVENTIONAL wisdom says the best way to ruin a friendship is to lend money to someone. Does that make the euro the worst idea the architects of the European Union ever had?Until recently I\u2019d have said don\u2019t rush: The quarrels among the union\u2019s 28 member-states over the Greek debt crisis have actually been helpful, I believed. They generated a new frankness in the sometimes all-too-consensual bloc. But what is happening now is going beyond healthy ventilation. It is starting to smell in Europe.Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former Obama State Department official, may have been exaggerating slightly when she said that Europe was facing a \u201ccivil war\u201d without physical violence. But what is true is that, suddenly, after 60 years of movement toward closer union, we in Europe are confronting an unsettling feeling we never wanted to know again: how easy it is for countries to fall away from one another, and where that falling away can ultimately lead.There are two opposing narratives in this feud, two closed systems in which one side is completely right and the other is always the culprit. These aren\u2019t just dry political arguments, either, but emotional tales laden with pride, prejudice, stubbornness and ideology.On one side is the tale of Germany destroying Europe\u2019s democracy, as told by Europe\u2019s left and heated up by numerous American commentators.We\u2019re told that the current mess has one simple driver: self-righteous, rules-obsessed Germans. After Greece joined the eurozone in 2001, German banks began lending excessively to its citizens and businesses, and these Greeks spent the money on German cars and machinery.In Germany, producers started to love the euro: It filled their order books, because German goods became much more competitive than in the days of the mark. But when Greece approached bankruptcy in 2010, the Germans helped out merely to salvage their own banks. They, not the Greek citizens, benefited most from the bailout. Moreover, the austerity measures forced upon Greece by Germany wrecked its economy, leaving 25 percent unemployment.When the Greeks held a referendum, demanding to end this madness, Germany responded by blackmailing them: Accept an even tougher austerity program or leave the euro. The same Germany that had its debt written off after World War II is willing to smother Europe\u2019s south unless it bends to Berlin\u2019s will. The European Union as an economic Fourth Reich? Europeans, resist!That\u2019s one story line. The other is a tale of Greece driving the eurozone to ruin, as told by Europe\u2019s right and trumpeted by northern European commentators.The debt crisis, they say, is a direct result of Greece\u2019s prolonged political incompetence. Athens cooked its books in order to enter the eurozone and was rewarded with the opportunity to borrow money at 5 percent interest, compared with 18 percent during the times of the drachma. But instead of investing the cheap money, the Greeks happily spent it.At around the same time, Germany introduced harsh cuts to its social benefits and liberalized its labor market. This, together with wage restraints, is what made German goods competitive.When Greece faced default, Germany helped mobilize emergency loans worth 120 billion euros, even though the European Union treaty explicitly forbids bailouts. In addition to this generosity, foreign investors agreed to a haircut of 105 billion euros.This, and careful budget cuts in Athens, began to bear fruit. In 2014 the Greek budget showed a slight surplus, leaving aside interest payments.Then the leftist Syriza government came to power. It, not Germany, was the blackmailer, threatening to disrupt the eurozone with a destabilizing referendum. And that simply doesn\u2019t work \u2014 what would happen if lender countries held their own referendums on whether to help Greece?Yes, Germany had its debt largely written off in 1953. But back then Germany wasn\u2019t part of a monetary union whose members had agreed to a specific set of rules. Chancellor Angela Merkel has already been too lenient, paving the way for yet another bailout package for Greece. A eurozone in which bankrupt socialist governments dictate the terms of their own rescue? Europeans beware!These two narratives may sound like caricatures, but unless something changes they will continue to influence public opinion, and elections, and therefore European politics for the foreseeable future.Is there a way to stop the centrifugal forces? Fortunately, yes. The Greek crisis has exposed deep fissures among Europeans. Yet a friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you, as the American essayist Elbert Hubbard famously said. This precisely is the level of mature friendship Europe needs now.Germany could start by recognizing the dire facts and agreeing to new debt relief for Greece. Such a gesture may be seen at home as a sign of weakness, but framed properly abroad, it would be a strong gesture of generosity from a position of strength. At the same time, to avoid moral hazard, the European Union should create an option for nations to leave the eurozone in an orderly way should they prove unable to recover within it. Combined, these steps would bring the crisis to an end while also creating breathing space should another one emerge.And maybe we can all agree on one lesson from the Greek crisis, namely that, to maintain a friendship, you should lend only as much money as you are ready to give away anyway. From there, we Europeans could finally start growing together like grown-ups.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low-Income Housing Goals Set for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Housing Finance Agency is required by a 2008 law that took effect after the collapse of the housing market to set annual targets for mortgages bought by Fannie and Freddie, the government-run institutions that back most home loans.The goals act as directives for Fannie and Freddie to focus more of their business on affordable housing. The companies buy loans from private lenders, package them into mortgage-backed securities and provide a credit guarantee to investors to ensure timely payment.Some advocates of housing for the poor expressed disappointment that the goals were not more ambitious. But the agency hailed the rules as an important lever for helping more poor families buy homes and for improving access to mortgages for landlords who rent out affordable apartments to low-income tenants in poverty-stricken neighborhoods.\u201cThese goals establish a solid foundation for affordable and sustainable homeownership and rental opportunities in this country,\u201d Melvin L. Watt, the agency\u2019s director, said in a news release.The agency set separate targets for single-family housing including categories for mortgages for low-income families, very low-income families and families in low-income areas, and for refinancing mortgages. The goals for mortgages for owners of multifamily property also include separate targets for low- and very low-income families.The agency said 24 percent of mortgages should be bought by Freddie or Fannie for homes for low-income borrowers, or those with incomes no greater than 80 percent of an area\u2019s median income. That goal is one percentage point higher than the goal for 2014.The National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which advocates affordable housing, said that the new target fell short of expectations.\u201cWith demand up and the economy stronger, to say 24 percent is to create a standard that isn\u2019t as helpful as what is needed,\u201d said John Taylor, president of the organization, who called the new goals \u201ca lost opportunity.\u201dThe agency also set a goal of 6 percent of mortgages for borrowers considered very low income, who have incomes no greater than 50 percent of the median income of the area. That is slightly less ambitious than last year\u2019s goal of 7 percent.For multifamily units, the agency wants the lenders to back mortgages for 300,000 units a year through 2017 for low-income units and 60,000 a year for very low-income units.For mortgages for small apartment complexes, the goals are 48,000 total low-income units for the next two years, less than half of the 105,000 total units originally proposed. The higher goals would have risked \u201ccrowding out\u201d smaller lenders, the agency said, acknowledging that the final goals are modest but are intended to keep Fannie and Freddie active in this market.The agency said that Fannie and Freddie had not fallen short of similar housing goals in the past, but that it could take action to ensure the goals are met if problems arise.During the housing crisis, the federal government placed Fannie and Freddie in conservatorship, and they received a taxpayer bailout to avoid bankruptcies. They now pay their profits to the Treasury.The agency said it had received 144 comment letters from advocacy groups and others on its proposed goals. A \u201csignificant number\u201d of those letters questioned whether Fannie and Freddie should still be under conservatorship or were tied to unrelated matters.\u201cThose comments are beyond the scope of this rule-making,\u201d the agency said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Everybody Rise,\u2019 by Stephanie Clifford", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A quarter-century ago, Harper\u2019s published an essay by Tom Wolfe titled \u201cStalking the Billion-Footed Beast: A \u00adLiterary Manifesto for the New Social Novel.\u201d Wolfe, whose best seller \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d had been published two years earlier, called for a revival of the sort of novel that emerged during the 19th century: realist fiction that was wide in its scope and accurate in its detail, grounded in the kind of reporting that journalistic nonfiction demands.Since Wolfe, other journalists have attempted to produce a richly textured, densely reported novel of the city. Kurt Andersen, a writer for Time before he became a co-founder of Spy magazine, imagined Manhattan on the brink of the digital age in \u201cTurn of the Century,\u201d while Amy Waldman, a former New York Times reporter, took the mutilated, post-9/11 city as her subject in the excellent \u201cThe Submission.\u201d Now comes \u201cEverybody Rise,\u201d by Stephanie Clifford, a Metro \u00adreporter for The Times. Clifford, who covered media and advertising in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 crash, has written a novel with similarly large ambitions \u2014 this time, of capturing New York City in the overheated moment preceding the \u00adfinancial crisis.Clifford\u2019s protagonist, Evelyn Beegan, is a product of Sheffield Academy, an elite New England boarding school. One of her best friends, Preston Hacking, who works vaguely in investing, is \u201ca Winthrop on his mother\u2019s side.\u201d Another close friend, Charlotte Macmillan, is the daughter of an executive at an international corporation; she has lived on several continents, speaks half a dozen languages and works for a private equity firm. Evelyn\u2019s origins are less confidently affluent and less socially secure. Her father, a charismatic Southern lawyer who grew up in a blue-collar mill town, specializes in suing pharmaceutical companies. Her ambitious but unfulfilled mother is determined to propel her daughter into ever higher circles.Evelyn\u2019s job isn\u2019t as lucrative as those held by her friends, but it\u2019s equally specific to the era: She\u2019s the director of membership for a start-up called People Like Us, a would-be Facebook for the rich. In a nod to Edith Wharton \u2014 whose \u201cThe House of Mirth,\u201d published in 1905 during what historians call the long 19th century, is a key reference point for Clifford \u2014 Evelyn lands the job by parading a familiarity with the upper crust that\u2019s partly gleaned from a college literature class, \u201cNovels of the Gilded Age, Newport.\u201dEvelyn\u2019s role is to recruit her friends, and then their friends, for the site. But it swiftly becomes Evelyn\u2019s goal to be more than a new-media handmaiden: She wants a place in society for herself. While she scrambles upward in New York, however, her family back in Maryland is tumbling downward as her father is indicted by a federal grand jury, accused of bribing expert witnesses. In a tightly plotted narrative, Clifford shows how Evelyn\u2019s tenuous initiation into this most elite of social networks coincides with an increasingly desperate effort to secure her footing there.Clifford details the manners of the old-money set with a reporter\u2019s well-trained eye. Upper East Side hostesses have inscrutable, WASPy names like Push and Souse. She nicely captures the vile heartiness of a weekend at an Adirondack camp, where the table is set with antler candelabras and the luridly colored cocktails to be served at a fund-raising boat race are mixed in paint tins labeled \u201cV\u201d for \u201cVirgin,\u201d \u201cS\u201d for \u201cStrong\u201d and \u201cT\u201d for \u201cToxic.\u201d Also well drawn are the arcane arrangements for the debutantes\u2019 \u201cBal Fran\u00e7ais,\u201d at which a boy dressed as Little Lord Fauntleroy performs the \u201cMarseillaise,\u201d France\u2019s revolutionary anthem, while the moneyed guests sing rousingly along.The social practices of the young bankers to whose set Evelyn precariously belongs are persuasively cataloged. Clifford has a good ear for the competitive banter about who gets FedExed more C.I.M.s (confidential information memorandums) and for their perplexing insider language, like the use of the word \u201cbuck\u201d to mean either a thousand dollars, a hundred thousand dollars or a million dollars, depending on the context. Hints are dropped of the impending crisis: Nouriel Roubini, the economist who forecast the housing crisis, is name-checked, and so is Bernard Madoff, not yet a disgraced Ponzi schemer but still a successful investor, the possession of whose private telephone number is in itself valuable social capital.Given this setup, it comes as something of a surprise that the novel ends before the crisis breaks, so the bubble economy, rather than being the merciless engine of Evelyn\u2019s fate, remains only the backdrop against which she experiences her personal downfall. Meanwhile, Clifford\u2019s depiction of these moneyed milieus is so convincingly repulsive that it\u2019s hard to be persuaded they hold that much charm, even for a striver like Evelyn.It\u2019s similarly hard to see the personal appeal of the well-placed individuals Evelyn courts. She becomes particularly enamored of the glossy heiress Camilla Rutherford, a mean girl with means, who quotes wisdom gleaned from her acupuncturist while shopping for sandals at Takashimaya. To secure Camilla\u2019s friendship and claim a coveted place alongside her, Evelyn tells egregious lies about her own background. Seemingly without much consideration, she betrays first her old friends and then her new ones. In an attempt to create a flawed heroine in the mold of Lily Bart, Clifford has given us one whose behavior borders on the sociopathic. Evelyn\u2019s actions and values leave little space in which the necessary sympathy of the reader might be kindled.Only occasionally, as in this suggestive, lyrical passage, do we get a glimpse of the New York that lies beyond the rarefied precincts of privilege:\u201cSomewhere in the city, an orange cat finished chewing on a marjoram plant next to his studio apartment\u2019s door and leapt purring onto the shoulder of his owner, home early from work. Somewhere in the city, a young Chinese pianist sat down at the rehearsal hall and let his fingers play the first opening notes of the Emperor Concerto, notes that would envelop the little girl in row D of the Philharmonic that night in a shimmering cloud. A boy in Staten Island touched his finger to the lower back of the girl who had been just a friend until then.\u201dEvelyn has been too busy social climbing to pay much attention to these other members of the billion-footed city \u2014 the ones who don\u2019t wear Ferragamos \u2014 among whom she might have made a more satisfying life, as Charlotte reminds her at the novel\u2019s conclusion. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to make it in Edith Wharton\u2019s New York,\u201d she says, but that New York \u201cbarely exists anymore.\u201dThe loosening of the strictures that governed Wharton\u2019s world is good news for Evelyn. Unlike Lily Bart, she isn\u2019t obliged to die in poverty. But their larger irrelevance presents something of a problem for the novelist who would take them as a principal theme. In the late-19th- and early-20th-century novels that Tom Wolfe so admired (and that Clifford gestures toward), invented characters are placed within worlds whose manners and constraints they\u2019re obliged to navigate. The enduring power of such works lies in the conflict between the specificity of an individual\u2019s desires and the larger, more powerful \u00adforces exerted by society. The pathos of Lily Bart\u2019s story derives from the inexorability of her fate.But Clifford\u2019s heroine has voluntarily adopted the codes and practices of an elite whose members ultimately grind her down. Evelyn has turned her back on the many other options that are available to her. In the novel\u2019s concluding pages, she comes to realize this; but by that time a reader might well have ceased to care whether she rises or falls in the vacuous world she has sought to conquer.EVERYBODY RISEBy Stephanie Clifford376 pp. St. Martin\u2019s Press. $26.99.Rebecca Mead, a staff writer at The New Yorker, is the author of \u201cMy Life in Middlemarch.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As His Term Wanes, Obama Champions Workers\u2019 Rights", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With little fanfare, the Obama administration has been pursuing an aggressive campaign to restore protections for workers that have been eroded by business activism, conservative governance and the evolution of the economy in recent decades.\u201cThese moves constitute the most impressive and, in my view, laudable attempt to update labor and employment law in many decades,\u201d said Benjamin I. Sachs, a professor at Harvard Law School and a former assistant general counsel for the Service Employees International Union. The goal, he said, is to \u201ckeep pace with changes in the structure of the labor market and the way work is organized.\u201dOnce in office, Mr. Obama delivered on that implied promise in a few critical ways, particularly his signature health care legislation. But throughout much of his first term, he disappointed supporters with his inability to pursue a larger progressive agenda and with what they saw as an insufficient focus on the balance of power between workers and their employers.Labor unions complained that he failed to throw his energy behind a measure that would have made it easier for workers to organize by requiring employers to recognize a union once a majority of workers had signed cards, rather than allowing employers to insist on a secret ballot election.\u201cThey were very weak on getting people into their positions in the first term,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research and advocacy group. \u201cThey lost many years of potential fruitful activity.\u201d (The White House says that the president was prompt in naming appointees, whose nominations then became bogged down in the Senate.)After spending several months in 2011 on a failed effort to negotiate a deficit-cutting \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the new House Republican majority, however, Mr. Obama did an apparent about-face, deciding that he would use every tool available to enact what he considered to be a bold pro-worker agenda on his own.Since he has not been able to advance legislation through the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Obama has failed to achieve a number of important goals, most notably raising the federal minimum wage. And many of the recent actions could be undone by a future administration.Meanwhile, critics abound across the ideological spectrum.Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute who served as Mitt Romney\u2019s domestic policy director in 2011 and 2012, said that calling the Obama economic agenda pro-worker \u201cmisses the forest for the trees \u2014 or perhaps, more precisely, misses the trees for a few stray weeds.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Cass said that \u201cincreasingly onerous employment regulation is driving employers to avoid employment relationships altogether, which benefits no one.\u201dLiberals and union supporters, while applauding Mr. Obama\u2019s record in the narrow realm of labor rights, complain that he has undercut workers with his efforts to promote global trade agreements and balanced budgets.\u201cAs long as the budget deal the administration negotiated continues to restrict domestic discretionary spending,\u201d the Department of Labor\u2019s ability to enforce the laws guaranteeing workers a minimum wage and overtime pay \u201cand fight misclassification will be severely limited,\u201d Ross Eisenbrey, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute who was one of the architects of the overtime regulation, said in an email.Still, there is little doubt that the Obama administration has become more ambitious in pursuing worker rights during the president\u2019s second term.Consider the home health care decision. The Labor Department wrote the original rule exempting home care professionals employed by staffing agencies from minimum wage and overtime protections in 1975, back when very few home care workers of that sort existed. In recent decades, however, the field has exploded, turning what was once a small exemption into a yawning regulatory gap at the heart of the service economy.The Clinton administration proposed closing the exemption three times, but the proposals were never made final. Mr. Obama\u2019s Labor Department pushed through new rules in 2013, but they stuck only after a protracted legal fight. After the home care industry challenged the rule and a Federal District Court struck it down, it took a three-judge panel on the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to revive it. Obama helped make that decision possible back in 2013, when he appointed two of the three judges.In many cases, the administration and its appointees have understood themselves to be not merely updating laws and regulations to reflect current economic realities, but also explicitly undoing what they considered to be efforts of Republican administrations to put workers at a disadvantage.\u201cThe overtime provision was intended in no small measure to correct a regulation from the Bush era that took leverage from workers and gave it to employers \u2014 by design,\u201d said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. \u201cWe were restoring what was a time-honored economic and social compact, which is that as we have productivity and profitability in this country, that is shared between business and workers.\u201dLast week\u2019s ruling by the labor board, which changed the standard for when a corporation may be designated a joint employer of workers hired by its contractors and franchisees, followed a similar logic.For decades before the mid-1980s, the N.L.R.B. considered a corporation to be a joint employer, and therefore liable for violations of workers\u2019 rights, as long as it enjoyed a fair amount of control over working conditions at facilities run or staffed by a contractor or franchisee. It didn\u2019t really matter whether the control was hands-on or arm\u2019s-length.In 1984, the Reagan-era N.L.R.B. began to sharply tighten the standard. On Thursday, voting 3 to 2 along partisan lines, the board tossed out the Reagan era rule, arguing that it was essentially returning to what had existed before.Taken together with other key regulatory actions and executive orders \u2014 an N.L.R.B. rule that effectively sped up the process for holding elections on whether to form a union and Mr. Obama\u2019s order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 \u2014 the effect has been to significantly alter the tilt of federal law.\u201cWe\u2019re really digging out of a 40-year hole,\u201d Mr. Mishel said. \u201cThe Clinton years were ones where they more triangulated between business and workers rather than weigh in on the side of workers.\u201dMr. Obama has long seen himself as working to empower the economically marginal, as steadfast in his commitment to labor protections as President Reagan was in rolling them back.That self-image dates all the way back to one of his first jobs after college, as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago. \u201cThose are the folks he worked with,\u201d said Gerald Kellman, the organizer and labor activist who hired him back then. \u201cHe feels strongly about this stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Many in Spain, a Heralded Economic Recovery Feels Like a Bust", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that was years ago. Recently, Angel Puyal\u00f3n, 50, was just hoping to get a call back for a job sorting recyclables. Mr. Puyal\u00f3n said he would be glad for any work now. His unemployment benefits are finished. He and his wife can no longer pay their mortgage, and they are relying on a food bank to eat.\u201cThey say there is a recovery,\u201d Mr. Puyal\u00f3n said at home here, with a stack of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9s sitting on the coffee table. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know.\u201dSpain, heralded by many as a success story for austerity policies, is on track for more than 3 percent growth this year and has created more than one million jobs since the beginning of 2014.But for many Spaniards, like Mr. Puyal\u00f3n, the statistics are meaningless \u2014 even suspect.Experts say that is not surprising because the vast majority of the new jobs are part-time \u2014 some lasting only a few days \u2014 and they pay poorly, doing little to improve the lives of the millions of Spaniards who lost their jobs during the global economic crisis.In many ways, the crisis here was deeper and more sustained than the downturn in the United States. Spain lost about 16 percent of its jobs, more than any other eurozone country. Its G.D.P. declined by 7 percent. And for the poorest 10 percent, real income dropped by 13 percent per year from 2007 to 2011, compared with only 1.4 percent for the richest 10 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, based in Paris.The desperation among job seekers is now so acute that many accept work contracts that pay less than the country\u2019s reduced minimum wage \u2014 often by agreeing on paper to work two days a week, but actually working many more unpaid hours, experts say. And some, returning to their old jobs, are finding that they must take huge pay cuts.\u201cA new figure has emerged in Spain: the employed person who is below the poverty threshold,\u201d said Daniel Alastuey, the secretary general of UGT Arag\u00f3n, a regional branch of one of Spain\u2019s largest unions, with more than 1.1 million members. \u201cFor a lot of people, the \u2018recovery\u2019 just doesn\u2019t feel like a recovery.\u201dCampaigning for his center-right party recently, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy talked of Spain\u2019s recovery in glowing terms, at one point saying that no one was even \u201ctalking about unemployment anymore.\u201dSince then, Mr. Rajoy has curbed his optimistic language and promised change. But polls suggest that anti-establishment parties could still do well when the country holds regional and national elections this year.The official unemployment rate sat above 22 percent at the end of the last quarter, with more than 5.15 million people out of work (2.7 million of them unemployed for more than a year). Many of them no longer qualify for any benefits and have family members who are already overextended trying to help.Redouane El Omari, 35, his wife, Esther Mendoza, 32, and their two children, for instance, are about to be evicted from the church housing where they have been living for more than 18 months, so that another needy family can move in. But they cannot turn to relatives for help. Ms. Mendoza\u2019s brother and his family are already living with her mother, and all of them survive on the mother\u2019s pension of 300 euros, or about $331, a month.Mr. Omari, a forklift operator, recently got a week\u2019s work at his old company, but he was stunned when he saw his paycheck. He had earned nearly 35 percent less than before the economic crisis, for the same duties.\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d he said recently, staring at a pay stub showing \u20ac169 in wages for the week ($186). Experts say that there are encouraging signs in Spain\u2019s economy. But some wonder whether recent growth is simply the result of a drop in energy prices.And in the long run, the recovery faces many challenges, including a growing group of aging unemployed who may never work again and a middle-aged work force that left school early for high-paying construction jobs, which disappeared when Spain\u2019s real estate bubble burst in 2008. Such work is unlikely to return soon, but that part of the labor force is trained for little else.At the same time, the labor reforms that the government introduced to make it easier to discharge employees has set off rounds of cost cutting. Companies, experts say, are letting expensive workers go and replacing them with people who will take low-paying, part-time work. But this strategy, some say, adds to costs for the government, which is still running an annual budget deficit of more than 5 percent of G.D.P., above the eurozone goal of 3 percent.\u201cBad jobs can be very expensive for the public,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, an economics professor at Complutense University of Madrid and the deputy director of Fedea, a research group. \u201cPeople with bad jobs go to unemployment benefits when they can and wait there trying to look for a better job.\u201dAnd the number of situations where employees are expected to work many unpaid hours is rising, Mr. Conde-Ruiz said. \u201cPeople are so desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will take anything.\u201dThat is what happened to Isabel Carrasco Granado, 38, who found a part-time job in a nursing home this year and was asked to work unpaid overtime. Divorced and raising a daughter, she says that living with the fear of unemployment has taken its toll.\u201cI miss having savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI miss going to the dentist once a year.\u201dEven entrepreneurs and small-business owners who are beginning to get back on their feet say the economy still feels dysfunctional. Chus Castej\u00f3n, 49, who saw his fledgling skateboard company disintegrate early in the crisis when his bank abruptly demanded full repayment of a \u20ac300,000 business loan, has had five tough years, losing his house in the process.He has been making ends meet lately, acting as a go-between for companies looking to import products from Asia. Still, he says, the economy feels fragile, and there is no credit to be had. \u201cI have a lot of friends who are telling me that all the good news is really just advertising,\u201d he said.The economy here in Zaragoza, a city of about 700,000 in northern Spain, is doing relatively well compared with the rest of the country. Even so, recent elections brought in a mayor, Pedro Santisteve, whose party is affiliated with Podemos, the new leftist party. Mr. Santisteve bluntly calls Spain\u2019s economic recovery \u201ca big lie.\u201d He says there are 25,000 families in Zaragoza living on less than \u20ac300 a month, and 31,000 who cannot afford the electricity they need. In the last year, more than 500 families have been evicted from their homes. Mr. Santisteve says the city\u2019s budget is so strained, he will have little room to maneuver. But he intends to begin by auditing the books and taking back much of the work the city has been contracting out, he says, at very high prices. For instance, he says, the private company taking care of the city\u2019s trees found 33,000 that needed attention while an alternative survey found 3,700.\u201cThe data shows there has been a transfer of wealth from the masses to the most elite,\u201d he said, \u201cand we need to find ways to reverse that.\u201dMr. Puyal\u00f3n could not agree more. Before the crisis, he earned \u20ac5,000 a month and his wife, Maria Jes\u00fas J\u00fadez, 53, earned about \u20ac1,100. They spent conservatively, buying an apartment with a mortgage of \u20ac1,100 a month. But then he lost his job and his wife\u2019s hours were reduced. They now fear being evicted.\u201cThe politicians in office right now,\u201d Mr. Puyal\u00f3n said, \u201care just not connected with real life.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of the business loan to Chus Castej\u00f3n\u2019s skateboard company that was abruptly called by his bank. It was \u20ac300,000, not $300,000.Rachel Chaundler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Currency Devaluation Is a Short Step in China\u2019s Long Advance", "Date": "2015-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWhen China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, fell against the dollar on Aug. 11, it set off a furor.Stock and commodities markets have shuddered around the world, and many traders feared that China had begun a sharp and dangerous devaluation \u2014 a salvo in a \u201cbeggar thy neighbor\u201d currency war, in which countries would seek competitive advantage by making their goods cheaper in global markets.That could turn out to be true, of course. Countries like Kazakhstan and Vietnam have devalued their currencies as well, and many emerging-market currencies have been dropping. But there is another way to interpret what happened in China. And while it may seem counterintuitive, I think it\u2019s equally valid.China did not devalue its currency sharply, and it has not embraced a currency war, at least not so far. What it has done is make very modest adjustments both in the value of its currency and in the manner in which it trades. Those moves continue an agonizingly slow process that has been underway for more than 35 years. They are a small but important part of China\u2019s transformation into a modern nation.But there are specific reasons for the timing of this latest Chinese move. One runs counter to a commonly held assumption in the United States: that China has been manipulating its currency by making it artificially cheap. The markets have been saying that the opposite is true \u2014 that the renminbi was, and still is, not cheap enough.It has not fallen more sharply because Chinese authorities have prevented it from doing so. Over the last week they have stemmed the tide of the markets to keep the renminbi, also known as the yuan, from falling more steeply.The numbers tell the story \u2014 and it is not one of precipitate decline in the renminbi, at least not yet. To the contrary, the renminbi has dropped less than 3 percent against the dollar since the close of trading on Aug. 10. The next day, China announced a technical change in its rules, saying market forces would begin to play a bigger role in renminbi price-setting. In addition, it set the renminbi less than 2 percent lower against the dollar. The currency\u2019s declines over the next two days were smaller.By Aug. 14, the Chinese central bank\u2019s intention of stabilizing the renminbi became clearer, and the currency started to flat-line on the foreign-exchange charts. Since then, it has not been plummeting, as many people had feared. It has been one of the best performers among emerging-market currencies, rising slightly against the dollar. Even including the first days of decline, it has outperformed many currencies, including the Russian ruble, which is down 9 percent, and the Colombian peso, down more than 6 percent, according to Bloomberg data.That said, the renminbi\u2019s fall on Aug. 11 was significant. Small as the currency\u2019s drop may have been, it startled the markets partly because it was the biggest one-day change in the currency in 20 years. China made some really big changes in its foreign-exchange system back then \u2014 changes that dwarf what has just occurred.Consider that at the start of 1994, China effectively devalued the renminbi by 33 percent \u2014 yet that truly sharp decline had scarcely any effect on global markets. While trade frictions with the United States had already flared up by then, China was relatively unimportant in world finance, and the renminbi was not a major currency.Until the 1994 overhaul, China had two official foreign-exchange systems with confusingly different rates \u2014 an unfavorable one for foreigners and a better one for qualified Chinese enterprises. It also had a thriving black market and lots of corruption.As part of the changes, China unified the two official foreign-exchange systems, setting the rate for foreigners at roughly the same level used internally by Chinese enterprises on swap markets. Those were critically important steps in China\u2019s evolution.But they were just intermediate steps. So were the ones taken this month, disturbing though they may be for international markets. The recent brouhaha is an indication of how little China has done to free up its currency over the last 20 years, and how much still needs to be done.The International Monetary Fund has responded to China\u2019s latest measures cautiously, indicating that they are not yet enough to give the renminbi the enhanced stature that China desires: an elite currency, ranked along with the dollar, the euro and the yen. The I.M.F. last week deferred that particular seal of approval, deciding not to include the renminbi in its so-called Special Drawing Rights basket, which would add to the renminbi\u2019s international luster, until at least next year.Aside from its long-term goal of achieving greater global status, China had domestic reasons for taking action on Aug. 11. Its stock market has fallen, its exports have flagged, and its economy is undergoing restructuring. China\u2019s cabinet last month asked that the renminbi be included in the mix of solutions.That brings us to the timing of the central bank, which continues to exert a great deal of control over China\u2019s exchange rate. It chose a very interesting moment to act. This is why: Over the last year, the numbers show, the renminbi has been a sidekick of the dollar, rising in strength as the dollar has moved higher.The central bank\u2019s own rigid foreign-exchange rules helped make this happen. The bank stabilized the renminbi by restricting its movement: It enforced a tight trading range against the dollar, and so the renminbi essentially did what the dollar did. One result is that even including the recent devaluation, the renminbi has fared better against the dollar than every major currency that is freely traded.That has made Chinese goods more expensive on world markets, and it helps explain why there was such alarm when China devalued its currency. At this stage, though, the decline in the renminbi\u2019s value seems to have been carefully calibrated. It is too small to have helped China much with its exports, and not large enough to set off much additional capital flight by people afraid that their renminbi assets will depreciate in a currency decline.Still, the central bank\u2019s move might help stave off domestic political pressure and improve China\u2019s standing with bodies like the I.M.F. And because the markets have clearly been pushing the renminbi downward, the timing is useful in diplomacy with the United States, which will have difficulty arguing now that the renminbi\u2019s price has been set too low. Under current conditions, if China\u2019s central bank stops intervening, the renminbi might well fall sharply.\u201cWhat China has done is very astute,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, the former head of the I.M.F.\u2019s China division, and now an economist at Cornell and the Brookings Institution. \u201cThe People\u2019s Bank of China has managed to pull off a reform that is important to them and to do it in a way that allows them to mollify domestic critics and stave off criticism from international investors.\u201dIn short, China has made a little progress and bought a little time to make further changes in its economic and financial systems. It has come far but it still has a very long way to go.Advertisement"}

The ruling party bases its legitimacy on delivering high rates of growth and employment. It also hopes to encourage consumer spending as a new engine of growth as the manufacturing sector slows and to nudge the economy away from an investment-driven model. Eroding confidence threatens both goals.These days, Chinese are using the social media app WeChat to look for news and advice on the economy rather than the state news media, which, at the orders of the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda department, have only had bare-bones reporting on the stock market crisis and the broader concerns over slowing economic growth.But censors have yet to prevent people from using search terms related to the economy or the stock market on social media networks, so discussion is thriving online.\u201cIn the absence of information about the stock market on official media, Chinese investors are relying on social media, primarily the two \u2018We\u2019s \u2014 Weibo and WeChat \u2014 to get news about the economy,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, founder of China Digital Times, which tracks China\u2019s media censorship.He noted that WeChat was particularly popular because it was less \u201cpolluted\u201d by posts from government-supported Internet users and because people could easily share news articles on the economy from Western news publications, especially stories already translated into Chinese.The author of the widely circulated financial advice column on WeChat, Lin Mo, once worked for a state-run business magazine, then started her own online writing about the economy. She said in an interview that she had published her latest list of suggestions after getting hundreds of messages from \u201cvery terrified\u201d readers responding to one of her earlier essays on what she called an \u201ceconomic crisis.\u201d\u201cMany readers were asking me things like, \u2018What should we do?\u2019 and, \u2018What if China becomes Japan in the \u201880s?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey are in their early 30s \u2014 the age to buy apartments or make investments or start their own businesses. So they have big financial decisions to make, and in the current economy, they worry about losing those investments in the slowdown.\u201d\u201cMany of them are at a place in their careers where they want to leverage their current positions for higher-paying positions, and they worry about getting laid off by the new company in the economic winter,\u201d she added. \u201cOne reader told me that he left a state-owned travel agency to join a booming Internet-based travel service because he felt he had to \u2018embrace the Internet\u2019 as a young professional. Now he regrets that decision bitterly because the new company is having layoffs, and he might be laid off first.\u201dOne Chinese woman who posted Ms. Lin\u2019s column on her WeChat account said it \u201cechoed the zeitgeist.\u201d She had tried to sell an apartment, but said, \u201cNow I think I might hold off until the market recovers a bit.\u201dAmong the most worried are university graduates. This year, nearly 7.5 million people graduated from universities in China, a 3 percent increase over last year.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Victor Shih, a political economist at the University of California, San Diego, said the slowdown exacerbated worrisome trends in the job market.\u201cHighly paid professional jobs have been scarce for several years now,\u201d he said, \u201cand many young graduates have depended on their parents\u2019 connections to obtain entry positions in the government or state-owned enterprises. The current downturn will hit graduates without strong connections or specialized skills.\u201dMs. Lin said China\u2019s young strivers \u201cworry about a decline in life quality. They worry about never getting that financial freedom they so badly want. They worry about never being able to retire early. They worry about never being able to start their own business.\u201dLeisure spending still exists, of course. Popular restaurants in Beijing are crowded. Earlier this month, groups of Chinese tourists snapped up all manner of luxury goods one weekend at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, a high-end destination. Tour groups shuffled through the alleys and luxury shops of Venice.But on Zhihu, the Chinese equivalent of the question-and-answer website Quora, hundreds of people have submitted responses to questions from 2014 and 2015 that asked, \u201cWhat things do you see in your profession that indicate an economic slowdown?\u201d The answers this year have ranged from \u201cI\u2019m in sales \u2014 commission is impossible\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m in construction. Last year we got four jobs and this year none.

{"Headline": "For Asian Youth Orchestra, Mission Is More Than Just Music", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Like all good youth orchestra conductors, Richard Pontzious is not always nice to his charges.\u201cCan\u2019t you count to five?\u201d Mr. Pontzious, 71, said last month at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, during the Asian Youth Orchestra\u2019s first rehearsal for its 2015 season. Mr. Pontzious, who founded the ensemble 25 years ago in Hong Kong, pointed to the principal second-violinist, who put his bow up a bar too early, before turning his attention to a brass player with the wrong sheet music.He then added: \u201cSay, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Pontzious.\u2019 No, that\u2019s not funny. In a professional orchestra, you\u2019d be out.\u201dMr. Pontzious then addressed the room, filled with young musicians who were going to work together for the next two months. \u201cThere is no place to hide \u2014 not in my rehearsals,\u201d he said.The orchestra\u2019s 103 instrumentalists \u2014 chosen from more than 800 applicants, aged 17 to 27, from a dozen nations and territories across Asia \u2014 were in their first group practice. They had only a few hours to prepare for the \u201cNimrod\u201d movement from Elgar\u2019s \u201cEnigma Variations\u201d before a ceremony attended by corporate sponsors, government officials and celebrities. For the following three weeks, these musicians would rehearse for nine hours a day. This Saturday, they embark on a tour across mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan, playing for a total of about 20,000 audience members.In past years, the orchestra has played at the White House, the Hollywood Bowl and Avery Fisher Hall, in New York. But for its 25th season, it is staying on home turf. Its anniversary gala at the Hong Kong Coliseum on Aug. 16 will feature about 600 musicians \u2014 300 instrumentalists, including alumni, and 300 vocalists \u2014 performing a spirited rendition of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony.On top of mastering Hayden, Beethoven, Mahler, Strauss and Shostakovich, the members of the youth orchestra will also have to learn how get along with colleagues from vastly different backgrounds, and how to navigate a tour that crisscrosses rival Asian states like Japan and China. Almost every year, the orchestra\u2019s general manager, Keith Lau, has to fix visa problems or get special permission for players trying to enter particular countries. In May, the ensemble became the first orchestra to win the Nikkei Asia Prize in Japan for bringing the region together. The Asian Youth Orchestra, founded in 1990 by the violin maestro Yehudi Menuhin and Mr. Pontzious, is similar to the European Union Youth Orchestra. However, that ensemble is organized by a pan-national government body, whereas its Asian counterpart is privately funded and left on its own to bridge Asia\u2019s border tensions. Mr. Pontzious said the spirit of the Asian group was closest to the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which is based in Seville, Spain, and whose goal is to bring together musicians divided by the politics of the Middle East.The Asian players\u2019 education extends beyond the practice room. Touring musicians are housed with host families \u2014 an experience not always appreciated at first by young people struggling with other cultures or languages.\u201cIt\u2019s traumatic for some orchestral members,\u201d Mr. Pontzious said. \u201cOne Chinese player\u2019s grandfather had been killed by a Japanese soldier. Another Chinese girl turned to me when she was placed with a Japanese family and said, \u2018How do you think I feel?\u2019 But two days later, she was carrying the Japanese family\u2019s baby in her arms. This is a very common reaction.\u201dAt the end of every concert, the musicians are introduced by their country or territory. And sometimes, this has rattled nerves. The 2012 tour was particularly tumultuous. The orchestra crossed China at the height of anti- Japan protests over disputed islands. In China, \u201ctempers were igniting and heated insults were being hurled at anything and anyone Japanese,\u201d Mr. Pontzious wrote at the time in The South China Morning Post, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong. The Japanese players were apprehensive, but still received warm applause from the Chinese audience.Mr. Pontzious, originally from the San Francisco area, has seen many highs and lows in Asia since he moved to Taiwan in 1967. He was hired by the Shanghai Conservatory in 1983 and became one of the first foreigners to stay long term after the Cultural Revolution, which lasted from 1966 to 1976 and was a period when \u201cbourgeois\u201d Western instruments and sheet music were ritually destroyed.\u201cThe conservatory was very damaged by the events of the Cultural Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe instruments were terrible. Kids had rubber bands holding together the keys on their clarinets.\u201dWhat he saw was far removed from today\u2019s China, home to gleaming new concert halls and celebrity soloists like Lang Lang, Yundi Li and Jian Wang. For Mr. Pontzious, the future of classical music is in Asia. \u201cIf you look at audiences in Europe, they are all elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite here. People are bringing babies to concerts.\u201dThe Asian Youth Orchestra\u2019s demographics have shifted with Asia\u2019s economic development. In the 1990s, it was dominated by Japanese players. But when Japan\u2019s economy faltered and China\u2019s grew, more Chinese members came on board. There is also an evolving contingent from Southeast Asia. In one telling example of the changing climate, Naoki Ota, a French horn player from Japan returned to his country in 2010 to deliver pizzas, but he later found work with the Hangzhou Philharmonic Orchestra, in China, because of his connection to the Asian Youth Orchestra.The Asian group\u2019s age cap, at 27, is a bit higher than other youth orchestras to accommodate musicians from various backgrounds. Players can repeat the program as many times as they want so long as they pass auditions each time.Kevin Julius Castelo, who is 23 and just graduated from the University of the Philippines as a percussion major, is on his fourth tour. He was a talented high school drummer who played in a rock band but had little exposure to classical music or instruments. \u201cIt\u2019s not like other countries, with better secondary school programs,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how to read notes.\u201dBack at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts last month, Mr. Lau, the general manager, continued to prepare the players for their first performance. He checked that their sheet music was ordered, their uniforms were ironed, and threatened to cover their legs in black stage tape if they forgot to wear socks.To symbolize the full financial support that each of the orchestra\u2019s members receive for their participation and travel, Mr. Lau handed a certificate of donation to Hoang Ho Khanh Van, an 18-year-old violinist from Vietnam. \u201cThis is worth $12,500,\u201d Mr. Lau said, positioning Ms. Hoang where she would face the V.I.P.s in the front row. \u201cSo when your time comes, look at the audience and smile.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Rising Turbulence", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBrazil is in tatters. The economy is in a deepening recession: Last Tuesday, Moody\u2019s downgraded Brazil\u2019s credit rating to just about junk. A massive corruption scandal involving the national oil company Petrobras has ensnared scores of politicians and businessmen. The legislature is in revolt. President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s popularity rating, less than a year after her re-election, is down to one digit, and nationwide protests on Sunday reverberated with calls for her impeachment.In all this turbulence, it is easy to miss the good news: the fortitude of Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions. In pursuing bribery at Petrobras, federal prosecutors from a special anticorruption unit of the Public Ministry have not been deterred by rank or power, dealing a blow to the entrenched culture of immunity among government and business elites. Former Petrobras executives have been arrested; the wealthy chief executive of the construction giant Odebrecht, Marcelo Odebrecht, is under arrest; the admiral who oversaw Brazil\u2019s secret nuclear program has been arrested, and many others face scrutiny, including Ms. Rousseff\u2019s predecessor and mentor, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.Though the investigations have created huge political problems for Ms. Rousseff and have raised questions about her seven-year tenure as the chairwoman of Petrobras, before she became president, she has admirably made no effort to constrain or influence the investigations. On the contrary, she has consistently emphasized that no one is above the law, and has supported a new term for the prosecutor general in charge of the Petrobras probe, Rodrigo Janot.So far, the investigations have found no evidence of illegal actions on her part. And while she is no doubt responsible for policies and much of the mismanagement that have laid Brazil\u2019s economy low, these are not impeachable offenses. Forcing Ms. Rousseff out of office without any concrete evidence of wrongdoing would do serious damage to a democracy that has been gaining strength for 30 years without any balancing benefit. And there is nothing to suggest that any leaders in the wings would do a better job with the economy.There is no question that Brazilians are facing tough and frustrating times, and things are likely to get worse before they get better. Ms. Rousseff is also in for a lot more trouble and criticism. But the solution must not be to undermine the democratic institutions that are ultimately the guarantors of stability, credibility and honest government. Advertisement"}

She was 99.The cause was complications of dementia, her daughter, Susan, said.As chief of the economics division of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, she issued her first analysis of worldwide defense expenditures in 1964.With military spending rising precipitously, Ms. Sivard and her staff decided two years later to dramatize the competition for resources by also measuring government budgets for things like education, health and foreign aid.Hers were not impenetrable tracts intended to gather dust on government shelves. She infused them with provocative facts \u2014 noting early on, for example, that developed nations had as many soldiers per capita as teachers, and that 25 percent of the world\u2019s scientific talent was devoted to defense.In 1970, Defense Secretary Melvin R.

{"Headline": "Stocks Deepen Their Slide After Early Gains Evaporate", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sudden reversal in United States stock prices late in trading on Tuesday produced a sixth consecutive session of losses and heightened uncertainty about the challenges facing global markets. The wild swings in prices over the last two days have been the most extreme since the financial crisis. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index surged as much as 2.9 percent on Tuesday, but ended down 1.4 percent.The resurgence of volatility has overturned a sense of comfort among many investors who had grown accustomed to calm markets and steadily rising stock prices in recent years.\u201cThe last two days have been a wake-up call for a lot of portfolio managers,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at Convergex, an institutional brokerage firm. \u201cIt forces everyone to reconsider their base assumption for things like earnings growth and revenue growth.\u201dThe opening of trading in Asia on Wednesday brought little clarity. Shanghai stocks, which have led the declines over the past few days, swung between gains and losses, and the volatile trading spread across the rest of Asia. Japanese stocks rebounded from Tuesday\u2019s 4 percent drop, but shares in Australia were down. Some investors have taken a dark outlook, questioning whether the markets \u2014 and the broader economy \u2014 will be able to abide a coming rise in interest rates that the Federal Reserve has been moving toward for months.For the time being, there are few doubts that the American economy has been growing, and the economy is unlikely to be significantly hampered by recent turmoil in China. New data reported on Tuesday morning pointed to a healthy increase in consumer confidence in August and a rise in new home sales in July.But voices like Lawrence H. Summers, the former chief economic adviser to President Obama, have recently joined a chorus of skeptics arguing that the growth may not be able to continue if the Fed steps back from the market, as it had looked set to do in September. Investors have ramped up bets this week that the Fed will have to delay any planned changes in interest rates. Tuesday provided another reminder of the wide range of outcomes that investors are debating. Early on Tuesday, investors in markets around the world appeared to take comfort as China, the epicenter of the recent sell-off in global stock markets, took steps to tackle slowing growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The Chinese central bank announced measures intended to lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. European markets rose sharply, and when New York trading opened, stocks surged. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had plunged 1,000 points early on Monday, rose 441 points early on Tuesday in another day of heavy trading. That optimism, however, slowly faded. And in the last half-hour of trading, the tentative rally fell apart completely. The Dow closed down 204.91 points, or 1.3 percent, at 15,666.44. The S.&P. 500 ended 25.60 points lower at 1867.61, while the Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.4 percent, or 19.76 points, to 4,506.49. There were no obvious explanations for the sudden decline in prices in the waning minutes of trading, though many investors said it suggested the lack of conviction behind recent market moves. \u201cIt is going to take a week, or a couple of weeks, to have this market stabilize,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, the chief investment officer at the Solaris Group. The major stock indexes have all entered into what is known as a correction \u2014 a 10 percent decline from the recent high, reached in May. The new declines brought the indexes closer to a so-called bear market, which is a 20 percent slump from recent highs. The Dow is now down 15.5 percent since May. The pullback has erased all of the gains that American stocks had made since early 2014.Treasury prices, which have benefited from the instability in stock markets, were weaker on Tuesday. The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell, driving its yield \u2014 which moves in the opposite direction of its price \u2014 to 2.08 percent from 2.01 percent on Monday.The big moves this week have struck many strategists as an overreaction, particularly given that there are no new major signs of any turn in the economy. But many investors who focus on the value of stocks, as measured by the price paid for each dollar of profit from a company, say that stocks have further to fall still if valuations are to come in line with historical norms.Investors were paying $16.80 for every dollar of earnings over the last year \u2014 the so-called price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 even after Monday\u2019s losses, according to FactSet Research. Over the last 10 years, the ratio has been, on average, $15.70.\u201cWhen we are this high, even with this pullback, the track record of future returns isn\u2019t all that good,\u201d Mr. Colas of Convergex said.Over the last two years investors have bid up the price of stocks in the hope that the companies would experience significant future growth. In recent quarters, though, American corporate profits have been falling on a year-to-year basis. Looking forward, many investors are anticipating slower growth from American companies unless the economy significantly picks up.Still, all of the negative sentiment could dissolve on Wednesday morning, as it appeared to do for a time on Tuesday morning.When American stocks opened on Tuesday, European markets were up sharply, recouping most of the losses they had experienced on Monday. The benchmark German index ended the day up almost 5 percent, while France\u2019s benchmark index was up 4.1 percent \u2014 all before the markets in the United States began to experience trouble.The moves suggested that Chinese authorities are now looking to stabilize the economy, rather than focusing on the problems in the financial markets. But similar past efforts have failed to reverse the country\u2019s problems, and many investors are skeptical that the latest measures will be more effective.In the United States and Europe, too, there are growing fears that the central bankers have done everything in their power and now need to rely on some outside assistance.Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote on Facebook that Tuesday\u2019s reversal will \u201cerode the faith that market participants have in the power of central banks to repress volatility.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount by which the Chinese government lowered interest rates. It was 0.25 of a percentage point, not 0.25 percent. The article also misstated the amount by which the reserve rate requirement was decreased. It was 0.5 of a percentage point, not 0.5 percent.Neil Gough and Chris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s because as Americans increasingly buy more efficient hybrid and all-electric cars, they will use much less gasoline and diesel.

That\u2019s good news but those fuel-saving cars will use public highways and bridges just as much as conventional vehicles.Of course, it will take several years to fine-tune the mileage fees and how they are assessed and collected. Newer cars will come with technology like wireless connections that should make it easier and cheaper to administer the system. Governments will also have to build strong privacy protections to make sure mileage and location data are not compromised or misused. In Oregon, the state says it deletes data older than 30 days once drivers have paid their bills.In some ways mileage-based fees are similar to tolls. But these fees should be more efficient because car and truck drivers often try to avoid highway tolls causing congestion on local streets. And it will still be important to encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars, so some form of fuel or carbon tax might well be needed, even if a miles-driven fee is used.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Number of Uninsured Has Declined by 15 Million Since 2013, Administration Says", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of people without health insurance continues to decline and has dropped by 15.8 million, or one-third, since 2013, the Obama administration said Tuesday.The data may bolster Democrats\u2019 claims that the law is working as they intended, but it is unlikely to prompt Republicans to let up on criticism of the law, which was passed without any Republican votes.In a report on its findings, the center said that the proportion of the population without insurance had declined by five percentage points, to 9.2 percent, in the first quarter of this year, from 14.4 percent in 2013.Among people age 18 to 64, the number who were uninsured dropped by about one-third, to 25.5 million, in the first quarter of this year, from 39.6 million in 2013. And among children under 18, the number of uninsured declined to 3.4 million this year, from 4.8 million in 2013.The decline in the number of uninsured coincides with improvements in the economy. In the last two years, the recovery has gained traction and the unemployment rate has declined steadily.The numbers for the first quarter of this year, from the National Health Interview Survey, are estimates based on data for 26,121 people. The information was collected in household interviews by the Census Bureau, using procedures specified by the National Center for Health Statistics, a part of the Public Health Service. The survey focused on the civilian population outside prisons and nursing homes.The report suggests that the Affordable Care Act produced the most significant gains in coverage among poor people and those with income just over the poverty level, which is $11,770 for an individual.In the first three months of this year, among poor people age 18 to 64, about 28 percent lacked health insurance, down from 39.3 percent in 2013, the government said. And among people in that age bracket with incomes from the poverty level up to twice that amount, 23.8 percent were uninsured in the first quarter of this year, down from 38.5 percent in 2013.Gains in coverage were also notable for Hispanics, who have long been more likely than other groups to be uninsured. In the first quarter of this year, 28.3 percent of Hispanics age 18 to 64 were uninsured, down from 40.6 percent in 2013, the government said.The comparable figures also fell for non-Hispanic black adults, to 15.6 percent from 24.9 percent, and for non-Hispanic white adults, to 8.7 percent from 14.5 percent.States that expanded Medicaid have seen a sharper drop in the proportion of people who are uninsured, although residents of those states were also more likely to have coverage before the health law took effect. In states that expanded Medicaid, 10.6 percent of people age 18 to 64 were uninsured in the first quarter of this year, down from 18.4 percent in 2013, the report said.In states that chose not to expand Medicaid, 16.8 percent of such adults were uninsured in the first quarter of this year, down from 22.7 percent in 2013.A separate study, issued this week by the Gallup organization, found that Texas was the only state where at least 20 percent of people were uninsured. By contrast, it said, in 2013, people without coverage accounted for at least 20 percent of the population in 14 states. Arkansas, California and Kentucky were among the states showing the largest reductions in the proportion of people without insurance.From 2008 to 2014, Massachusetts was the only state at or below 5 percent, Gallup said. Massachusetts expanded coverage under a 2006 law that was, in some ways, a model for the federal law signed four years later by President Obama.A chart on Wednesday with an article about a decline in the number of Americans without health insurancetransposed, in some editions, labels showing the uninsured rates for adults considered near-poor or poor. The rate for poor adults is higher, at 28 percent, and the rate for near-poor adults is lower, at 23.8 percent. In addition, the share of adults considered not poor who were uninsured was 7.5 percent, not 4.6 percent. A corrected chart can be found at nytimes.com/us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blind Faith in China\u2019s Stock Market", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In late June, as the Chinese stock market was in a tailspin, a joke began making the rounds.\u201cWe played the market when we thought stocks had hit rock bottom,\u201d one investor says to another, \u201conly to find there was a basement below. We played the market when prices were in the basement, only to find there was a cellar underneath that, and when we kept playing in the cellar, we found that below that there was hell. Then we took our lives in our hands and kept playing when stocks were in hell \u2014 only to discover it\u2019s true what they say: There are 18 levels of hell!\u201dFor the officials of China\u2019s Securities Regulatory Commission, July 4 must have seemed like hell on earth: They were as frantic as ants on a hot wok. That morning, the heads of 21 top brokerages met with the regulatory commission, and, according to media reports, agreed to supply some 120 billion renminbi, or $19.4 billion, to a market rescue fund.The plan was in clear violation of the Securities Law. Brokers need approval from their shareholders to give up so much money. But with the regulatory agency desperate for a cash infusion, the brokers were in no mood to follow the law. We Chinese are used to this kind of thing: In China, law and the rule of law are a world apart.Many people think the stock market plunge, which continued this week, had its origin in the government clampdown on margin trading, the use of borrowed money to buy stocks, which had led to a feverish expansion of broker financing and to the stock market bubble. Brokers are required to back trades with the equivalent amount of cash from a client, but competition and a thriving stock market had led too many to flout the rules. Every day investors complained to brokers that the financial threshold for trading was too high. The brokerages felt they had no choice but to ease the cash requirements for making trades.As the market boomed, more and more ordinary people invested their savings and funneled borrowed money into stocks. The virtual economy of the markets detached itself from economic fundamentals, and stock prices of listed companies became disconnected from their real value. It was as though investors were spending 100 yuan to buy a 1 yuan pair of chopsticks.When you realize that there are some 100 million investors in China\u2019s stock market, and when you think, too, of the throngs of gambling-loving Chinese packing the world\u2019s casinos, along with the clatter of mahjong tiles inside practically every Chinese home (they say that when you\u2019re on a plane and hear people shuffling mahjong tiles below, you know you\u2019re over China), then it is clear that for many Chinese the stock market simply whets a thirst for a quick profit.This is in part why so many new fund-providing companies have sprouted up in recent years. Most have no intention of establishing a permanent business: The idea is to make a killing, then get out while the going is good. These new enterprises don\u2019t register with the government; they simply rent an apartment in a housing block, lug in a few desks, chairs and computers, access the brokers\u2019 trading platform, raise or borrow tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of renminbi, and they\u2019re in business.The government was keen to see people move money from savings \u2014 some Chinese put away as much as half of their income \u2014 into capital markets and thus stimulate an increasingly sluggish economy. Brokers could charge high interest rates for financing the trading. And many retail investors dreamed of becoming rich overnight. Everyone seemed to have a stake in seeing the stock market climb, and desire-fueled fantasies ensued.The Chinese stock market has long been a policy-driven market, its ups and downs largely prompted by new government policies. Thus, the country finds itself in the bizarre situation of having a bear market when the economy is humming and a bull market when the economy is in the doldrums. A decade ago, a single People\u2019s Daily editorial was enough to change the market\u2019s direction.But habitual reliance on a policy-driven market has hurt China\u2019s small investors. When stocks began to nosedive in June, many people hung on, trusting that the government would come to the rescue. When the government began to intervene, many shareholders sat tight, and many who had bailed out began to get back in. Prices continued to fall, but because every day the government was announcing new rescue measures, investors were sure that prices had bottomed out. Then the market just kept sliding. After suffering huge losses, one investor announced that he was now sleeping like a baby \u2014 because he kept crying himself to sleep.Blind emotion often continues to rule. On July 9, as rescue efforts took effect and the market began to rebound, the phones of brokerage and margin trading managers were constantly ringing once more, as investors who had suffered losses mortgaged their assets or borrowed funds to generate new capital.It is said that the memory span of a Chinese investor is as short as that of fish \u2014 no more than seven seconds. Clearly, the slump has still not taught a respect for market principles. Many people go on believing the official claim that it is malicious short-sellers who have caused the sell-off.Perhaps investors will eventually stop placing blind faith in government policy, and the Chinese stock market will evolve from being a top-down system overly influenced by the government. When in the space of a few days you lose the savings built up over a lifetime, this should make an indelible impression. But it\u2019s quite possible that the appeal of taking one more gamble and winning all your money back will lead people into the same old trap. Any change in the mind-set of the Chinese is likely to be a long drawn out process.Government agencies and the official media have continued eagerly talking up the stock market, encouraging investors to buy stocks and buy big.On social media, however, one young woman who lost all her assets when the market swooned took a different line. \u201cI just wish I could find a man who doesn\u2019t own a single stock!\u201d she cracked.Yu Hua is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Seventh Day.\u201d This essay was translated by Allan H. Barr from the Chinese.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Perils of Ever-Changing Work Schedules Extend to Children\u2019s Well-Being", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Abercrombie & Fitch announced last week that it would stop requiring workers to be on call for shifts that could be canceled with little notice, making it the latest retailer to pull back from such scheduling practices.Although the workers directly affected by unpredictable schedules are the most obvious winners, the biggest beneficiaries of a change in the practice could be their children. A growing body of research suggests that children\u2019s language and problem-solving skills may suffer as a result of their parents\u2019 problematic schedules, and that they may be more likely than other children to smoke and drink when they are older.\u201cWe are all talking about this today,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, who is one of the bill\u2019s lead sponsors. \u201cFive years ago, it was an issue people would have brushed to the corner.\u201d The bill has 69 co-sponsors; two Democrats also introduced companion legislation in the Senate.Among the needs that policy makers and activists working on the issue identify is finding stable, professional child care on a schedule that shifts from week to week.\u201cThe arrangements families put together are usually ad hoc,\u201d Ms. DeLauro said. \u201cThey have to rely on other family members, friends. If something breaks down in that chain, they have a problem.\u201dWhile all shifting schedules pose a challenge in this regard, on-call work may be unique in the way it complicates child care arrangements.Kris Buchmann of Albuquerque worked a retail job at a local mall when her son, now 3 \u00bd, was about 1 year old. She said she was frequently scheduled for on-call shifts that never materialized or that lasted less than an hour when they did.When Ms. Buchmann demanded a more stable schedule, her employer refused, an experience that is not uncommon. After that, she left the job.As practices like unpredictable scheduling have proliferated in recent years, fed by a shift toward lean staffing models made possible by sophisticated software, they have attracted public criticism.Several companies that received letters from the New York attorney general have denied that they use on-call scheduling for low-wage workers, or that it is common in their stores. Some retailers say that only a small fraction of their workers who have been on unpredictable schedules care for children.\u201cVery few of our store associates are working parents,\u201d said Michael Scheiner, a spokesman for Abercrombie & Fitch, which was among the letter\u2019s recipients.Because the practice is relatively new, however, scholars must infer its likely impact from research over the last decade showing the effects on children of parents working nonstandard hours, including night shifts, that have been more common for years.Professor Han, who was then at Columbia University, found that children of mothers who worked nonstandard schedules performed lower on problem-solving, verbal comprehension and spoken language tests than children of mothers who worked traditional schedules. Part of the explanation, she concluded, was increased stress on the part of the parents.\u201cParents try their best to attend to their children in a sensitive and warm manner, but the physical and emotional exhaustion from nonstandard schedules makes it difficult,\u201d Professor Han said in an interview. \u201cWith young children, if they\u2019re crying, asking for food, asking for something, it\u2019s all about how you interact with them.\u201dAnother key issue, she found, was access to quality child care. Children whose mothers worked nonstandard schedules during their first year of life were significantly less likely to be enrolled in professional day care centers throughout early childhood. This type of child care setting, she noted in the paper, tends to be associated with better cognitive development than informal arrangements like relying on extended family members, a frequent alternative.The specific effect of on-call work and other frequently changing schedules \u2014 as opposed to work hours that fall outside the traditional workday \u2014 is only beginning to be studied, but social scientists worry that it has similar implications for children.While the study did not examine the way this affected children, Dr. Henly suggested that the challenges posed by unpredictable work hours could take a toll on children as well. She also predicted that mothers with constantly changing work schedules would be less likely to enroll their children in preschool and other high-quality child care facilities.\u201cSome amount of early childhood education is important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to take advantage of those opportunities if you have a schedule that doesn\u2019t allow you to get your kid there.\u201d\u201cA lot of times we find that they don\u2019t last very long,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely impossible for working parents to meet their responsibilities to their families and hold down a job at a company with on-call shifts.\u201dStill, even parents who don\u2019t work on-call jobs often have little advance notice of their schedules. In many companies that officially promise to make schedules available in advance, Ms. Gleason said, \u201cmanagers edit the schedule up until the hours someone is supposed to come in.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the effects on children of their parents\u2019 unpredictable work schedules misstated part of the name of a group in which Kris Buchmann, who left a retail job because of the difficulties in arranging child care, is active. It is Organizers in the Land of Enchantment, not Organizers in the Land of Enrichment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Takes Step Toward Reviving Nuclear Industry as It Restarts Reactor", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 For more than four years since the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima in 2011, Japan has been debating whether it should permanently abandon a technology that went so disastrously wrong but that for years was seen as essential to its economy.Governments have offered differing answers. The public has sent confusing signals.The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe supports restarting idled reactors that meet the enhanced safety standards, arguing that Japan\u2019s economy depends on the low-cost power they provide.Japan has few domestic energy sources, and it imports virtually all the fossil fuels it uses to power its homes and factories. Electricity prices in the country have increased 20 percent or more since the Fukushima disaster, squeezing households and businesses and obstructing efforts by Mr. Abe to stimulate the economy. Emissions of greenhouse gases have risen sharply, too.The public remains skeptical about the plants\u2019 safety, however, with surveys consistently showing that most Japanese favor closing the idled reactors permanently. A group of 150 to 200 protesters, including a former prime minister who turned against nuclear power after Fukushima, gathered outside the Sendai plant on Tuesday as the police stood guard, the Japanese news media reported.\u201cBy moving ahead with restarts, the Abe administration is leading a doomed country,\u201d the former prime minister, Naoto Kan, was quoted as saying.But public opposition to nuclear power has not translated into victories for antinuclear politicians like Mr. Kan. Not long after the Fukushima accident, his government announced a policy of gradually phasing out nuclear power, but that foundered after his center-left party was defeated in an election in 2012.\u201cAbe has kept his focus on the economy, and the opposition is weak, so he has managed to win people\u2019s support in spite of the fact that most don\u2019t like his defense and nuclear policies,\u201d Shinichi Nishikawa, a professor at Meiji University, said. \u201cBut the limits of that approach are starting to show.\u201dThe government and power companies have certainly tried to move cautiously. Plans to restart Sendai and other reactors have been in place since the revised safety regulations were introduced more than two years ago. The plants need to be retrofitted with new ventilation systems and other protections, and operators have needed to court local political leaders for endorsements to switch them back on. The Sendai plant was declared safe by regulators nearly a year ago, in September 2014.How extensive Japan\u2019s nuclear revival will ultimately be remains unclear. Some of the 48 operable reactors around the country are considered too old to be worth the cost of retrofitting to meet the new safety standards. Concerns about earthquake faults found under or near others have kept them from winning approval from the government regulatory body, which was reorganized and given more independence after the Fukushima disaster.Power companies have applied for safety certification for about half the 48 units. So far only five, including the one restarted at Sendai, have been declared safe.The utility that owns the Sendai plant, Kyushu Electric Power, said it removed control rods from the core of the reactor at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, initiating the atomic reaction that will eventually produce electricity. It plans to start producing and transmitting electricity for its customers next month.The national broadcaster NHK aired video of workers in the plant\u2019s control room as they restarted the reactor. Tomomitsu Sakata, a spokesman for Kyushu Electric Power, said the reactor had been put back online without any problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn the Soviet era, the political joke was the first line of defense against the machinery of repression. The jokes are cropping up again, many over Vladimir Putin\u2019s zany crackdown on European flowers and food imports, like the satirical video \u201cDeath of a Parmesan,\u201d in which the destruction of foreign cheeses becomes a ballad about a heroic military campaign. \u201cThis song is about the unusual stupidity of today\u2019s Russia,\u201d reads the caption.That looks like cutting off the nose to spite the face, especially at a time when Russians are experiencing the first sustained decline in living standards in the 15 years since Mr. Putin first came to power. But Mr. Putin\u2019s instinctive response to any problem is usually to blame the West and its \u201cagents\u201d in Russia.The message he apparently wants to get across is that Russia is standing up to the perfidious West, whether by bravely destroying its food or blocking its bugs. A subsidiary hope is that restricting imports will bolster Russian production and reduce the resources spent on fancy foreign goods that flowed into the country in better days, and have continued to flow courtesy of smugglers and corrupt officials.It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the measures or their political impact, but Mr. Putin still appears to be enormously popular with the masses. Equally clearly, there is an educated layer of the population that doesn\u2019t buy into the Western conspiracies or Ukrainian adventures and sees Mr. Putin\u2019s war on food for the propaganda gimmick it is.Fooling his people may buy Mr. Putin time, and Russians are famously capable of sacrifice. But time and sacrifice will be useful only if Mr. Putin starts to come clean with his people, instead of feeding them propaganda, and begins to look for real solutions to the mess in Ukraine instead of inventing Western conspiracies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many Sailors Are Not Put Off by Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Polluted Waters ", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Putting aside concerns over health risks to athletes, about 339 sailors from 52 countries will begin racing here Saturday on the picturesque and polluted Guanabara Bay in the second official test race ahead of next year\u2019s Summer Olympics.Several sailors said this week that based on their practices, they were increasingly growing accustomed to and willing to accept the reality that will face them at next summer\u2019s Games. The Australian Jason Waterhouse, who with his partner, Lisa Darmanin, races in the Nacra 17 class, acknowledged, \u201cIt\u2019s not the cleanest bay in the world, and I can pretty much guarantee it won\u2019t be ready for the Olympics.\u201dBut he and Darmanin, who fell into the water this week, said they had not become ill and were taking necessary precautions. Still, Waterhouse said: \u201cIt\u2019s in the back of your mind, that\u2019s for sure. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re so focused on racing that you\u2019ll do anything for the gold medal.\u201dOther athletes more familiar with Guanabara Bay said they had even noticed an improvement compared with the last test race, which was held here one year ago and drew loud complaints from racers. Australia\u2019s Nathan Outteridge, who with Iain Jensen races in the 49er class \u2014 they won a gold medal in the 2012 Olympics in London \u2014 said that in terms of debris in the water, \u201cThis year it seems like it\u2019s a lot cleaner.\u201dPollution in Guanabara Bay as well as Rio\u2019s other waters is a decades-old problem and well known to local residents. It gained newfound attention last month after The Associated Press reported that a monthslong study it had commissioned showed high levels of viral and bacterial content in several locations in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s waters, including Guanabara Bay.That report was published just before visits by International Olympic Committee officials, including the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach. It also came at a sensitive time for Brazilians, who face a contracting economy and political tension less than a year before the Games open. President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s approval is in the single digits, and many Brazilians remain angry about what they describe as the broken promises and largely failed legacy of last year\u2019s World Cup.Cleaning up Guanabara Bay was to be one of the main legacies of the Olympics, Rio de Janeiro officials said when Brazil was awarded the Olympics; for many of the Olympic sailors here, water pollution in Rio is not a new problem.The United States team, for example, set up a training base across the bay in Niter\u00f3i in 2013. It has since put in hundreds of days of training and racing in and out of Guanabara Bay, said Josh Adams, managing director of U.S. Olympic Sailing.That is especially true for athletes in the classes of Laser, Laser Radial, 470M, 470W, 49er, 49er FX and Finn, Adams said, but officials said sickness caused by water had not been an issue for the Americans. Adams said that cumulatively, \u201cOur team has sailed here for hundreds of days without major incident.\u201dThat is not to say the Americans think the water is pristine. \u201cWe have our concerns and we got ahead of it several years ago,\u201d Adams said. That included conducting their own tests of the water quality in the bay, Adams, said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to monitor it.\u201dRaw sewage is pumped into the bay, a result of the city government\u2019s inability to build a proper disposal system, but that mainly affects the marina where the sailboats are launched and is less of a problem the farther boats get from shore. In fact, three of the six courses are outside Guanabara Bay, in an area that Adams described as \u201carguably one of the most spectacular places to sail in the world.\u201dThe problem of debris on the water seemed to be more of a concern for several athletes.\u201cMy biggest fear isn\u2019t getting sick,\u201d Waterhouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s more the performance issues affected by running into collecting garbage in the bay while sailing.\u201cThat can end a race. That\u2019s my biggest fear.\u201dOutteridge concurred, saying that although his fears of illness had abated, he had renewed concerns about running afoul of items in the water. He said that in a recent race, he dropped to seventh place from second because his boat ran into a trash bag.Whether officials can do much to clean up the water is unclear because few expect any improvement in the city\u2019s sewage system. The teams have expressed little interest in changing the site of the Olympic sailing competition, especially given how much time they have spent learning winds and currents here. Adams, the United States official, said that \u201cU.S. Sailing does not advocate a venue change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Malaysia\u2019s Welcome Wears Thin", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the last decade, economic growth \u2014 combined with a push to become a leader in education and information technology in Southeast Asia \u2014 has made Malaysia a magnet for students and immigrants from Africa. It should be a success story of progress and cultural exchange, but recently tensions have escalated.In May, a 30-year-old Nigerian student was sentenced to death in Kuala Lumpur for trafficking 1.7 pounds of methamphetamine. It was the second capital sentence handed to a Nigerian citizen in Malaysia in two months, following the sentencing of another student, also for meth trafficking.Sandwiched between these headline cases was a more minor crime story \u2014 but still a revealing one. A 46-year-old Malaysian schoolteacher, who had \u201cmet\u201d a man on Facebook and fallen in love, agreed to loan him the huge sum of $31,000. When she finally met him in person, the man, whom she\u2019d thought was Caucasian, turned out to be Nigerian. He offered to repay the debt \u2014 but the bank notes he gave her were counterfeit.The publicity over such high-profile criminal cases involving Africans (mostly Nigerians) has helped inflame widespread prejudices in a country that until recent years had had little contact with Africans.According to the most recent available figures, 79,352 African citizens entered the country in 2013; and in 2012, 25,467 student visas were issued to Africans. Many, like those on a student exchange plan at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, sponsored by Kano State in Nigeria, are drawn by Malaysia\u2019s fast-growing, well-equipped higher education institutes, which offer the chance of better employment both in Malaysia and back home.For many African Muslim students, Malaysia also offers the chance to practice their faith in a modern, cosmopolitan environment. One young Nigerian couple I chatted with at the airport last year explained how their master\u2019s degrees in engineering from Malaysia had led to employment with a respected company in Lagos, and they now traveled frequently for work.Given Malaysia\u2019s efforts to transform itself into an educational hub open to foreign labor and talent, these kinds of stories should be news, but they aren\u2019t. Instead, a narrative of cooperation between Malaysia and African countries has increasingly morphed in the popular imagination into nightmarish scenes involving African criminality.Malaysia\u2019s modern infrastructure, efficient banking system and reliable Internet connectivity have, according to a Reuters report, made it an \u201cepicenter\u201d of online schemes \u2014 with Nigerians in particular said to be using Malaysia as an operating base. American women have been a major target of these frauds, with the United States Embassy in Kuala Lumpur reporting in 2014 that Internet fraud made up 80 percent of inquiries to duty officers, with a dozen new cases every week.The tricksters use persuasive stories \u2014 posing, for example, as an American Christian stuck in a Muslim-majority country who needs cash to get home. American officials report more than 600 cases a year, with most victims losing, on average, sums \u201cin the tens of thousands\u201d; two women each lost more than $250,000.These con men, like many of the convicted drug mules and dealers, have often entered the country on student visas, which are easy to obtain and rarely attract follow-up checks. As a result, local prejudice is running high against Africans generally.Malaysians rarely bother to make distinctions between Nigerians and Ghanaians, Kenyans and Tanzanians. The press, politicians and the public refer to them as \u201cAwang Hitam\u201d; the rough translation \u201cblack guy\u201d fails to convey the expression\u2019s pejorative edge.Recently, an upscale condominium development in Petaling Jaya, a city near Kuala Lumpur, tried to ban Africans from renting apartments within the complex. After negative publicity, the developers backed down, but it is an index of how intense the loathing has become in some quarters.The increasingly entrenched nature of anti-African sentiment was encapsulated in last year\u2019s widely read editorial in one of the country\u2019s most influential Malay-language dailies, Utusan Malaysia. Titled \u201cMalaysia Can Do Without \u2018Pak Hitam\u201d\u2019 (a variation of \u201cAwang Hitam\u201d), it summed up a prevailing view of Africans in Malaysia: that all the stories were the same, and all the stories were bad. It went on to list the social problems caused by Africans, from serious crimes like drug trafficking and online fraud to gathering in large groups and \u201ccolonizing residential areas.\u201dIt is in this last grievance that a clash of cultures becomes clear: Africans are accused of rowdiness, drunkenness and harassing local girls \u2014 all of which represents the antithesis of the behavior expected in a conservative Asian country. Afraid to challenge these African immigrants because of their physical size, large numbers and \u201ccoarse character\u201d \u2014 according to the editorial \u2014 Malaysians watched as their neighborhoods were overrun by \u201cPak Hitam.\u201dMany Malaysians argue that the sheer number of offenses committed by Nigerians and other Africans justifies their jaundiced blanket view \u2014 though actual figures are hard to come by. According to a Nigeria-based nonprofit organization, the Legal Defense and Assistance Project, there are 132 Nigerians serving sentences in prison in Malaysia, with several on death row \u2014 but the project was able to gather data from only two of the country\u2019s seven maximum-security prisons.Whether or not there is a crime wave caused by Africans, many Malaysians definitely have a perception that one is happening. And this is feeding deep-rooted prejudice. I once witnessed a local woman on a train holding her nose when sitting next to a passenger of African appearance.With Malaysian companies like the industrial multinational Sime Darby starting to invest heavily in the growing economies of Africa, and Malaysian universities continuing their drive for fee-paying foreign students, the flow of people between Malaysia and Africa seems unlikely to abate. And neither, anytime soon, does the climate of xenophobia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teacher Shortages Spur a Nationwide Hiring Scramble (Credentials Optional)", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROHNERT PARK, Calif. \u2014 In a stark about-face from just a few years ago, school districts have gone from handing out pink slips to scrambling to hire teachers.Across the country, districts are struggling with shortages of teachers, particularly in math, science and special education \u2014 a result of the layoffs of the recession years combined with an improving economy in which fewer people are training to be teachers.At the same time, a growing number of English-language learners are entering public schools, yet it is increasingly difficult to find bilingual teachers. So schools are looking for applicants everywhere they can \u2014 whether out of state or out of country \u2014 and wooing candidates earlier and quicker.Some are even asking prospective teachers to train on the job, hiring novices still studying for their teaching credentials, with little, if any, classroom experience.Louisville, Ky.; Nashville; Oklahoma City; and Providence, R.I., are among the large urban school districts having trouble finding teachers, according to the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents large urban districts. Just one month before the opening of classes, Charlotte, N.C., was desperately trying to fill 200 vacancies.\u201cWe are no longer in a layoff situation,\u201d said Monica Vasquez, chief human resources officer for the San Francisco Unified School District, which offered early contracts to 140 teachers last spring in a bid to secure candidates before other districts snapped them up. \u201cBut there is an impending teacher shortage,\u201d Ms. Vasquez added, before correcting herself: \u201cIt\u2019s not impending. It\u2019s here.\u201dWith state budgets rallying after the recession, spending on public schools is slowly recovering, helping to fuel some of the hiring. In California, Gov. Jerry Brown persuaded voters in 2012 to pass a sales and income tax measure that raised funding for public schools.And that has led districts here \u2014 and elsewhere \u2014 to people like Jenny Cavins.Ms. Cavins, 31, who once worked as a paralegal and a nanny, began a credentialing program at Sonoma State University here in Rohnert Park less than a year ago. She still has a semester to finish before she graduates. But later this month she will begin teaching third grade \u2014 in both English and Spanish \u2014 at Flowery Elementary School in Sonoma. Ms. Cavins said she would lean on mentors at her new school as well as her professors. \u201cYou are not on that island all alone,\u201d she said.Esmeralda Sanchez Moseley, the principal at Flowery, said she could not find a fully credentialed \u2014 let alone experienced \u2014 teacher to fill the opening. \u201cThe applicant pool was next to nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Six years ago, this would not have happened, but now that is the landscape we are in.\u201dIn addition, the number of emergency temporary permits issued to allow noncredentialed staff members to fill teaching posts jumped by more than 36 percent from 2012 to 2013.At California State University, Fresno, 100 of the 700 candidates enrolled in the teacher credentialing program this year will teach full time while completing their degree.\u201cWe don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Paul Beare, dean of the university\u2019s school of education. \u201cBut we do it.\u201dSome educators worry that as school districts scramble to fill empty slots, the quality of the teaching force could weaken.\u201cThere are not enough people who will look at teacher education or being a teacher as a job that they want to pursue,\u201d said Carlos Ayala, dean of the school of education at Sonoma State University.Ashlee Pepin, 31, turned down several opportunities to work as a teaching intern while still earning education credentials at Sonoma State because, she said, she had seen the difference \u201cbetween a teacher who is passionate and has a lot of skill, and a teacher who is just there.\u201dMs. Pepin, who graduated in June, will begin teaching special education next week at an elementary school in Petaluma, north of San Francisco. \u201cI wanted to make sure I was prepared,\u201d Ms. Pepin said on a recent morning as she sorted through old textbooks in her new classroom.Recruiters from Oklahoma City have traveled to Puerto Rico and Spain on the hunt for teachers, while in Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district in North Carolina, the superintendent, Ann Blakeney Clark, tells audiences at every community meeting she attends that the schools are desperate to hire. \u201cI\u2019ve gone on to say \u2018Everyone in this room knows someone who was a teacher, who is a teacher,\u2019\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201c\u2018And I am asking you to email, text or call them and invite them to teach in Charlotte.\u2019\u201dLast spring here in Rohnert Park, about 50 miles north of San Francisco, the superintendent, Robert A.

{"Headline": "China Seeks to Calm Markets as It Devalues Currency for 3rd Consecutive Day", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China on Thursday sought to calm fears that the country\u2019s depreciating currency had set off, as authorities defended the devaluation decision.The country\u2019s central bank has pushed the value of the currency lower for three consecutive days. Since Tuesday, the currency, the renminbi, has fallen 4.4 percent, the biggest drop in decades.While China said the move was aimed to make the currency more market-oriented, it has raised concerns that the already slowing economy was in deeper trouble. The sharp and sudden fall has also prompted questions about whether the country\u2019s leadership can manage the slowdown.At an ad hoc news conference on Thursday, officials from the central bank defended the devaluation, saying that the currency had not entered a free fall. The central bank also said it would continue to intervene, as necessary.Zhang Xiaohui, an assistant governor at the central bank who became a member of its monetary policy committee in June, added that there was \u201cno basis for the continued depreciation of the renminbi.\u201d\u201cFrom a long-term view, the renminbi remains a strong currency,\u201d Ms. Zhang said, adding that \u201cin the future, the renminbi will be back on the appreciation track.\u201dFor more than a year, China\u2019s slowing economy has created pressure on the renminbi to weaken. Despite that, the government held to its longstanding practice and kept it closely linked to the dollar, which has grown stronger as the United States\u2019 economy has rebounded.Previously, the central bank assigned a value to the currency each morning, allowing its value against the dollar to rise or fall by a maximum of 2 percent. In practice, it barely budged more than a small fraction of a percentage point each day.Now, policy makers say they will give market forces greater sway over currency\u2019s value. The official exchange rate will be set based on the renminbi\u2019s trading performance, not simply by a government decree.These charts show the relative currency strength of East Asia\u2019s three largest economies over the last 15 years.\u201cThe central bank has withdrawn from the normal mode of intervention,\u201d Yi Gang, the deputy governor of the bank and the head of the unit that runs China\u2019s foreign exchange system, said in Beijing. \u201cBut if you say the market has commonly recognized rules of the game, then those are still the rules that we lay out.\u201dCommenting on reports that the bank was aiming for a 10 percent devaluation, Mr. Yi told reporters in Beijing that \u201cthis is nonsense and is totally unfounded.\u201dBy devaluing the renminbi now, China has also helped its exporters, whose goods will become relatively cheaper for overseas buyers. Bank officials on Thursday denied this was their goal in pushing down the currency.\u201cThey intervened massively and drove the exchange rate up,\u201d said Arthur R. Kroeber, the managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial consultancy.But the new system \u201cis clearly on the spectrum of a much more market-exchange-rate environment,\u201d he added.On Thursday, trading slowed, although activity picked up in the final few minutes of the day. The renminbi weakened only slightly, by 0.2 percent. This suggested that, under the new system, the central bank would not be under pressure to make another drastic shift in the renminbi\u2019s trading range on Friday.Stock markets across the region recovered modestly on Thursday after the recent sell-off, led by Shanghai, where the main index finished 1.8 percent higher after two days of declines. Other currency markets outside China also stabilized, including the South Korean won, which rose against the dollar in late Asian trading.Mr. Yi did not directly comment on intervention when asked about it on Thursday, but hinted it was a tool still at the central bank\u2019s disposal.\u201cWhen there\u2019s excessive volatility in the market, it can still be effectively managed,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an assistant governor at the Chinese central bank. The assistant governor, Zhang Xiaohui, is a woman.Adam Wu contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Challenged on Left and Right, the Fed Faces a Decision on Rates", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 Conservative activists who want the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates distributed chocolate coins in golden wrappers at the local airport last week as Fed officials arrived for their annual policy retreat.Liberal activists in green \u201cWhose Recovery?\u201d T-shirts formed a receiving line at the resort hotel in the heart of Grand Teton National Park where the meeting was held, to personalize their argument that the Fed should wait.Investors, who always pay attention to the Fed, are paying particular attention now. The central bank has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008; the impending end of that era is one cause of recent financial market turmoil.But the Fed\u2019s plans have also become the latest point of contention in a broader debate about the government\u2019s management of the American economy, pitting liberals who see a need for more aggressive measures to bolster growth against conservatives concerned that Washington and the Fed are already doing much too much.\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be this intense interest in a quarter-point increase, and there shouldn\u2019t be this intense interest in whether it comes in September or December,\u201d said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist and the Fed\u2019s vice chairman in the mid-1990s. \u201cBut the Fed remains the center of the financial universe. People stare at it like they stare at the North Star.\u201dIn the decades before the financial crisis, policy makers generally agreed that central banks should focus on moderating inflation. Now, both that goal and the best way to achieve it are subjects of debate. Liberals argue that the Fed should aim more broadly to lower unemployment and encourage rising living standards. Conservatives want to strengthen the focus on inflation by requiring officials to follow rules in making policy.With the critics lining up outside, central bankers found no escape inside the main conference, where a series of academics warned policy makers that their view of inflation was oversimplified, and that their policies were less effective as a consequence.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.\u201cThe conference was more about what we don\u2019t know, about a candid willingness to analyze what we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor at London Business School and former director general of research at the European Central Bank. \u201cIt did not really inspire confidence\u201d in monetary policy.Central bankers, however, have shown little interest in paradigm shifts. Several said that the basic understanding of inflation, while obviously imperfect, remains more functional than any alternatives.\u201cI don\u2019t think the folks at the Fed are of a mind to redesign monetary policy just because of what happened during the crisis,\u201d said Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.Indeed, V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, vice president of the European Central Bank, said the euro area was currently experiencing \u201ca renaissance of the Phillips Curve.\u201dBut his bottom line, too, was that the Fed understands inflation well enough to predict its movements. While domestic inflation has been surprisingly sluggish for years now, Mr. Fischer said on Friday that his confidence in an eventual rebound remained \u201cpretty high.\u201dThe organizers of the fringe conferences acknowledged the odds against their more radical proposals.The Center for Popular Democracy, which organized the \u201cFed Up\u201d campaign, wants the Fed to keep rates near zero even as overall unemployment falls, to spur wage gains and help members of minorities, in particular, find jobs. It brought about 50 people to Jackson Hole as part of an effort to engage community groups that generally focus on civil rights or local issues like minimum wage laws.Dawn O\u2019Neal, 48, makes $8.50 an hour as a day care worker in suburban Atlanta; her husband has not found regular construction work in a year. When Ms. O\u2019Neal needs a refill on her asthma medication, she cuts back on food, buying hot dogs instead of beef and canned vegetables instead of fresh vegetables.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like anyone at the Fed has ever had to make a decision about whether to eat or get medication, and so when I hear that they\u2019re going to raise interest rates in September, it angers me and it scares me,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neal said.The protesters struck a chord with some officials at the main meeting. Jason Furman, President Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser, went downstairs and delivered an impromptu speech. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on monetary policy, but what I can say is that monetary policy matters,\u201d he told the activists. The prosperity of the late 1990s, he added, resulted in part from \u201ca set of decisions made by the Federal Reserve that allowed that to happen.\u201dOther officials, however, said the push for low rates was misguided.\u201cThe biggest risk for those that are less fortunate is that we would go back into recession,\u201d said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who said he leaned toward raising rates in September. \u201cI\u2019m hoping my policy would lengthen out the expansion longer.\u201dThis view has few fans among the central bankers, who see their own judgment as an essential part of policy making.Mr. Blinder said part of the disconnect between the officials and the activists may reflect that broader concerns motivate liberals and conservatives. Conservatives see the Fed as enabling the growth of the federal debt, while liberals see the Fed as contributing to the rise of inequality.Mr. Blinder said the central bank had little power to reverse either trend. \u201cThey overstate the importance and power of the Federal Reserve,\u201d he said. All it can do, he added, is \u201caddress these problems around the edges.\u201dAn article on Monday about pressure on the Federal Reserve from groups with differing ideas on when the Fed should raise interest rates misidentified, in some editions, the group that organized the \u201cFed Up\u201d campaign, which wants the Fed to keep rates low, to lower unemployment rates and to raise living standards. It is the Center for Popular Democracy, not the Center for Public Democracy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is India Selling Out Its Tigers?", "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionINDIA\u2019S tigers are in danger. In the year since the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has laid siege to the country\u2019s environmental laws, threatening to undo recent conservation successes that have increased tiger numbers. India is the planet\u2019s last stronghold for tigers, home to almost three-quarters of the 3,200 that remain in the wild across Asia.Tigers have survived and prospered here because of increased protection and government efforts to relocate villages outside reserves, giving the big cats more space. A recent government census counted 2,226, a 30 percent increase in four years, and though researchers questioned the survey\u2019s methods, there\u2019s no question that tiger numbers are up.But the Modi government\u2019s aggressive focus on development threatens both the cats\u2019 future and the nation\u2019s environment. India is razing forests and flooding them with dams, giving the go-ahead for new mines and pushing rapid industrialization. The 2015 budget cut funding for the environment ministry by 25 percent and support for tiger protection by 15 percent.At an international business meeting, the prime minister vowed to make India the \u201ceasiest\u201d place to do business, noting, \u201cwe need the enabling policy framework.\u201dToward that end, the government is moving swiftly and systematically to alter environmental regulations. Last August, a high level government committee was given the impossible task of reviewing the country\u2019s major environmental laws and suggesting overhauls, all within a few months. Most of the committee members lacked environmental expertise, recommendations were not reviewed by independent authorities and most outside input was \u201cinvited.\u201dThe resulting report recommended radical changes to the country\u2019s legal framework governing forests, wildlife, the environment, water, air and land rights that would fast-track coal mines, dams, roads, railways and other projects. The Modi government is now drafting changes to those environmental laws.The environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, claims that his goal is \u201cdevelopment without destruction.\u201d Yet proposed projects would bring widespread devastation of land and forests.Among them is a river-diversion scheme that would submerge nearly one-third of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a project that had been shelved by Jairam Ramesh, the environment minister under the previous national government, who had called it a \u201cdisastrous\u201d idea. A road that runs along the edge of the Pench Tiger Reserve is slated to become a four-lane highway \u2014 without overpasses for wildlife at crucial crossings. New coal mines are planned for central India, where hundreds of tigers live in a string of reserves.Over 125 dams have been proposed for northeast India\u2019s mighty Brahmaputra River system, including the huge Dibang River project, which was twice rejected by the previous government because it would inundate pristine forest. One gem at risk from dams planned or being built is Kaziranga National Park, home to more than 100 tigers, huge elephant herds and Asia\u2019s largest population of Indian one-horned rhinos.Beyond current efforts to rewrite India\u2019s environmental laws, the Modi government is also trying to limit expert and public participation in the process. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of muzzling of voices,\u201d said Mr. Ramesh, the former environmental minister. \u201cEnvironmental activism is now seen as a threat to the country\u2019s economic growth prospects.\u201dIn January, the Ministry of Home Affairs prevented the Greenpeace campaigner Priya Pillai from flying to England, where she was scheduled to speak to members of Parliament about the impact of coal mining in India. The government then froze the group\u2019s bank accounts, and in April, it canceled the registration of nearly 9,000 charities and advocacy groups.Critics charge that other high level committee recommendations, if implemented, would be like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. Inspections would be curtailed and it would be left to businesses to voluntarily disclose their pollution and monitor their compliance. States would be given substantial power to approve development projects like dams, roads and mines. Critics worry that it is at the state level where the influence of private interests can hold powerful sway.The committee also suggested barring the National Green Tribunal from weighing environmental impact in cases. The tribunal is among the most effective environmental courts in the world, the environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta said. \u201cThey want to curtail its power.\u201dThis eco-backlash stems from an entrenched environment-versus-growth debate. But the claim that environmental regulation is straitjacketing the economy is unfounded. A vast majority of major development projects are approved, according to Mr. Dutta. Delays often stem from missing information or local corruption \u2014 not from over-regulation, he said.India has a strong environmental legacy, with exemplary wildlife laws going back more than 40 years. The Constitution requires every citizen \u201cto protect and improve the natural environment.\u201d In 2010, India signed an international agreement pledging to do \u201ceverything possible to effectively manage, preserve, protect, and enhance habitats\u201d of tigers.India has done an incredible job creating 48 tiger reserves, but many are small green islands. Cats and other species can\u2019t survive long-term without the few tenuous wildlife corridors that connect parks. Corridors allow tigers to establish their own territory, move, mate, hunt and escape monsoon flooding. Projects that bisect or eliminate them could spell doom for isolated populations.Vast amounts of money and effort have been spent protecting the country\u2019s tigers, with legions of rangers risking their lives. Safeguarding tigers has had far-reaching benefits. The forests they inhabit act as huge carbon vaults, provide buffers from flooding, clean the air and purify drinking water for millions of people.Though tigers have increased, the land is in decline. India loses an average of 333 acres of forest daily. Two of its rivers (including the sacred Ganges) are among the world\u2019s most polluted, and 13 of the 20 cities with the most polluted air are in India, with Delhi at No. 1.Loosening rules under these circumstances, with the growing specter of climate change, seems unwise. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m exaggerating,\u201d said Ashok Khosla, the first director of India\u2019s Office of Environmental Planning and Coordination, \u201cbut it sounds to me as if we have a cliff ahead of us and we have our foot on the accelerator.\u201dIndia must, of course, develop. About two-thirds of its population lives on $2 a day or less and 400 million lack electricity. But \u201cgreen accounting\u201d must be part of the development equation. Dismembering protective laws will have untold consequences: The country will ultimately have to pay for short-term corporate profits with denuded land, polluted air, scarce, filthy water, ill health and the loss of its mighty national animal, the tiger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Nokia Layoffs, Tech Workers in Finland Regroup and Refocus", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI remember those sleepless nights,\u201d said Mr. Kalliola, 42, who holds a Ph.D. in radio engineering.This fast influx of unemployed tech workers like Mr. Kalliola into the Finnish economy has left policy makers with a headache \u2014 one that many of their counterparts elsewhere would most likely welcome.Yet Finland \u2014 whose population is roughly the same as Minnesota\u2019s \u2014 has almost the opposite problem: a surplus of these workers, who were left jobless after a series of layoffs at Nokia and Microsoft. How to solve this problem has left policy makers and tech companies trying to turn Nokia\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s pain into Finland\u2019s gain.In part, the relatively soft landing among workers is a result of efforts by the Finnish government. Just as Nokia began to lay off its employees, politicians started providing government grants, entrepreneurship programs and other training to help the thousands of laid-off tech workers start their own companies. In addition, companies outside Finland have opened offices there, lured by the available workers.Finnish politicians have also forced Nokia \u2014 and are putting pressure on Microsoft \u2014 to support former employees\u2019 re-entry into the labor market. The help includes one-off grants for new business ventures and allowing former employees to use some of the companies\u2019 intellectual property, like unwanted patents, almost free of charge.\u201cBoth Nokia and Microsoft have shown substantial responsibility in mitigating the impact of the layoffs,\u201d Olli Rehn, the country\u2019s minister of economic affairs, said in an interview. \u201cFinland remains a stronghold for the global tech industry.\u201dOne of the individuals helping to lower this number is Risto Kivipuro, who was 58 and a lifelong Nokia employee when his team was scrapped in 2012.A group of younger former colleagues persuaded him to join a fledgling company, Piceasoft, which is based on the mobile data-transferring technology they built at Nokia. Through a government-sponsored program, the small team licensed the software \u2014 almost free \u2014 from Nokia and received tens of thousands of dollars from their former employer to fund their start-up.By tapping into the wide diaspora of former Nokia sales employees \u2014 many of whom had also recently lost their jobs \u2014 they have been able to sign up mobile operators as clients from Germany, across Central Europe and even Russia.\u201cAt 58, no one was going to hire me,\u201d Mr. Kivipuro said. \u201cIf I had known that running my own business was so fun, I would have left Nokia a lot earlier.\u201dSeveral of the Finnish cities most affected by the big job cuts have pushed to attract other tech companies, using the available local tech talent as a major selling point.ARM Holdings, the British designer of digital products, and MediaTek, the Taiwanese semiconductor company, have recently set up research and development facilities in Oulu \u2014 in the far north of Finland \u2014 hiring teams of former Nokia engineers.\u201cIf you need to find a complete development team, then there are probably people in Oulu who can do that for you,\u201d said Juha Ala-Mursula, director of economic development for the city of Oulu, where Nokia manufacturing and design teams were severely hit by the company\u2019s multiple rounds of layoffs.\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see what happened at Nokia,\u201d he added. \u201cBut when a large tree falls, you need to plant a lot of small ones to take its place.\u201dSome Finnish investors and entrepreneurs, though, express doubts about former Nokia employees\u2019 entrepreneurial skills. Creating a new company, they say, is far different than being a valuable worker at a large established one.\u201cNokia wasn\u2019t a school for entrepreneurship,\u201d Mr. Saarnio said. \u201cMost people have a lot to learn.\u201dYet for Pekka V\u00e4yrynen, who after leaving Nokia co-founded an industrial design company that makes mobile devices, the chance to take control of his career outweighed any perks offered in his former corporate position.\u201cIn the final days at Nokia, it took so long to make any decision,\u201d said Mr. V\u00e4yrynen, 54, whose company, Creoir, recently helped design a smartphone for Marshall, the renowned amplifier manufacturer. \u201cWe\u2019re now making our own choices.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Turmoil Sinks Sewer Bond", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a few days earlier, Puerto Rico petitioned the United States Supreme Court asking for the right to restructure its debt \u2014 which has reached $72 billion \u2014 under its own quasi-bankruptcy law. Puerto Rico, a United States commonwealth, enacted the law last year because it has no access to the federal bankruptcy courts. But the law was later found unconstitutional and was voided by the courts.Investors who at one time might have been potential buyers of the water and sewer bonds seemed taken aback by the island\u2019s move, on the one hand, to sell new bonds (and incur new debt) while also telling the Supreme Court that it had to restructure its old debt.\u201cYou could take it on face value and say, \u2018Either they\u2019re lying to investors about the bonds being payable, or lying to the Supreme Court about the bonds being unpayable,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics, a financial research firm. \u201cI see it as a blunder, ultimately, and not anything more heinous, but it really undermines their ability to negotiate.\u201dTaken together, the steps demonstrate some of the confusion within the government as it faces a Sept. 1 deadline to outline its restructuring plan. A working group, appointed by the governor, has been trying to put a proposal together for several months. But in a signal of political conflicts to come, the island\u2019s main opposition party has dropped out of the group.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we wait till Sept. 1 and then we\u2019ve got a road map to fixing everything,\u201d said Kent Collier, chief of Reorg Research, a firm that monitors Puerto Rican affairs for clients that include hedge funds. About two months after the restructuring plan is issued, he said, the government is supposed to seek the authorizing legislation, setting off an unpredictable political process.Eventually, Puerto Rican officials have expressed hopes of resolving their problems through a global debt-for-debt swap, in which the holders of the island\u2019s bonds would turn those in and receive new bonds that would be worth less but be far more likely to be paid off. But the details are sketchy and many other things must happen first.\u201cTheir economy does need to grow, and I don\u2019t disagree that their debt is too high to do all the things they need to do to make their economy grow and provide for the health and welfare of their citizens,\u201d said Gerry Durr, senior municipal credit analyst at Wilmington Trust. \u201cBut you know, I think the only way this thing really gets solved is if there\u2019s a strong, independent control board, and I don\u2019t think Congress has the appetite to impose one.\u201dUntil recently, senior Puerto Rican officials had sought to reassure investors that its water and sewer authority, known as Prasa, was a credible borrower.Puerto Rico announced Prasa\u2019s plans to issue the $750 million of bonds just days after another branch of the government had defaulted on a different group of bonds, but the president of the Government Development Bank, Melba Acosta Febo, said that was not relevant.It \u201creflects the individual financial circumstances of the various debt issuers across the commonwealth,\u201d she said.The bonds that defaulted were issued by the Public Finance Corporation, a small, single-purpose entity that has no power to levy taxes. Its bond-marketing materials warn that investors will have little or no recourse in the event of a default.Prasa, by contrast, provides essential services and can increase rates, within reason, because it is a monopoly. Prasa\u2019s bondholders have a first claim on that revenue if cash gets tight, and they can bring in a receiver to enforce collections.In addition, the new Prasa bonds were expected to include such investor-friendly terms as a make-whole agreement, which would discourage Puerto Rico from refinancing them at lower interest rates in the future, if Puerto Rico\u2019s fortunes changed for the better.\u201cThey were within striking distance of settling this deal,\u201d said Stephen Snowder, an associate editor at Reorg Research.But the deal started to come unglued on Friday, after Puerto Rico filed its petition to the Supreme Court. It sought a review of the legality of its so-called Recovery Act, which tried to create a bankruptcylike restructuring framework for public corporations on the island. Among other things, the petition said that it needed to have a legal framework in case Prasa\u2019s debts have to be restructured.\u201cThat\u2019s not the phrase you want in the middle of a bond deal,\u201d said Mr. Fabian.On Monday, Prasa filed a statement from Victor Su\u00e1rez Mel\u00e9ndez, the governor\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cWe currently do not contemplate Prasa necessitating a restructuring of its debt,\u201d he said.But Mr. Suarez also tried to explain why Puerto Rico needed a safe place to restructure: \u201cIf any Puerto Rico utility ever needs to restructure its debts, it should be done in a way that is fair not only to their creditors but also to the people such utilities serve.\u201dThe next thing Mr. Snowder knew, he said, the deal was off. He said a colleague called Prasa\u2019s executive president, Alberto L\u00e1zaro, Monday evening to find out what was going on.\u201cVictor Suarez was making nice statements, and then a couple of hours later, we had L\u00e1zaro telling us that the deal was delayed, postponed or canceled,\u201d said Mr. Snowder. \u201cNo one has explained it to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exxon and Chevron Report Worst Quarterly Results of Current Decade", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe two American oil giants are better off than most of their smaller peers, who in recent days have been cutting their payrolls, writing down assets and in some cases reporting losses. The oil giants\u2019 refinery businesses benefit from the grinding drop of commodity prices, but the strength of their global diversified businesses was not substantial enough to balance the reduced revenue of their exploration and production businesses.The gloomy mood among oil executives was summed up this week by Al Walker, Anadarko\u2019s chief executive, who told analysts, \u201cIt just seems unlikely that we will have the kind of margins that we have seen historically that would encourage us to go back into a growth mode.\u201dBut the company announced it was scaling back share buybacks as cash flows tighten because of low oil and gas prices. Analysts estimated that Exxon buybacks would be a tenth what they were just four years ago, when energy prices were far higher. Not expecting a rebound in oil and gas prices anytime soon and trying to conserve cash, the company cut its spending in the quarter, reducing capital and exploration expenditures 12 percent to $16 billion.\u201cA second straight quarterly loss in the U.S. production segment was a surprise, given that oil prices were higher than the last quarter,\u201d said Brian M. Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones.Energy companies that have long been known for hefty profits are now forced to cut investments around the world. Rystad Energy, a consulting firm based in Norway, has estimated that the cuts will amount to $180 billion in 2015 alone. That has brought tens of thousands of job losses, which are beginning to hurt the economies of energy-rich states like Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas.Its oil and gas production businesses actually lost money, $2.22 billion, in contrast to earning more than $5 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company announced a write-down on assets of $1.96 billion. This week the company said it would cut 1,500 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $1 billion.\u201cOur upstream businesses were particularly hard hit,\u201d said Chevron\u2019s chief executive, John Watson, \u201cas lower prices reduced revenues and triggered impairments and other charges.\u201d He added, \u201cMultiple efforts to improve future earnings and cash flows are underway.\u201dThere was some good news in the Chevron results. Earnings from its refinery businesses, which make gasoline, lubricants, diesel and other refined products, were lifted by stronger margins to nearly $3 billion from $721 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, production of oil and gas was up 2 percent because of new or stepped-up operations in Argentina, Bangladesh and the Permian basin in West Texas.Nevertheless, analysts expressed disappointment.\u201cSecond-quarter earnings were lower than expected for both companies, a disappointment for Exxon and a disaster for Chevron,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \u201cBoth lost money in the U.S., especially Chevron.\u201dThe lower oil prices are helping consumers. The AAA motor club reported that gasoline prices are falling at the fastest rate since January, declining 16 days in a row for a total of 11 cents a gallon. The average price nationally for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.66, the lowest for this time of year since 2009.Most energy analysts expect that oil prices will decline through at least the end of the year.\u201cOil prices will be under downward pressure until there is evidence the glut is shrinking,\u201d IHS Energy, a consultancy, projected in a report on Friday. \u201cThis will not happen quickly unless prices fall even further from recent levels.\u201dThe IHS Energy report noted that global oil production had gone up, not down, this year because of production in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Together, they have increased their output by two million barrels a day, far outstripping demand. It further projected that oil prices would have to slide closer to $40 a barrel for several months before a decline in United States output would erode the global glut.A $40 price would be ruinous for many small, independent oil companies operating in the shale fields of North Dakota and Texas, where break-even well costs average about $60 a barrel. The domestic rig count has already dropped roughly 60 percent, but it takes time before the output of new wells falls. Many of the small companies have remained solvent because they have price hedges on their output, but those hedges will begin to run out this year and next.Some analysts, however, think prices could rebound. A Barclays report on Friday said the high output by several members of the OPEC cartel was not sustainable, and a drop in production and exports would help tighten the market. The report noted that pipeline disruptions tied to political violence in Iraq were already taking a toll. It also said that Iranian oil was not likely to be a significantly larger portion of the global market until at least the middle of 2016.And perhaps most important, the Barclays report noted, \u201cU.S. production will fall in 2016 if prices stay at these levels.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bungling Beijing\u2019s Stock Markets", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is ruled by a party that calls itself Communist, but its economic reality is one of rapacious crony capitalism. And everyone has been assuming that the nation\u2019s leaders are in on the joke, that they know better than to take their occasional socialist rhetoric seriously.Yet their zigzagging policies over the past few months have been worrying. Is it possible that after all these years Beijing still doesn\u2019t get how this \u201cmarkets\u201d thing works?The solution is to invest less and consume more. But getting there will take reforms that distribute the fruits of growth more widely and provide families with greater security. And while China has taken some steps in that direction, there\u2019s still a long way to go.Meanwhile, the problem is how to sustain spending during the transition. And that\u2019s where things have gotten weird.The response of the Chinese authorities was remarkable: They pulled out all the stops to support the market \u2014 suspending trading in many stocks, banning short-selling, pushing large investors to buy, and instructing graduating economics students to chant \u201cRevive A-shares, benefit the people.\u201dAll of this has stabilized the market for the time being. But it is at the cost of tying China\u2019s credibility to its ability to keep stock prices from ever falling. And the Chinese economy still needs more support.So this week China decided to let the value of its currency decline, which made some sense: While the renminbi was clearly undervalued five years ago, it\u2019s significantly overvalued now. But Chinese authorities seem to have imagined that they could control the renminbi\u2019s descent, taking it a couple of percent at a time.They appear to have been taken completely by surprise by the market\u2019s predictable reaction; namely, the initial devaluation of the renminbi was \u201cthe first bite of the cherry,\u201d a sign of much bigger declines to come. Investors began fleeing China, and policy makers abruptly pivoted from promoting currency devaluation to an all-out effort to support the renminbi\u2019s value.The common theme in these wild policy swings is that China\u2019s leadership keeps imagining that it can order markets around, telling them what prices to reach. And that\u2019s not how things work.I\u2019m not saying governments should never interfere with markets, or even set limits on prices. There is, as I\u2019ve written in the past, a strong case for raising the minimum wage and in general for promoting higher wages for American workers; there\u2019s an even stronger case for effective financial regulation.But these were short-lived actions, taken at times when markets seemed to have lost their bearings. Staffers at the Federal Reserve used to call these moves \u201cslap in the face\u201d interventions. That\u2019s very different from the kind of sustained intervention and political dictation of prices China seems to imagine it can pull off. Do the country\u2019s leaders really not understand why that won\u2019t work?If they really don\u2019t, that\u2019s a big concern. China is an economic superpower \u2014 not quite as super as the United States or the European Union, yet, but big enough to matter a lot. And it\u2019s facing tough times. So if its leadership is really as clueless as it has been looking lately, that bodes ill, not just for China, but for the world as a whole.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Fox News Moderators Look for Ways to Keep 10 Candidates on Their Toes", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLEVELAND \u2014 Just over 24 hours before the first Republican primary debate here, more than a dozen Fox News executives and producers gathered Wednesday with their debate moderators \u2014 Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace \u2014 backstage at Quicken Loans Arena for a final run-through of logistics.The Fox News team had already spent weeks discussing how to handle the challenges that have made this debate, 15 months before Election Day, such highly anticipated viewing: a robust field of 10 candidates, including, of course, the man atop the polls, Donald J. Trump, known for his ability to overtake almost any event and upend the rules of political discourse.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows \u2014 maybe he doesn\u2019t know \u2014 what you\u2019re going to get from Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Wallace said after the meeting. \u201cWhat makes it such compelling television is that sense of, at the very least, uncertainty, and at the very most, danger.\u201dAnd so they found themselves, sitting at a long table, trying to minimize danger and uncertainty, while maximizing the sleek and high-octane television for which Fox News has become known. The team had already decided to eliminate opening statements from the field, to save time. Instead, at 9 p.m. sharp, the questions will begin.To keep the debate on schedule, the Fox team was also discussing a possible alternative to the usual gentle ding sound that signals that a candidate\u2019s time has expired: the actual shot-clock buzzer used during Cleveland Cavaliers basketball games, which are played at the same arena.\u201cYou could make it about synergy in that arena: Use the very same buzzer that LeBron James hears on the court when the shot clock runs out,\u201d said Mr. Baier, who had come up with the idea over dinner Tuesday night at a local bistro. (\u201cI was inspired,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cby a beer.\u201d)Though the best debates often turn on unexpected moments, television networks spend months trying to script their own parts, down to the very last word and camera angle. And for Fox News, the highest-rated cable station in the country, the stakes could not be greater.The network gave a reporter behind-the-scenes access to debate preparations \u2014 everything from ensuring that the lecterns are evenly spaced (42 inches apart, to be exact) to the precise moment the candidates will take the stage (at 30 seconds after 8:56 p.m., sharp) to tweaking the wording of the questions (strictly off the record, until the debate begins).\u201cThere\u2019s really no margin for error,\u201d said Jay Wallace, vice president for news and senior executive producer of news and politics.\u201cSo many people are just so interested in this debate. Whether it\u2019s the number of candidates or Donald Trump, there\u2019s been a spotlight on this one that is unlike any other debate we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dFox News has perhaps more on the line than other debate hosts. The network occupies an exalted place among the conservative base, which views it as the one of the few fair alternatives to what it sees as the otherwise liberal news media.But Fox News journalists, including the three moderators, are known for their hard-hitting questions, often putting Republicans on the spot and on the defensive. Each of the moderators can point to moments \u2014 whether in an interview with a Republican candidate or during a previous debate \u2014 when they earned plaudits for their tough questions and revealing answers.A look at the line-up for Thursday night\u2019s debate in Cleveland, the first of the Republican primary contest, which will be broadcast by Fox News, and how each candidate could gain with a strong performance.\u201cIf you look at last time, we got a lot of criticism from the right wing saying we were too tough, and I think that in the main, that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Mr. Baier said. \u201cHow are you going to go up against the Clinton machine if you can\u2019t handle us?\u201dThe challenge, however, is balancing the desire for good television \u2014 which Mr. Trump and his outbursts provide \u2014 with the rigors of an informative debate.\u201cIt\u2019s like 100 details must be done right, and the high-wire act of it is, if the most important one or the least important one fails, then it can take the whole thing down,\u201d said Michael Clemente, the executive vice president for news editorial of Fox News. \u201cEven bad lighting on a candidate can make all the difference in the world.\u201dThe network is also trying to seize every opportunity. In the editorial meeting Wednesday, Chris Wallace suggested that once the entire group of candidates was onstage, it might be nice to have a quiet moment to observe the body language dynamic. \u201cYou always kind of want to see who is ignoring whom, who is talking to whom,\u201d he said.Then they got down to business, talking through questions. The moderators have spent weeks writing (and rewriting) about 100 potential questions, roughly half of which will actually be asked. Though they have eight to 10 broad topics they plan to raise, including immigration and the economy, the moderators found themselves working down to the wire to refine their questions and think through smart follow-ups.\u201cEveryday I spend a fair amount of time on my iPhone tightening them, redoing them, refining them, further researching them, bolstering them, eliminating them, and starting anew on some,\u201d Ms. Kelly said.Bill Sammon, vice president for news and Washington managing editor, urged the group to keep in mind two additional types of queries: timely ones off late-breaking news and ones \u201cwe might have missed.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want the weird, \u2018If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?\u2019 but you might want questions that are more 30,000-foot altitude questions,\u201d Mr. Sammon said. Citing the growing size of the federal government, he added, \u201cYou know, a question off a broad overarching theme that\u2019s going to be important to a voter that\u2019s dialed in at home.\u201dIn addition to the buzzer, the network will have a staff member in the control room with a stopwatch, timing the candidates and making sure that everyone is receiving roughly equal broadcast time.And if they still go long, the moderators are prepared to politely cut them off. \u201cI have no problem doing that,\u201d Ms. Kelly said with a laugh.On Wednesday afternoon, the moderators dialed into a New York editorial meeting led by Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman and chief executive. After walking the group through programming logistics and details like lighting and camera angles, he signed off by reminding them that Fox News has become must-watch viewing for presidential debates.\u201cFifty years ago, the broadcast networks owned politics and the presidential debates, and now our one cable channel that we built less than 20 years ago is where everyone turns to watch these events,\u201d Mr. Ailes said. \u201cGo out there and be confident and be yourselves. I know everyone will do a great job, and I\u2019m proud of all of you.\u201dLater, Ms. Kelly referred back to advice Mr. Ailes often gives her: Aim to hit singles, not home runs. \u201cWe have very tough, pointed questions for these guys, but I am not trying to hit any home runs,\u201d she said. \u201cI only want to advance the debate about the candidates. If we can flesh out some of the issues and some of their character and help the audience have a better feeling for who they are \u2014 as men and as candidates \u2014 then I\u2019ve done my job.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Sea With Joseph Conrad", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "OpinionLearning about life, from the age of the great sailing ships.Supported byTHE tall ship Corwith Cramer stumbled into the Celtic Sea, engine roaring, 7,500 square feet of sail furled up mute. Its two masts ticked against the horizon like a metronome set to allegro. I joined a row of pallid sailors crouched at the leeward rail. Foam-lathered swell swung for my face, then reeled abruptly away. By the third time I threw up over the side, the \u201cwine-dark sea\u201d of Homer\u2019s poetry just looked like the basin of a billion vomits.Misery loves blame, so I blamed Joseph Conrad, whose fiction had brought me here. Before Conrad published his first novel in 1895, he spent 20 years working as a merchant sailor, mostly on sailing ships, and fully half his writing \u2014 including \u201cHeart of Darkness,\u201d \u201cLord Jim\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Sharer\u201d \u2014 deals with sailors, ships and the sea. These loom so large for him that as I have researched a book about Conrad\u2019s life and times, I have felt it essential to travel by sea myself.I had already taken passage from China to England on a giant container ship, tracing a historic route with the comforts of a queen-size bed, round-the-clock hot water and a mass of steel as big as the Empire State Building between me and the sick-making swell. But the more I read Conrad, the more I realized that I had to get on a tall ship like the ones he knew best, and experience its unique ways of moving, working and speaking.By \u201ccruise\u201d I don\u2019t mean a pleasure cruise. For the 12 bright, game students who boarded with me in Cork, this was a floating boot camp. Under the patient instruction of 13 professional crew members, the students plunged into a grueling schedule of round-the-clock watch duty, hauling and heaving lines, setting and striking sails, scrubbing dishes and floors. They were learning the ropes just as Conrad did, 140 years ago.It\u2019s hard to think of a less relevant skill in today\u2019s job market than knowing your jib halyard from your main sheet. The truth is, these skills were already becoming obsolete when Conrad went to sea in the 1870s. Oceangoing steamships were the way of the future: bigger, faster, more reliable.Steamers needed engineers in place of sailmakers, firemen to shovel coal into boilers, not leather-palmed shellbacks to hand, reef and steer. Because steamships also had much higher cargo capacity than sailing ships, the total number of British ships \u2014 and jobs \u2014 went down, even as the volume of trade increased. Conrad consistently took positions below his certified rank, on poorly paid and uncomfortable routes.By the early 1900s, steamships outnumbered sail on the high seas, and the \u201cage of sail\u201d passed into memory like a beloved grandmother. Conrad published an elegy of sorts with a book of essays called \u201cThe Mirror of the Sea\u201d (1906). The sailing ship floats over its pages as an ethereal ghost of \u201ccobwebs and gossamer,\u201d drawing \u201cits strength from the very soul of the world.\u201dBut Conrad wasn\u2019t being emptily nostalgic. He recognized that technological progress, for all its much-heralded benefits, comes with social and ethical costs. To operate a sailing ship was to master a \u201ccraft.\u201d You had to observe and interpret nature, adapt and react to fast-changing conditions, obey without question, decide without doubt, toil without pause. The craft connotes more than a clutch of skills; it is a code for how to live. It turns a sailing ship into a \u201cfellowship,\u201d a community forged by shared values.\u201cThe taking of a modern steamship about the world,\u201d by contrast, \u201chas not the same quality of intimacy with nature,\u201d Conrad insisted. \u201cIt has no great moments of self-confidence, or moments not less great of doubt and heart-searching.\u201d It lacks \u201cthe artistic quality of a single-handed struggle with something much greater than yourself.\u201dANYTIME Conrad sets a story on a steamship, you can be pretty sure something will go wrong. It certainly did for him. In 1890, with good berths harder and harder to come by, Conrad signed a three-year contract with a Belgian company to captain steamboats on the Congo River. Europeans regarded steamships as engines of civilization: They opened the interior of Africa to Western products and ideals.But when Conrad arrived in Congo, he quickly discovered that the rhetoric of progress and civilization masked a colonial regime of appalling rapacity and violence. After just one trip upriver, he resigned in disgust. \u201cEverything here is repellent to me. Men and things, but men above all.\u201d Conrad returned to Europe in the grip of near-suicidal depression, and never sailed the same way again.Conrad recast his experience in the novella \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d (1899), in which a veteran sea captain, Charlie Marlow, describes his journey up a river in Africa to fetch the rogue agent of an ivory-trading company. Bit by bit, Marlow registers the hypocrisy and senseless violence of European activity. At one point en route, he hears what he thinks are war cries from the banks, but then realizes they are a lament: \u201cThe glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief.\u201d That is because they know that a steamship spells their subjugation.Toward the end of the trip, Marlow stops at a riverside hut. Inside, he discovers, of all things, a book. \u201cIt was an extraordinary find. Its title was, \u2018An Inquiry into some Points of Seamanship,\u2019 by a man Tower, Towson \u2014 some such name \u2014 Master in his Majesty\u2019s Navy\u201d and it \u201cwas sixty years old\u201d \u2014 a relic from the golden age of sail. Marlow loses himself in its pages as if in \u201cthe shelter of an old and solid friendship.\u201d It \u201cmade me forget the jungle,\u201d and imparted \u201ca delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real.\u201d The manual has no practical relevance for a Congo steamship, but it reminds Marlow of something more essential: the ethics of sail he fights to uphold in the savage world of steam.When I lurched belowdecks on the Corwith Cramer, my stomach voided, I found it hard to credit Conrad\u2019s enthusiasm for the sailing ship. It was rank, dank, dark, cramped and besides, as the engine ceaselessly screamed, the sails weren\u2019t getting us anywhere. Seawater frothed like spinning laundry against a porthole. I focused on the rusty beads of water gathering on the ceiling of my bunk. On the first mate\u2019s advice, I had duct-taped \u201cBaby Sesame Street\u201d-themed diapers over the rafters to catch the drips. I dozed off wondering how anyone had figured out how to draw a recognizably juvenile Muppet.Then came the calm. The motor snapped off. My eyes, knees and stomach all fit in the same, stable body. When I went up on deck, I saw a sprightly team of students setting sails. We moved by the power of nature and muscle, and a craft refined over centuries.I disembarked from the Corwith Cramer knowing things I had not appreciated otherwise. I learned that to stay on course at the helm you have to watch the horizon more than the compass. I learned that sails balance a ship, so much so that oceangoing steamships carried rigs for stability long after they used them for auxiliary power. I learned how to steady myself by swinging like the gimbaled tables in the saloon, which seesawed wildly with the ship\u2019s roll while plates and glasses didn\u2019t budge.Sailing in Conrad\u2019s tracks has made me think afresh about progress and obsolescence. When I hear people say that everything\u2019s changed (or should) in the digital age, I look at the ocean. The 21st-century economy depends more than ever on ships, which carry 90 percent of global trade. Sending data \u201cinto the ether\u201d often means sending it through cables laid across the sea floor, just like the telegraph.The ocean also shows the failures of progress. It is where thousands of refugees drown trying to reach prosperity. It is where slavery and piracy flourish in the face of modern law. It is where industrial chemicals and plastics pollute and destroy ecosystems.And it is where, with rising sea levels, the planet pays us back even beyond Conrad\u2019s imagination for our embracing fossil fuels over the enduring benefits of sail.Advertisement"}

Wall Street\u2019s best-known investment bank has joined an illustrious list of Chinese fakes that belie a very real Chinese strength.If you think like an emerging-market entrepreneur, stealing an idea seems like a victimless crime. Neither the developer in Chongqing who ripped off an iconic skyscraper by architect Zaha Hadid nor the makers of the faux British village outside Shanghai are fooling anyone. Piracy can damage brands, for sure. Like the $30 Jimmy Choo stilettos for sale on e-commerce site Taobao, however, most counterfeits aren\u2019t going after consumers of the original item.The case of the Shenzhen-based leasing company called Goldman Sachs is a bit more complex. The bank\u2019s Chinese name translates roughly as \u201chigh and flourishing.\u201d Perhaps the Chinese copycat simply searched online for its fairly generic name and found a handy, pre-made Anglicism, complete with logo. It happens, especially in a country where many citizens don\u2019t read Roman characters.China\u2019s big problem enforcing antipiracy laws remains troubling. Nearly two-thirds of the goods seized by United States Homeland Security last year were made in China. There is much to admire, however, about the related ability to work around systemic weaknesses to get things done. In Silicon Valley, it is often a virtue. Similarly, a keen eye for loopholes has nurtured private companies in a state-controlled economy, and funneled lifesaving capital to companies ignored by big banks.That pluck and ingenuity deserves more credit. If China\u2019s readiness to bend the rules could only be channeled into more productive \u2013 and original \u2013 endeavors, it might be very powerful indeed.Then one day China might really have its own Goldman Sachs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Candidates and Obama\u2019s Failure to Fail", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrange, isn\u2019t it? The shared premise of everyone on the Republican side is that the Obama years have been a time of policy disaster on every front. Yet the candidates on that stage had almost nothing to say about any of the supposed disaster areas.And there was a good reason they seemed so tongue-tied: Out there in the real world, none of the disasters their party predicted have actually come to pass. President Obama just keeps failing to fail. And that\u2019s a big problem for the G.O.P. \u2014 even bigger than Donald Trump.Start with health reform. Talk to right-wingers, and they will inevitably assert that it has been a disaster. But ask exactly what form this disaster has taken, and at best you get unverified anecdotes about rate hikes and declining quality.Needless to say, right-wing think tanks are still cranking out \u201cstudies\u201d purporting to show that health reform is a failure. But it\u2019s a losing game, and judging from last week\u2019s debate Republican politicians know it.Which brings us to the economy.O.K., there are many reasons to qualify that assessment, notably the fact that measured unemployment is low in part because of a decline in the percentage of Americans in the labor force. Still, the Obama economy has utterly failed to deliver the disasters \u2014 hyperinflation! a plunging dollar! fiscal crisis! \u2014 that just about everyone on the right predicted. And this has evidently left the Republican presidential field with nothing much to say.What\u2019s the common theme linking all the disasters that Republicans predicted, but which failed to materialize? If I had to summarize the G.O.P.\u2019s attitude on domestic policy, it would be that no good deed goes unpunished. Try to help the unfortunate, support the economy in hard times, or limit pollution, and you will face the wrath of the invisible hand. The only way to thrive, the right insists, is to be nice to the rich and cruel to the poor, while letting corporations do as they please.According to this worldview, a leader like President Obama who raises taxes on the 1 percent while subsidizing health care for lower-income families, who provides stimulus in a recession, who regulates banks and expands environmental protection, will surely preside over disaster in every direction.But he hasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying that America is in great shape, because it isn\u2019t. Economic recovery has come too slowly, and is still incomplete; Obamacare isn\u2019t the system anyone would have designed from scratch; and we\u2019re nowhere close to doing enough on climate change. But we\u2019re doing far better than any of those guys in Cleveland will ever admit.Advertisement"}

Even if it\u2019s not as fast as we would like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving,\u201d Doug McMillon, president and chief executive of Walmart Stores, said in a statement.\u201cIn this case, our desired changes require investments, which are pressuring earnings this year. We\u2019re confident that our strategic plan will create robust sustainable growth for shareholder returns over time,\u201d he said.Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., joins a flurry of retailers reporting second-quarter earnings this week, some of which are gaining traction with the economic recovery better than others.Home Depot raised its annual forecast for the second time this year, spurred by a rebound in the housing market. Capitalizing on customers\u2019 hunger for deals and discounts, TJX, which operates the T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores, said sales this year would exceed expectations.But American Apparel, the struggling clothing retailer, warned this week of slumping sales and a fast-dwindling cash position, and said it might not be able to stay in business.For Walmart, once thought unstoppable, the latest numbers underscore the challenges it still faces as it tries to move on from a period of prolonged decline in sales and market share.The lackluster results also test Walmart\u2019s commitment to improving the lot of its 1.3-million-strong work force and to revamping customer service at its 5,000 American stores, as well as online.Walmart acted to raise wages for its lowest-paid hourly store employees after nationwide campaigning by labor activists and others who highlighted the plight of low-wage workers in the fast-food and retail industries. A tightening job market brought on by the recovering economy also prompted Walmart to raise wages to attract more new workers and reduce turnover.In the short term, the investments will hamper profits, analysts said. Walmart reported second-quarter earnings of $1.08 a share, below analyst expectations of $1.12 a share.That was despite quarterly revenue of $120.2 billion, which was $500 million higher than forecast. Comparable sales at stores in the United States, or stores open at least a year, rose 1.5 percent, the fourth consecutive quarter of increases in the commonly used retail metric.The company lowered its full-year guidance to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 a share, from a previous range of $4.70 to $5.05.Walmart\u2019s investments will eventually pay off, Charlie O\u2019Shea, a vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in a note.Walmart\u2019s performance \u201creflects the negative impact on near-term earnings of long-term investments in e-commerce and in its employees that we believe will ultimately bear fruit,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Shea said.\u201cInvesting in the development of an online channel, which is in effect building a second business, is not cheap and results do not happen overnight,\u201d he said. Even Amazon\u2019s experience has shown that \u201cshort-term earnings can get a bit choppy.\u201dStill, Walmart\u2019s spending on wages, training and additional work hours at its stores has amounted to more than the retailer initially forecast, shaving 24 cents off its projected per-share earnings for the year, 4 cents more than expected.The extra hours, in areas like product stocking, \u201cwere significant, and more than we had planned,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in prepared remarks to investors.Walmart said the strong dollar continued to weigh on earnings. Problems on the international side of Walmart\u2019s business went beyond the strong American currency, however.Operating income from its international business fell even with currency swings factored in, hurt by poor performance in countries like Britain, where heightened competition in groceries drove down sales 4.7 percent.Mexico and Canada were among the only countries where Walmart logged strong sales gains.Walmart\u2019s spending on e-commerce appears to be paying off, at least. It said global e-commerce sales increased about 16 percent when excluding currency fluctuations.The company continues to open smaller stores, called Neighborhood Markets, to cater to consumers who increasingly prefer to shop at more central, convenient locations. Walmart said comparable sales at Neighborhood Markets increased approximately 7.3 percent, with strong growth from new stores.Walmart expects to open up to 170 Neighborhood Markets this fiscal year, adding to the 350 locations it has opened in the last two years.Walmart\u2019s pared-back forecast came in contrast to a bullish outlook from Home Depot, which expects earnings per share to grow 13 to 14 percent this year, above the 11 to 12 percent annual growth forecast in May.TJX also raised its outlook for the year to $3.28 a share from $3.24, saying it expected sales in stores open more than a year to grow 3 to 4 percent.At the opposite end of the earnings spectrum, American Apparel said in a filing on Monday that second-quarter sales slumped by as much as 17 percent, to $134 million. Its losses for the quarter came to 11 cents a share.American Apparel and its backer, the hedge fund Standard General, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the retailer\u2019s founder and chief executive, Dov Charney, who was ousted last year.The company, based in Los Angeles, said it planned to cut about $30 million in costs in a bid to stay afloat.

Stock markets also fell across the region. Hong Kong\u2019s main index fell 2.4 percent while in Japan the Nikkei 225 stock average closed down 1.6 percent. The sell-off was steeper in Southeast Asia, where the main share index in Singapore fell 2.9 percent, while Indonesia\u2019s Jakarta composite index closed 3.1 percent lower.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was down 2.5 percent at midday, while the FTSE 100 index in London was down 1.3 percent by late morning. The euro rose almost 1 percent, to $1.11.The renminbi fell sharply in offshore markets, where it is freely traded. The offshore renminbi weakened to around 6.5 per dollar in late Asian trading, displaying a record level of bearishness on the Chinese currency, as investors bet on further depreciation to come.In onshore trading in mainland China, where the renminbi is subject to a daily rise or fall of a maximum 2 percent, the currency at one point pushed up against the weak end of the trading band. But it recovered sharply late in the trading day on heavy buying volumes to close at 6.38 per dollar, weaker by 1 percent than Tuesday\u2019s market close.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.The onshore market closing level has taken on new significance since Tuesday, when China\u2019s central bank said the closing price would be used as the reference point for setting the renminbi\u2019s official exchange rate on the following morning.Citing unidentified people, Reuters and Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that the central bank intervened in the market, selling dollars and buying renminbi through state banks in order to support the Chinese currency. The reports could not be independently verified. Phone calls to the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s headquarters in Beijing rang unanswered after regular office hours.In a statement on Wednesday morning, China\u2019s central bank reiterated its pledge to give the market a bigger role in setting the exchange rate. But it sought to allay any concerns that the value of the renminbi would continue to spiral downward.\u201cBased on international and domestic economic and financial conditions, there is currently no basis for a continued depreciation of the renminbi exchange rate,\u201d the statement said.For one, it could help offset the country\u2019s slowing economy. Exports have been particularly hard hit, contracting by 8 percent in July, and a cheaper renminbi makes China-made goods relatively more affordable for consumers in the United States and Europe.At the same time, China is also seeking a greater role for its currency on the global stage. In recent months, policy makers have been lobbying the International Monetary Fund to include the renminbi in its basket of global reserve currencies, which includes the dollar, euro, yen and pound.That means convincing the fund that the renminbi is a freely traded currency.It added, however, \u201cThe exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Chinese diplomats raised concerns about recent police shootings in the United States. \u201cThe Ferguson case was raised briefly,\u201d Mr. Malinowski said, \u201cand I actually thought this was quite interesting because they said, \u2018We all saw that on TV,\u2019 and my response, without in any way diminishing the seriousness of the problem that we are facing in the United States, was, \u2018Exactly, you saw it on TV.\u2019\u00a0\u201dReporters in China are not free to report on similar episodes of violence, and victims, their family members and lawyers are not able to petition for redress without fear of retribution from the government, Mr. Malinowski said he told his Chinese counterparts, who did not participate in the news briefing.Mr. Malinowski, who served for more than a decade as the Washington director for Human Rights Watch, has long been a prominent and passionate advocate for human rights. While he promised that the Obama administration would advocate forcefully on these issues with the Chinese, his ability to deliver on that vow is far from clear.Profiles of some of China\u2019s most prominent civil rights advocates detained in a nationwide campaign.Mr. Obama has a long list of issues to discuss with Mr. Xi, including climate change, cybersecurity, open navigation of the South China Sea and economic concerns. And as China has become increasingly central to the global economy, its leaders have grown less willing to be lectured about human rights.While the human rights dialogue is supposed to be an annual affair, the two countries skipped having one last year, something Mr. Malinowski said he could not explain. Even the timing of Thursday\u2019s briefing \u2014 late in the afternoon on the eve of a visit to Cuba by Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 all but ensured that it would receive little news coverage. \u201cChina has become increasingly allergic to these human rights discussions,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cAnd China is strong enough now to set the terms of the discussion to its own benefit.\u201dChina has the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and it is so deeply integrated into the global economy that shifts in its policies or outlook have international repercussions. An abrupt devaluation of its currency this week, for instance, rattled stock markets around the world. Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, said that repression of rights in China had become so grave that Western governments could no longer ignore it. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer easy to draw a line between human rights issues and everything else,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. A bipartisan group from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter this week to Mr. Obama urging him to make human rights a \u201ckey and public component of the agenda\u201d during Mr. Xi\u2019s state visit. But the senators acknowledged in their letter that the two leaders had a long list of issues to discuss. Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, an international human rights organization based in Washington, said that China\u2019s increasingly intense censorship of the Internet had become a vital business issue for many American companies, blurring the lines between human rights and economic interests. For that reason, she said, American officials must raise human rights concerns more forcefully.\u201cYou can no longer separate the economic concerns of U.S. companies from the human rights concerns about citizens in China,\u201d Ms. Cook said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Howard Schultz: America Deserves a Servant Leader", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorFROM the earliest days of Starbucks, I\u2019ve been captivated by the art of leadership. I was mentored over three decades by Warren G. Bennis, the eminent professor and scholar on leadership. I\u2019ve gathered insights from peers, and I\u2019ve drawn inspiration from our 300,000 employees. But nothing I\u2019ve read or heard in the past few years has rivaled the power of the image I viewed on my cellphone a few years ago: Pope Francis, shortly after his election, kneeling and washing the feet of a dozen prisoners in Rome, one of them a young Muslim woman, in a pre-Easter ritual.In recent weeks, I have taken to recalling that humble, inspiring act of servant leadership as I observe the antithesis: a field of presidential aspirants unable to rise above petty politics. I know candidates want to play to the party faithful during the primary season, but the challenges facing us today are too dire for another status-quo election. We cannot afford more false promises, slogans, theatrics and fool\u2019s gold. Our nation has been profoundly damaged by a lack of civility and courage in Washington, where leaders of both parties have abdicated their responsibility to forge reasonable compromises to expand the economy, rebuild our infrastructure, improve schools, transform entitlement programs and so much more. We have become too desensitized to the horrendous metrics that define today\u2019s America, from student-loan debt to food-stamp dependency to the size of our prison population.As a boy growing up in public housing in Brooklyn, I was told by my mother that I could be the first in my family to graduate from college. A scholarship and an entry-level job at Xerox created a path upward that was typical for many of my generation.Despite the encouragement of others, I have no intention of entering the presidential fray. I\u2019m not done serving at Starbucks. Although we have built an iconic brand while providing even part-time employees with access to health care, free college education and stock options, there is more we can do as a public company to demonstrate responsible leadership.The values of servant leadership \u2014 putting others first and leading from the heart \u2014 need to emerge from every corner of American life, including the business community.While Americans have diverse views in what they want from Washington, I reject the notion that our divided and dysfunctional government is merely a reflection of what the political class calls the red-blue divide. Too many of our political leaders are putting party before country, power before principle and cynicism before civility. The common purpose that created this great nation, which has united us in difficult moments, has gone missing.Our country is in desperate need of servant leaders, of men and women willing to kneel and embrace those who are not like them. Everyone seeking the presidency professes great love for our nation. But I ask myself, how can you be a genuine public servant if you belittle your fellow citizens and freeze out people who hold differing views?Every one of the candidates offers grand promises about new leadership and new solutions. But where do they stand on working with their rivals? Regardless of who wins the presidency, the odds of the same party controlling a filibuster-proof Senate are slim. If we want to turn the nation around, we have to act differently. Save for the most rabid partisans, most people don\u2019t want one-party rule. They want Democrats and Republicans to work together.Americans who are tired of politics as usual should demand a clear answer to a simple question from every candidate: What will you do to unite all of us?Our country deserves a candidate courageous enough to select a member of the other party as a running mate. Our country deserves a president humble enough to see leadership not as an entitlement but as a privilege.The speculation about my candidacy reminds me of a lesson from a great Jewish leader. A decade ago, I visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem with Nosson Tzvi Finkel, a widely respected rabbi in Israel. As we approached one of the holiest sites in Judaism, the rabbi halted about 10 yards away as a crowd of admirers gathered nearby. I beckoned him further.\u201cI\u2019ve never been closer than this,\u201d the rabbi told me. Astounded, I asked why.\u201cYou go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not worthy.\u201dHoward Schultz is the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama to Unveil Tougher Environmental Plan With His Legacy in Mind", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the strongest action ever taken in the United States to combat climate change, President Obama will unveil on Monday a set of environmental regulations devised to sharply cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from the nation\u2019s power plants and ultimately transform America\u2019s electricity industry. As the president came to see the fight against climate change as central to his legacy, as important as the Affordable Care Act, he moved to strengthen the energy proposals, advisers said. The health law became the dominant political issue of the 2010 congressional elections and faced dozens of legislative assaults before surviving two Supreme Court challenges largely intact.The most aggressive of the regulations requires the nation\u2019s existing power plants to cut emissions 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation. That new rule also demands that power plants use more renewable sources of energy like wind and solar power. While the proposed rule would have allowed states to lower emissions by transitioning from plants fired by coal to plants fired by natural gas, which produces about half the carbon pollution of coal, the final rule is intended to push electric utilities to invest more quickly in renewable sources, raising to 28 percent from 22 percent the share of generating capacity that would come from such sources.In its final version, the rule retains the same basic structure as the draft proposal: It assigns each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants, but allows states to create their own custom plans for doing so. States have to submit an initial version of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018. But over all, the final rule is even stronger than earlier drafts and can be seen as an effort by Mr. Obama to stake out an uncompromising position on the issue during his final months in office.The anticipated final climate change regulations have already set off what is expected to be broad legal, legislative and political backlash as dozens of states, major corporations and industry groups prepare to file lawsuits challenging them. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, has started an unusual pre-emptive campaign against the rules, asking governors to refuse to comply. Attorneys general from more than a dozen states are preparing legal challenges against the plan. Experts estimate that as many as 25 states will join in a suit against the rules and that the disputes will end up before the Supreme Court. Leading the legal charge are states like Wyoming and West Virginia with economies that depend heavily on coal mining or cheap coal-fired electricity. Emissions from coal-fired power plants are the nation\u2019s single largest source of carbon pollution, and lawmakers who oppose the rules have denounced them as a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d \u201cOnce the E.P.A. finalizes this regulation, West Virginia will go to court, and we will challenge it,\u201d Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, said in an interview with a radio station in the state on Friday. \u201cWe think this regulation is terrible for the consumers of the state of West Virginia. It\u2019s going to lead to reduced jobs, higher electricity rates, and really will put stress on the reliability of the power grid. The worst part of this proposal is that it\u2019s flatly illegal under the Clean Air Act and the Constitution, and we intend to challenge it vigorously.\u201d Although Obama administration officials have repeatedly said states will have flexibility to design their own plans, the final rules are explicitly meant to encourage the use of interstate cap-and-trade systems, in which states place a cap on carbon pollution and then create a market for buying permits or credits to pollute. The idea is that forcing companies to pay to pollute will drive them to cleaner sources of energy.Mr. Obama tried but failed to push through a cap-and-trade bill in his first term, and since then, the term has become politically toxic: Republicans have attacked the idea as \u201ccap and tax.\u201d But if the climate change regulations withstand legal challenges, many states could still end up putting cap-and-trade systems into effect. Officials familiar with the final rules said that in many cases, the easiest and cheapest way for states to comply would be by adopting cap-and-trade systems. The rules take into account the fact that some states may refuse to submit plans, and on Monday, the administration will also unveil a template for a plan to be imposed on such states. That plan will include the option of allowing a state to join an interstate cap-and-trade system. Climate scientists warn that rising greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly moving the planet toward a global atmospheric temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point past which the world will be locked into a future of rising sea levels, more devastating storms and droughts, and shortages of food and water. Mr. Obama\u2019s new rules alone will not be enough to stave off that future. But experts say that if the rules are combined with similar action from the world\u2019s other major economies, as well as additional action by the next American president, emissions could level off enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change.Mr. Obama intends to use the new rules to push other countries to commit to deep reductions in their own carbon emissions before a United Nations summit meeting in Paris in December, when a global accord to fight climate change is expected to be signed.While opponents of the rules have estimated that compliance will cost billions of dollars, raise residential electricity rates and slow the American economy, the administration argues that the rules will save the average American family $85 annually in electricity costs and bring additional health benefits by reducing emissions of pollutants that cause asthma and lung disease.The rules will be announced at a White House ceremony on Monday and signed by Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. While the ceremony is scheduled to take place on the White House\u2019s South Lawn, officials said it might be moved indoors to the East Room after forecasters predicted that the weather would be too hot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalonia Calls Election in New Bid for Secession From Spain", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 A year ago, secessionist movements were all the rage in Europe \u2014 until they were not.But if Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain breathed a sigh of relief that the issue was behind him, he has reason again to worry.Catalan politicians have managed to revive the independence issue. Setting aside personal and political rivalries, they have formed a broad alliance of candidates whose aim is to turn a regional parliamentary election scheduled for September into a plebiscite on breaking away from Spain.Should their alliance secure a majority in the Sept. 27 vote, the secessionist leaders say they will proclaim independence within 18 months.The election, which was formally called on Monday by the Catalan leader Artur Mas, puts the thorny issue of Catalan independence back at the top of the national political agenda, just ahead of general elections expected before the end of the year.If nothing else, the quick return of the issue has demonstrated that while an independence referendum may have been previously blocked by Madrid, the grievances that animate Catalonia\u2019s secessionist drive have yet to be addressed.Those grievances have long included a mix of Catalonia\u2019s distinctive language and identity as well as complaints that the region, one of the richest in the country, has been economically squeezed to subsidize poorer parts of Spain.The pro-independence coalition in Catalonia, which calls itself Together for Yes, while not unanimous, is broad enough to present a credible threat.While Mr. Mas is expected to remain Catalonia\u2019s regional president should the joint ticket win next month, Together\u2019s list of candidates is officially led by a consensus candidate, Ra\u00fcl Romeva, who recently returned to Catalan politics from Brussels, after spending a decade as a Green member of the European Parliament.\u201cWe have reached a point of no return,\u201d Mr. Romeva said in an interview. \u201cThese are not normal but exceptional elections, whose goal is to find out whether there is a majority in favor of independence or not.\u201dMr. Rajoy, however, says his government and Spain\u2019s courts will once again strike down any Catalan decision that violates the Spanish Constitution. At the same time, statements from him and his government have grown more threatening.\u201cNobody is going to steal from Catalans their triple status as Catalans, Spaniards and Europeans,\u201d Mr. Rajoy told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cNobody will break up Spain in any way.\u201dSpain\u2019s justice minister, Rafael Catal\u00e1, warned last month that, if Catalonia\u2019s leadership violates the Constitution, Madrid was empowered to effectively seize control of Catalonia\u2019s administration and suspend its regional autonomy.Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Mas have been at loggerheads for three years. What started as a financial dispute over the tax contributions Catalonia should make to the rest of recession-hit Spain has turned into a full-fledged secession battle.The Catalan leader has also been emboldened by street protests in favor of independence \u2014 the next of which is scheduled for Sept. 11, Catalonia\u2019s National Day.Mr. Rajoy and Mr. Mas have in some ways benefited from feuding about Catalonia\u2019s future, at a time when both men have been undermined by corruption investigations relating to the financing of their respective parties.For Mr. Rajoy, it has allowed his governing Popular Party to present itself as Spain\u2019s flag-bearer while highlighting the ambivalence of other national parties toward Catalonia, notably Podemos, an insurgent far-left party that is competing in its first general election.But Mr. Mas has struggled to define his plans for Catalonia, beyond his vision of independence.\u201cMas has spent more time defending the right to independence than explaining what kind of independence and country he wants,\u201d said Salvador Garcia Ruiz, chief executive of Ara, a Catalan newspaper that has backed independence.While Mr. Mas talked on Monday about leading \u201can ancient nation that has the right to decide its own future,\u201d divisions remain even within the pro-independence camp.Teresa Forcades, a nun who recently took a leave of absence from her convent in order to campaign for independence, said in an interview that she opposed the joint list of candidates under the Together banner because it would allow Mr. Mas to forge ahead with the kind of public spending cuts that have been part of his conservative economic agenda.\u201cYou cannot hide the wallet behind the flag and use this election as if it was an independence referendum,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody should forget Mr. Mas is a neo-Liberal politician just like Mr. Rajoy, with the only difference that he\u2019s Catalan.\u201d Mr. Romeva, the coalition leader, acknowledged that asking Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million citizens to elect lawmakers based solely on their stance on independence was problematic, especially at a time of high unemployment and concerns over political corruption.\u201cAll our attempts to do things in the correct and most democratic way have been denied and on top of this with a belligerent attitude of bringing things to court,\u201d Mr. Romeva said. \u201cWould we have wanted to do it like in Scotland? For sure, but we have now at least on Sept. 27 the right to vote legally.\u201dMr. Romeva said Catalonia first needed to gain control of its economy before considering how best to improve it.As part of their secessionist plans, Catalan officials have recently talked about setting up an autonomous Catalan tax agency, based on the fiscal model of countries like Sweden and Australia.\u201cThese elections aren\u2019t about presenting an economic program \u2014 they go beyond that,\u201d Mr. Romeva said. \u201cA lot of the things that we want to do and change in terms of social economy and policies first require gaining resources that we don\u2019t have today.\u201dBut by calling a Catalan election a year ahead of schedule, Mr. Mas is forcing Catalans to confront their future without first finding out whether Mr. Rajoy can win another general election.Some here clearly preferred that the Catalan leader had waited.\u201cIt\u2019s not that Catalonia has reached a point of no return, but rather that we\u2019ve reached a complete breakdown in communications, which Rajoy has done nothing to improve, making it also easier for our own politicians to sell the nonsense message that we\u2019re somehow smarter than the rest of Spain,\u201d said Carlos Rivadulla, the deputy president of Businessmen of Catalonia, an association of entrepreneurs who oppose Catalan independence.\u201cIf the Popular Party doesn\u2019t win the next election,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be room for a new dialogue and to change radically the situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Turn off the loudspeakers, the North warned, or face \u201call-out war.\u201dIn the age of mass media, government-controlled in the hermetic North, and the Internet, which is banned there, the Cold-War style playing of antagonistic recordings through batteries of loudspeakers remains a provocative act here, largely because both sides deem it so.\u201cThey are an unbearable insult to his pride because they tell front-line North Korean troops, most of them sons of the elites, what they are not supposed to hear,\u201d said Shim Jin-sup, a retired psychological warfare officer in the South Korean military. \u201cThey help undermine the total information blackout in the North, Kim\u2019s dignity and the very foundation of his regime.\u201dFor the South, they fall under the military\u2019s psychological warfare operations, a bloodless escalation to be deployed in the endless pattern of provoke-negotiate-repeat that has characterized North-South relations since the Korean War ended 60 years ago.\u201cWe do this so that North Koreans can learn that the world is changing,\u201d Kim Min-seok, a ministry spokesman, said in a briefing. \u201cWe believe this helps significantly improve human rights of the North.\u201dOfficials say that depending on the weather and other conditions, the broadcasts can travel up to 12 miles over the border, reaching mostly North Korean border guards but also some front-line villages.Stung by the international news media\u2019s characterization of the broadcasts as propaganda, the Defense Ministry insisted that they be referred to instead as a \u201cvoice of hope.\u201d\u201cIf propaganda attempts to change the other side through distorted and exaggerated facts, what we do is not propaganda,\u201d Kim Min-seok, the ministry spokesman, said.These \u201cvoices of hope\u201d include calling Kim Jong-un \u201cchildish\u201d and \u201clacking confidence,\u201d according to military officials who heard the recording.\u201cKim Jong-un\u2019s incompetent regime is trying to cheat the world with absurd lies,\u201d was another, according to a snippet captured by a South Korean cable channel.\u201cSoldiers of the Korean People\u2019s Army!\u201d one recording said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your beautiful youth for the North Korean dictatorship but rise up against it!\u201dNot to be outdone, the North began broadcasting its own propaganda, but its decrepit sound system, handicapped by the country\u2019s spotty electricity, went largely unheard on the South Korean side, South Korean officials said.Emblematic of the two countries\u2019 relative economic health, the fences on the South Korean side are ablaze with blinding lights at night to detect infiltrators, while the North is shrouded in darkness.Dueling propaganda loudspeakers are hardly new. Germany and France exchanged loudspeaker taunts across their front lines in World War II.The Koreas have harangued each other at the border since 1962, with North Korean loudspeakers urging southerners to defect to the \u201csocialist paradise,\u201d a \u201ccountry with no taxes,\u201d and on the south side a giant electric billboard flashing the number of cars in \u201cFree South Korea.\u201dBoth sides deployed female voices, echoing over the hills day and night, to lure border soldiers to defect.Even after the North\u2019s economy collapsed in the 1990s, the loudspeaker war raged, until 2004 when, during a period of improved relations, both sides agreed to desist.If Kim Jong-un feared that his troops, spellbound by the synthesized siren-call of K-pop girl groups, would mutiny, that did not happen. More likely, the broadcasts mainly prick his cult of personality.In the North Korean textbooks, Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, single-handedly liberated Korea from Japanese colonial rule. He could turn sand into rice and pine cones into grenades, according to North Korean books and animations. Mr. Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, held 1,200 titles, including \u201cthe Guardian of the Earth.\u201dMr. Kim, whose favorite title is \u201cthe supreme dignity,\u201d has executed generals for offenses as minor as dozing off in his presence. His uncle was executed for, among other crimes, \u201chalfheartedly clapping his hands\u201d when Mr. Kim entered a conference hall.Loudspeakers from across the border represent one of the few public channels of information he cannot control. The United States-sponsored Radio Free Asia is another. Activists also regularly organize balloon drops, sending hydrogen balloons across the border carrying transistor radios, antigovernment leaflets, and DVDs and computer memory sticks loaded with South Korean movies and soap operas.\u201cWhat makes the loudspeakers so exasperating and infuriating for North Korea is that you can\u2019t do anything about them, except having to listen to them or plug your ears,\u201d said Jang Hae-sung, a former North Korean journalist.But beyond provoking Mr. Kim, it is unclear whether they have much effect.\u201cOther than episodic cases of defectors who claimed to have defected after listing to the broadcasts or reading leaflets, there is no evidence whatsoever that they are helping North Koreans develop a resistance against their system or a yearning for the South,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, an analyst at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. \u201cThey only incite the North into boosting their ideological education and animosity toward the South.\u201dThe speakers were turned off again on Tuesday, after the two sides reached an agreement, in exchange for a rare, face-saving expression of \u201cregret\u201d by North Korea over the Southern soldiers\u2019 injuries. The South retained the option of turning them on again if provoked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scandals in Brazil Prompt Fears of a Return to Turmoil", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuch turmoil was supposed to be a thing of the past in Brazil, a democracy that reduced poverty and greatly increased its global profile during the previous decade.Companies paid the bribes to win lucrative contracts with the oil company. Though Ms. Rousseff has not been charged, the bribery flourished while she was chairwoman of the board at Petrobras, and it continued during the first years of her presidency, opening her to claims that she was, at best, negligent in overseeing the company and its tendrils throughout government.As the revelations of corruption continue to come out, the country is showing deep signs of shock and outrage, with some of the same political figures accused of wrongdoing trying to use the upheaval to their advantage.\u201cAwaiting greatness from the political dwarfs who dominate the Brazilian scene is awaiting the impossible,\u201d said Cl\u00f3vis Rossi, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo.\u201cThe country is terrible with Dilma, but it would get worse without her,\u201d said Ronaldo Doria, 53, a math teacher, referring to the president by her first name.\u201cThe solution is not disrupting democracy,\u201d Mr. Doria added, arguing that some critics overlooked the long struggle to allow freedom of expression to flourish in Brazil. \u201cAt least those who criticize Dilma can do so without fear of getting arrested.\u201dThe political flux is all the more pronounced because the opposition seems nearly as adrift as Ms. Rousseff.The Brazilian Social Democracy Party, founded partly by leftist intellectuals who had opposed the military dictatorship, now embraces an amalgam of centrist, conservative and socially liberal views. Its leaders seem content to let Ms. Rousseff dangle in the wind, even if that means aggravating the uncertainty in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, and the reverberations it has sent through the economy.Two of the party\u2019s leaders, A\u00e9cio Neves, the senator who ran against Ms. Rousseff in 2014, and Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, said this week that it was not up to them to solve the political mess.Opposition legislators are seeking to start impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff. The president seemed to have a respite this week when Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate, who is also under investigation in the Petrobras scandal, expressed opposition to impeaching her. But in doing so, Mr. Calheiros managed to increase his own bargaining power, with Ms. Rousseff speaking favorably about his proposals to mend the economy.Only months after her re-election, Ms. Rousseff has watched her approval ratings plunge into the single digits in 2015, the lowest of any Brazilian president in decades, as the economy comes under stress, with the gross domestic product seen shrinking more than 2 percent this year.Either way, many voters hold her responsible for failing to curtail corruption in her own government and for policies viewed as worsening the economic slump. A successful but poisonous re-election campaign last year may be partly to blame, when Ms. Rousseff disputed the depth of economic problems and rejected her opponent\u2019s proposals for fixing them.Analysts say that Ms. Rousseff has failed to mount an effective counterattack. Her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, anointed her as his political heir even though she had never held elected office. She sailed to victory in 2010, when Brazil\u2019s economy boomed with 7.5 percent growth and Mr. da Silva enjoyed widespread popularity.Five years later, her supporters contend that a \u201ccoup\u201d is being put into motion by her opponents, echoing the polarizing politics of Venezuela, Paraguay and Honduras, Latin American countries where leftist leaders were toppled this century.Still, some observers say that the political upheaval is a sign that Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions are actually growing stronger, especially in a system long defined by the impunity enjoyed by powerful figures.The arrests of such highly influential people reflect a crucial streak of judicial independence achieved by the Public Ministry, a body of independent prosecutors, analysts note.Ms. Rousseff has refrained from interfering in the prosecutors\u2019 work, while emphasizing that no one should be above the law in Brazil. She is supporting a new term for Rodrigo Janot, the prosecutor general overseeing the investigation into Petrobras. That has put her on a collision course with Mr. Cunha, the house speaker, who is emerging as the president\u2019s most prominent nemesis and says he is being targeted unfairly by investigators.Before 1964, when the armed forces toppled a civilian president in a coup supported by the United States, Brazil endured several successful coups after the overthrow of Emperor Pedro II in 1889, historians point out. That is in addition to various unsuccessful efforts by the military to intervene in national politics.Brazil has changed considerably since the dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985. It left behind an economy in disarray and a record of human rights abuses.\u201cTurmoil since then has been generated within a democratic context in which the military has not been a significant political actor,\u201d said Colin Snider, a historian at the University of Texas at Tyler.But many Brazilians have dim or nonexistent memories of the hyperinflation, debt crises and coups of the past. About half of the country\u2019s 204 million people are under 30.Forty-seven percent of Brazilians say the current political crisis is the worst the country has experienced, according to a public opinion survey by Data Popular this month. On a street level, many watching the intrigue in Bras\u00edlia express dismay over both Ms. Rousseff and her opponents.\u201cThe problem is that I don\u2019t see anyone who can take her place because all of the options are pathetic,\u201d said Gabriela Souza, 30, a cosmetics saleswoman. \u201cI feel anguished because there is no exit from this.\u201dThe assessment of some in Brazil\u2019s elite seems almost as glum.Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Signs, Long Unheeded, Now Point to Risks in U.S. Economy", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs investors scramble to make sense of the wild market swings in recent days, a number of financial experts argue that, for more than a year now, signs pointing to an equity crisis were there for all to see.The data points range from the obvious to the obscure, encompassing stock market and credit bubbles in China, the strength of the dollar relative to emerging market currencies, a commodity rout and a sudden halt to global earnings growth.While it would have been impossible to predict the precise timing of the last week\u2019s downturn, this array of economic and financial indicators led to an inescapable conclusion, these analysts say: The United States economy would only be able to avoid for so long the deflationary forces that have taken root in China.And if the bull market had made it to April, it would have become the second-longest equity rally in United States history.The one common theme binding all these measures together is the risk that they pose to the economic recovery in the United States. The Federal Reserve has said that it expects to raise interest rates sometime soon, given evidence over the last year that economic growth is picking up.But more and more analysts are now pointing to problems in China and other markets as posing a real threat to the American economy.\u201cThe global G.D.P. pie is shrinking,\u201d said Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachs executive, now based in the Cayman Islands, who produces the Global Macro Investor, a monthly financial report that caters to hedge funds and other sophisticated investors.Of the hundreds of indicators that Mr. Pal follows, the most crucial over the last year, in his view, has been the relentless upward move of the dollar against just about all emerging-market currencies. The dollar rally began in January 2014, when the Fed signaled that it would raise interest rates.But the greenback\u2019s strength against currencies like the Russian ruble, the Turkish lira and the Brazilian real began to gather steam a year ago. Veterans of past emerging-market booms and busts will tell you that the party always ends \u2014 as it did in Latin America in the 1980s and Southeast Asia in the 1990s \u2014 when the dollar takes off against these monetary units.Suddenly, loans in relatively cheap dollars that financed real estate and consumption booms were no longer available and the ultimate result was always a growth slowdown.Any discerning investor could have taken note of this trend.For example, through the year ending on Aug. 19, the worst-performing investments in dollar terms were the following, according to Merrill Lynch: Brazilian equities, down 45 percent; Russian bonds, down 43 percent; Indonesian equities, down 26 percent; Turkish and Korean equities, down 25 percent; and Mexican equities, down 22 percent.During this same period, United States equities returned 8.7 percent \u2014 the fourth-best return delivered by any major class of assets.In effect, investors in the United States were saying that what happened in Russia, Turkey and Indonesia need not have any effect on stocks of companies based in the United States.This would turn out to be a major miscalculation.What was driving weakness in all these countries was the gradual slowdown in the Chinese economy. As China bought less steel from Brazil, iron ore from Australia (its stock market was down by 22 percent during this time frame) and less mineral fuel and oil from Indonesia, the effect on these economies was immediate.When it comes to warning indicators from China, there are many from which to choose. One is that, according to their 2014 balance sheets, four out of five of the world\u2019s largest banks are Chinese. Or one could choose the Chinese debt ratio, which McKinsey & Company has estimated to be over 280 percent of the country\u2019s total economic output.But for Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London, what really confirmed in his mind that the Chinese growth engine was sputtering to a halt was the government\u2019s naked support of the country\u2019s stock market bubble. Among the government interventions were lending state entities money to buy stocks and restricting shareholders from selling large positions. Before the market collapsed, Chinese stocks reached a market capitalization of close to $10 trillion \u2014 making it the second-most valuable exchange in the world.\u201cOnce you encourage an equity bubble, it will collapse \u2014 and then you are really in trouble,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cThis was utter madness.\u201dLong before China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency this month, Mr. Edwards said that it was the sharp reduction in value of the Japanese yen against the dollar in autumn 2014 that also set off alarm bells.Because Japanese exports compete aggressively with currencies in Thailand and Korea, this was, in effect, a precursor to the Chinese currency move. He also noted that one of the causes of the Asian emerging market crisis in 1997 was that countries in the region broke their peg with the yen.\u201cIt just rippled across the whole region,\u201d he recalled.The bottom line though, is that investors in American stocks recognized too late in the game that a global contraction was sneaking up on them.For Jeffrey Sherman, a portfolio manager at the bond investment firm DoubleLine, the big cautionary sign was the correction in the high-yield corporate bond market. In summer 2014, as stocks of United States companies continued to push upward, the yields on risky corporations started to spike.As many of these companies were in the energy sector, mostly digging for shale oil, they were hard-hit by the sharp drop in oil prices. Still, the fact that these bonds were entering their own bear market should have been seen by equity investors as a warning sign, Mr. Sherman said.\u201cThese bonds have been very weak,\u201d Mr. Sherman said. \u201cThere has been a huge divergence between high yield bonds and the stock market.\u201dTaken together with slow growth in China, the result, as he sees it, is that the outlook for growth in the United States is extremely fragile and not in a good position to survive an increase in interest rates from the Fed.He points out, for example, that in the late 1990s, China had the capacity to manufacture 100 million tons of steel. That figure today is 1.1 billion tons \u2014 almost twice the amount of annual demand for steel in China.The China steelmaking boom also sent the price for iron ore up to nearly $200 a ton in 2011, from around $30 in 2008. Like all commodity prices, it has fallen sharply, to just under $100, a correction that creates problems for big iron ore-producing countries like Australia, which made huge investments to keep supplying these raw materials to China.\u201cIron ore is the canary in the steel shaft if you will,\u201d Mr. Stockman said. \u201cIt is a real measure of the violence of global deflation that is currently underway.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Prepares to Lure Foreign Investors After Nuclear Deal", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast month, however, the company, the Telecommunication Company of Iran, was put up for sale, as the Revolutionary Guards now seem more interested in cashing in on what Iranian leaders are hoping will be a flood of foreign investment if a nuclear deal with world powers gains final approval and sanctions are lifted.And it is not just the Revolutionary Guards. During the past decade, well-connected Iranian investors amassed undervalued assets in poorly executed and frequently corrupt rounds of privatization, buying insurance companies, hospitals, refineries and public utilities, among other things previously run \u2014 usually poorly \u2014 by the state.But with Western sanctions putting an ever-tightening stranglehold on the Iranian economy, finding buyers for the assets became next to impossible, especially in recent years. In the absence of outside investors, and no deep-pocketed private buyers in the country, Iranian investment companies fronting for state pension funds, military cooperatives and religious foundations bounced shares back and forth on the Tehran Stock Exchange just to make small profits.\u201cThey had no one to sell to inside Iran but now, with the nuclear deal done, everything is falling into place,\u201d said one well-established Iranian-American consultant who asked to remain anonymous because his business activities are punishable under United States law as long as sanctions remain in place. \u201cA lot of people here have started pulling out their calculators.\u201dThe potential sell-off began to take shape in July, as the nuclear agreement began to move toward a conclusion, economists say. That was when the Etemad-e-Mobin investment company, part of a cooperative fund belonging to the Revolutionary Guards Corps, put the Telecommunication Company of Iran on the selling block.The fund\u2019s chief executive officer, Mostafa Seyyed Hashemi, told the Tabnak website that bidding for the company \u2014 which Iranian news media reported was acquired after Etemad-e-Mobin\u2019s strongest competitor was barred from the auction \u2014 would start at the $7.8 billion it paid in 2009.That the company could put itself up for sale to the highest bidder, foreign or domestic, might seem impossible in a country founded on an anti-Western revolutionary ideology. However, a law passed with little fanfare in 2002 and mostly forgotten since then as sanctions and anti-Western feelings piled up practically rolls out the red carpet for foreign buyers.This seems to be so even though Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said repeatedly since the signing of the nuclear agreement last month that his country is not for sale, particularly not to United States buyers.Yet, Iran has a long history of changing laws on the fly, or simply ignoring them when that suits the establishment\u2019s purposes. In an effort to reassure investors, the act guarantees that the government will pay compensation for any investments in projects that are nationalized or expropriated, though it does not say exactly how much.Economists warn that investing in a country like Iran is not as straightforward as it is in the West. The Iranian economy is riddled with conflicting interests, they say, and those in power are typically interested in obtaining foreign cash without giving up power.\u201cHere our officials are minister, regulator and seller at the same time,\u201d said Saeed Laylaz, an economist. \u201cTheir goal is to get foreign funds, but in their hearts they are not ready to give away their influence.\u201dNevertheless, Iranian officials have gone out of their way in recent weeks to emphasize that once sanctions are lifted, nothing stands in the way of foreigners snapping up assets.Speaking in Austria in July, the influential minister of industries and mines, Mohammad Reza Nematzadeh, met with potential investors during a business opportunities event, Reuters reported. The minister presented a strictly pro-market package. Mentioning roads, hospitals and factories, he promised his audience that basically everything except the country\u2019s national oil company theoretically was for sale.A short overview of highlights from the Iran nuclear pact.There is little question that Iran needs the money, $185 billion to update the petrochemical sector alone, officials say. It also needs a new airline fleet of as many as 400 planes and further investments in almost every aspect of the economy and infrastructure.Yet, critics of President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s government, the main driving force behind Iran\u2019s foreign and economic diplomacy, say that many top officials in his reformist government have vested business interests, a common feature of almost the entire Iranian political elite.According to the semiofficial Fars news agency, Mr. Nematzadeh is himself a well-known businessman, privately active in the petrochemical industry.\u201cThe fact is that many laws have been made outside of the public eye, by a small group, often to the advantage of that group,\u201d said Hossein Raghvar, a professor of economics at Al Zahra University in Tehran.\u201cWe need technology and investment. All investors are welcome, also Americans, if their policies allow it,\u201d said Mr. Ghoroghi, 34, who is a member of the Zanjan and Tehran chapters of the Chamber of Commerce.But the foreign investment law, even for his taste, is way too liberal for Iran, he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t been thought through,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen ordinary people find out, they will say the country is being sold out. I can\u2019t really disagree.\u201dMr. Ghoroghi also worries that the law will be pared back too much, once conservatives in the government realize how much freedom it is affording foreign investors. \u201cIf that happens, Iran\u2019s dream of investments will end before it can really begin,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will trust us after that.\u201dMr. Raghvar said that there had been an increasing intersection between business and politics in Iran. That marriage of interests may be taken for granted in other parts of the world, he said, but not in the Islamic Republic. \u201cThe difference here, of course, is that we had a revolution in Iran to uplift the poor and keep foreigners out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Drafts Order on Paid Sick Leave for Federal Contractors", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stymied by Republicans in Congress, President Obama has drafted an executive order to force any company that contracts with the federal government to issue paid leave to employees who are sick, are seeking medical attention or need to care for a sick relative.The draft order, obtained by The New York Times on Wednesday, could affect hundreds of thousands of workers, because it would apply to federal contractors and their subcontractors. It would be the latest in a string of executive orders that seek to impose requirements on companies doing business with the government that the president and Democrats want applied nationally. The Labor Department was to approve the order and send it to the White House by Wednesday afternoon, according to internal communications viewed by The Times.Mr. Obama has issued executive orders requiring federal contractors to recognize same-sex marriages, not discriminate against homosexual employees and pay required overtime. Last year, he raised the minimum wage for federal contract employees to $10.10 an hour.Mr. Obama even considered \u2014 then dropped \u2014 a requirement that federal contractors disclose political contributions.A Labor Department spokesman acknowledged that \u201cin the absence of action from Congress\u201d on the issue of paid sick leave, \u201cwe continue to explore ways to expand access.\u201d The official added that no final decisions had been made.But the president had signaled the initiative in his State of the Union address in January when he told lawmakers: \u201cSend me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dThe timing of the order was not clear. The confidential draft was marked \u201cpre-decisional and deliberative.\u201d But emails show that Labor Department lawyers were seeking final approval by 2 p.m. Wednesday, making it clear the agency considered the matter as urgent. Senate Democrats said they understood executive action was in the works.The order would set a minimum of 56 hours a year of paid sick leave, about seven days, but it is broad in scope. It covers not just an employee\u2019s illness but also caring for a child, parent, spouse, domestic partner \u201cor any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.\u201dIt would apply to absences from work resulting from domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, if that time was used to seek medical attention, obtain counseling, seek relocation assistance from victim services organizations or prepare civil or criminal proceedings.Employers would be ordered to allow unused paid leave to accrue, year after year.The issue of paid sick leave has been percolating since last year, when Democrats in states like Oregon began pushing legislation in statehouses. This spring, a bipartisan majority voted to include paid sick leave in the Senate\u2019s version of a budget blueprint, but that vote was nonbinding.\u201cNo worker should have to sacrifice a day\u2019s pay, or their job altogether, just to take care of themselves or their sick child,\u201d Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said in a statement in April after 61 senators voted for her paid-leave amendment. \u201cToday\u2019s vote was an important step forward for families in need of paid sick days, and I\u2019m going to fight to get this done.\u201d\u201cSeventy-eight percent of private sector workers earning under $9.00 an hour cannot earn paid sick days, making illness not merely inconvenient but economically catastrophic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is bad news for a rebounding economy and a growing job market.\u201dPresident Obama has written, but not released, an executive order that would force any company that contracts with the federal government to issue paid leave to employees.\u201cAt some point, the contracting community is going to cry uncle, and we\u2019re going to go to court,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.While the order is still in draft, the details show how much deliberation went into it. The draft order states that an employer cannot make paid leave contingent on asking a worker to find a replacement. It also says the implementation of the order would have no effect on longstanding requirements that federal contractors pay the \u201cprevailing wage\u201d of the area where the work is being done.Detailed regulations would be issued by the Labor secretary by Sept. 30, 2016.White House officials refused to comment on the document. But email traffic obtained by The Times states that Labor Department and White House lawyers were involved in the executive order\u2019s drafting. That makes clear that the Labor Department \u2014 the government\u2019s labor policy advocate \u2014 is not operating on its own.Supporters and opponents of the order suggested the effect could extend beyond contractors.\u201cYou can build an expectation that paid sick leave comes with a job,\u201d Ms. Gould said. \u201cChanges in cultural norms matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Has Another Debt Worry on Horizon", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Puerto Rico\u2019s first bond default in its history reverberated through the financial markets on Tuesday, another move by the cash-poor island may provide a clue to where the next trouble spot lies.After openly acknowledging on Monday afternoon that it had not made a $58 million bond payment, the government quietly disclosed in a financial filing later that afternoon that it had temporarily stopped making contributions of $92 million a month into a fund that is used to make payments on an additional $13 billion in bond debt. A small payment from the fund is due on Sept. 1.Unlike the bond payments that went into default on Monday, the ones coming due are on general obligation bonds \u2014 the kind many investors have been led to believe would never go into default because the issuer\u2019s full faith, credit and taxing authority stand behind them.Puerto Rico issued such bonds over the years to raise money for a variety of government projects, and investors bought them eagerly because the island\u2019s constitution explicitly guaranteed that such bonds would be paid.The general obligation payment due to bondholders on Sept. 1 is for a mere $5 million, an amount so small that even if the redemption fund is empty at that point, Puerto Rico could still produce the cash right out of general revenue. It would presumably want to do so because of the constitutional requirement.But a much bigger payment on the general obligation bonds, about $370 million, comes due on Jan. 1.If Puerto Rico misses that one, \u201cit would be an earthquake for the markets,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics, a financial research firm.\u201cDefaulting on the Public Finance Corporation bonds was a change in direction,\u201d he said, referring to the government unit whose bonds have been in default since Monday. \u201cDefaulting on the general obligation bonds would change the game entirely.\u201dMr. Fabian said he doubted Puerto Rico would risk such a move.Still, market participants trying to understand Puerto Rico\u2019s overall negotiating strategy see that a pattern may be taking shape. Monday\u2019s bond default was preceded by a missed payment into a similar pot of money, collected in advance to make scheduled payments on the Public Finance Corporation\u2019s bonds.It was not paid as scheduled on July 15 because it depended, in turn, on the Puerto Rico Legislature making an appropriation by the end of June, when the current budget was enacted. No appropriation was made, but the significance was not widely recognized at the time.Two weeks later, when no prepayment was made, officials in Puerto Rico said it was still not tantamount to a default. But by the time the actual default took place, on Monday, active market participants were not surprised.The Public Finance Corporation issues what is known as a moral obligation bond \u2014 a type of bond that gives investors little recourse in the event of a default, and the financial institutions that hold the debt still appeared to be assessing their options \u2014 including possible lawsuits over the default \u2014 on Tuesday. Puerto Rico bonds continued their long, steady decline on Tuesday.Around the time the budget was being completed, something else happened that now seems portentous, even though few noticed it at the time: A 1976 law was amended, allowing Puerto Rico to stop making monthly prepayments on general obligation bonds. The suspension took effect in the 2016 fiscal year, which began on July 1.When Mr. Fabian heard about the amendment he called it \u201cmost alarming\u201d in a newsletter his firm publishes. True, the amendment meant only that Puerto Rico would stop putting the bond prepayments into something like an escrow account. But it also meant that when Jan. 1 rolls around, $370 million will be due to the general obligation bondholders and unless something changes in the meantime, the money will not be there.Puerto Rican officials said the suspension was not a harbinger of anything and should not be cause for alarm.\u201cThe suspension of these deposits does not imply a breach with the bondholders on the date of payment,\u201d the government said in a statement when the amendment was passed.The governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, said late in June that the island\u2019s debt was \u201cunpayable,\u201d and called for a \u201cnegotiated moratorium\u201d on the debt, to give the island time and space to make big structural changes in its economy.Since then, investors have been saying they want to help Puerto Rico, but they disagree that a debt moratorium is what the island needs. If any debt must go unpaid, they have suggested, let it be revenue bonds, which historically were considered less reliable than general obligation bonds anyway.The bill now before Congress, to give Puerto Rico limited access to bankruptcy court, might produce that outcome. It would let Puerto Rico send a few of its big public enterprises, which issue revenue bonds, to be restructured in bankruptcy. The general obligation bonds would presumably be untouched.But the bill has not progressed. Republicans and Democrats alike are deeply divided over whether to help Puerto Rico \u2014 and even how. In the meantime, plans for restructuring the island\u2019s entire $72 billion debt are being devised by a working group established by the governor. The deadline for the plan is also Sept. 1.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Venezuelan Border Town, a State of Emergency Is Barely Perceptible", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosSAN ANTONIO DEL T\u00c1CHIRA, Venezuela \u2014 President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has declared a state of emergency in this Venezuelan border town in what he says is nothing less than a fight for national survival. More than 1,000 Colombian immigrants have been deported and some basic guarantees, like the right to hold most public gatherings, have been suspended.And yet Crazy Land soldiers on.That is the name of a traveling carnival that happened to set up shop in a field just outside town a few days before the state of emergency was declared on Aug. 21. Despite the restriction on public gatherings, the park has continued to operate, its colored lights blinking cheerily every night as a few doughty souls venture out to ride the caterpillar-shaped children\u2019s roller coaster or whirling teacups, called Crazy Dance, or try their hand at games of chance.\u201cThe way the government is doing the state of emergency, no one understands it,\u201d said Edward Fabelo, 35, looking out from the ticket booth over the nearly empty carnival, where a family tossed balls at a stack of cans in a vain attempt to win a SpongeBob SquarePants toy. \u201cYou\u2019d expect to see the authorities in the streets, the liquor stores closed.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey have their own way of doing things.\u201dTo hear Mr. Maduro talk about it on television, the state of emergency is about Venezuela\u2019s survival as a sovereign nation.\u201cWe have been obliged by historical circumstance to take extraordinary and exceptional measures,\u201d Mr. Maduro said, \u201cto protect the people, to liberate our country from criminals, from paramilitaries, from an economic war, from war against the humble hardworking people of Venezuela and Colombia. It is a plan of liberation and sovereignty on our border.\u201dBut for all the noise emanating from Caracas, the capital, about a 13-hour drive away, a casual visitor to this border city might well ask: What state of emergency?There is no curfew.Bars remain open. People hold drinking parties in the street.In the nearby town of Ure\u00f1a, an approach to a major bridge, which has been closed to all cross-border traffic, was protected on Thursday by six soldiers standing by a pair of flimsy barriers made of pipe and a few sagging strands of barbed wire. Only one of them carried a gun: an officer with a sidearm. Across the street, two teams of girls played a soccer game on an artificial turf field.Here in San Antonio, the police and soldiers virtually disappear after dark.On two recent nights, in the slum that Mr. Maduro singled out as an epicenter of the evils that threaten the country \u2014 including paramilitary activity, smuggling and sex trafficking \u2014 there was not a single soldier or police officer to be seen.And yet a visitor could walk about freely, with indignant residents pointing out the small house that soldiers had demolished, claiming it was a brothel (it was, once, the residents said, but that was more than a year ago) and the many ordinary homes that troops had leveled, following the president\u2019s order to destroy the neighborhood.During the day, on the other hand, soldiers are highly visible in the slum. On Friday they were mostly seen lounging in the shade, chatting, napping or checking their cellphones.On the Colombian side, police officers and soldiers waded into the water to help those arriving. On the Venezuelan side, the authorities were completely absent.A Colombian man pointed upriver and gave a warning whisper: \u201cThe hooded ones are there.\u201dHe was referring to a second crossing nearby, where four Venezuelan intelligence police agents wearing black ski masks and gripping automatic weapons stood smoking cigars. But they simply watched as the Colombians hustled by, belongings on their backs.Two national guard soldiers sat on motorcycles at the top of the path to the water. After a while one of them told some approaching Colombians that they could no longer cross the river.Asked why, the soldier said that he had received a call from a superior.\u201cFive minutes ago it was O.K.,\u201d the soldier said, \u201cand now it\u2019s not.\u201dThat same arbitrariness has landed with brute force on hundreds of undocumented Colombian immigrants, as well as many who are here legally and their Venezuelan neighbors in this slum.Once the emergency decree was announced, soldiers went door to door through the slum, searching houses and checking identification papers. Colombians, including many children, whose papers were not in order were marched to a soccer field where they were made to sit all day in the heat. Several said they were given neither food or water. That night they were deported.Meanwhile, the soldiers spray-painted a letter by each door. Residents said that an \u201cR\u201d indicated a house had been searched and a \u201cD\u201d that a house was slated for demolition.\u201cR\u2019s\u201d and \u201cD\u2019s\u201d aside, Mr. Maduro has vowed to raze the entire neighborhood.While large numbers of people along the border engage in at least small-scale smuggling of subsidized Venezuelan goods, like gasoline or powdered milk, into Colombia, many residents said that they worked for a living and did not deserve to be lumped in with criminals.The main border bridge in San Antonio has been shut, depriving the city of its lifeblood, the thousands of people who cross to and from Colombia each day. But elsewhere in the wide border area under the state of emergency, things appeared to be operating pretty much as usual.Frightened Colombians who sneaked back home across the river from Ure\u00f1a last week said they had to pay a bribe to Venezuelan national guard soldiers to cross the river and another bribe to Colombian gangs when they got to the other side.And a farmhand, who said that he had been working for decades in Venezuela without ever having a visa, described how he waded across the river from his home in Colombia each morning, waded back for lunch, returned in the afternoon and crossed again to go home at night.\u201cI come here every day,\u201d said Luis Vega, 70, leaning on a shovel in a sugar cane field in Ure\u00f1a. \u201cThey\u2019ve never tried to stop me.\u201dAt Crazy Land on a recent night, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez, a 40-year-old construction worker, and his family were among the few people at the carnival. Colombian-born, he said he was in the country legally but was alarmed by the mass deportation of his countrymen.\u201cWe have to entertain ourselves as a distraction from this bad treatment,\u201d he said as he stepped off the roller coaster.Meanwhile, on Friday, one week after announcing the state of emergency, Mr. Maduro said he was extending his fight against criminals to encompass another large area of the border region, where he said the hunt for dangerous paramilitaries that threaten the stability of the country would continue even if the armed forces have to look \u201cunder the rocks.\u201dThen he said that he was leaving the next day on a trip to Vietnam and China.Patricia Torres contributed reporting from San Antonio del T\u00e1chira, and Susan Abad from C\u00facuta, Colombia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Economies Gasp Globally, U.S. Growth Quickens", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot long ago, the United States was considered the tortoise of the world economy, at least in comparison to emerging powers like China and Brazil.Lately, however, slow but steady seems to be winning the race. The American economy continues to chug along, while the onetime hares in Asia, South America and elsewhere are flagging.The latest evidence of this shift came on Thursday, as the Commerce Department revised sharply upward its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to a healthy annual pace of 3.7 percent, from an initial estimate of 2.3 percent. At the same time, the Labor Department, in reporting another drop in weekly unemployment claims, provided further evidence that the job market was on the mend.Stocks on Wall Street jumped by nearly 2.5 percent on Thursday, following a broader 4 percent rebound on Wednesday. Oil prices also rallied by almost 10 percent to settle above $40 a barrel after sinking to postrecession lows earlier in the week. \u201cThe United States relies more than any other developed economy on demand within our own borders,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cWhile the focus in the past three weeks has been on international instability, this should position us to withstand the consequences of recent market volatility.\u201dWith markets remaining on edge, investors are already turning their attention to coming data about the economy\u2019s course, which will help determine whether the Federal Reserve will make its long-awaited move to raise interest rates in September or wait until later meetings.Moreover, the impact of the recent plunge in stock prices on the broader economy will not be known for some time. Growth data for the current quarter will be released in late October. And the cutoff date for data for the Labor Department\u2019s report on hiring and unemployment in August, due next Friday, was earlier this month, before the stock market correction took hold.Still, far from the anxious trading desks in New York, many American executives in the business trenches report that growth has not wavered in recent months, and has even picked up in some cases.\u201cWe have returned to prerecession levels, and we expect volume for the entire year to be above where it was back then,\u201d said Jon Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach in California, the country\u2019s second-largest port. \u201cThere is tremendous consumer demand here, and we\u2019re seeing a real surge in volumes.\u201dMuch of what stevedores in Long Beach and other ports are hauling are consumer goods like electronics and apparel being imported into the United States, but the economic situation in the countries that produce those products is not nearly as cheerful.Chinese output certainly is not shrinking, but the pace of expansion in what is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy is clearly cooling down. And that is sending shivers through emerging markets in South America and Asia as well as in more developed economies like Australia, as China\u2019s seemingly limitless appetite for iron ore, bauxite for aluminum and other commodities slows down.Japan has faltered once again, and European economies have been in and out of recession in recent years.While the German economy remains healthy and unemployment is relatively low there, Germany\u2019s dependence on exports makes it more vulnerable in the face of weakening demand from China and its neighbors on the Continent.As a result, companies from other countries are showing greater interest in acquisitions in the United States to increase their exposure to the faster-growing North American market.Last month, for example, the W\u00fcrth Group of Germany acquired Northern Safety & Industrial, based in Utica, N.Y., a maker of protective equipment like safety glasses, gloves and hard hats for industrial customers.\u201cWe are their entree into the safety market in the U.S.,\u201d said Neil Sexton, president of Northern Safety & Industrial. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call the overall business climate here high-flying, but it is very solid.\u201d Most of the company\u2019s $200 million in sales last year came from North America, and nearly all of its 500 employees are based in the United States.\u201cW\u00fcrth has a big target on the U.S. for growth,\u201d Mr. Sexton added. \u201cThere are headwinds here from the energy sector, but there has been great strength in the chemical industry, and construction has also been a real bright spot.\u201dMuch of the jump in overall economic activity during the second quarter, from an initial estimate of a 2.3 percent growth rate, came from strong spending by businesses looking to expand factories, buildings and other physical structures.Other tailwinds included a better trade picture, as net exports improved, and increased government spending, especially at the state and local levels.Companies also added to their stockpiles of goods, which could weigh on growth in the months ahead. Real private inventories increased at a $121.1 billion pace in the second quarter, adding a little more than 0.2 percentage points to overall economic activity.In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 last week, to 271,000 \u2014 a level that suggests the labor market remains on a solid footing.When the Labor Department reports the latest figures for hiring and the unemployment next Friday, Wall Street is looking for a gain of about 200,000 jobs and expects the unemployment rate to remain flat at 5.3 percent. Normally, that might be enough to nudge the Fed into action, but the plunge in overseas markets and the correction on Wall Street has blurred that timeline. Many experts now expect policy makers to wait until December.The uncertainty over the central bank\u2019s course has prompted investors and economists to put each new data point under a microscope.Yet for all the zigs and zags of economic data over the last couple of years, the underlying growth rate has not deviated much from about 2.5 to 3 percent annually, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a private research and forecasting firm.\u201cHistorically, this is a modest growth rate,\u201d he said, explaining that the American economy now faces what he termed \u201cspeed limits,\u201d including the retirement of the baby boomers, slower population growth and weak productivity gains recently.\u201cWould we like to see faster growth? Of course,\u201d said Mr. Behravesh. \u201cBut we\u2019re growing twice as fast as Europe and three to four times as fast as Japan. For a mature economy, this is about as fast as we can grow, and it\u2019s something we can feel good about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Increase Taxes? Talk by Donald Trump Alarms G.O.P.", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Republicans have run for office on promises of cutting taxes and bolstering business to stimulate economic growth, pledging allegiance to a Reaganesque model of conservatism that has largely become the party\u2019s orthodoxy.But this election cycle, the Republican presidential candidate who currently leads in most polls is taking a different approach, and it is jangling the nerves of some of the party\u2019s most traditional supporters.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on American companies that put their factories in other countries. He has suggested he would increase taxes on the compensation of hedge fund managers. And he has vowed to change laws that allow American companies to benefit from cheaper tax rates by using mergers to base their operations outside the United States.Alarmed that those ideas might catch on with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican rivals \u2014 as his immigration policies have \u2014 the Club for Growth, an anti-tax think tank, is pulling together a team of economists to scrutinize his proposals and calculate the economic impact if he is elected.Investment managers generally pay only a 15 to 20 percent capital gains tax on profits earned from their customers\u2019 holdings, a treatment that Democrats often argue amplifies income inequality. Mr. Trump wants fund managers to \u201cpay up.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas are not new. The Obama Treasury Department supports a detailed overhaul of the corporate tax code that involves taxing hedge fund and private equity compensation as ordinary income and sweeping changes to the way American corporations are taxed overseas. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is determined to produce his own corporate tax overhaul this fall, in part to finance a long-term highway and infrastructure bill. And he has the backing of President Obama and Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.Mr. Trump\u2019s business acumen has been one of his biggest selling points with voters. He promises that his experience will translate into favorable deals on the global stage and boasts that he cannot be bought by bankers or corporate lobbyists.\u201cI don\u2019t want any strings attached,\u201d Mr. Trump often says in his speeches, pointing to the big donations he has declined to take from lobbyists.Mr. Trump has also threatened to make companies like Ford \u201cpay a price\u201d for shifting their production abroad. And while he claims to be friendly with many of them, he has called hedge fund managers \u201cpaper pushers\u201d who tend to get lucky on the road to riches. The populist tone is playing well with a subset of the Republican electorate that is frustrated with the status quo, but there are signs that Mr. Trump is beginning to alienate some in the party\u2019s base.\u201cThose aren\u2019t the types of things a typical Republican candidate would say,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, referring to the candidate\u2019s comments on hedge funds, support for entitlement spending and the imposing of trade tariffs. \u201cA lot of these things are not things that businesses would be happy about.\u201d\u201cI would certainly be concerned about how that conversation would continue,\u201d Mr. Norquist said. \u201cDemocrats will take that and say, \u2018Now that you\u2019ve conceded the principle, let\u2019s go further.\u2019\u00a0\u201dWhile Mr. Norquist said he had no problem with candidates making bold proposals for investing in infrastructure \u2014 such as border walls and roads \u2014 or the military, he thinks it is important that they detail where they would make requisite budget cuts.Mr. Trump declined to comment on his economic agenda, and a spokeswoman for his campaign said a tax plan would be rolled out in the next few weeks.As with many of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy ideas, confusion seems to be keeping interested parties from knowing exactly how to respond. In an interview with Fox News last week, Mr. Trump said a flat tax would be a viable improvement to America\u2019s tax system. Moments later, he suggested that a flat tax would be unfair because the rich would be taxed at the same rate as the poor.\u201cThe one problem I have with the flat tax is that rich people are paying the same as people that are making very little money,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think there should be a graduation of some kind.\u201dUltimately, he has settled on simplifying the tax code as a sensible first step, saying taxpayers spend too much time and money on their returns. H&R Block, the tax preparer, should be put out of business, Mr. Trump says.\u201cI think it\u2019s tough to really know what he\u2019s thinking about any of this stuff,\u201d Mr. Strain said. On Wall Street, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the rich so far have mostly led to eye rolls and a few winces.Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at E Squared Asset Management in New York, said Mr. Trump was still widely considered to be a long-shot candidate in hedge fund and private equity circles. If his positions on raising taxes on their businesses gain traction, Mr. Funtleyder suggested, then some members of the financial industry will probably form a political action committee or donate to a candidate who would tell their side of the story.Until then, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on business remains relatively harmless to the one-percent set.\u201cHe\u2019s just hitting all the populist high notes,\u201d Mr. Funtleyder said, noting that hedge fund managers are easy targets for politicians. \u201cIt is unusual for a Republican to say it.\u201dJonathan Weisman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrant Influx Prompts\u00a0Macedonia, Britain and France to Increase Security", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Europe\u2019s migration crisis took on new dimensions Thursday as at least three countries announced added security measures to address the biggest movement of refugees and migrants seen here since the aftermath of World War II.Many of the refugees are fleeing the wars in Iraq and Syria and had recently made their way from Turkey to Greek islands. They have flooded into Macedonia \u2014 almost 42,000 in the past two months according to the nation\u2019s Ministry of Interior \u2014 as they head north to seek asylum in wealthy countries like Austria, Germany, Britain or Sweden.Migrants in Macedonia told reporters there this week that they were especially anxious to move now that Hungary \u2014 the transit land north of Serbia on the long route to Germany \u2014 has decided to build a fence to keep migrants out.Nongovernmental groups in Macedonia criticized the government\u2019s move as a step that would again expose migrants to human traffickers, or tempt them into dangerous paths like walking along rails at night.While the problems at Calais have disrupted truck drivers and travelers, the images of chaos on the border between two of Europe\u2019s richest nations have highlighted the inability of Europe to deal with the crisis. Indeed, Calais is just one prominent outpost of a situation that German officials have begun to characterize less as an emergency than as the Continent\u2019s new normal.Europe must act, German leaders say, to distribute refugees from war and persecution more evenly among European nations, while so called \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d \u2014 mostly from impoverished Balkan countries, will be sent home from Germany because they do not qualify for asylum.Germany has grappled with a rising number of attacks on refugee shelters and arriving migrants. On Thursday, media were full of reports about fighting that broke out at an overcrowded shelter in Suhl in the central German state of Thuringia, injuring at least 17 people, including police officers, refugees and bystanders. About 1,800 people are said to be crowded into a space designed for 1,200.In Macedonia, reports from the border with Greece on Thursday evening suggested that about 1,500 migrants \u2014 many of them Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans \u2014 were stranded between the Greek and Macedonian borders.Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski of Macedonia said that the state of emergency was a \u201ctemporary mechanism\u201d intended to control the flow of migrants \u201cso that they will have more humane transport through Macedonia.\u201dJust two months ago, the authorities in Macedonia introduced measures to document migrants. At that point, there were 500 to 600 arrivals each day, he said. Now, the number has climbed to 2,500 a day and is likely to continue to increase to 3,000 to 4,000 a day, he said.\u201cThe country does not have the capacity to help so many people, so we had to intervene,\u201d Mr. Gruevski said, noting that trains designed to accommodate 350 people have been arriving with 650 onboard.The British-French agreement on Thursday is intended to halt the acts of desperation seen this summer around Calais, typical of countless others across the Continent. Migrants in the French port have tried to break into the Channel Tunnel and stow away on cars, trucks and trains.Some efforts to make the crossing have proved fatal, and one migrant even walked most of the 31-mile tunnel, where he avoided being hit by trains but was arrested as he approached Folkestone in Britain.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.Under plans announced after talks in France, British police and border protection forces will work with their French counterparts at a new \u201ccommand and control center\u201d in Calais. The new body will be led by two senior officers, one British and one French, and will try to target those organizing human trafficking.The British home secretary, Theresa May, said that the situation in Calais was \u201cthe result of a global migration challenge,\u201d and promised to work with France to ensure that \u201cthe rest of the European Union and the transit and source countries from which migrants are coming are also playing their full part in solving this problem.\u201dUnder the new agreement, Britain will now spend more on reinforcing the perimeter of the Eurotunnel railhead with tougher fencing, CCTV, floodlighting and infrared detection technology.Extra search teams, including detection dogs, will be deployed, more mobile French policing units will be added and a security audit will be conducted. Although some British politicians have criticized France for losing control in Calais, Britain\u2019s government has been careful not to do so.

Until China\u2019s leaders revised their growth target.The currency for years was set at a relatively stable rate. Until the government devalued the currency, prompting its steepest fall in decades.\u201cChina really has always been an enigma,\u201d said Troy Gayeski, a senior portfolio manager at SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm that has $9.4 billion invested in hedge funds. \u201cYou could be dead right in the thesis and you won\u2019t make money.\u201dHe proclaimed he had seen this movie before. \u201cLike day follows night, six to 12 months down the road you\u2019re out of recession, and you\u2019re into a full-blown recovery,\u201d Mr. Druckenmiller said.These charts show the relative currency strength of East Asia\u2019s three largest economies over the last 15 years.Still, he pared his growth expectations slightly, \u201cbecause it\u2019s China, and we don\u2019t know the nature of what we\u2019re dealing with here relative to normal, mature developed markets.\u201dMr. Druckenmiller declined to comment for this article.The Chinese stock market\u2019s rise into the stratosphere, fueled in part by the government\u2019s encouragement, had attracted droves of hedge funds.\u201cIn the short term, we are buying the dip,\u201d Mr. Yusko said. \u201cOne of the crazy things is that \u2014 in investing \u2014 when things go on sale, people run out the door.\u201dBetting on China is anything but straightforward. Many like Morgan Creek opted to invest in Chinese hedge funds.Investors seeking to buy local equities directly have to get approval from Chinese regulators, by obtaining a qualified foreign institutional investor license. Big players like Goldman Sachs and Stanford University have taken this route. Several years ago, the government began to expand the program, as part of an effort to overhaul its financial system.As the market soared, many hedge funds rode the bull run, raking in profits and posting double-digit returns. At the end of the second quarter, Asia-focused hedge funds had $126.3 billion in capital invested, a record amount of money according to the research firm HFR.Chinese markets began to tumble, with stocks 30 percent off their highs at one point. By the end of July, the capital devoted to Asia-focused hedge funds had dropped by $10 billion as investors ran for the exits and losses mounted, according to HFR. Since then, it has continued to be shaky, with stocks in Shanghai down more than 6 percent on Tuesday.Casting doubt on the market reform efforts, Chinese authorities have aggressively intervened to help stop the slide. Investors got blindsided by some of the measures, including a ban on \u201cmalicious short-selling\u201d and forcing big investors to hold their shares for six months.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a little bit of smoke from the devaluation,\u201d Mr. Gayeski said. \u201cAnd where there is smoke, there is fire,\u201d he added.Despite the recent tumult, the China story continues to enchant Wall Street.\u201cAsia, in general, and China, in particular, offer great opportunities for hedge funds, both on the long and short sides,\u201d Mr. Robertson said in an emailed statement.CDIB Capital International Corporation, the private equity arm of China Development Financial, raised $405 million last month for a fund focused on private equity opportunities in China and other Asian markets. It is the fourth Asia-focused fund that the firm has started this year.The fund will focus on Chinese consumption, as well as companies with innovative models and advanced manufacturing operations, said Chris Lerner, a Shanghai partner at Eaton Partners, the firm that helped CDIB Capital raise money for the fund. For example, the fund could focus on Taiwan, where the economy is intertwined with China; seven of the top 10 exporters in China are run by Taiwanese entrepreneurs, Mr. Lerner said.Wall Street investors are also finding new ways to play the turmoil in China. Penso Advisors, a hedge fund adviser that manages money for investors like pension funds, scoped out currencies that were affected by the renminbi devaluation in an attempt to profit from the shock waves. The firm bet on the Taiwan dollar, which dropped more than the renminbi, said Ari Bergmann, founder of Penso Advisors.\u201cPeople want to play China, but it\u2019s much harder to play China because you don\u2019t know the rules and they change all the time,\u201d Mr. Bergmann said, referring to capital controls there.\u201cDo you realize how volatile these things are?\u201d he added. \u201cYou could lose your shirt.\u201dInvestors ultimately know they cannot ignore China, given its size and influence.Ray Dalio, the founder of the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, the $160 billion Bridgewater Associates, recently tempered his enthusiasm for China, saying the firm did not properly anticipate how quickly the stock bubble would deflate.\u201cEven those who haven\u2019t lost money in stocks will be affected psychologically by events, and those effects will have a depressive effect on economic activity,\u201d Bridgewater said in its July note to investors.Bridgewater remains cautious about the domestic equity markets because the terms and regulatory framework continue to be uncertain, according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm.Yet Mr. Dalio, who has traveled to China for business since 1984, maintains a positive outlook over the longer term. Bridgewater has applied for a foreign investment license from Chinese regulators, so that it can invest directly in the country\u2019s stocks.Advertisement"}

The currency, the rupiah, is at its lowest level against the dollar since the late 1990s.Mr. Joko did not speak or make any statements after swearing in his new cabinet members on live national television.The biggest casualty of the reshuffle was Sofyan Djalil, the president\u2019s coordinating minister for the economy, who was replaced by Darmin Nasution, the former governor of Bank Indonesia.Mr. Sofyan was reassigned to become head of the country\u2019s national planning agency, which is also a cabinet position, replacing Andrinof Chaniago.Rachmat Gobel, the country\u2019s trade minister, was also replaced on Wednesday, by Thomas Lembong, a private investment fund manager.In addition, Mr. Joko appointed Rizal Ramli, who served as coordinating minister for the economy more than a decade ago, as coordinating minister for maritime affairs, a sector that the president is counting on to help his economic turnaround plans.\u201cI think the pressure on Joko Widodo\u2019s government has been growing since a few months ago to restore confidence,\u201d said Didik J. Rachbini, a prominent economist and former member of the National Economic Committee, which advises the president. \u201cThe market response to his first government was not much, but this should increase confidence and make the government\u2019s coordination better in implementing economic policies.\u201dMr. Joko, 54, won the presidency in July 2014 as a political outsider and \u201cpro-people\u201d candidate, and he is the first leader not to come from the military or the country\u2019s aloof political elite. Yet he filled the majority of his cabinet with appointees from his governing Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, known as the P.D.I.P., and other political parties that backed his campaign. As a result, analysts say, Mr. Joko\u2019s government has been gridlocked by an absence of coordination, as ministers act unilaterally and make public pronouncements about state policy that run counter to the presidential palace.In addition, despite Mr. Joko\u2019s openly courting foreign investment into the country during prominent visits to China, Japan and Singapore this year, his government has passed a series of protectionist trade policies and drastically increased tariffs on more than 1,000 kinds of imports, from beef to cars to condoms.The appointment of Mr. Lembong, a Harvard-educated businessman, as trade minister, however, \u201cis a hopeful sign that Indonesia understands the importance of open trade,\u201d said Douglas Ramage, a political and economic analyst based in Jakarta.Mr. Joko also moved to shore up his inner circle on Wednesday, appointing Luhut Panjaitan, his chief of staff and a former army general, to the powerful post of coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs. He also appointed Pramono Anung, a senior politician from the P.D.I.P., as his new cabinet secretary.\u201cHe has brought into his inner circle in Pramono Anung one of the P.D.I.P.\u2019s most professional and talented members,\u201d Mr. Ramage said. \u201cIt will help to smoothen and professionalize the operations of the president\u2019s office and improve the process of policy and legislative development.\u201dMr. Anung is also a close confidant of Megawati Sukarnoputri, a former president of Indonesia and the current chairwoman of the P.D.I.P. Ms. Sukarnoputri handpicked Mr. Joko to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate last year because of his high polling numbers and maintains significant political influence within the government.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Is Set to Propose Regulation to Cut Methane Emissions", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is expected to propose as soon as Tuesday the first-ever federal regulation to cut emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, by the nation\u2019s oil and natural-gas industry, officials familiar with the plan said on Monday. The new rules are part of Mr. Obama\u2019s broad push for regulations meant to cut emissions of planet-warming gases from different sectors of the economy. This month, Mr. Obama unveiled the centerpiece of that plan, a regulation meant to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, a move that could transform the way the nation produces and consumes electric power.The new rules on methane could create a tougher regulatory scheme on the nation\u2019s fossil fuel production, particularly on the way that companies extract, move and store natural gas.Environmental advocates have long urged the Obama administration to crack down on methane emissions. Most of the greenhouse gas pollution in the United States comes from carbon dioxide, which is produced by burning coal, oil and natural gas. Methane, which leaks from oil and gas wells, accounts for just 9 percent of the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution \u2014 but it is over 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, so even small amounts of it can have a big impact on global warming.The oil and gas industry has resisted methane regulations, insisting that new rules could stymie a booming natural gas industry and that voluntary industrywide standards are sufficient to prevent methane leaks. Mr. Obama is pressing efforts to cut harmful emissions as he works toward forging a United Nations global warming accord in Paris in December. The aim of the accord is to commit every nation to enact policies to cut greenhouse gases. The United States has already submitted a plan to the United Nations laying out how it will cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions by up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Sprawl of Ghost Homes in Aging Tokyo Suburbs", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYOKOSUKA, Japan \u2014 Ever since her elderly neighbor moved a decade ago, Yoriko Haneda has done what she can to keep the empty house she left behind from becoming an eyesore. Ms. Haneda regularly trims its shrubs and clips its narrow strip of grass, maintaining its perfect view of the sea.The volunteer yard work has not extended to the house two doors down, however. That one is vacant, too, and overgrown with bamboo. In fact, dozens of houses in this hillside neighborhood about an hour\u2019s drive from Tokyo are abandoned.\u201cThere are empty houses everywhere, places where nobody\u2019s lived for 20 years, and more are cropping up all the time,\u201d said Ms. Haneda, 77, complaining that thieves had broken into her neighbor\u2019s house twice and that a typhoon had damaged the roof of the one next to it.Despite a deeply rooted national aversion to waste, discarded homes are spreading across Japan like a blight in a garden. Long-term vacancy rates have climbed significantly higher than in the United States or Europe, and some eight million dwellings are now unoccupied, according to a government count. Nearly half of them have been forsaken completely \u2014 neither for sale nor for rent, they simply sit there, in varying states of disrepair.These ghost homes are the most visible sign of human retreat in a country where the population peaked a half-decade ago and is forecast to fall by a third over the next 50 years. The demographic pressure has weighed on the Japanese economy, as a smaller work force struggles to support a growing proportion of the old, and has prompted intense debate over long-term proposals to boost immigration or encourage women to have more children. For now, though, after decades in which it struggled with overcrowding, Japan is confronting the opposite problem: When a society shrinks, what should be done with the buildings it no longer needs?Many of Japan\u2019s vacant houses have been inherited by people who have no use for them and yet are unable to sell, because of a shortage of interested buyers. But demolishing them involves tactful questions about property rights, and about who should pay the costs. The government passed a law this year to promote demolition of the most dilapidated homes, but experts say the tide of newly emptied ones will be hard to stop.\u201cTokyo could end up being surrounded by Detroits,\u201d said Tomohiko Makino, a real estate expert who has studied the vacant-house phenomenon. Once limited mostly to remote rural communities, it is now spreading through regional cities and the suburbs of major metropolises. Even in the bustling capital, the ratio of unoccupied houses is rising.Yokosuka is on the front lines. Within commuting distance of Tokyo and close to naval bases and automobile factories, it attracted thousands of young job-seekers in the era of roaring economic growth that followed World War II. Land was scarce and expensive, so the newcomers built small, simple homes wherever they could. Today the boom is relentlessly reversing itself. The young workers of the postwar years are now retirees, and few people, their children included, want to take over their homes. \u201cTheir kids are in modern high-rises in central Tokyo,\u201d Mr. Makino said. \u201cTo them, the family home is a burden, not an asset.\u201d Japan\u2019s birthrate has been stuck below the level needed to maintain the population since the 1970s, as young people postpone marriage and many women put off having children as they enter the work force.The city of Yokosuka is trying to change that, by encouraging owners of abandoned houses to tidy them up and put them on the market. It has established an online \u201cvacant home bank\u201d to showcase houses that commercial real estate agents will not touch. Land prices in Yokosuka are down by 70 percent since their peak at the end of the 1980s. The houses are a steal for the rare souls who will have them. But just one has been sold through the home bank so far, a 60-year-old single-story wooden home with a patch of garden that was listed for 660,000 yen, or $5,400. Places farther up the hill can be had for the equivalent of just a few hundred dollars. Four have been rented, including one to students in a nursing-care program at a nearby college who receive a discount in return for checking up on elderly people in the area.Other towns have tried their own creative solutions, including offering cash payments to outsiders who move in and buy unoccupied homes. A few have succeeded in attracting pockets of artists and freelance workers, who stay tethered by the Internet to their urban clients.\u201cThey may not be used for their original purpose anymore, but preserving them physically is important,\u201d said the project\u2019s founder, Fram Kitagawa. \u201cThe key is to preserve them in a positive way.\u201dRaw numbers suggest there is a limit to how many homes can be rescued through reuse, however. Japan\u2019s population of 127 million is expected to drop by a million a year in the coming decades. Efforts to increase its low birthrate have been only modestly successful, and the public has shown no appetite for mass immigration. \u201cWe have too much infrastructure,\u201d said Takashi Onishi, an urban planning professor and the president of the Science Council of Japan. The government, he believes, will eventually have to cut services like water and road and bridge maintenance in the most depopulated areas. \u201cWe can\u2019t maintain it all. We\u2019ll have to make those hard choices.\u201dThe most blunt solution for abandoned houses is to tear them down before they become hazards or their neighborhoods earn an irreversible reputation for blight. But owners can be hard to track down, and are often reluctant to pay demolition costs.The house that Ms. Haneda tends is owned by the family of Mioko Utagawa, 74, who lives a 10-minute walk down the hill. Ms. Utagawa\u2019s husband bought it for an aunt in the 1970s after she divorced and moved here from Tokyo. Now she is in a nursing home. The family has been paying her modest property taxes but has otherwise left the house alone. The interior is a musty wreck; a small addition that once housed the bath has been ripped out, and the bathtub sits upturned on the faithfully manicured lawn.\u201cEven if we fixed it up nobody would want it,\u201d Ms. Utagawa said.The Utagawas recently agreed to have the house demolished, after the city offered to subsidize the estimated 3 million yen cost, under a municipal program introduced last year to deal with hazardous or hopelessly unsellable homes. It is scheduled for destruction this fall. Noriyuki Shima, the director of the city\u2019s planning department, said cost considerations meant the city was targeting only the worst-affected neighborhoods.\u201cGiving public money to demolish a private house isn\u2019t something we can do lightly,\u201d he said.The new national law, which came into effect in May, could help more municipalities cull their vacant houses. Among other changes, it removed a perverse incentive that has contributed to the problem. A tax break introduced decades ago to encourage home construction sets property tax rates on vacant lots at six times the level of those on built-up land. That means that if an owner demolishes a home, the tax rate soars \u2014 a big reason many let even crumbling houses stand.Now the government can revoke the preferential tax treatment for houses whose absentee owners are letting them fall apart. But some critics say Japan needs a more fundamental shift in its approach to housing, which has long prioritized new construction over reuse.Hidetaka Yoneyama, a housing specialist at the Fujitsu Research Institute, a think tank, said that until recently, homes in Japan were built to last only about 30 years, when they were then expected to be torn down and rebuilt. Building quality is improving, but the market for secondhand homes remains tiny. Developers are still building more than 800,000 new homes and condominiums a year, despite the glut of vacancies.\u201cIn the high-growth era, everyone was happy with this arrangement,\u201d Mr. Yoneyama said. But in 20 years, he calculated, more than one-quarter of Japanese houses could be empty. \u201cNow the tables are turned. The population is declining and no one wants to live in these old houses.\u201dHisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Art Market Bracing for an Uncertain Sales Season", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the Frieze and FIAC fairs in October and at Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips\u2019s flagship auctions in New York in November, much attention is likely to be focused on whether the ultra-rich still want to spend millions on postwar and contemporary art. Larger or smaller telephone bids at those New York sales will be watched as a definitive indicator of whether the art market is still \u201cbooming\u201d or not.At the same time, the market for older, less-fashionable objects will again be tested by other dealers and auctioneers at several significant fairs and auctions.Postwar and contemporary art was by far the biggest seller at Christie\u2019s auctions in the first half of 2015, contributing 927.7 million pounds, about $1.4 billion, to total sales of \u00a32.9 billion. First-half sales at Christie\u2019s in the catch-all old masters category, which now includes 19th-century pictures and Russian art, were \u00a371.1 million. Contemporary sales were up 16 percent and old masters down 32 percent, the London-based company said in a statement on July 20.\u201cIt\u2019s a different situation from 20 or 30 years ago,\u201d said the Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto. \u201cThere are now few serious collectors of antiquities. It\u2019s kind of a pity. There are serious collectors of contemporary art, and I have benefited from them. There\u2019s always a mixture of motives, but most of them are collecting for investment purposes.\u201dMr. Sugimoto informs his photographic practice by collecting, among many other things, fossils (which he calls \u201cpre-photographic time-recording devices\u201d), medical instruments and Japanese Shinto religious art. Like his fellow featured artists, Andy Warhol, Peter Blake and Damien Hirst, Mr. Sugimoto evinces a historical eclecticism and intellectual curiosity that has become a rarity among today\u2019s financially minded collectors.But why have tastes narrowed? Is it just that works by an international \u201cbrand\u201d artist like Mr. Sugimoto are perceived as a better investment?The new Frieze Masters section will feature eight dealers presenting museum-style displays of neglected collecting fields, such as Italian Renaissance ceramics (Bazaart, London); Japanese netsuke (Sydney L. Moss, London); German Expressionist prints (Simon Theobald, London); and ancient Egyptian wood sculpture (Sycomore, Geneva).A century ago, when wealthy bankers and industrialists bought art across a range of historical periods and cultures, Italian tin-glazed pottery, or maiolica, from the 15th to 17th centuries was one of the great prestige purchases. In 1912, for example, the London dealer Duveen, bidding on behalf of the American financier John Pierpont Morgan, bought a 1524 dish by Maestro Giorgio Andreoli of Gubbio at auction for \u00a32,835, or about $330,000 in today\u2019s money.\u201cIt is a sophisticated taste,\u201d said Justin Raccanello of Bazaart, who will be trying to widen interest in maiolica at Frieze Masters with a display of about 40 pieces. A 1528 plaque of the Holy Family, newly attributed to Nicola da Urbino, is priced at \u00a3275,000. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of the few Renaissance art forms that retains its original colors, and in a modern environment one or two pieces wouldn\u2019t look amiss next to a Richter.\u201dSuch is the understandably wishful, if not magical, thinking that dealers in historic items can sometimes fall into as they watch Nike-shod contemporary collectors hurry past their booths.Frieze, like Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, is eager to promote the concept of \u201ccrossover\u201d collecting. But few of today\u2019s wealthy art buyers are willing to mix and match with the connoisseurship and commitment that characterized collecting in the early 20th century.The French financier David David-Weill (1871-1952), for example, had a taste for Art Deco and 18th-century furniture, Impressionist and old master paintings, Baroque sculpture and Byzantine objects. He also amassed a pioneering collection of early Chinese art, whose finest bronzes were eventually bequeathed to the Mus\u00e9e Guimet in Paris.His collection was plundered by the Nazis during World War II. After his death, most of what remained of the collection was sold at auction in the early 1970s. The family will offer a final residue of about 56 lots of archaic Chinese jades and bronzes at Sotheby\u2019s in Paris on Dec. 16.Estimated at 1.2 million to 1.8 million euros, about $1.4 million to $2.1 million, the auction will include a 1200 B.C. Shang dynasty bronze ritual food vessel, valued at \u20ac150,000 to \u20ac250,000, and a large jade notched disc, dating to as early as 2000 B.C., valued at \u20ac80,000 to \u20ac120,000.The Chinese economy might be in a febrile state at the moment, and most of the pieces in the sale might be less than museum quality, but the prestige of the David-Weill provenance should ensure bidding from Asia. What, then, can be expected from Western \u201ccrossover\u201d buyers?\u201cWe exhibited some highlights in Paris in June and some collectors of pre-Columbian art were impressed with the jades,\u201d said Caroline Schulten, Sotheby\u2019s senior specialist in Chinese art in Paris. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to get younger collectors engaged with the decorative arts. It\u2019s all about contemporary.\u201dPerhaps something like Sven Gahlin\u2019s 160-lot collection of Indian miniatures, which Sotheby\u2019s is selling in London on Oct. 6, might be easier to engage with, both visually and financially. Dating from the 16th to 19th centuries, these vivid gouache-on-paper studies, mainly of Mughal, Deccani and Rajput courtly life, had been acquired by Mr. Gahlin, a London dealer and collector, since the 1960s.Indian miniatures have long been admired \u2014 the British abstract painter Howard Hodgkin owns a collection featured in the \u201cMagnificent Obsessions\u201d show \u2014 but because few works can be ascribed to individual artists, values remain reasonable compared with much contemporary art. The best of Mr. Gahlin\u2019s examples are mostly estimated in the \u00a330,000 to \u00a360,000 range.The market for Indian miniatures, like that for Italian maiolica, archaic Chinese bronzes and almost everything made before 1900, has a far smaller client base than that for international contemporary art.\u201cWhen I started, there were only two contemporary galleries in London,\u201d said Mr. Rosenthal, who co-curated the Royal Academy\u2019s controversial 1997 \u201cSensation\u201d exhibition of Young British Artists. \u201cNow art has become an industry. It\u2019s vast.\u201d\u201cThe Slump of the Old,\u201d as the critic Robert Hughes might have called it, is a complex cultural phenomenon. The digital age\u2019s totalitarian sense of \u201cnow\u201d might have something to do with it, as might the pecuniary prestige of brand-name contemporary art and the horror of clutter and financial risk.But at least one group still possesses the curiosity and imagination to collect earlier art without worrying about investment outcomes.

{"Headline": "Breakdown at BP Refinery Strains Midwest Gas Prices ", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA breakdown at a BP refinery outside Chicago is sending jolts across the energy markets of the Midwest and Canada, pushing up gasoline prices even as oil prices over all reached a six-year low.Since a mechanical breakdown at BP\u2019s refinery in Whiting, Ind., on Saturday, the wholesale price of gasoline has climbed 50 to 80 cents a gallon in a region that stretches from Great Lakes states like Michigan to as far south as parts of Kansas and Oklahoma.In Illinois, the average price at the pump jumped\u00a0on Thursday by 15 cents, to $2.78 a gallon for regular gasoline, according to AAA. In Michigan, regular gasoline jumped by even more, 23 cents a gallon to $2.81, AAA said, an almost unheard-of increase, except when hurricanes barrel through the refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.Consumers around the area expressed confusion and frustration.\u201cIf I had known this was going to happen, I could\u2019ve filled up yesterday,\u201d said Nancy Nester, a psychotherapist from West Bloomfield, Mich., as she fueled her car. \u201cIt makes me angry.\u201d Ms. Nester\u2019s Lexus calls for premium fuel, but she used regular instead to save money.Drivers in almost all other parts of the country are paying considerably less than they were at the beginning of the summer as crude oil prices continue their sharp decline. On Thursday, the American benchmark for oil fell to $42 a barrel, a six-year low.At the Whiting refinery, leaky pipes on a crude distillation unit built to process Canadian heavy crude forced BP to shut the unit, and experts say it could take as much as a month to fix the problem.\u201cIt is a mess,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cIt might take a month to fix, and it\u2019s a bad month to miss because you can still see a lot of summer driving.\u201dRefinery breakdowns are not unusual, but this one comes at a particularly bad time for Canadian oil producers. Because the Whiting plant is one of the primary processors of Canadian heavy crude in the United States, inventories are building north of the border.Canadian producers were already suffering from overproduction and a couple of pipeline breakdowns when the BP refinery experienced its problems. But the new breakdown is particularly damaging for Canadian producers and the Canadian economy, because the weeks leading up to Labor Day weekend have some of the heaviest demand of the year.BP issued a short statement saying that it had shut down the largest of three distillation units at the plant \u201cfor unscheduled repair work.\u201dThe company added: \u201cBP is working to safely restart the unit as soon as possible. In the meantime, the company is working to meet its fuel supply obligations.\u201dThe Whiting refinery is the largest in the Midwest and seventh largest in the country. It can refine as much as 270,000 barrels a day of diluted bitumen piped from Canada. The refinery has a total capacity to process 413,000 barrels of crude a day to produce 19 million gallons of fuel.The problems at Whiting caps a summer of snags at various refineries in California, Missouri and other states that have led to sporadic higher regional prices, especially on the West Coast. Nevertheless, drivers on average have been paying a dollar less for a gallon of gasoline than they were last summer.At the same time, refiners have been benefiting from the glut of cheap domestic oil and have been producing record amounts refined fuels. Refiners are making hefty profits, selling their reformulated gasoline on the spot market for $25, $50 and sometimes as much as $100 more per barrel than their cost of crude depending on the region.\u201cIt has been a golden summer for refiners,\u201d Mr. Kloza said.But it is not a golden month for Michigan drivers.\u201cIt seems like they keep coming up with all these mysterious reasons why the prices fluctuate,\u201d said Jenny Osgood of suburban Southfield, Mich., \u201cbut who can really understand them?\u201dMary M.

{"Headline": "Low Oil Prices Pose Threat to Texas Fracking Bonanza", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkers who migrated from far and wide to find work here, chasing newfound oil riches, are being laid off, deserting their recreational vehicle parks and going home. Hay farmers who became instant millionaires on royalty checks for their land have suddenly fallen behind on payments for new tractors they bought when cash was flowing. Scores of mobile steel tanks and portable toilets used at the ubiquitous wells are stacked, unused, along county roads.\u201cEverybody is waiting for doomsday,\u201d said Vi Malone, the Karnes County treasurer. \u201cEverything was good, and everybody was getting these big checks, and everybody waited for their land to be leased, and then it all came to a screeching halt around the beginning of the year.\u201dThat screeching was the price of oil cracking \u2014 to under $45 a barrel from more than $100 a barrel last summer. After a brief revival in the spring, the benchmark American price has swooned again by more than 25 percent, plunging this week to a new low since the recession.Record production in the United States, along with a drilling frenzy in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, as well as the prospect that Iranian oil will again flood world markets, have spooked traders into abandoning their positions. What\u2019s more, the very productivity here in the heart of the Eagle Ford shale fields, and the efforts by the oil companies to make them increasingly efficient, are contributing to the glut as well.\u201cPeople didn\u2019t have to work anymore,\u201d said Elliott Skloss, a sign maker for the county road and bridge department. \u201cNow they\u2019ll have to work or panhandle if the oil price doesn\u2019t go back up.\u201d His family farms had five oil and gas wells that earned monthly checks worth $50,000 just a year ago, but they now earn one-tenth as much because of the decline in prices and well production.Mineral rights that once sold for $40,000 an acre for the field\u2019s sweet spot here in Karnes County now go for $15,000. The total county tax base dropped this year for the first time since 2010, by more than 20 percent.Producers that have been shielded by contracts that allowed them to sell oil at higher than benchmark prices are gradually being exposed as those agreements expire. The depressed oil price is limiting the ability of companies to borrow as they have to write down field assets that are used as collateral for loans.One result, analysts say, will be a painful consolidation among oil producers as the weak and indebted are forced to sell to the strong.Swift Worldwide Resources, an oil industry recruiter based in Houston, estimates that worldwide oil field layoffs have reached more than 176,000.Just five years ago, Karnes County was a speck in the oil patch, its production a rounding error in a state historically tied to oil.Then came hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the surge in oil production it unleashed.Crumbling towns here reinvented themselves with new restaurants, markets and hotels as money and jobs poured in. Construction began on several new schools and a major hospital to accommodate the new residents. Today, even with the price of oil plummeting, no county in Texas comes close to producing as much crude as Karnes County \u2014 6.8 million barrels in June alone. Twenty rigs operated by giants like ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Murphy Oil continue to churn through hard rock thousands of feet below ground.Most local officials say the county is still far better off today than before the shale boom, when it was one of the poorest in the state. Back then, the biggest employer was the local jails, and local ranches were forced to sell off their livestock after years of drought.Despite the downturn, the oil still flows, thanks to producers\u2019 advances in efficiency.During the second quarter of the year, Marathon Oil, for instance, averaged 32 percent more oil and natural gas production in the Eagle Ford than in the same quarter a year before.But even those days are set to end. With the number of rigs now drilling in the core Eagle Ford counties dropping to 79 from a peak of 206 only nine months ago, and with production from a shale well declining as much as 60 percent the year after it is completed, output is bound to begin a steep decline in the coming months unless prices rebound.\u201cWith the amount of oil we\u2019re sitting on top of, it\u2019s devastating that we can\u2019t go get it,\u201d said Matt Kibodeaux, the local project manager for Energy Maintenance Services, a Houston company. The company, which lays pipes to connect well pads to larger pipelines here, employed 186 people here a year ago but is now down to 18.In a shed behind Mr. Kibodeaux\u2019s office, a group of workmen hung out on the back of a pickup truck the other day trying to stay in the shade to endure the 100-degree heat.\u201cWhen you come to work, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll tell you to go home,\u201d said Omar Marquez, 69, a project safety coordinator who had just returned from inspecting workers who spray-paint pipes. \u201cI\u2019m working to pay off my debts, but now that looks slim the way the oil business is going.\u201dThe local service companies are suffering because the major operators are cutting costs by forcing them to slice their prices and fees.Supreme Vacuum Services, which hauls fracking fluids and oil well waste water, is being paid 20 percent less this year for its services. With revenue and profits down considerably, it has reduced the hours of its drivers, released the least efficient drivers and installed new software in the office to replace secretarial help. From an average payroll of 92 last year, it is down to 75, according to the local management.\u201cThere is a point where I can\u2019t reduce my prices anymore,\u201d said Brooks Holzhausen, the company\u2019s chief operating officer here. \u201cAny more cuts, you sacrifice safety and quality, and I am not going to do that.\u201dFor all the grief, local officials here say their county is still destined to have a great future once the oil price recovers, as they say it surely will.\u201cWe will probably be the last field to decline, or bust, if you will,\u201d said Don Tymrak, the city manager of Karnes City. \u201cBut we will also be the first to feel the recovery.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Selling Shows Concerns About China\u2019s Weakness", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter China shocked investors on Tuesday by devaluing the country\u2019s currency, a wave of selling swept the globe. The price of oil plunged, the currencies of other countries tumbled and stock markets skidded on every continent.For once, the markets may not have overreacted.Investors have been able to live with the problems brewing in China\u2019s economy for years. The country\u2019s authorities always seemed to have the financial firepower and the will to rev up China\u2019s $10 trillion economy when it sputtered.But the devaluation, along with the authorities\u2019 aggressive efforts earlier in the summer to shore up the country\u2019s stock market, has rekindled long-running concerns that China\u2019s economy is substantially weaker than official figures suggest \u2014 and that its leadership is running out of ways to bolster growth.James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors\u2019 perceptions of China dimmed after the authorities intervened to stem the selling of Chinese stocks. \u201cNow, this devaluation has just made it worse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an admission that they\u2019ve been unable to arrest the slowdown.\u201dThe devaluation of the renminbi, nearly 2 percent against the dollar, may help revive the economy. When a country devalues, its goods cost less in other currencies, like the dollar, which can lead to an increase in demand for those goods around the world.Still, investors can view devaluations warily.Some analysts had recently speculated that China would adjust its exchange rate. But the change, when it came, was far greater than expected, prompting analysts to ask whether the Chinese authorities were acting from a position of weakness.\u201cThis is the second time in two or three months that they surprised us with what seemed like abrupt policy changes,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS. \u201cThey were almost panicky measures \u2014 that is the concern.\u201d China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.Mr. Mariscal added that investors might have expected the adjustment to be a 2 percent decline in a year, not 2 percent in a day.The move rippled through the markets on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 212.33 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 17,402.84. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, a broader index favored by investors, declined by 0.96 percent to close at 2,084.07. Oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, declined by 3.75 percent to $43.35 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury note, a safe haven on troubled days in the market, rose in price, pushing its yield down to 2.137 percent. The currencies of Asian countries, including South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, declined on Tuesday.As investors grope for explanations for the devaluation, they point to the need for stemming capital outflows from the country, which have picked up in recent months. It is an indication, at least somewhat, that Chinese investors \u2014 fearing their currency was overvalued and a devaluation was coming \u2014 are looking for better opportunities elsewhere.\u201cAll this hot money outflow was people in China realizing they had an overvalued currency \u2014 and spending when they could,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. But there is a danger that the capital outflows may now speed up, if the Chinese investors believe the renminbi could be devalued again.The sharp reaction among investors also reflects the mistrust toward economic data coming out of China. While the country\u2019s goal is to grow 7 percent this year, a report last week from Bank of America Merrill Lynch caused a particular stir in the markets. It cited data that suggested China\u2019s economy may already be in a ditch, including figures showing that power generation was flattening, cement production contracting and steel output slowing.The murkiness of China\u2019s numbers means that global investors could remain jittery in coming weeks as they pore over every report about the country\u2019s economy. If more signs of slowing emerge, investors might expect a further devaluation.That, in turn, could prompt other countries to devalue, to prevent Chinese exporters from gaining an outsize advantage in world markets. If that happens, fears of a full-on currency war would soon grip the markets.\u201cEveryone has to back up and at least put their projects on pause when China has to tweak more than the stock market to get its economy growing as quickly as it did in the past,\u201d said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial. Russia, too, is watching closely. Any further slowdown in China \u2014 its largest trading partner \u2014 could weigh on Russia, at a time when it is already dealing with the dual headwinds of Western sanctions and low oil prices. On Tuesday, the Russian ruble was off roughly 2 percent.The United States economy would most likely get hit if China and many other countries continued to devalue. American companies would find it harder to export, depressing their earnings. \u201cWe thought we were at the end of the stronger dollar cycle \u2014 and clearly this could extend it,\u201d Mr. Mariscal said.Still, some analysts say the fretting has gone too far. In devaluing, China\u2019s authorities, they assert, acted mostly out of a long-term desire to allow the market to have a greater role in setting the level of its currency.\u201cWe take China policy makers at their word that this is meant to introduce greater market forces into determining the exchange rate,\u201d Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note on Tuesday, adding that any further declines are likely to be restrained. The country also has billions of dollars in reserves that it can use to influence the exchange rate and put out financial fires.Others said that the devaluation was sensible because the currency was becoming quite overvalued, and was merely a catch-up move that would have benefits for the economy. \u201cChina\u2019s wages haven\u2019t increased and their cost base hasn\u2019t gone up,\u201d Mr. Lele said, \u201cbut they have been slowly becoming less competitive.\u201d And by loosening the way it manages its currency, China in effect will gain more flexibility in conducting its domestic monetary policy, leeway it will need as it tries to stimulate the economy, Mr. Lele contended.Even so, China will most likely remain a big worry among investors until it posts strong and convincing growth figures. Some investors are wondering whether China is just another emerging market, vulnerable to global money flows.As the Federal Reserve now prepares to raise interest rates, the supply of dollars around the world has slowed, causing financial havoc in many developing countries. That tightening could make life harder for China \u2014 and the authorities there may already have seen that.\u201cThe growth scare is what is affecting the markets right now,\u201d Mr. Mariscal said. \u201cThey are worried that Chinese growth is much, much weaker than people expected.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Forecast Is Another Reason for the Fed Not to Raise Rates", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThere\u2019s a concept in economics called the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu, which is the lowest level of unemployment the economy can support without causing inflation to rise. The C.B.O. had estimated this at 5.3 percent, with expectations that it would fall to 5.2. Now, it is pegging it at 5.0 percent. It is also raising the projection of how many Americans will participate in the labor force, either by working or looking for work; that is, unemployment will be lower in the long run even as a greater share of the population seeks work.These changes are pretty small, which is why the Congressional Budget Office did not significantly raise its forecasts of economic growth at the same time it made these bullish calls on employment. But the changes do point toward answers to two key questions about the labor market: Why aren\u2019t wages rising more briskly when unemployment has fallen so much, and has the job situation improved so much that the Federal Reserve should start raising interest rates?In general, as unemployment falls and the number of job openings per job seeker falls, wages should rise as companies compete to hire a limited pool of available workers. But steadily falling unemployment in the United States has not turned into wage growth.This sounds like a conundrum, but the C.B.O.\u2019s new numbers are saying it isn\u2019t: Wages aren\u2019t rising because the labor market isn\u2019t as tight as we thought; there are more people available to re-enter the work force as more jobs become available, and the unemployment rate can fall more before it becomes truly hard for firms to find workers.Now, unemployment is 5.3 percent and interest rates are still near zero. Guidance from the Federal Reserve in recent months has explained why: Fed officials are taking a holistic view of what constitutes low unemployment, and other signs of slack in the labor market (such as low labor force participation and modest wage growth) may offset a low headline unemployment rate.The key question, then, is why a rate hike is necessary, if 5.3 percent unemployment does not mean full employment and if there are no signs of inflation. It\u2019s possible the Federal Reserve will look at that question and say it\u2019s not.If the Congressional Budget Office is right, the Fed has breathing room to wait.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Boring Jobs Report Is Great News for the Fed", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportEmployers added 215,000 jobs last month, but the average over the last six months is 213,000. The unemployment rate was 5.3 percent, but that was the same as in June. The proportion of the population working was unchanged, as was the proportion of Americans in the labor force. And average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent, exactly what forecasters had expected.Of course it would be welcome news if we started experiencing faster job growth, or, perhaps more important, stronger gains in hourly pay for workers who have seen scant raises for years. But given that the Fed is nearing an important policy turning point, namely a decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years, the fact that there are highly consistent signals about what is happening in the economy in the labor market actually is welcome in its own right.The numbers for July and the last few months have been strikingly consistent both internally (meaning the different portions of the 38-page jobs report make sense relative to one another) and externally (the jobs numbers make sense relative to other economic indicators, such as surveys of business activity).There are no great mysteries for Janet Yellen and her colleagues to sort out. The economy, and the job market, are improving at the same steady, consistent, gradual rate they have been for half a decade or so. The judgment call to make relies not on parsing confusing or contradictory data, but in whether is time to raise rates to prevent the economy from overheating down the road.The Fed seems to be gliding toward a rate increase quite soon. If it is wrong \u2014 if rate increases are premature and inflation doesn\u2019t return to the 2 percent the central bank targets, and workers never see the meaningful raises they\u2019ve been awaiting \u2014 then Fed officials will have only themselves to blame. The culprit will be an analytical mistake, not a problem of incomplete, hard-to-parse data.All that said, if you\u2019re a decision maker in the economy, whether Ms. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, or a C.E.O. deciding whether to make a big investment, you\u2019d certainly prefer this type of economic data \u2014 consistent, even a little boring \u2014 to the alternative. Economic data in 2009 wasn\u2019t boring, and we\u2019d all be better off if it had been.But with the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting barely a month away, and only one more jobs report to be issued before then, Ms. Yellen has a looming deadline. And the latest numbers suggest that whatever she was planning to do when she woke up this morning, she should also be planning to do now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The High Price of Rejecting the Iran Deal", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 THE Iran nuclear deal offers a long-term solution to one of the most urgent threats of our time. Without this deal, Iran, the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism, would be less than 90 days away from having enough fissile material to make a nuclear bomb. This deal greatly reduces the threat of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, making Iran\u2019s breakout time four times as long, securing unprecedented access to ensure that we will know if Iran cheats and giving us the leverage to hold it to its commitments.Those calling on Congress to scrap the deal argue that the United States could have gotten a better deal, and still could, if we unilaterally ramped up existing sanctions, enough to force Iran to dismantle its entire nuclear program or even alter the character of its regime wholesale. This assumption is a dangerous fantasy, flying in the face of economic and diplomatic reality.To be sure, the United States does have tremendous economic influence. But it was not this influence alone that persuaded countries across Europe and Asia to join the current sanction policy, one that required them to make costly sacrifices, curtail their purchases of Iran\u2019s oil, and put Iran\u2019s foreign reserves in escrow. They joined us because we made the case that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was an uncontained threat to global stability and, most important, because we offered a concrete path to address it diplomatically \u2014 which we did.In the eyes of the world, the nuclear agreement \u2014 endorsed by the United Nations Security Council and more than 90 other countries \u2014 addresses the threat of Iran\u2019s nuclear program by constraining it for the long term and ensuring that it will be exclusively peaceful. If Congress now rejects this deal, the elements that were fundamental in establishing that international consensus will be gone.The simple fact is that, after two years of testing Iran in negotiations, the international community does not believe that ramping up sanctions will persuade Iran to eradicate all traces of its hard-won civil nuclear program or sever its ties to its armed proxies in the region. Foreign governments will not continue to make costly sacrifices at our demand.Indeed, they would more likely blame us for walking away from a credible solution to one of the world\u2019s greatest security threats, and would continue to re-engage with Iran. Instead of toughening the sanctions, a decision by Congress to unilaterally reject the deal would end a decade of isolation of Iran and put the United States at odds with the rest of the world.Some critics nevertheless argue that we can force the hands of these countries by imposing powerful secondary sanctions against those that refuse to follow our lead.But that would be a disaster. The countries whose cooperation we need \u2014 including those in the European Union, China, Japan, India and South Korea, as well as the companies and banks that handle their oil purchases and hold foreign reserves \u2014 are among the largest economies in the world. If we were to cut them off from the American dollar and our financial system, we would set off extensive financial hemorrhaging, not just in our partner countries but in the United States as well.Our strong, open economic relations with these countries constitute a foundation of the global economy. Nearly 40 percent of American exports go to the European Union, China, Japan, India and Korea \u2014 trade that cannot continue without banking connections.The major importers of Iranian oil \u2014 China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 together account for nearly a fifth of our goods exports and own 47 percent of foreign-held American treasuries. They will not agree to indefinite economic sacrifices in the name of an illusory better deal. We should think very seriously before threatening to cripple the largest banks and companies in these countries.Consider the Bank of Japan, a key institutional holder of Iran\u2019s foreign reserves. Cutting off Japan from the American banking system through sanctions would mean that we could not honor our sovereign responsibility to service and repay the more than $1 trillion in American treasuries held by Japan\u2019s central bank. And those would be direct consequences of our sanctions, not to mention the economic aftershocks and the inevitable retaliation.We must remember recent history. In 1996, in the absence of any other international support for imposing sanctions on Iran, Congress tried to force the hands of foreign companies, creating secondary sanctions that threatened to penalize them for investing in Iran\u2019s energy sector. The idea was to force international oil companies to choose between doing business with Iran or the United States, with the expectation that all would choose us.This outraged our foreign partners, particularly the European Union, which threatened retaliatory action and referral to the World Trade Organization and passed its own law prohibiting companies from complying. The largest oil companies of Europe and Asia stayed in Iran until, more than a decade later, we built a global consensus around the threat posed by Iran and put forward a realistic diplomatic means of addressing it.The deal we reached last month is strong, unprecedented and good for America, with all the key elements the international community demanded to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Congress should approve this deal and ignore critics who offer no alternative.Jacob J. Lew is the secretary of the Treasury.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe Echoes Japan\u2019s Past World War II Apologies but Adds None", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a nationally televised address, Mr. Abe described feelings of \u201cprofound grief\u201d and offered \u201ceternal, sincere condolences\u201d for the dead. He said Japan had inflicted \u201cimmeasurable damage and suffering\u201d when it \u201ctook the wrong course and advanced along the road to war.\u201dBut in a potentially contentious break with previous expressions of contrition by Japanese leaders, he did not offer a new apology of his own.The decision, a product of months of deliberation, appeared calibrated to draw a line under what Mr. Abe and many Japanese see as an endless and enfeebling cycle of apologies for decades-old offenses. But Mr. Abe sought to do so while still addressing lingering resentment in China and South Korea, nations that bore the brunt of Japan\u2019s often brutal empire building in the first half of the 20th century.\u201cJapan has repeatedly expressed feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology for its actions during the war,\u201d Mr. Abe said. \u201cSuch positions articulated by previous cabinets will remain unshakable into the future.\u201dHere is a look at major statements on Japan\u2019s war legacy by monarchs and senior officials since its defeat in 1945.But, he added, there was a limit to the number of times Japan could apologize. \u201cWe must not let our children, grandchildren and even further generations to come, who have nothing to do with that war, be predestined to apologize,\u201d he said. It is enough, he added, \u201cto inherit the past, in all humbleness, and pass it on to the future.\u201dMr. Abe has long sought to break with what conservatives call Japan\u2019s \u201cmasochistic\u201d approach to addressing history. Apologies dating to the 1990s have not prevented feuds with China and South Korea, which have their own reasons, political analysts note, for keeping public animosity toward Japan alive.Jennifer Lind, an expert on Asian history at Dartmouth College, said Japan had acknowledged past wrongdoing more frequently and candidly than any other country. Mr. Abe, for all his flaws as a messenger, is \u201ctrying to bring what he sees as balance back to the historical discussion,\u201d she said.In an initial commentary published online, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said Mr. Abe\u2019s speech \u201ctrod a fine line with linguistic tricks\u201d and was insincere.On Saturday, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea said that Mr. Abe\u2019s statement \u201cleft much to be desired\u201d and that for Japan to earn its neighbors\u2019 trust its words needed to be supported with \u201cconsistent and sincere conduct.\u201d \u201cHe used flowery words and talked at length, but he didn\u2019t make clear why he was doing it,\u201d Mr. Murayama, 91, said on a program on the Fuji TV network.Emperor Hirohito broadcast his surrender announcement at noon on Aug. 15, 1945, ending Japan\u2019s four-year war with the United States and its much longer conflict in Asia.\u201cWe must never forget that there were women behind the battlefields whose honor and dignity were severely injured,\u201d Mr. Abe said.He said Japan had practiced \u201caggression,\u201d a term first used by Mr. Murayama that is disputed by Japanese rightists. Mr. Abe himself had previously questioned the labeling, but it has become too integral to Japan\u2019s position to cut without being accused of revisionism.

But it may also seek a scapegoat. \u201cXi might be tempted to allow the venting of the righteous wrath of the Chinese people against the hated and unrepentant Japanese in order to divert public opinion from domestic problems,\u201d Dr. Berger said.Mr. Abe also drew parallels between history and the present day in ways that seemed likely to antagonize China, even if the absence of an apology did not.A reference in his statement to Japan\u2019s past as a \u201cchallenger\u201d to \u201cinternational order\u201d echoed rhetoric that Mr. Abe has often used to describe China, whose increasing willingness to assert its power in the region has included challenging Japanese control over islands in the East China Sea.Mr. Abe sharpened the reference further in response to questions from the news media. \u201cUkraine, the South China Sea, the East China Sea \u2014 no matter where in the world, attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be tolerated,\u201d he said.\u201cTransmitting the lessons of 70 years ago carries great meaning for the present day, not only for Japan but the world.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Losing Water, California Tries to Stay Atop Economic Wave", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "The Parched WestDespite the drought, communities are pushing ahead with plans for new housing, with advocates saying there will be enough water to meet the demand.Supported byFOLSOM, Calif. \u2014 Evert W. Palmer has a vision for this city famous for its state prison: 10,200 new homes spread across the rolling hills to the south, bringing in a flood of new jobs, new business and 25,000 more people.Yes, Mr. Palmer, the city manager, is well aware that Folsom Lake, the sole source of water for this Gold Rush outpost near Sacramento, is close to historically low levels, and stands as one of the most disturbing symbols of the four-year drought that has gripped this state. And that Folsom is under orders to reduce its water consumption by 32 percent as part of mandatory statewide urban cutbacks.But Mr. Palmer, like other officials who approved the ambitious plan to expand this city, said he was confident that there was enough water to allow Folsom\u2019s population to grow to nearly 100,000 by 2036. It would be economic folly, he said, to run things any other way.\u201cThat would create unnecessary economic hardships here to benefit others,\u201d Mr. Palmer said. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m a citizen of the planet, I\u2019m also paid to manage the home team.\u201dThe drought that has overrun California \u2014 forcing severe cutbacks in water for farms, homeowners and businesses \u2014 has run up against a welcome economic resurgence that is sweeping across much of the state after a particularly brutal downturn. It is forcing communities to balance a robust demand for new housing with concerns that the drought is not cyclical but rather the start of permanent, more arid conditions caused by global warming.At a time when Gov. Jerry Brown has warned of a new era of limits, the spate of construction, including a boom in building that began even before the drought emergency was declared, is raising fundamental questions about just how much additional development California can accommodate. The answer in places like this \u2014 and in other parched sections of the state, from the Coachella Valley to Bakersfield to the California coast \u2014 is, it seems, plenty.\u201cThey say we can\u2019t stop building and developing because weather is cyclical,\u201d Jennifer Lane, a Folsom planning commissioner, said as she drove around Folsom Lake last month, where expanses of lake bed were exposed to the sky and recreational boaters had been ordered to get their vessels out of the water.6 Photos\u201cI say we are looking at this whole new world here,\u201d she said. \u201cGlobal warming. Where are we going to get the water? As a planning commissioner, I say let\u2019s be prudent. Is this the new normal?\u201dFolsom officials describe the expansion here as the kind of well-planned development that has characterized their trim and attractive city since it was founded in 1856. \u201cHousing doesn\u2019t create growth \u2014 people create growth,\u201d Mr. Palmer, the city manager, said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening all over California. When you are in the city business, you accommodate market factors.\u201dMr. Palmer noted that Folsom was not now using its entire allocation from the lake, and said that he was confident there would be enough water to supply the future development on the books.Ms. Lane said projects like this one, and others that continue to show up on the docket of the planning commission, stand in denial of the climate problems that are confronting a state that scrambles even in rainy times to find water needed for farming in the Central Valley and for the ever-growing spread of Southern California.Ms. Lane, a retired elementary schoolteacher who has lived on a quiet neighborhood street here for almost 30 years, stopped her car at the edge of Folsom Lake to step out and snap a photograph of the declining water levels to post on her Facebook page. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m going to vote against 300 more homes they want to build here,\u201d she said. \u201cSee all that white out there? That should be water. And it is only July.\u201dThe water shortage is sharpening a perennial battle across a state that has symbolized the pioneering growth of the American West.\u201cVentura is in a multiyear drought with mandatory water rationing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is not enough water to serve existing businesses and residents. Ventura residents and businesses will pay more to use less water. Citizens want to know how we can, in good conscience, keep adding more new development under these conditions.\u201dOn the other side are developers and many elected officials, who tend to champion growth and point to the state\u2019s history of innovation and overcoming the challenges posed by nature.\u201cI don\u2019t think they should hold back building at all,\u201d said Alex Martinez, a senior consultant with John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which does research for housing developers. \u201cWhen you look at the data at how many gallons of water a new home uses compared to ones built in 1975, it uses at least half as much water. You look at who uses the most water: It\u2019s largely agriculture. And on the residential side, it\u2019s the old houses that use more water.\u201dIn Coachella, Mayor Steven Hernandez said that given the Colorado River and the groundwater, he was confident that there was enough water to supply not only the 7,800 housing units approved last summer but an expected huge increase in the population, to 135,000 from 43,000, by 2035.\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Mr. Hernandez said. \u201cAs long as we can continue to recharge our basin, as long as we can continue to implement water conservation and invest in using water two or three times, I know we\u2019ll do a great job of being around \u2014 we are not going to be in a water crisis.\u201dMr. Hernandez acknowledged that the Colorado River was drying up, but noted that his city had acquired senior water rights to it nearly a century ago, putting it at the front of the line should cutbacks come.\u201cBefore one drop of water was cut here, it would have to be cut off in Arizona and Nevada,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe are going to fight for our water.\u201dThe central question is whether water savings technologies in new housing, as well as some applied to old housing, such as new requirements for water meters and leak reduction efforts, can achieve what would seem an improbable result: no corresponding increase in the use of potable water from a significant population growth. \u201cThis generation of water managers are committed to knocking down per capita demand,\u201d said Mr. Quinn of the Association of California Water Agencies. \u201cWe have enough water to build in California if we change how that translates into demand for water.\u201dIn Sacramento, developers and environmental leaders drew up a regional plan in 2000 setting water consumption standards for new housing that officials here said should ease anxiety about the kind of building on the horizon for places like Folsom, which is 20 miles to the east.So it is that state officials who are trying to manage the drought \u2014 seeking at once to carry out immediate reductions but also to cultivate long-term changes in behavior to accommodate increasingly dry times \u2014 have stopped short of suggesting that new building be curbed statewide.\u201cIt is concerning to us at the state policy making levels that there may be areas of the state where development is putting an increased strain on water resources at a time when we know we are experiencing more droughts and more severe droughts,\u201d said Mr. Gomberg of the State Water Resources Control Board. \u201cAnd in certain parts of the state, that\u2019s really problematic.\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, new developments are, by and large, pretty darn water efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cThe developments taking place are not the old-school developments with a house on a lot and a pretty large lot and an irrigation system that just blasts water. The new development is not going to be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201dWhile the state can set long-term planning goals and study how population growth affects water consumption and air pollution, it is largely limited from imposing development limits or telling communities what kind of building they should allow.Builders and some municipal leaders argue that in many cases, longtime foes of development in places like Newport Beach have seized on the drought as a new tool. \u201cThe same old antigrowth advocacy groups are and will try to use this time of hardship to their advantage,\u201d said Mr. Martinez, the real estate consultant whose clients are housing developers.Yet for many community members, frustrated with local developers and City Hall, it is a matter of adapting to what they see as the reality of a new era.\u201cI think the water is going to run out,\u201d said Jeff Morgan, a leader of the Sierra Club in Coachella Valley, which fought unsuccessfully to block the Coachella development. \u201cWhether it\u2019s five years or 50 years, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s going to run out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Plunge in China Rattles Markets Across the Globe", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks around the world tumbled in volatile trading on Monday, leaving investors to wonder how much government officials can and will do to insulate the global economy from the turmoil.The upheaval in the markets began with another rout in China that drew comparisons to the 1987 crash in the United States known as \u201cBlack Monday.\u201dConcerns about China\u2019s ability to be a powerful engine of global economic growth have added to worries about the potential impact of higher interest rates in the United States, driving stocks sharply lower in Asia and Europe.But early Tuesday, after a three-day rout that erased nearly $3 trillion in value from stocks globally, markets showed signs that selling pressures were easing.Volatility continued to dominate early trading in Asia, but many regional markets swung from losses to gains on Tuesday for the first time in days. Stocks in Japan opened sharply lower but had recovered by late morning, while shares in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea were staging a modest rally.Across Asia, the free-fall of the past few days appeared to have ended \u2014 except in China, where Shanghai stocks opened 6.4 percent lower after Monday\u2019s 8.5 percent plunge.The tumult has had many analysts grasping for explanations, given the lack of any significant new data that would explain the big market moves.On Monday, the steepest losses in the New York markets ended within minutes after opening, with share prices spending the rest of the day sharply rising and reversing course multiple times. When the day\u2019s roller-coaster ride ended, the benchmark for stocks, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, was down 3.9 percent. That left the index off 11 percent from its May high, in what in market parlance is called a \u201ccorrection,\u201d its first since 2011.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Beyond the questions about what exactly caused Monday\u2019s moves, the recent market turmoil has now led many investors to turn their focus to the government officials who have become the most important players in the market since the financial crisis.In particular, there is a growing debate among market participants about whether the Federal Reserve will still follow through with plans to push interest rates higher, an action that was expected to begin in September. The market turmoil has led some, including Lawrence H. Summers, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, to call for the central bank to reconsider those plans.\u201cEverything is going to be dictated by government policy,\u201d said Kevin Kelly, the chief investment officer of Recon Capital Partners. \u201cWhatever noise is coming from policy makers is going to determine the next couple weeks.\u201dFed officials could give some indication of their thinking later this week when they gather for an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.7 PhotosAt an event on Monday, the president of the Atlanta Fed, Dennis Lockhart, said that recent developments \u201care complicating factors in predicting the pace of growth,\u201d though he said he still expected rates to rise this year.Investors have also been looking to Beijing. Over the weekend, there were expectations that the Chinese government would take more aggressive steps to stem the recent declines in the Chinese stock market and the renminbi, the country\u2019s currency.Previous moves, though, did little to beat back concern about a weakening Chinese economy, and Chinese officials declined to do anything significant on Monday.The debates in both China and the United States have often turned to more worrying questions about whether the levers that central bankers use to influence the markets are losing their power after years of extensive intervention.With all the hand-wringing, however, many investment advisers have been urging clients to ignore the recent swings.And although a number of American companies stand to be hurt by any weakness in China, recent data has suggested that the economy in the United States is continuing to gain strength.Even apart from the problems in China, many analysts have said that high-flying American stocks were due for a pause after the steady upward climb that has characterized the American stock market over the last four years.Still, the violent swings in stocks have left many investors unnerved.\u201cWe take the sell-off very seriously as this unfamiliar mix of emerging market uncertainty, deflationary pressure, central bank interference and extreme volatility is hard for global markets to digest,\u201d Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer for the UBS wealth management arm, wrote in a note to clients.Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge, the Vix, rose Monday morning to its highest level since 2009.On Monday, the Shanghai composite index closed down 8.5 percent. In Europe, benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France fell nearly 5 percent or more. A number of emerging markets were also lower, with leading indexes in Brazil and Indonesia both down around 4 percent.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 1,000 points before regaining ground. It ended the day down 3.6 percent, or 588.40 points, to 15,871.35. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 3.9 percent, or 77.68 points, to 1,893.21. The Nasdaq composite index closed down 3.8 percent, 179.79 points, to 4,526.25.The Treasury market was a beneficiary of the fear in stocks. The demand for bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to as low as 1.90 percent before it settled at 2.01 percent.The recent market tumult began two weeks ago when the Chinese government unexpectedly allowed the value of its currency to drop, partly in response to indications that the country\u2019s economy is weakening.The Chinese moves played into the continuing drop in the price of oil, which has taken the price of a barrel of crude oil down 65 percent over the last year. On Monday, the price of oil, as measured by a benchmark New York contract, dropped below $40.The selling in China has accelerated despite extraordinary government intervention in the last two months aimed at propping up share prices. On Sunday, the Chinese government said that the country\u2019s pension funds would be allowed to invest in stocks for the first time. But the slide on Monday highlighted that the new policy, and several similar recent moves, have not been successful.Many investors are now hoping that the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, will cut the ratio of deposits that banks are required to keep on reserve in a bid to encourage lending and spur economic growth.In the meantime, there are big questions about whether China\u2019s stock market plunge will make the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after that of the United States, even weaker.In the United States, too, economists were hopeful that the activity in the markets would not spread to the broader economy.\u201cFor now we believe the positive factors will win out,\u201d Mr. Haefele of UBS wrote in his note to clients. \u201cBut market shocks of this magnitude have the potential to overpower fundamentals so we need to remain vigilant.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a global stock market slide misstated, in one reference, Monday\u2019s change in the Shanghai composite index. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it declined 8.5 percent, not 8.7 percent.David Jolly and Keith Bradsher contributed reporting. Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Large Puerto Rico Bondholders Demand Full Payment", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe path that the current administration has chosen will steer Puerto Rico towards litigation and create further deterioration in the capital markets\u2019 trust in Puerto Rico, potentially leading to years of economic turmoil,\u201d the senior vice presidents of OppenheimerFunds and Franklin Advisers said in a joint letter on Thursday.\u201cWe hereby demand that P.F.C. take all actions necessary to collect,\u201d said the executives, Richard A. Stein of OppenheimerFunds and Sheila Amoroso of Franklin Advisers.A spokeswoman for the Government Development Bank said, \u201cWe are in receipt of the letter, and it is currently under review.\u201dFinancial institutions that hold Puerto Rico\u2019s debt have been questioning its intentions since late June, when the island\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, announced that Puerto Rico was in \u201ca death spiral,\u201d and he had to negotiate a moratorium on its $72 billion in debt.He said the moratorium would give Puerto Rico time to make major structural changes in its economy and to restore growth after years of painful recession. Officials who represent bondholders have said repeatedly that they believe Puerto Rico has the resources to pay all of its debts and does not need to suspend the payments.The missed payment on Monday was Puerto Rico\u2019s first since coming under United States jurisdiction in 1898. Of the island\u2019s $72 billion total in outstanding bonds, the Public Finance Corporation has issued a little more than $1 billion, but they have special terms that Puerto Rico says have removed any legal obligation to pay.The bonds were issued as part of a financing process in which the Government Development Bank made loans to various government projects, then securitized the loan repayments as bonds issued by its subsidiary. The bond repayments are secured by annual appropriations of the Puerto Rico Legislature. Officials on the island say that if an appropriation is not made \u2014 and none were made this year \u2014 then there is no legal obligation to pay the bonds.The mutual fund executives disputed that. They said the law that allowed the bonds to be sold authorized Puerto Rico\u2019s Treasury secretary to advance the money needed to pay interest and principal each year, rather than waiting for the Legislature to make the appropriation.\u201cThe Treasury secretary must now exercise that power,\u201d they wrote. \u201cNot only is this failure to pay unprecedented in modern times, it also violates the requirements of Puerto Rican law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kansas Experiment", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeatureGene is 63 now, and his worm-dancing days are well behind him. He has served in the Kansas Legislature for the past six years, the last four as an ally of Gov. Sam Brownback, who is best known for his crusading social conservatism, including an unwavering opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Yet as governor, Brownback\u2019s fiscal politics may be more remarkable.This fervor for budget-cutting is hardly unique to Kansas. At the federal level, the opposition party in the White House has kept the Republican majority in Congress from making much headway. But there are 23 states in the Union controlled entirely by Republicans, from statehouse to governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 24, if you count Nebraska\u2019s technically nonpartisan, unicameral legislature \u2014 compared with just six (and Washington, D.C.) on the Democratic side. In these Republican states, the combination of the Great Recession with the anti-Obama elections of 2010 and 2014 has allowed legislators to make deeper cuts to the size and scope of government than has been possible in Washington for decades. In 2012, according to a report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, state governments spent $9 billion less than they did the previous year \u2014 the first such decline in 50 years. Many of these cuts have fallen on education. In Pennsylvania, for example, Gov. Tom Corbett cut funding for the state\u2019s public universities by 20 percent, a compromise from his original proposal of 50 percent. Last month in Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker, backed by Republican majorities in the state House and Senate, cut $250 million from the University of Wisconsin system.As many tax-cutting states have found later on, the party\u2019s deep-seated opposition to tax increases of any kind can make balancing the budget a high-wire act. In Alabama this year, the state\u2019s Republican governor, Robert Bentley, vetoed a bill from the Republican-controlled statehouse that would have removed $200 million from the state\u2019s budget, including 5 percent cuts for Medicaid, prisons and the state\u2019s department of mental health. Instead, he called the Legislature into a special session and asked for more than $300 million in new taxes.The situation in Kansas was just as dire, if not more so. Brownback began the year by cutting education in the face of the state\u2019s budget crisis, but he also proposed that legislators raise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. The new taxes were part of an effort to close a staggering gap for fiscal 2016, estimated at $650 million in January, or more than 10 percent of the state\u2019s $6 billion general fund. More urgent, the state still needed to cut about $300 million from this year\u2019s budget as, month after month, tax revenues continued to arrive well below expectations. In January alone, the state took in $47 million less than anticipated. As Brownback saw it, these new taxes on consumption were necessary so that his priority \u2014 the march to zero on income taxes \u2014 could proceed.Uncle Gene is not an architect of the march to zero, but he supports it, and he is one of the legislators in the Kansas statehouse who has helped to enact it and to preserve it. He is the vice chairman of the Tax Committee in the Kansas House, and he also sits on the Appropriations Committee. There are more important figures \u2014 the speaker of the House, the Senate president, the leaders of the Tax and Appropriations Committees in both houses, for starters \u2014 in the statehouse, but Gene is in the next tier. He\u2019s one of the people whose support the governor usually relies on to get something done, according to Tim Shallenburger, Brownback\u2019s legislative liaison and a former speaker of the Kansas House.I called Gene in January, as this year\u2019s legislative session began in Topeka. For a Kansan, and a Suellentrop, Gene is a talker, but if you met him you would probably find him a little bit reserved, although not taciturn. On this call, he sounded worried. \u2018\u2018People are leaving Kansas,\u2019\u2019 he told me. The state has no mountains and no beaches, and thousands of jobs that were lost during the Great Recession, especially in Wichita\u2019s aircraft industry, never returned. The march to zero, which includes an already-passed provision that exempts the owners of 330,000 businesses and farms in Kansas from income tax, was designed, Gene said, to turn Kansas into a different sort of tourist attraction. As he and his fellow conservatives see it, it\u2019s an \u2018\u2018open for business\u2019\u2019 sign, one they hope will draw free enterprise to the state, perhaps akin to the way the national debate over the expansion of slavery once drew young abolitionists from New England to the plains. At the very least, they hope it will prevent young people and existing businesses from moving elsewhere, to places with ski lodges or surf shops.A couple of weeks later, I landed at the airport in Kansas City, Mo., and drove an hour or so west to Topeka, where Gene offered to be a sort of Virgil on my tour. He would introduce me to the principals in the state\u2019s budget negotiations in the hope of highlighting what he called \u2018\u2018a different philosophy\u2019\u2019 of how to make a state\u2019s government revenues match its expenditures. I\u2019ve spent much of my life moving between America\u2019s two political territories \u2014 between places like Topeka and places like Washington, Boston and New York \u2014 and generally found that neither knows much about the other beyond caricature. For my part, I hoped to be able to reveal Gene and his colleagues as something other than the monolith of monsters and morons that they\u2019re so often taken for in the political conversation, perhaps out of disregard for the moral disagreements that underlie the American political divide.There were actually five Suellentrops roaming the statehouse on my third day in Topeka \u2014 me; Gene; my father and my uncle Charlie, both of whom drove in from the Kansas suburbs of Kansas City to visit; and my uncle Frank, the president of the family bank, who came up from Wichita for a gathering of the Kansas Bankers Association, which Brownback addressed. As I pondered whether we should start a lobby, Charlie, who works as a corrections officer, began volunteering political advice. \u2018\u2018You have to get out there that you\u2019re not anti-teacher,\u2019\u2019 he told Gene, referring to the plan to reduce a court-imposed spending increase on education. \u2018\u2018I know you\u2019re not. But that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to say.\u2019\u2019 He added, \u2018\u2018Right behind me live two teachers, and my God, they just hate Brownback.\u2019\u2019As a child and as a young adult, I always found Gene to be an affable if extremely opinionated guy. Uncle Gene in Topeka was not all that different from Uncle Gene in Colwich, although perhaps he had less hair. Even in his 60s, he cuts a boyish, blue-eyed, baby-faced figure in the statehouse. He\u2019s far from flashy, but he has been known to depart from the monochromatic navy suits that dominate Topeka as they do Washington. He speaks in a slow baritone, not the reedy twang of many rural Kansans.I followed him for a few days in February as he mixed with legislators and lobbyists. \u2018\u2018This is one of our business-friendly legislators,\u2019\u2019 a Walmart lobbyist said as he clapped Gene on the back. \u2018\u2018He gets it. Free-market guy.\u2019\u2019 (Walmart is not always popular in western Kansas, where even some conservatives blame it for hollowing out small towns by putting small grocers and others out of business.) A lobbyist for McLane, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, fretted about the effect of higher cigarette taxes on company-owned convenience stores along the Missouri border. Gene brainstormed with Dave Trabert, the president of the small-government Kansas Policy Institute, about whether there was a way to isolate the administrative costs in the state education budget, so Republicans could cut them without reducing classroom spending. My uncle would stiffen a little, though, if local reporters approached. He gave direct but clipped answers to their questions.On the morning my father and Uncle Charlie were in town, we ran into Topeka\u2019s most powerful figure, who presides over the statehouse like a school principal. Sam Brownback favors sweater vests and ties and can often be found sipping from a coffee mug under the rotunda, as he was this day, near a ring of the eight ruling flags that have variously flown over Kansas going back to the 15th century. He is modest in demeanor, flat almost to the point of dullness. This explains why The New Republic once described him as \u2018\u2018diminutive,\u2019\u2019 even though his height approaches six feet. When I met him a month later at Cedar Crest, the governor\u2019s residence in Topeka, he served me tangerines that he peeled and set out on a \u2018\u2018Toy Story 2\u2019\u2019 plate.His affect makes him easy to underestimate. In the past four years, Brownback has remade the Kansas Republican Party in his likeness. The party\u2019s once-powerful moderate wing has withered after steep losses in consecutive primary elections, the main battleground where policy is determined in a one-party state. In 2011, the Kansas House welcomed 33 new Republican members, and then 40 more in 2013, a turnover of more than half the body in just a few years. The Senate\u2019s moderate Republican president, Steve Morris, was ousted in 2012 with Brownback\u2019s support. It has been a striking transformation for a state party long associated with a more cooperative approach to politics. Bob Dole, who after Dwight Eisenhower is the most revered politician in Kansas, told Al Hunt of Bloomberg View this spring that his proudest political accomplishments were passing the Americans With Disabilities Act and brokering a 1983 compromise to rescue Social Security through benefit cuts and tax increases. Brownback takes great pride in the bipartisan humanitarian agenda he pursued as a United States senator \u2014 he and Barack Obama once wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post criticizing the Bush administration\u2019s policies in Darfur \u2014 but it is impossible to imagine him trumpeting, as Dole did, entitlements and regulations as his political legacy.That day, Brownback was stewing over a basketball loss his undergraduate alma mater, the Kansas State Wildcats, had suffered against the Kansas Jayhawks, the more popular, more successful, more glamorous team in the state.\u2018\u2018It just went according to script,\u2019\u2019 he complained \u2014 and it was slow and boring, to boot. My dad chimed in that K-State liked to play that way: a tough, physical, not always aesthetically pleasing style.Brownback nodded. It was clear that he preferred to be the scrapper. \u2018\u2018When you\u2019re fighting a gazelle,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018the best thing to do is step on her foot.\u2019\u2019The budget itself, at least in broad strokes, is not a complicated document. About half the state\u2019s spending goes to K-12 education, with another 12 percent or so given to the state\u2019s public colleges. Around 20 percent goes to Medicaid, some more to pensions for teachers and state workers. Add those numbers up and you get a budget that\u2019s relatively inflexible, even for a governor and legislature eager to cut it.But in the details, especially when facing a sizable deficit and no easy new cuts in spending, the process can get technical. Here in Topeka, the biggest question at the outset of the 2015 legislative session \u2014 after, you know, \u2018\u2018Can Kansas pay its bills?\u2019\u2019 \u2014 was whether Brownback could preserve one of the most controversial elements of his 2012 tax cut: the zero-income-tax policy for the owners of businesses structured as \u2018\u2018pass-through entities,\u2019\u2019 mostly S corporations and limited-liability companies. Brownback calls this the \u2018\u2018small-business accelerator,\u2019\u2019 and it was conceived in consultation with Arthur Laffer, the Reagan-era economist and godfather of supply-side economics. Government revenues plummeted. In fiscal year 2014, which ended about a year ago, Kansas took in almost $330 million less than it had anticipated, almost 6 percent below the estimates of the state\u2019s nonpartisan experts. According to Pew, at the end of 2014 only five states had experienced declines in tax revenues for three consecutive quarters: Alaska, Connecticut, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Kansas. Moody\u2019s cut its debt rating for Kansas in April of last year. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like going through surgery,\u2019\u2019 Brownback told The Wall Street Journal at the time. \u2018\u2018It takes a while to heal and get growing afterward.\u2019\u2019Brownback\u2019s devotion to his tax cuts would make it difficult, if not impossible, for him to live up to a second goal he had set for his administration: increasing spending on education. If tax revenue was going to continue to fall, the budget for \u2018\u2018K-12\u2019\u2019 (as everyone referred to it, as if it were a mountain in the Himalayas) would have to fall a little, too. Tim Shallenburger, sounding a lot like Rahm Emanuel after Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008, told me that the budget crisis in Kansas created an opportunity for conservatives to repeal the state\u2019s school-finance formula, which he called the last still-standing Democratic achievement in the state. Brownback himself, mixing metaphors, said it was \u2018\u2018the key to the Rubik\u2019s cube that will solve it.\u2019\u2019 As he put it during an interview in his office in the statehouse, \u2018\u2018Major on the majors, not on the minors.\u2019\u2019In early March, the results of the back-room negotiations over school financing were announced at a news conference by the leaders of the budget committees for the House and Senate. The plan essentially froze spending for school districts for the next two years while loosening the rules for how districts could spend what money they did get. It repealed the formula that the state had used for more than two decades to allocate money to districts, which was based on enrollment, property values, the number of special-needs students and other factors. Republicans pledged to create a new formula, one that emphasized outcomes and student achievement over \u2018\u2018Suburbans for superintendents\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Suburban-driving superintendents being, in Kansas at least, the 21st-century equivalent of Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cadillac-driving welfare queens. But they gave themselves two years to figure it out.A week after the news conference, the bill was passed on the floor of the House, and within 12 days it was the law of the land. Putting aside the merits of the formula or exactly how many dollars each school district needs, the vote was significant because \u2014 despite being a Republican achievement \u2014 it effectively guaranteed that the Legislature would need to raise taxes before the session was over. The House and Senate, before repealing the formula, restored tens of millions of dollars in cuts that Brownback had taken from schools in February.Just holding education spending nearly flat required extraordinary measures in the House, where the vote fell one shy of the 63 needed to pass a bill. This led to a \u2018\u2018call of the House,\u2019\u2019 a motion that requires each legislator to remain seated while state troopers, at least supposedly, scour the state for missing members. Two hours later, a couple of members of the House showed up and voted yes, and the call was lifted.The bill cut roughly $50 million from schools, a figure that conservatives asserted could be made up by consolidating administration and back-end operations like payroll, especially in smaller districts. Critics of the cuts described them in apocalyptic language as the dismantling of public education in Kansas. Mark Tallman, a lobbyist for the state\u2019s association of school boards, told me both sides were telling the truth. Schools would be getting more money than they received in 2014. But that accounting relied on a contentious tactic: lumping teacher pensions, previously a separate item, with each school district\u2019s budget. (Those pensions may reflect the full cost of employing a teacher, and thus be fairly considered a classroom expense, but making that determination while holding the line on spending could dent school operating budgets.) Also, on a practical level, the legislators had clawed back money that the districts expected to receive, and had already allocated, for this year.Won\u2019t even supporters of smaller government, I asked several conservative leaders in Topeka, complain when jobs in their communities are lost? Wagle, the Senate president, smiled and said dryly, \u2018\u2018There will be lots of complaints.\u2019\u2019 Ty Masterson, the chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said districts needed to ask themselves: \u2018\u2018Am I holding this position because I need this position? Or am I holding this position because I want to employ this person?\u2019\u2019 Gene put it this way: \u2018\u2018Well, how much government do you want?\u2019\u2019That same week, I went to see Brownback at Cedar Crest, the governor\u2019s residence, days before the Kansas Jayhawks and Wichita State Shockers were to play each other in the N.C.A.A. men\u2019s basketball tournament. He was in a playful mood.\u2018\u2018Did you get tickets to Omaha?\u2019\u2019 he asked. \u2018\u2018Your dad couldn\u2019t get that for you? Your Uncle Gene? C\u2019mon!\u2019\u2019Lucy, his 3-year-old puggle, wandered about. His foyer was littered with luggage and a backpack that his daughter had left there, right before falling asleep upon her return from a Colorado ski trip. Brownback went into the kitchen \u2014 where the page-a-day Scripture calendar was 12 days behind schedule \u2014 to get a drink and the tangerines. We sat in his cavernous living room, beneath a Birger Sandz\u00e9n landscape. He drank Coke from a Glory Days Pizza souvenir cup and kicked his shoes off and left them by the fireplace. He was relaxed, close to manspreading.A lot of people in the statehouse, I said, seemed to be talking past one another during the education debate. \u2018\u2018Isn\u2019t it delightful, though?\u2019\u2019 Brownback replied. \u2018\u2018After being at the federal level for so many years \u2014 you never had this sort of interaction. Because it\u2019s so big, it\u2019s so hard to change. You send up a trial balloon, you\u2019re likely to get killed with it yourself. But here, things just pop up all the time.\u2019\u2019One thing I liked, I said, was that there weren\u2019t a lot of staff members to deal with. Nothing against staff, I added, looking at Eileen Hawley, Brownback\u2019s communications director, who was in the room with us.\u2018\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019\u2019 Brownback said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re dealing with principals. That\u2019s why I like standing out in the hallways, a lot of days. See who walks by. Because I can do half a dozen meetings just standing there. Gene walks by with a tax idea and I can say: \u2018You know, I\u2019d have a real problem with that. No, nothing against you, I don\u2019t like this one.\u2019 See the next guy, on the education formula: \u2018Yeah, I really want to encourage you about that.\u2019 I can do that all day long. You don\u2019t have to set up a meeting, go to a guy\u2019s office, have four people watching. You just deal with it right there, in the hallway.\u2019\u2019The best part, he said, was simply that. \u2018\u2018It functions,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You lack that functionality, federally.\u2019\u2019The moderates and liberals probably don\u2019t think Topeka is all that functional, I pointed out.The second of Ray\u2019s two rules seemed especially relevant: \u2018\u2018It is our responsibility to be successful under conditions as we find them \u2026 not as we would like them to be.\u2019\u2019 Brownback\u2019s dream of a state unburdened by income tax was not in itself unreasonable: Seven states, among them Florida, Nevada and Texas, get by without one. But eliminating a tax that generates about 40 percent of your state\u2019s government revenue is a lot harder than never imposing that tax to begin with.And economic reality was failing to cooperate with the governor\u2019s expectations. Brownback, after signing the tax cuts in 2012, pledged that they would act as \u2018\u2018a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy,\u2019\u2019 a metaphor that called to mind an image of the governor astride a dying state, like John Travolta atop Uma Thurman in \u2018\u2018Pulp Fiction,\u2019\u2019 preparing to deliver a gleaming needle to the chest. In an op-ed article in The Wichita Eagle, Brownback made the cuts sound magical, suggesting they would create tens of thousands of new jobs, bring tens of thousands of new people to the state, leave more than $1 billion in the bank accounts of taxpayers and even \u2018\u2018directly benefit our schools and local governments\u2019\u2019 by expanding the population and the economy.The money, or a good chunk of it, did stay in Kansans\u2019 pockets. But the rest of the promises have not been met, although Brownback points to the state\u2019s private-sector job growth as evidence that his policies are working. \u2018\u2018I think it\u2019s just clear that the tax cuts were promoted as having these quick and strongly positive results, and they haven\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 says Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at National Review and a native Kansan (he grew up about 10 miles from the house where I was raised in the suburbs of Kansas City).In late April, after the state\u2019s revenue estimate for the next fiscal year came in low, the Brownback administration and the state\u2019s legislative leaders crossed their fingers and hoped that there had been some unusually large checks dropped in the mail on April 15. People who owe taxes tend to file on deadline, they noted, while people who get refunds are more likely to file early. Eventually the administration assigned additional staff members to start opening the piles of envelopes at the Revenue Department, in search of the tax-return equivalent of one of Willy Wonka\u2019s golden tickets.\u2018\u2018There\u2019s some discussions now about what the heck we\u2019re going to do for two weeks while they go through 160,000 envelopes,\u2019\u2019 Gene told me by phone, audibly frustrated. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll know a lot more Monday about what the next two weeks are going to look like,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding: \u2018\u2018Sam\u2019s pretty upset about it.\u2019\u2019No golden ticket was ever found. The consensus estimate, as reported by The Lawrence Journal-World, was that fiscal 2015 would bring in $5.7 billion in tax revenues, the lowest number since 2010\u2019s $5.2 billion, and $700 million less than the state collected in 2012, before the tax cuts were passed. Lawmakers and the governor would need to find about $400 million, it was announced on April 20, to close the deficit for the fiscal year that would begin on July 1, in a little more than two months.Since the beginning of the legislative session, you could divide the conservative Republicans into three camps. The first was the Cutters, who thought that the state\u2019s budget woes should be solved solely through reductions in spending; these were the hardest of the hard-liners, and their position did not get much consideration. The second was the Marchers, who were willing to raise sales taxes and other consumption taxes but not to raise income taxes. The third I call the Do-Overs, who were willing to raise some taxes but only if changes to the 2012 income tax cuts were included. The Do-Overs especially wanted to eliminate the zero-tax policy for business owners and farmers.Each side brought numbers as evidence for the righteousness of its cause, but it was clear that they were motivated by something deeper \u2014 a reminder, for an outsider like me who now lives in a very different political climate, that math can never really resolve a debate rooted in history, culture and values. In Kansas, the Do-Overs, who had many legislative leaders in their ranks \u2014 including Wagle, the Senate president, and Mark Hutton, the chairman of the House Commerce Committee \u2014 wanted a system that valued fairness by taxing business owners and their employees equally. \u2018\u2018I hope I can get 63 people to put their integrity and fairness ahead of their desire to return here,\u2019\u2019 Hutton told me. By contrast, the Marchers, led by Brownback and including Uncle Gene, wanted a tax system that valued risk and entrepreneurialism. The two policies Brownback most wanted to preserve were his \u2018\u2018small-business accelerator\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018the ratchet,\u2019\u2019 a statute that automatically applies revenue growth in future years to income tax cuts, before the money can be spent by legislators. Most of all, each side wanted to signal to themselves and to others that they stood for these things. At a moment when the divide between the Do-Overs and the Marchers seemed unbridgeable, a public-radio reporter asked Melissa Rooker, a moderate Republican, if conservatives were acting out of political expediency.No, Rooker said, these are true believers. If they were merely political opportunists, the gulf in Kansas \u2014 and nationally \u2014 would not be so wide. \u2018\u2018You could get around the political expediency,\u2019\u2019 Rooker said; you could come up with acceptable alternatives. \u2018\u2018But you can\u2019t change people\u2019s beliefs.\u2019\u2019After the Marchers and the Do-Overs on the House committee failed to come up with a proposal that satisfied both sides, the two factions agreed to bring two separate bills to the House floor, and let the whole Republican Party hash it out during a full debate with unlimited amendments. One bill was a consumption-tax-only proposal that would test the depth of the support for the Marcher perspective. The other would impose income taxes at a reduced rate on otherwise-exempt business owners, among other increases.Soon the wrangling turned to the question of which bill would go first. Gene wanted the Do-Overs to mount up and lead the charge. When their bill failed, they would resign themselves, he said, to the governor\u2019s approach. Instead, the Marcher bill went to the floor of the House. It would be hard to find stronger circumstantial evidence that the congressional leadership had joined the Do-Over caucus. Marc Rhoades, a Marcher leader, leveled just that accusation during the floor debate. The night before, as I walked out of the capitol, I saw Mike O\u2019Neal, a powerful Marcher ally who was the Kansas Chamber of Commerce president and the speaker of the House when the 2012 tax cuts passed. I asked him: This tax increase is going down in flames, right? \u2018\u2018I think so,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Unfortunately, that\u2019s the plan.\u2019\u2019The next morning, just before debate ended and votes were about to be cast, Gene approached the lectern in front of the Kansas House and spoke in favor of the bill. Food taxes will go down, he said. Income taxes will go down. \u2018\u2018The only one that is being increased is the sales tax, other than on food,\u2019\u2019 he said. This bill will address the state\u2019s \u2018\u2018budget-tax deficiency,\u2019\u2019 while maintaining \u2018\u2018our progression to cut rates for all.\u2019\u2019He sat down. Moments later, the bill failed on a voice vote so overwhelming that no one even bothered to ask for a roll call.The Republican Party\u2019s seemingly intractable divide on taxes would continue for the next four weeks, as the Kansas House and Senate tried to cobble together something, anything, that would get the votes \u2014 63 in the House, 21 in the Senate and 1 (the governor) \u2014 to raise taxes and close the deficit. At one point, the Democratic leader of the Senate issued a news release that was nothing but a photograph of an underground passage and a single, mocking sentence: \u2018\u2018There is no light at the end of the tunnel, because they can\u2019t even find the entrance to the tunnel.\u2019\u2019At 4 a.m. on June 12, the 113th day of the legislative session, after a debate that began at 1:30 a.m. and included one speech explaining a yes vote that was given in a staccato, shuddering sob, the House voted to raise taxes, 63 to 45 with 17 not voting. The plan raised the state\u2019s sales tax to 6.5 percent, from 6.15 percent; eliminated most itemized deductions for income taxes; raised cigarette taxes; and preserved a watered-down version of Brownback\u2019s ratchet. The Senate followed suit more than 12 hours later. Democrats called it the largest tax increase in Kansas history, passed without a single Democratic vote.Mark Hutton, the Committee on Commerce chairman and Do-Over leader, lashed out at moderates and Democrats who refused to vote for tax increases, either out of fear of losing their next election or out of a desire to campaign against Republicans for voting for them. He wrote in The Wichita Eagle after the session was over, \u2018\u2018In the end, we had a governor, held hostage by East Coast ideologues, who would not consider a correction to his tax policy; House moderates paralyzed by fear of being \u2018postcarded\u2019; conservatives in both chambers who would have been fine with cutting $400 million from our state budget; and the Democrats in both chambers who were more interested in political gains in the 2016 elections than being part of the solution in 2015.\u2019\u2019It was over, sort of. The negotiators squeezed a final concession out of Brownback, an additional $50 million in unnamed budget cuts that would be made at the governor\u2019s discretion. Without those cuts, the budget that passed and was signed into law would leave an ending balance of little more than $30 million for fiscal 2016. Another bad January, and the state could be right back in the hole.Threatening the truce from another side is a lawsuit before the Kansas Supreme Court over whether the Legislature\u2019s K-12 cuts were constitutional and satisfied the legal requirement to adequately and equitably educate Kansas children. In the coming weeks, school districts would announce layoffs and program cuts. A large suburban district said it would cancel its elementary-school Spanish program. In Kansas City, just before the budget was passed, the superintendent announced a 10 percent cut to every school and department budget. NPR reported that Kansas teachers were \u2018\u2018fleeing\u2019\u2019 to Missouri, with twice as many unfilled teacher jobs in Kansas \u2014 700 \u2014 as there normally were at that time of year.The cuts to education were real, and they have been the most controversial outcome of the budget agreement in Kansas. But I prefer to emphasize this aspect of the deal: A group of politicians decided to violate a deeply held principle to protect what they saw as the common good. In this summer of Trump, as the Republican presidential campaign reaches new nadirs of silliness, it may be hard for some to believe that conservatives in the Kansas statehouse could ever hit bottom on the amount of government that could be cut. But that\u2019s what happened. If they could have cut spending more deeply without doing immeasurable harm to schools, to prisons, to mental hospitals, to roads, they would have done so. Over and over, they told me they didn\u2019t run for office to raise taxes. Then they did exactly that.Not that Uncle Gene would necessarily see it my way. He held out hope that an audit of the government by a private firm \u2014 the money to pay for it is in the 2016 budget \u2014 would find new inefficiencies to eliminate. He would also point out that the new tax increases are smaller than the historic tax cuts of 2012. \u2018\u2018We wish to be known for an aggressive, positive business environment,\u2019\u2019 he told me after the vote. \u2018\u2018Everyone else will say we\u2019re just flyover country,\u2019\u2019 unless Kansas does something that makes people sit up and notice. To raise the sales tax by a little more than three-tenths of a percentage point is \u2018\u2018palatable,\u2019\u2019 he said, if doing so would save the march to zero.And the dream of zero, at the end of the day, is what buoys him and his fellow travelers, no matter how arduous the journey ahead. Barring a surprise that is outside the control of Uncle Gene or the governor \u2014 an economic boom of the likes that has yet to be seen this century, filling the state\u2019s budget with a surplus of tax revenues that would make hard choices easy to avoid \u2014 Republicans in Kansas will almost certainly be debating again next January, and perhaps for many Januaries to come, whether the march can keep moving. To the stars, through difficulties.Chris Suellentrop is a former story editor for the magazine.

{"Headline": "As Minimum Wages Rise, Restaurants Say No to Tips, Yes to Higher Prices", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe saw there was a fundamental inequity in our restaurants where the people who worked in the kitchen were paid about half as much as the people who worked with customers in front of the house,\u201d Mr. Donegan said.Amanda Cohen, the owner of Dirt Candy, said she had fielded a flood of phone calls from other restaurants asking how her no-tipping policy was working.Like many owners, Ms. Cohen has long wanted to close the yawning earnings gap between those who prepare the food and those who serve it. Tips are not shared with the kitchen staff, whereas the revenue from certain types of surcharges and higher menu prices can be distributed to everyone.Several also cited research showing that diners tend to tip black servers less and that the system can encourage sexual harassment of women.Still, many fear a backlash from their customers and servers.\u201cThe tipped culture is still what draws many people into our industry,\u201d said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman at the National Restaurant Association. While the association estimates that the median hourly earnings for tipped servers are between $16 and $22, waiters at high-end restaurants can earn much more.Chelsea Krumpler, a waitress at Manos Nouveau in San Francisco, said that many waiters she knows were skeptical of her $25-an-hour wage and no tips. But she says she is earning as much as before with no worries about slow nights.\u201cIt\u2019s a little more secure,\u201d said Ms. Krumpler, who has worked as a waitress for seven years. The policy has also drawn the staff closer together. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a family,\u201d she said.Although the no-tipping idea is generating a lot of discussion, the number of restaurants that have signed on is still tiny, and they tend to cluster near the higher end of the price spectrum.Most are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to jump on the trend,\u201d said Akop Paronyan, the general manager of E&O Kitchen and Bar in San Francisco. With further mandated wage increases scheduled, Mr. Paronyan said the restaurant does need to be prepared. He is researching a hybrid model, where guests might be charged a mandatory 10 percent service charge and then encouraged to add a 5 percent to 10 percent gratuity.Brian Keyser, the owner of Casellula restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, would prefer to end tipping but does not think his staff members or his diners are ready to accept it.For many industry veterans, the business model is changing at such a rapid clip that they are not certain how to respond.When Daniel Patterson first started working as a chef in the early 1980s, he said, labor used to account for about a third of total costs, and owners could enjoy a 10 percent to 20 percent profit. Now, as a partner in five San Francisco Bay Area restaurants, Mr. Patterson says labor costs eat up about 40 percent to 45 percent of the budget. At the same time, rent costs are skyrocketing.\u201cEven a good restaurant doing a lot of business that\u2019s popular on every level, is bringing 2 percent or 1.5 percent to the bottom line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a not-for-profit.\u201dCoi, Mr. Patterson\u2019s two-Michelin-star restaurant, has had all-inclusive pricing since it opened in 2006. He tried the same strategy when he opened Aster in the Mission District a few months ago, and quickly realized it was not going to work.\u201cI really believe in that model, but our customers didn\u2019t want it,\u201d Mr. Patterson said, because they thought it was too expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s about perception,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the dollars you\u2019re spending, but what you think you\u2019re spending.\u201dThe next phase of the minimum wage increase in Seattle is pushing Brian Canlis, a co-owner of the upscale Canlis restaurant, to consider a pricing system that includes tips for 2016.\u201cI\u2019ve got to have a hierarchy of pay,\u201d Mr. Canlis said. He employs 96 workers to serve six meals a week. If the dishwasher earns $15 an hour, then the line cook needs to earn at least $18, he said. And then what about the sous chef, and the waiters? \u201cThere\u2019s a cascading effect,\u201d he said.At the Walrus and the Carpenter, the owner Renee Erickson has been adjusting her no-tipping experiment. Although she originally wanted to adopt an all-inclusive menu, she \u201cworried we weren\u2019t going to have the opportunity to explain why our prices were so much higher than the restaurant right next door.\u201dInstead, she added an 18 percent service charge. But it did not generate enough money to cover the added labor costs. So she bumped the charge up to 20 percent and shrank the owners\u2019 share.As the weeks went by, she and her partner kept adjusting the percentage that went to the kitchen workers. To get the staff on board, she decided to let everyone see the payroll spreadsheets, so they could understand how the money was being allocated.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a lot of great support and feedback,\u201d she said. And at two new restaurants Ms. Erickson is opening there will also be no tips.At Ivar\u2019s, eliminating tipping has been a success, said Mr. Donegan, the chief executive \u2014 thanks in part to the summer tourist season and a booming economy. Since the policy went into effect four months ago, wages have risen between $3 and $12 an hour, he said, with the lowest-paid worker earning $15 an hour. Everyone, including part-timers, has health insurance and a 401(k) retirement plan.The No. 1 complaint from customers? The prohibition on tips. So while the menu still states that prices include service, the credit card slips now have a line that reads: \u201cIf you INSIST on leaving a tip, write it here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dorrington quickly turned to the business at hand.\u201cMy trophy hunting price is $2,500\u201d for a kudu, more than 10 times what the meat of one of the antelopes would bring, he said.\u201cYou stop trophy hunting, the live market is going to change completely; it\u2019ll go to meat value, really,\u201d less than 60 cents a pound, he added. \u201cSo that will deprive the national parks and the provincial parks of a lot of their budget.\u201dMany scientists agree with him.While hunting is banned in government parks here in South Africa, animals inside their boundaries are routinely sold to game ranches when their populations are considered excessive, generating money to maintain habitats and fight poachers.And because trophy hunting is legal in private game reserves, the animals end up fetching higher prices than they would in being killed for food or other reasons, conservationists contend. Lion hunts, one of the most lucrative forms of trophy hunting, bring in between $24,000 and $71,000 per outing on average across Africa, according to a 2012 study. In southern Africa, the emergence of a regulated trophy hunting industry on private game ranches in the 1960s helped restore vast stretches of degraded habitats and revive certain species, like the southern white rhinoceros, which had been hunted almost to extinction, conservationists say.A similar shift occurred in the United States decades earlier when the Pittman-Robertson Act of 1937 allocated the proceeds from hunting to bring back lands and animals, they argue.\u201cThere\u2019s only two places on the earth where wildlife at a large scale has actually increased in the 20th century, and those are North America and southern Africa,\u201d said Rosie Cooney, a zoologist who is the chairwoman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Sustainable Use and Livelihoods Specialist Group. \u201cBoth of those models of conservation were built around hunting.\u201dThe Zimbabwean professional hunter who organized the hunt is scheduled to appear in court next month. Zimbabwe\u2019s government, which has long had antagonistic relations with the West, has called for the American hunter\u2019s extradition, and this week President Robert Mugabe blamed foreign \u201cvandals\u201d for the lion\u2019s death.The Big Five animals hunted for sport, their conservation status according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List and the market rates that a trophy demands in South Africa, home to the biggest hunting industry on the continent.The governments of South Africa and Namibia, a country regarded as a model for hunting programs that benefit local communities, decried the moves.\u201cThis will be the end of conservation in Namibia,\u201d the country\u2019s environment and tourism minister, Pohamba Shifeta, said last week, according to the Namibia Press Agency.Animal rights groups say it is simply unethical to kill animals in the name of conservation. They contend \u2014 and most conservationists agree \u2014 that there are problems with trophy hunting. Proceeds from hunting are not always funneled into conservation efforts. Unlike those in Namibia, hunting programs elsewhere, including a long-existing one in Zimbabwe, fail to bring full benefits to local populations.Trophy hunting is allowed in more than 20 African nations, though the rules vary greatly. In many places, permits are sold to hunt specific animals, often ones past breeding age. Quotas are set to maintain the populations of certain species, while the hunting of endangered ones, like the black rhinoceros, is illegal or severely restricted.In South Africa, home to the biggest hunting industry on the continent, it is legal to hunt most big game animals inside private ranches, including the Big Five: lions, white rhinoceroses, elephants, leopards and buffaloes.But some practices have drawn widespread criticism. In South Africa, animals are sometimes moved between game ranches to satisfy clients, a practice known as \u201cput-and-take.\u201d A more serious problem in recent years \u2014 the so-called canned hunting of lions bred in captivity \u2014 has hurt the reputation of South Africa\u2019s hunting industry and also split its members.Despite trophy hunting\u2019s problems, most conservationists believe the positives still outweigh the negatives. The reality in Africa, they say, is that most animals, including elephants, rhinos and lions, are not killed by trophy hunters.Instead, they are killed by local residents for meat or in clashes as wild habitats shrink, Africa urbanizes and the continent\u2019s population grows at the fastest pace in the world. But above all, the animals are illegally slaughtered by highly organized, heavily-armed poachers who sell ivory and organs, mostly to Chinese markets.\u201cMost of the illegal offtake results from illicit wildlife trafficking,\u201d said Jimmiel Mandima, an ecologist and program director at the African Wildlife Foundation.Mr. Mandima, who led the foundation\u2019s efforts in his native Zimbabwe for nine years, described killings like the one that claimed Cecil as a \u201cless frequent occurrence.\u201d\u201cA lot of the professional hunters tend to follow very strict procedures on how they do their hunting,\u201d he said, noting that the enforcement of trophy hunting regulations varies by country.One of the study\u2019s authors, Vernon Booth, a Zimbabwe-based ecologist who has worked in wildlife management for 30 years in Africa, said that lions were now protected because of the high value attached to them as trophies. Locals tolerate them because of the income that trickles down. Without the trophy hunt money, locals would increasingly poison lions, which are considered dangerous to people and livestock, he said.\u201cIf there is a complete ban on lion hunting, the tolerance levels for lions would just plummet,\u201d Mr. Booth said. \u201cAnd in wild areas outside of the protected areas, lions would be exterminated, and very quickly.\u201d\u201cEven though hunting may seem unpalatable to a lot of people around the world, it is actually very, very necessary,\u201d he added.For many, trophy hunting recalls some of the most unsavory aspects of Africa\u2019s colonial past. A framed photograph in the dining hall of Mr. Dorrington\u2019s game ranch here shows two white hunters towering over a black man holding their freshly-caught game. One of the white men rests his left hand on the black man\u2019s head, as if petting him.Trophy hunting is often difficult to detach from an era of unquestioned white privilege in Africa, Mr. Dorrington, 56, said.\u201cIt\u2019s something for the elites, the rich whites, to play on,\u201d he said of game ranches. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the challenges, to get benefits from wildlife to the black population.\u201dHe said his game ranch, less than 200 miles northwest of Johannesburg, employs 12 full-time black workers and donates to the local community and school. Like many cattle ranchers, Mr. Dorrington began transforming his land, which his great-grandfather secured in 1918, into a game ranch in the 1980s, specializing in bowhunting.Mr. Dorrington spends a few months a year marketing in the United States, the source of 95 percent of his business. His customers spend an average of $7,000 per trip and kill between 120 and 140 animals a year, he said. After kudu, the most popular animals are impalas and warthogs, for which he charges $400 and $350 per animal.All three animals are popular because they make attractive trophies, he said, explaining why the airline ban could hurt his business.\u201cYou see that tsessebe?\u201d he said, nodding at an antelope-like animal whose trophy price is $2,200. \u201cThey\u2019re not a very pretty animal, but they\u2019re rare. We\u2019ve got too many of them. If I find a hunter that wants one, I\u2019m very happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Carbon Dioxide Emissions May Have Been Overstated by More Than 10%", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe study looked in detail at the coal used as fuel in China, and found that it is generally less rich in carbon and is burned less efficiently than scientists had assumed. That means that each ton of burned coal yields less carbon dioxide than had been thought (as well as less energy, and more ash).The scientists behind the new study said they analyzed more detailed information about China\u2019s coal quality, combustion performance across industries and total energy consumption than had previously been used.Estimating a country\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions entails some scientific detective work. Researchers start with information about fossil fuel consumption, and then assess how much carbon is contained in those fuels and what fraction of that carbon is actually combusted and ends up in the atmosphere.\u201cBasically, this is the first time we\u2019ve applied real measurement of the coal quality on a national scale in China,\u201d Dr. Liu said. \u201cThe quality is not as good as developed countries, so if we use the same amount of coal, we overestimate the carbon content of the coal, and so we overestimate the carbon emissions.\u201dThe researchers found that, on average, each lump of coal in China was 40 percent less potent as a source of carbon dioxide emissions than the default figure used for coal by the United Nations\u2019 scientific panel on climate change.That was despite another finding in the study, that official Chinese figures understated the country\u2019s overall energy consumption by about 10 percent from 2000 to 2012.The study looked at Chinese emissions up to 2013, so it does not reflect China\u2019s most recent efforts to curb pollution from fossil fuels. But the authors said those efforts would not significantly change their findings.\u201cThe carbon content of coal is what it is,\u201d said Dr. Davis of the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe gap between our estimates and previous ones may vary, depending on how much of the burned coal is coming from this mine or that mine in a given year, but as long as most of the coal being burned is from domestic sources, it probably won\u2019t have narrowed much.\u201dHe said the study might prompt new questions about how accurately scientists have been estimating other countries\u2019 emissions, and whether the world\u2019s forests have been absorbing as much carbon from the air as they think.Dr. Liu of Harvard said that accurate data would be needed if a new international treaty on global warming, including national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was to succeed.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the exact numbers, all of the political promises are just some kind of numbers game,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has a plan, the U.S. has a plan, different countries have plans. But all of these plans are based on very broad data that has a lot of uncertainty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrants Race North as Hungary Builds a Border Fence", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTISZASZIGET, Hungary \u2014 Roiling everything in its path, a wave of tens of thousands of migrants and refugees \u2014 many fleeing wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan \u2014 has worked its way up the length of the Balkans in recent days.The next link on their route, almost inevitably, are towns like this one on the Hungarian frontier with Serbia. But Hungarian officials say they have a firm, if unwelcoming, answer to the slow-motion tide: a fence.Still under construction, parts of it are already laced across fields and river banks or trace old railway tracks, and it will be as tall as 13 feet in some places, a patchwork intended to send a clear message that the migrants should not expect to move freely.As the chaotic flow through the Balkans has demonstrated, absent coordinated policies, each nation along the path of the migrants has every incentive simply to move them on. The migrants are registered or issued temporary transit papers, but not entered as asylum applicants, ultimately passing the problem to someone else.After a weekend of demonstrations outside Dresden \u2014 both for and against the migrants \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France met on Monday to discuss the issue yet again, urging a unified European response and underscoring the need to move as swiftly as possible.Even before Monday, leading ministers in the German government have given rare public voice to complaints about their European colleagues, urging everyone to observe existing agreements guaranteeing humane shelter for all and to help countries like Greece and Italy cope with the influx.Paradoxically, far from deterring the migrants, Hungary\u2019s fence may actually be spurring them on. In a dozen or so fractured interviews this weekend, many Syrians, Afghans and others said that word of the fence had accelerated their race to get north before all of the Hungarian border with Serbia \u2014 almost 109 miles \u2014 is cordoned off, a goal that the Hungarians have set for Aug. 31.Experienced analysts say the fence will not stop the migrants, who travel in clumps of just a few to clans of dozens, often guided by Google Maps and Facebook groups on the smartphones that are vital to this modern migration.\u201cIt\u2019s just one more obstacle,\u201d said one volunteer, Tibor Varga, who has been working with migrants in northern Serbia for four years. \u201cThey will find out how to get around, above, under it.\u201dSome 43,651 refugees and migrants have passed through Macedonia in the past two months, according to official numbers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Between Saturday night and Sunday, more than 7,000 crossed into Serbia from Macedonia, according to the United Nations refugee agency.A vast majority entered Macedonia from Greece after several hundred rushed across the border, bypassing a line of police officers and soldiers who used stun grenades and force in trying to keep them back.After the episode, the authorities in the impoverished country, which has just 2.1 million people and a gross domestic product of around $11 billion a year, appeared to have given up on the idea that they could control the flow.\u201cWe tried to ensure easier crossing for vulnerable categories first, but obviously there wasn\u2019t any will for cooperation from the migrants,\u201d said the Macedonian interior minister, Mitko Chavkov, on Sunday.If anything, the Macedonian authorities are trying to get them through the country faster, having set up a reception center and shelter near the border city of Gevgelija, where refugees and migrants will be able to get the documents legalizing their transit.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.Since the clashes, activists say, the migrants and refugees are now passing almost unhindered, traveling on a significantly increased number of buses and trains to Serbia. Others take taxis and vans.Local news media in Serbia reported that some 70 buses of migrants entered the capital, Belgrade, on Sunday, while early Monday some 2,000 refugees were still at the camp near the town of Presevo.The migrants are expected to reach the Hungarian border in the next few days.Ferenc Ferenczi, the mayor of this town, drove visitors to a section of the fence that unfurls where Communist minefields once cordoned off the Soviet bloc from renegade Communist Yugoslavia.Two large coils of sharply barbed wire were stacked between close-set sturdy metal poles in a structure being built by soldiers and unemployed Hungarians on \u201cworkfare\u201d programs.Admittedly, he said, his village had seen only about 700 migrants in six months \u2014 a fraction compared to the scores now rounded up daily at a neighboring village, Asotthalom, which is even easier to reach from Serbia and whose mayor first propagated the idea of a fence.But Mr. Ferenczi nonetheless seemed to empathize with concerns about the migrants, particularly the numbers of Muslims. Last week, Slovakia said that it would not offer asylum to Muslims, a statement it later recanted.\u201cIf you look a bit closer, you can see another danger, the potential terrorists that could be infiltrating,\u201d Mr. Ferenczi said, echoing the tone of Hungary\u2019s conservative national government and evoking the country\u2019s long history of battling Turkish invasion, from the 14th to the 17th centuries.But today, even Germany says it cannot cope with the influx, estimating last week that it expects up to 800,000 migrants and asylum seekers to arrive this year.Berlin is now demanding a European push to enforce rules, and is itself planning to send home migrants from the poor Balkans drawn by Europe\u2019s No. 1 economy, with its jobs and system of state welfare.The two leading Social Democrats in Germany\u2019s coalition government, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, took the unusual step of publishing a 10-point action program for Europe to avoid an open rift on migration policy.Brussels is not at fault, a senior German government official said Monday. Rather it is up to individual governments in the 28 European Union member states to persuade their publics to take in refugees and treat them well.Everywhere, the mass migration is drawing a divided response, plainly on view here in southern Hungary and northern Serbia.The Serbian police alternately direct refugees along their trek to Hungary, or make a show of turning them around. Hungary\u2019s officers round up refugees, document them, then bring them by the busload to the railway station in Szeged, southern Hungary\u2019s biggest city.At the station square on Saturday morning, some 200 migrants, almost all Syrian, eagerly took the sandwiches and clothes offered by volunteers who for weeks have helped these crowds figure out their next step.Many board a train to Budapest and then decide whether to head \u2014 as law dictates they should \u2014 to a Hungarian refugee camp. But many make the final push toward neighboring Austria and Germany.In many areas, where the authorities have failed, individuals and civic groups have stepped in.Akos Toth, 37, a university lecturer in literature, was among the volunteers helping the migrants wash, shave, eat, drink and \u2014 above all \u2014 charge the cellphones they use as GPS guides and as a way to keep their families informed of their progress.Mr. Toth said he had spent hours at the nearby Hungarian police holding center the previous night, as torrential rain left refugees with little shelter and others sought medical aid. \u201cIt was the most horrible night of my life,\u201d he said.This past weekend, he and other volunteers said, they had coped with the most migrants since the influx started a few weeks ago. \u201cWe are a sort of emergency exit for the government,\u201d helping Hungary to cope, said one volunteer.Robert Lesmajster, a 32-year veteran of refugee work for international organizations, watched weary, stoic migrants arrive at his facility in the north Serbian town of Kanjiza \u2014 three busloads of some 40 each in just under an hour on Friday.\u201cThey all want to go to Germany,\u201d Mr. Lesmajster said. \u201cTheir \u2018promised land.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Nothing would prevent it, he said.\u201cIf they can\u2019t get through Hungary, they will go through Croatia,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Hungarian fence cannot stop them.\u201dAleksandar Dimishkovski contributed reporting from Skopje, Macedonia, and Helene Bienvenu from Asotthalom, Hungary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Allows Limited Oil Exports to Mexico", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision by the Commerce Department fell short of removing a ban on crude exports that goes back to the 1970s, when international oil boycotts produced long lines at gasoline stations and threatened the American economy. It also does not make a broad national security exception for Mexico, which has long existed for Canada, to release larger-scale exports.But support for an end to the ban is growing in Congress among Republicans and Democrats from oil states like Texas. The administration has been reluctant to remove the ban, although it has already given permission over the last two years to American producers to sell some extra-light forms of crude, called condensates, on a limited basis.The oil industry lent cautious applause to the administration\u2019s move, but repeated its calls for a complete end to the export ban.\u201cTrade with Mexico is a long overdue step that will benefit our economy and North American energy security, but we shouldn\u2019t stop there,\u201d said Louis Finkel, executive vice president of the American Petroleum Institute.The sales to Mexico will come in the form of swaps of different grades of oil. American refineries on the Gulf of Mexico are built for the heavy oil produced in Mexico and Canada, while Texas and Oklahoma shale fields near refineries in those states are producing an abundance of light oil.The Mexican market could help relieve a glut that threatens to overwhelm American storage facilities once the summer driving season is over. Mexico could benefit from importing the lighter American crude, which it could blend with its domestic product to make it easier and cheaper to refine locally.But the Obama administration is unlikely to lift the export ban entirely, in part because environmentalists say it would encourage more petroleum development and hydraulic fracturing at a time when the nation should be pivoting away from fossil fuels to curb climate change. Some domestic refiners argue that removing the ban would increase gasoline prices, a contention disputed by producers who contend that more American oil on international markets would actually bring energy costs down.Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who strongly endorses a continuation of the export ban, said that the administration\u2019s decision to allow swaps with Mexico represented more of a continuation of current policy than a break with it.\u201cToday\u2019s action by the Commerce Department to approve a small, temporary swap of oil with Mexico,\u201d he said, \u201cshows that there is already sufficient flexibility under the U.S. oil export ban.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The expanding lexicon officials use to describe such men \u2014 phrases like \u201cself-radicalizing\u201d and \u201clone wolves\u201d \u2014 hardly seems to accommodate the psychological and social factors underpinning the violence.No one was able to say what Mr. Abdulazeez was doing in the privacy of his home, where he seemed to spend most of his time. But his apparent solitude added weight to early theories by investigators in the United States who suspected he had acted alone and was not directed by any militant group.Some have speculated that the young man became swept up in politics or militancy, in a country seared by wars across borders, or grasped for answers to his personal struggles, including depression, in Islam.But the imam, Ayoub Bourini, and others in the tiny middle-class neighborhood in east Amman where Mr. Abdulazeez lived for a time said they had seen no sign of the rage he unleashed in Tennessee \u2014 or for that matter, any spark at all, describing a man whose mind always seemed to be elsewhere.His apparent quest for piety at the mosque was also unremarkable \u2014 less searching than a matter of routine, the imam and others said. He had not been like the \u201caggressive ones\u201d the imam had seen in his 10 years of leading services, men who verbally attacked him after he gave his weekly Friday sermon.He had been sent to Jordan last year to live with his uncle and grandfather, to get away from \u201cbad influences\u201d at home in Tennessee, a family representative said.American law enforcement officials had been investigating whether the uncle, As\u2019ad Ibrahim As\u2019ad Haj Ali, helped steer his nephew toward militancy. Jordanian investigators detained Mr. Ali last month, and F.B.I. agents were dispatched to question him and any associates.Officials have not said what, if anything, the interrogation revealed. Mr. Ali, who was released from custody last week, greeted a reporter at the family home in Amman but declined to talk about his nephew.Neighbors described Mr. Ali as a conservative Muslim \u2014 part of a clique that was active at the mosque \u2014 but said there was no sign that he had any strong ideological or political beliefs.He and his nephew had lived together with the grandfather, in a white villa at the bottom of a hill. The neighborhood had sprouted only in the past few decades, on parcels of land the government sold around the old mosque, said Abdul Monem Barham, who lived next door to the grandfather\u2019s house.Tidy roads lined with small apartment buildings and villas trailed off into desert lots, signs of a neighborhood and a community still without shape. \u201cPeople here are far from each other,\u201d Mr. Barham said.He thought Mr. Abdulazeez spent two or three months in Jordan \u2014 others said it was four to seven \u2014 surrounded by strangers in a country that often feels on edge.The rise of the Islamic State extremist group in the region was just the latest source of anxiety in Jordan, a state filled with refugees of conflicts in Iraq, Syria and the Palestinian territories.A selection of articles from New York Times series about weapons and mental health.It was hard to say whether the political tensions stirred anything in Mr. Abdulazeez, given his apparent reluctance to engage with Jordanians. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any social relationships here, not even with his own generation,\u201d said Qassem Mohammed, who lived two doors away and was one of the few people who remembered the young man without having to look at his photograph.Mr. Abdulazeez was diligent about attending the mosque, Mr. Mohammed said. But, he added, \u201che didn\u2019t open up.\u201dMr. Rabbani, who is based in Amman, said that, without knowing anything about Mr. Abdulazeez\u2019s time in Jordan, he seemed to fit with a trend of either \u201cborn-again\u201d Muslims or recent converts who \u201cgenerally have a shallow understanding of their religion.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re on a journey of rediscovering or discovering your new identity, the field is primarily open for those who scream the loudest, who are able to give you the most black-and-white version with as little ambiguity or doubt or critical examination,\u201d he said, adding that this phenomenon is hardly limited to Islam.\u201cYou have confused, problematic, perhaps disturbed youngsters, who latch onto a simple explanation of the world that solves all their problems.\u201dThe carnage in Chattanooga, like Mr. Abdulazeez\u2019s visit, passed without much notice in the neighborhood, lost in the accounts of massacres and crimes in Syria or other closer places, said the imam, Mr. Bourini.\u201cEvery day, there is news of death,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very far away.\u201dRanya Kadri and Jodi Rudoren contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Poroshenko had conceded the constitutional change, which is included in the text of the Minsk agreement, with a metaphorical gun to his head: thousands of Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russian-backed rebels near the Ukrainian railroad town of Debaltseve.Supporters of the change say granting special status to the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk would co-opt the rebels\u2019 major selling point, blunting the drive for separatism.Yet the war has angered Ukrainians to such an extent, opinion polls show, that members of Parliament are struggling to win support from voters for any concession.\u201cThe president is acting in a brave way,\u201d Mikhail Minakov, an associate professor at the Mohyla Academy in Kiev, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe is trying to find a legal solution to meet the agreement. We have very strong opposition to this in society. People don\u2019t want to go on with the war, but don\u2019t want to concede anything, either.\u201dThree parties from the majority coalition in Parliament supporting Mr. Poroshenko opposed the constitutional changes, making it unclear whether the president can ultimately win approval.Hopes for a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis have been rising lately in Europe as oil prices have sunk, increasing financial pressure on Mr. Putin. With the Russian economy reeling, the thinking goes, he should be more willing to compromise on eastern Ukraine, the source of damaging Western economic sanctions.But that thinking was not shared by many in Ukraine.\u201cThis is not a road to peace and not a road to decentralization,\u201d Yulia V. Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and the leader of one of the dissenting parties, said in comments carried by the news media here. \u201cThis is the diametrically opposite process, which will lead to the loss of new territories.\u201dAs Parliament approved the concessions, protesters outside the building scuffled with police, and shouted, \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d The demonstrators grew more agitated. Some tore helmets from the riot police and threw them on the paving stones.\u201cThey are trading in our blood and our corpses,\u201d said a veteran of the war in the east, Volodymyr Natuta, referring to members of Parliament who supported the measure. \u201cThey sold out Ukraine.\u201dSeveral loud explosions were heard. The interior minister, Arsen Avakov, said that a military hand grenade had been thrown into the police line, at a confusing moment when the police were hurling tear-gas canisters in the other direction.How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.After the grenade explosion, the police carried a dozen or so bloodied and apparently gravely wounded colleagues to ambulances, with the mayor\u2019s office later reporting that one officer had died.It was the first death in politicized street violence in the capital since the 2014 revolution, which overthrew Viktor F. Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president, after months of protests.Officially, the Russian government denies having any hand in propping up the two enclaves in eastern Ukraine. But Ukrainians \u2014 not to speak of virtually every Western government and NATO \u2014 universally reject that, holding Moscow responsible for all the carnage in the east.\u201cEverything is created by Russia and supported by Russia,\u201d Ilona Sologoub, a researcher at the Kiev School of Economics, said of the separatist region. \u201cIf Russia doesn\u2019t want it to exist, it will not exist in a few days.\u201dThe vote in Parliament that so offended Ukrainian nationalist parties, she said, was not about meeting separatist demands.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the separatist governments think,\u201d she said. \u201cIt matters what Putin thinks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brooklyn Rental for Sisters and Their Families", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntFour years ago, Lisbeth Kaiser and Alex Rappaport bought a condo with two bedrooms, two baths and almost 1,000 square feet on Fourth Avenue, the busy thoroughfare on the edge of lively Park Slope, Brooklyn. For $640,000, they got a terrace, a washer-dryer, a roof deck, a storage unit and even a parking spot.\u00a0Once their daughter, Winona, now 2, started crawling, the couple felt the walls closing in. They wanted a larger place in Brooklyn \u2014 ideally, big enough for putting up friends and relatives overnight. \u201cRaising a baby is isolating and exhausting,\u201d said Ms. Kaiser, who works from home as a freelance copywriter. \u201cI really wanted to have people around.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But they couldn\u2019t afford Brooklyn. Their budget for a new home was roughly $1 million. \u201cI never thought I would be able to use the word \u2018million\u2019 in a budget conversation and still think our options were limited,\u201d she said.\u00a0So the couple began exploring neighborhoods with at least some Brooklyn vibe.\u00a0Last fall, they attended an open house for a five-bedroom Tudor in Montclair, N.J., listed for $850,000. The house\u2019s agent urged them to bid immediately, but they were nowhere near ready. And the taxes were high \u2014 almost $25,000 a year for the place, which quickly sold for $999,000.\u00a0They visited Sea Cliff, N.Y., on Long Island, a low-key, beachy, artsy place, where they saw a classic Victorian, circa 1888 and in need of updating, for $1.15 million. \u201cIt was the most charming, magical house,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said. Even so, they were reluctant to leave Brooklyn.\u00a0Meanwhile, Ms. Kaiser\u2019s sister, Cecily Kaiser, the publishing director of children\u2019s books at Phaidon, became pregnant. She and her husband, David Wildes, also lived on Fourth Avenue, in a one-bedroom condo of roughly 800 square feet that had cost around $520,000. They, too, needed a larger place.\u00a0\u201cWe were on parallel tracks,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said.\u00a0One day, she was checking rental listings \u201cto exhaust every avenue for staying in Brookyn before we made a decision to leave,\u201d when she came across a 1906 house with seven bedrooms for $5,500 a month in leafy Ditmas Park.\u201cSome kind of light bulb went off for me,\u201d said Mr. Rappaport, who suggested both families move to the big Ditmas Park house. \u201cWe could all be together while we raised babies, which we felt was a good time to have other people around.\u201d Could it work? The couples discussed everything from splitting expenses to sharing dinner to disagreeing about television shows.At first, such a move seemed \u201cunconventional and risky,\u201d Mr. Rappaport said. But then he and the others decided \u201cit was the least risky\u201d of their options, as well as \u201cthe most supportive and nurturing environment we could create for our kids.\u201dThe couples contacted the house\u2019s agent, Laura Rozos, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group\u2019s Park Slope office. The house, once a parsonage, had long sat unused, she said. A few years ago, she persuaded the church to renovate it and rent it out for income. The area is filled with similar multi-bedroom houses, but \u201cthere isn\u2019t a very strong rental market in those properties,\u201d she said. Most of the parsonage\u2019s renters were short term, needing a temporary place to live while renovating.The families consulted an electrician to make sure the wiring could handle the demand. \u201cWe were looking for reasons not to do this and we couldn\u2019t find any,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said.\u00a0They signed a two-year lease in the spring, and rented out both Fourth Avenue condos. With that rental income, they are roughly breaking even on housing costs. The house had plenty of upfront expenses, including a new washer-dryer, baby gates for stairs, a pool table for the basement and eight air-conditioners \u2014 so many that P.C. Richard & Son gave them a discount.\u00a0Now, the ground floor serves as communal living space, with each family having a floor of its own. Mr. Wildes, who works for a home d\u00e9cor retailer, picked up some furniture at his employer\u2019s warehouse sale.\u00a0All quickly adjusted to the space, even though \u201cwe are still leaving our water glass or our cellphone on the wrong floor,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said.\u00a0The porch and the yard, which allows them to have a baby pool, have \u201cmultiplied our outdoor time,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of gardening potential.\u201d\u00a0Winona remains at her Park Slope day care. The three-mile drive takes 30 minutes each way. Ms. Kaiser no longer wonders why people choose to sit in gridlocked traffic instead of taking the subway. Doing so is better than the alternative, a subway trip involving two trains and lugging a toddler up stairs to make the transfer.\u00a0Most important, life in the house is harmonious. The families have built-in babysitting and dinner together most nights. Mr. Rappaport usually cooks. \u201cIt\u2019s so much more fun cooking for four than cooking for two,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is even an economy of scale using full boxes of things rather than half boxes. It feels like summer camp.\u201dMr. Wildes cleans up. Though he, his wife and their baby son, Ezra, have their own living area \u2014 and television \u2014 on the top floor, they rarely retreat there.\u00a0The couples find themselves up every night talking. \u201cWe end up going to bed a little too late,\u201d Ms. Kaiser said.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sanctions Worked, Congress. Let Them Die.", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Economic sanctions sometimes are called \u201cwar by other means.\u201d But in war, the executive branch generally controls the battlefield without congressional interference. That\u2019s unfortunately less so for sanctions. Many members of Congress are fighting President Obama now to maintain congressional sanctions against Cuba and Iran.American businesses bear the burden of sanctions. The Cuba and Iran sanctions broadly prohibit trade in goods and services; selling even pencils or tractors in either country can subject a company to significant liability. In fact, American businesses have lost markets to their global competitors or paid billions of dollars in penalties for violating sanctions not only against Cuba and Iran, but also against Russia, Syria, Sudan and other countries, groups and individuals.Despite the costs, many sanctions are sensible. Sanctions are intended to isolate their targets until they reform their behavior. That\u2019s a worthy goal. The problem isn\u2019t the use of sanctions by the executive branch; it\u2019s that congressional involvement makes sanctions less effective and causes unnecessary pain for American businesses.Scholars debate how much authority over foreign affairs the Constitution allocates to our different branches of government. Views about the prerogatives of the executive and legislative branches range from unfettered presidential authority, to shared powers, to congressional primacy.The modern presidency, however, has been the dominant force in foreign affairs. The executive branch not only sends troops into battle and trains foreign forces but also conducts diplomacy, allocates humanitarian aid and determines which foreign citizens can travel to the United States.This executive dominance is for the best. International leadership often requires speed, decisiveness and the ability to speak with a single voice in making threats and offering rewards and being able to deliver results. Whatever the virtues of Congress, those aren\u2019t among them. Congress is slow, political, fractured and dysfunctional \u2014 poorly suited for foreign affairs. Recognition of that poor fit should be common ground among Americans, whether one supported President George W. Bush\u2019s foreign affairs initiatives or President Obama\u2019s.Congress, however, has not shied from mandating economic sanctions. And while the president, left alone, can create, tighten, loosen or eliminate sanctions as circumstances warrant, congressional action generally is a one-way ratchet.Why is that? Because once a foreign country generates enough bad will to spark sanctions, congressional pockets of support for maintaining those sanctions persist long after a majority of legislators are ready to loosen them. In the Senate, 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, and Senate rules grant further rights to the minority party. A group of committed members often can block action by majorities.That makes the status quo a good bet in Congress. Unfortunately, this strong tendency means that congressional involvement in sanctions can dull their utility.In the long-simmering debate about the effectiveness of sanctions, a scholarly consensus is emerging that efficacy depends on a combination of factors. These include ensuring that sanctions are multilateral, since in today\u2019s global economy, no country acting alone can exert sufficient economic pressure. They also include a willingness to loosen sanctions in exchange for the change in behavior they were intended to bring about.In the case of Iran, the Obama administration coaxed other countries into imposing economic sanctions for a few years, with the understanding that a deal would prompt an immediate loosening. And the prospect of that loosening became the primary incentive for Iran\u2019s accepting restrictions on its nuclear program.During the negotiations, the Obama administration\u2019s inability to promise a rapid and broad loosening of American sanctions \u2014 because of congressional mandates \u2014 was a stumbling block. Now that obstacle has been overcome, partly by the ability of other countries to make more substantial commitments to loosening sanctions. But solving one problem has left another for American businesses: They will be penalized as their competitors grab market share.This situation could persist for a long time: Even as Cuba and the United States recently reopened their embassies after more than 50 years, congressionally imposed sanctions prevent even the foreign subsidiaries of American businesses from engaging in most forms of trade with Cuba. Those sanctions were never effective in changing Cuba\u2019s behavior, and they probably have far less than majority support in Congress today. But a few determined members are blocking legislation that would roll back the sanctions. The enduring burden on American businesses is now the only discernible effect.President Obama should take a shot at curtailing congressional authority just before he leaves office. He should declare that his own powers under the Constitution include the authority to waive economic sanctions \u2014 a view that has scholarly support. And he should grant a waiver in cases where the congressional mandate does not explicitly make one available. One example: The president could license foreign subsidiaries of American businesses to trade with Cuba, relaxing the Cuba sanctions to the form they took in the early 1990s.It is unlikely that Congress, where only a minority seems to want to maintain all sanctions against Cuba, would block such a waiver by the president. And then a future president could cite the Obama waiver as a basis for a broader rollback of sanctions.An established waiver authority would sharpen the executive branch\u2019s sanctions tools, ensuring that the president could quickly reward a foreign country for behavior that we seek \u2014 sustained Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, for example. And American businesses would not have to bear the burden of sanctions any longer than necessary.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Falters, and the Global Economy Is Forced to Adapt", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe China Factor | Part 2HONG KONG \u2014 The commodities giant BHP Billiton spent heavily for years, mining iron ore across Australia, digging for copper in Chile, and pumping oil off the coast of Trinidad. The company could be confident in its direction as commodities orders surged from its biggest and best customer, China.Now, BHP is pulling back, faced with a slowing Chinese economy that will no longer be the same dominant force in commodities. Profit is falling and the company is cutting its investment spending budget by more than two-thirds.China\u2019s rapid growth over the last decade reshaped the world economy, creating a powerful driver of corporate strategies, financial markets and geopolitical decisions. China seemed to have a one-way trajectory, momentum that would provide a steady source of profit and capital.But deepening economic fears about China, which culminated this week in a global market rout, are now forcing a broad rethinking of the conventional wisdom. Even as markets show signs of stabilizing, the resulting shock waves could be lasting, by exposing a new reality that China is no longer a sure bet.China, while still a large and pervasive presence in the global economy, is now exporting uncertainty around the world with the potential for choppier growth and volatile swings. The tectonic shift is forcing a gut check in industries that have built their strategies and plotted their profits around China\u2019s rise.Industrial and commodity multinationals face the most pressing concerns, as they scramble to stem the profit slide from weaker consumption. Caterpillar cut back factory production, with industry sales of construction equipment in China dropping by half in the first six months of the year.Smartphone makers, automobile manufacturers and retailers wonder about the staying power of Chinese buyers, even if it is not shaking their bottom line at this point. General Motors and Ford factories have been shipping fewer cars to Chinese dealerships this summer.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.It is not just companies reassessing their assumptions. Russia had been turning to China to fill the financial gap left by low oil prices and Western sanctions. Venezuela, Nigeria and Ukraine have been heavily dependent on investments and low-cost loans from China.The pain has been particularly acute for Brazil. The country is already faltering, as weaker Chinese imports of minerals and soybeans have jolted all of Latin America. The uncertainty over China could limit the maneuvering room for officials to address the sluggish Brazilian economy at a time when resentment is festering over proposed austerity measures.The weakness in China is even compelling officials at the United States Federal Reserve to think more globally, as they consider raising interest rates. William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said on Wednesday that a September rate increase looked less likely than it did a few weeks ago.\u201cThe entire world is focusing now on China, watching this crisis unfold,\u201d Armando Monteiro Neto, Brazil\u2019s minister of development and foreign trade, told reporters on Tuesday in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cBrazil is already feeling the effects of China\u2019s deceleration. If the situation gets worse, the impact will get bigger.\u201dThe trouble is, the true strength of the Chinese economy \u2014 and the policies the leadership will adopt to address any weaknesses \u2014 is becoming more difficult to discern.China\u2019s growth, which the government puts at 7 percent a year, is widely questioned. Large parts of the Chinese service sector, like restaurants and health care, continue to grow, supporting the broader economy. But the signs in industrial sectors, in which other countries and foreign companies have the greatest stake through trade, paint a bleaker picture.Adding to the worries are recent events like the deadly explosion of a hazardous chemicals warehouse in Tianjin, which has delayed shipments through one of China\u2019s biggest ports. Labor protests, already rising, jumped sharply across coastal China last week over unpaid wages at struggling export factories.The leadership, concerned with maintaining social stability, has been quick to act, making aggressive moves to prop up the stock market, inject money into the financial system, and generally stimulate the economy. But President Xi Jinping doesn\u2019t have much experience managing a downturn, and some economists worry that the government is making knee-jerk decisions that will do more harm than good.Many company executives and global economists say that forecasting China\u2019s growth has become so hard that they are hedging their bets for the time being. \u201cThis is a complete black art right now,\u201d said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, a large Hong Kong shipping company. \u201cI can\u2019t make any long-term decisions based on what is happening today, and so I just keep our fleet running until we get a bit of direction.\u201dThe problems have been building for months in areas like commodities and industrials where just modestly slowing growth in China has been having outsize effects.For more than a decade, prices surged for iron ore, a main ingredient in making steel, as new skyscrapers, rail lines and other infrastructure were built across China. Last year, BHP Billiton shipped enough iron ore each day to China to fill the Empire State Building.Now, the industry is retrenching in the face of China\u2019s weaker prospects and diving commodity prices.Vale, the Brazilian mining giant, is racing to unload assets. In Australia, Vale and its Japanese partner, the Sumitomo Corporation, sold a coal mine in July for just $1, after it had been valued at more than $600 million three years ago. In Argentina, Vale is trying to sell a potash mine in which it invested more than $2 billion.The fallout in commodities has been especially painful for emerging markets that depend on sales of those resources.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.With Brazil\u2019s revenues declining sharply this year, President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s government is coming under criticism over the country\u2019s dependence on China, which surpassed the United States as the top trading partner in 2009. Brazil\u2019s exports to China fell 23.6 percent, to $24.7 billion, in the first seven months of the year from the same period in 2014.In an editorial on Tuesday, the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo described Brazil\u2019s relationship with China as \u201csemi-colonial,\u201d claiming that the country\u2019s economy \u201cdepends in excess on Chinese prosperity.\u201dIlan Goldfajn, chief economist at Ita\u00fa Unibanco, one of Brazil\u2019s largest banks, said he was already forecasting the economy to contract about 2.3 percent this year, without factoring in the possibility of a hard landing in China. \u201cChina is the most important risk factor for Brazil,\u201d Mr. Goldfajn said.China was supposed to be the financial savior for Russia.Last year, Russia signed a $400 billion natural gas deal with China. China would help finance a nearly 2,500-mile pipeline to ship fuel from Siberia. Russia trumpeted that it would eventually sell more natural gas to China than Germany, now its biggest customer.But the prices that China is willing to pay for the gas are dropping so low that it may no longer be worthwhile to build a pipeline. The Russian energy giant Gazprom has cut its planned capital outlays this year for the first leg of the pipeline by half, Dozhd television reported.\u201cChina is an unclear country for us, opaque,\u201d said Aleksandr Abramov, a professor of finance at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cClearly, the situation will worsen in Russia.\u201dSome of the latest pressures reflect a belated recognition by businesses and politicians that China had been slowing down.Automobile manufacturers cut their shipments of new cars to dealers by 7 percent in July, compared with a year earlier. Retail sales had not suddenly tanked, said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of China\u2019s Passenger Car Association, which represents manufacturers.Rather, too many cars had been sent to dealers\u2019 lots in previous months, he said. In other words, manufacturers were slow to see the economy\u2019s deceleration and waited too long to throttle back their factories.\u201cWhat manufacturers are doing is adjusting inventory levels to the \u2018new normal,\u2019 \u201d said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China, using a favorite phrase of President Xi Jinping of China in recent months to describe an economy that is expanding at a slower pace.Similar adjustments are taking place around the globe.For years, Germany has been well positioned to profit from Chinese growth because it specializes in machine tools and other factory equipment. Most important, China acted as a counterweight to the chronically slow-growing markets in Europe.Now, major German exporters are seeing signs of pressure.Trumpf says that sales of its signature product, machines that automakers use to cut sheet metal that sell for about 500,000 euros ($566,000) each, have continued to grow in China. But in May and June, sales of less-expensive cutting machines flattened and began to decline. At the bottom of Trumpf\u2019s product line, sales have fallen sharply since November for machines often purchased by start-up companies.How industries and economies ultimately fare will depend on how long the slowdown and how deep the economic woes.Demand remains strong at Boeing for its 777-300ER and 787 jets, models that are capable of flights lasting 10 hours or longer, to Europe or North America. Long-haul international travel from mainland China soared nearly 30 percent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, Randy Tinseth, the vice president for marketing at Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft division, said during a visit to Beijing on Tuesday.So far, it has been mixed for technology players. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, said on Monday that business had stayed strong in China in July and August. But Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, said in an earnings call last week that China\u2019s consumer market for printers and computers was \u201cpretty soft,\u201d although demand from businesses was holding up better.In the end, much of the China story will come down to whether the expectations meet the reality. Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of BHP, captured a broader corporate view on Tuesday when he spoke glowingly about China\u2019s potential in the decade to come and predicted continued profitability. But he conceded that the country\u2019s steel production would most likely \u201cgrow a little more slowly,\u201d citing a forecast that works out to just 1.4 percent annually \u2014 a figure that sounds more like Europe than the formerly go-go economy of China.A similar realization is taking place in various corners. \u201cWe had five fabulous years in China, of course, where we grew strong double-digit, and it has been gradually slowing down,\u201d Frans van Houten, chief executive of Royal Philips, the Dutch conglomerate, said on July 27. \u201cI think, going forward, we need to be much more modest on expectations with regard to China growth: That\u2019s just being realistic.\u201dReporting was contributed by Simon Romero from Bras\u00edlia, Brazil; Jack Ewing from Athens; Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Political Risks May Foil Economic Reform in China", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCan China pull it off?It seems this is a pretty big risk.\u201cThe stumbling economy desperately needs a weaker currency,\u201d wrote Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street Research. \u201cIs this the start of a more flexible currency regime or an old-style devaluation?\u201dNobody believes China\u2019s official statistics anyway. What if the country\u2019s economy is slowing faster than anybody knows? Developing countries \u2014 already reeling from the collapse of China\u2019s demand for their raw materials \u2014 could feel the screws tighten further. And if China resorted to further devaluations to bolster exports and work itself out of an economic morass, it would undercut growth worldwide.The aggressive actions by the Chinese authorities signal their growing concern over the country\u2019s declining stock market and weakening economy. But, these sorts of moves are not quite what the I.M.F. means when it calls on China to transition from a single-minded export machine into a more complex market economy powered by consumers.\u201cOn average, autocratic nations grow faster than democratic ones up to around where China is now,\u201d said David Dollar, a former China hand at the World Bank and emissary to China at the Treasury Department who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut successful cases democratize at around this level of income per capita.\u201dHere\u2019s how that sounds in Beijing: Further economic change will inevitably lead to political instability \u2014 not exactly the strongest incentive for government reform.A totalitarian regime may be good at deploying capital and labor to deliver raw economic growth. Yet autocracies are not good at fostering innovation and creativity, which rarely flourish where there is no freedom of thought or speech. While \u201cmake the economy grow and don\u2019t have demonstrations\u201d might have worked in the past, a bureaucratic command and control structure will have a hard time handling the more complex demands of citizens in countries that reach middle-income status.\u201cIt must rely more on innovation and provide more services to urban migrants,\u201d said Kenneth Lieberthal, an expert on China at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt also has environmental constraints and a demographic profile that is shifting dramatically, with a rising proportion of dependents and a shrinking proportion of workers.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to get things wrong. Spending in rural areas on health and education has been dismal. For all the progress of urban schools, the low quality of rural education suggests China may face an acute shortage of skilled labor as it moves up the development ladder.China\u2019s succession of five-year plans has given local government officials a single goal: Grow. This set them off on a binge of borrowing to build everything from roads to industrial parks, often generating lucrative kickbacks for local officials and their families.\u201cLocal governments have been very successful at generating investment and growth, contributing to China\u2019s extraordinary growth performance,\u201d Mr. Dollar wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, they have not put as much effort into public goods such as environmental protection or social services.\u201dWhat is most striking is not how all three countries followed quite similar paths, but how China\u2019s trajectory has diverged from the others\u2019.Household spending was always the main source of demand in all three, declining gradually to about 50 percent of gross domestic product when they were about as rich as China is today. Investment rates, which rose sharply in the early stages of their development, peaked at that time at around 35 percent of G.D.P.By these metrics, China\u2019s economy is upside down: Consumer spending by households is only 35 percent of the nation\u2019s G.D.P. \u2014 one of the lowest levels in the world. Its investment rate \u2014 nearly 50 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 is extraordinarily high. And the productivity of this investment is dismal.To a large extent, its authoritarian command and control economic governance is to blame. Limits on legal migration to cities promoted an underclass of illegal urban workers toiling for meager wages, slowing consumer spending and hindering urban development. State-owned monopolies plowed profits back into investment rather than into government spending on social welfare. Near-zero interest rates on deposit accounts provided cheap loans to business but penalized savers.And this means the Chinese transition will be much more complicated. Unlike Japan, Taiwan and Korea \u2014 which went into their transitions with substantial trade deficits, which swung into surplus to pick up the slack when investment rates declined \u2014 China has been running a hefty surplus for years. A still-fragile world economy is in no position to absorb even more Chinese imports.And then there is the democratic deficit. The changes China needs today will require enriching \u2014 and empowering \u2014 its own citizens. Perhaps that\u2019s why despite repeated pledges from top Chinese authorities to reform and \u201crebalance\u201d its lopsided economy, not much has happened. As the I.M.F. report noted, in most areas China\u2019s progress \u201chas just succeeded in slowing the pace at which vulnerabilities rise.\u201dPerhaps that\u2019s why financial markets are spooked. \u201cThe Chinese, too, think it is unclear where their economy and society will be 10 years from now,\u201d Mr. Lieberthal said.If China doesn\u2019t know, how can we?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Orchestra Society Limits Schedule and Aims for Younger Audience", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe orchestra \u2014 an important part of New York City\u2019s music scene since 1947 that has focused in recent years on classical music for children \u2014 plans to cut the number of performances it gives next season nearly in half as it tries to get back on firmer financial footing and reinvent itself to appeal to new generations of concertgoers.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where we\u2019ve cut our costs administratively, we\u2019ve kind of got ourselves down to bare bones, and we just want to make sure we survive,\u201d William Ohlemeyer, the president of its board, said in a recent interview. \u201cIf we had more, we could do more.\u201dBut in at least one area the Little Orchestra Society, whose music director is now James Judd, is bucking the trend in classical music: The average age of its audience is dropping. The ensemble has not given concerts for adults in a couple of years, and is overhauling its children\u2019s programming in the coming season to focus on some of its youngest concertgoers. It also regularly gives blocks of tickets to public school children and their families.The orchestra has had to evolve as the city\u2019s music scene has changed. Now, even its name is evolving: It has taken to calling itself LOS New York.The Little Orchestra Society began as a chamber orchestra, founded by the conductor Thomas Scherman and dedicated to contemporary music and neglected works for smaller ensembles. The pianist Claudio Arrau played at its inaugural performance in 1947 at Town Hall. Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland led it in performances of their works during its early years. But if performances by smaller ensembles were once rare, they did not stay so for long: Other chamber orchestras soon sprouted in New York, and the field grew more crowded.Gone will be its older series for children, called Lolli-Pops and Happy Concerts. In their place will be a new series called LOS Kids, which will start with four concerts, each with scripts and comical stage business aimed at children between 3 and 7, and each devoted to a single composer. The opening lineup will be Mozart, Dvorak, Gershwin and Tchaikovsky.Joanne Bernstein-Cohen, the orchestra\u2019s executive director, said it needed to adapt and provide fresh works for its audiences if it is to survive. \u201cWe can\u2019t do \u2018Peter and the Wolf\u201d and \u2018Carnival of the Animals\u2019 endlessly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like to look for great works of music and put them in a context that is really engaging for families.\u201dShe said that the orchestra had hoped to begin a second reimagined, more ambitious series for older children called LOS Families, but that those plans were on hiatus. \u201cWe had some really wonderful programs planned, but in the harsh light of reality, we just couldn\u2019t sustain that level of work,\u201d she said.At the same time, she said, the orchestra has lowered ticket prices. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that the ticket price is stopping people from coming,\u201d she said.Now the orchestra, which has been trying to raise money and has added five members to its board over the past year, is working on long-term survival.On its wish list: finding an organization to team up with, preferably one with its own concert hall. The orchestra\u2019s original plans for this season included performances at large halls including the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Avery Fisher Hall, Ms. Bernstein-Cohen said, but its new, truncated season will be entirely at the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College.\u201cWhat makes perfect sense is for us to find a strategic partner,\u201d Mr. Ohlemeyer said. \u201cOur biggest expense is obviously the venue \u2014 it\u2019s the single biggest impediment for us doing more of what we can do. Concert halls are expensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Announcement Means for Greece", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA tumultuous summer in Greece could lead to an uncertain autumn as voters may have to decide who would best navigate the next phase of the country\u2019s financial struggle.Officials said he would seek to schedule the vote for Sept. 20, but it might be later as politicians from other parties jockey for influence. The country\u2019s main conservative opposition said it would try to avert elections by forming a government, as is their right, under the Greek Constitution.It is a bid to consolidate his power and press ahead with the bailout plan he agreed to this summer with European creditors.Mr. Tsipras has been weighing new elections for weeks amid a deep split within his Syriza party over his embrace of the bailout plan that was approved just last week by the Greek Parliament.That bailout package, worth 86 billion euros, or about $98 billion at Friday\u2019s exchange rate, puts in place strict spending limits, new tax increases and changes in the way Greece manages its economy in exchange for money to pay the country\u2019s crippling debts.In calling for the vote after Greece received some \u20ac13 billion, or about $14 billion, of new funds from the bailout package, Mr. Tsipras is hoping that voters will endorse his approach \u2014 and effectively ratify the bailout.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The deal infuriated Syriza\u2019s far-left factions and was approved by Parliament only with the help of opposition parties. Many of the breakaway Syriza lawmakers oppose the bailout plan because it proposes raising the retirement age and opening parts of the Greek economy to greater competition.That is the gamble he is making. Despite his reversal on the bailout plan, Mr. Tsipras has remained popular, with the most recent opinion polls from late July showing no other leader in a strong position to challenge him.Mr. Tsipras said Thursday that he would resign as prime minister \u2014 a constitutional requirement for new elections. But he will not resign as head of his party, now smaller without his former Syriza allies.Syriza was left on Friday with 124 lawmakers in the 300-seat Parliament, but local news reports speculated that four more legislators were preparing to abandon the party.Popular Unity will be led by a former energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, the leader of Syriza\u2019s radical Left Platform faction, with which about 40 of Syriza\u2019s lawmakers were loosely aligned.Mr. Tsipras is counting on his connection to ordinary Greeks, and hoping that his personal popularity can help his party win enough votes to maintain power without the support of the radical parties.If he does not, he might have to form a new coalition with other centrist parties in Parliament, some of whom he has depicted as part of Greece\u2019s corrupted establishment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Debt Crisis Adds to a Spike in Burglaries and Robberies", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 One evening three weeks ago in Kifissia, an affluent garden suburb of Athens, a retired financial adviser and his wife decided to take in one of the delights of summer here, an outdoor movie.They pulled tight the shutters, set the alarm, locked the house and strolled off. Halfway through the movie the alarm company called, and they rushed home to find the alarm immersed in a bucket of water, the shutters jimmied and a safe emptied of jewelry. The speed and sophistication of the crime were astonishing, the financial adviser\u2019s wife said, still feeling vulnerable and not willing to be identified by name.\u201cThey knew they had 10 minutes until the police came; they put everything in a pillowcase, and they were gone,\u201d she said.At seemingly every dinner gathering in Athens this summer, the conversation turns to tales of break-ins, burglaries and robberies that have accompanied the government debt crisis.Even before the crisis shut down the banks and limited the availability of cash, crime of this sort was ticking upward.While the rich may have moved their money to Switzerland, Luxembourg or safe deposit boxes, the middle class has stashed not just cash but gold and jewelry, among other valuables, under the proverbial mattress.Greek crime statistics released last week hinted at a dark side to the secreting of all those valuables. Across Greece, the most serious crime is down or stable over all, but reports of burglaries and robberies were on the rise for the first six months of the year, suggesting that the hidden valuables had become enticing targets for thieves.The increases in crime are small, and it is hard to parse how much is driven by economic hard times, rising poverty and unemployment, and how much is opportunistic, with more soft targets out there.The cash dependency also began at the end of the period, so its impact will not be fully reflected until new data is released.But with the number of robberies in banks, gas stations and supermarkets falling while those in homes and shops are rising, several experts said, a pattern seems to be emerging suggesting that, as the bank robber Willie Sutton might have said, the bad guys are going where the money is.\u201cMany people have taken their money into their homes, so this is understandable,\u201d a police spokesman in Athens said, on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to interpret the data. \u201cCrime has stayed about the same over all, or gone down in the high-risk places, like banks, and up in the soft targets, like on the streets.\u201dThe thieves are most likely part of organized rings, not poor people, said Mary Mantouvalou, a lawyer in the legal aid department of the Athens Bar Association.\u201cA poor person, when he goes to steal, he\u2019ll go to a supermarket, he\u2019ll go to someone known to him who has money,\u201d Ms. Mantouvalou said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about much more serious crime. Sometimes they are violent. They are willing to go as far as necessary.\u201dAmong those arrested in July, the police said, have been a gang preying on older adults who took money out of bank branches, and a young man accused of committing 13 house burglaries in four affluent suburbs over the past few months. At one house in the suburb of Papagou, he and his accomplices took jewelry and valuables worth 40,000 euros, or about $44,000, the police said.Having learned that thieves will go straight to the safe in the closet or the secretaire, Greeks have tried to find more imaginative hiding places, like storage sheds, she said.\u201cBut crime always goes one step ahead of the people and the state,\u201d she said, \u201cso they search in the sheds and don\u2019t even go into the houses.\u201dOver all, security consciousness is rising. It is common to see clusters of uniformed police officers outside the automated teller machines where people line up for their cash ration, especially at bank branches frequented by vulnerable pensioners.Many apartment doors have sprouted new security locks with heavy metal plates, similar to the locks used in safes.Razor wire bristles from garden gates where there were none last summer. Athenians now remind one another to watch out for chain snatchers on the street, to bolt their front doors and to close balcony doors at night.The anti-immigrant, neo-fascist party Golden Dawn has seized on crime as a political tool, using it to cultivate loyalty by escorting older adults to the bank so they would not be robbed by \u201cforeigners.\u201dAnd the United States State Department warned this year that while Athens is generally safe, tourists should beware of pickpocketing and purse snatching in crowded tourist areas and on buses and the Metro.The homeowner in Kifissia can recite other recent thefts. One friend\u2019s home was broken into by burglars who used a blowtorch to silence the alarm; another friend\u2019s heavy-duty lock was cut out with a power tool; and three burglars invaded the house of the best man at her wedding, tied up and beat the maid, yanked the safe out of the wall and escaped with cash and jewelry.After the homeowner\u2019s own burglary, the gardener found a wallet, apparently dropped by the thieves, with the identity card of what she presumes is another victim, who lives in Glyfada on the opposite side of Athens.In 2010, an earlier wave of the Greek crisis, there was an increase in street robberies and homicides in Athens.So far this year in the Athens region, there were 6,600 home break-ins, up from 6,319 during the same time last year, part of a 6.2 percent rise in burglaries. Robberies rose 13.6 percent, including a 6.4 percent increase in robberies in homes. Shop burglaries rose 20.8 percent, to 2,575 from 2,131. Petty theft in public spaces like beaches and parks rose 38 percent, to 2,392 from 1,732, the police said, and mobile phone robberies also rose sharply.On July 19, the night before Greek banks reopened for limited transactions, the head of the Greek banking association, Louka Katseli, called on Greeks to come back.A comparison of the Greek and American bailouts and their economic impact.\u201cTomorrow when the banks reopen and normality returns, let\u2019s all help our economy,\u201d Ms. Katseli said. \u201cIf we take our money out of chests and from our homes, where it is not safe anyway, and we deposit it in the banks, we\u2019ll be boosting the liquidity of the economy.\u201dAnd maybe fighting crime as well.One woman told how her sister\u2019s family had unthinkingly left the ground-floor windows open in their apartment on Lycabettus Hill, an aristocratic part of Athens. While the nanny was alone in the kitchen, burglars sneaked in, cracked a safe, and made off with jewelry and gold coins given to celebrate the birth of a son. The nanny never heard a thing.Business fraud seeking cash also seems to be on the rise, said Rodi Constantoglou, who owns two Greek handicraft stores in Athens. Her shops were recently hit twice \u2014 once by a man who persuaded an assistant to pay for a bottle of perfume he insisted Ms. Constantoglou had ordered (it was counterfeit), and again when a woman insisted that Ms. Constantoglou had promised to help pay for her mother\u2019s back operation (she got away with \u20ac20).The crimes appeared to be part of a well-orchestrated ring, Ms. Constantoglou said. \u201cImagine if they hit 10 stores and fool most of them; that\u2019s not a bad haul.\u201dLike the Athens area, the South Aegean Islands, with their prosperous vacation homeowners and the shopkeepers who cater to them, have also seen an uptick in burglaries, to 214 from 158 for homes, and to 115 from 65 for shops.Ms. Mantouvalou, the lawyer, said that on Sunday burglars broke the window of the friend of a friend\u2019s island house, and fled when the owners returned. They took nothing, and left a tablet computer and cellphone untouched, suggesting that they were looking for just cash.Ms. Mantouvalou said her friends have always felt safe on the island and were shocked. A spokesman for the regional police, Petros Vasilakis, confirmed the burglary. But he said that crime always rises in the tourist season, and it was too soon to draw conclusions. Almost everyone has a story. While walking to work last week, Myrsini Zorba, who runs a nonprofit, excused herself to answer her mobile phone. When she hung up, she explained that a friend had called seeking comfort. She had been at her country home when burglars broke in and stripped everyone of laptops and other valuables. \u201cAt least,\u201d Ms. Zorba said resignedly, \u201cno one was beaten or hurt.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a First, a Sudanese Migrant Nearly Crosses the English Channel on Foot", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For one African migrant, there was nothing left to lose.The migrant, Abdul Rahman Haroun, 40, risked his life this week by climbing four fences, evading international search teams and as many as 400 security cameras, and walking about 30 miles in the darkness of the Channel Tunnel in an effort to reach Britain from Calais, France. He dodged trains traveling to London from Paris as they hurtled by at up to 100 miles per hour.He had made it nearly to the other side, Folkestone, England, before he was caught and arrested on Tuesday.Three days later news of Mr. Haroun\u2019s perilous journey was still reverberating in Britain, a country polarized by a spiraling migration crisis. Though much about him remains unknown \u2014 the police said he is Sudanese and has no fixed address \u2014 his story of determination had reduced the sprawling migration crisis to a human scale, just at a moment when some British politicians and news media have railed at those seeking to enter their country in hopes of a better life in what critics say are increasingly dehumanizing terms.Mr. Haroun\u2019s boldness is unlikely to be rewarded.\u201cIt is illegal and very dangerous to attempt to enter the tunnel, and a person can be seriously injured or killed,\u201d Romain Dufour, a spokesman for Eurotunnel, said by telephone on Friday, adding that Mr. Haroun was the first migrant to walk nearly the entire length of the Channel Tunnel. \u201cMr. Haroun could now face prison, and he will likely not be able to get asylum. He has lost everything.\u201dMr. Haroun was charged with obstructing railroad engines or passenger cars under the Malicious Damage Act of 1861. He is expected to appear at Canterbury Crown Court on Aug. 24. The law office representing Mr. Haroun declined to speak about the case while it was pending.Britain and France are grappling with the challenge of thousands of desperate migrants who have tried to cross the Channel in recent weeks by cutting through fences and stowing away in trucks or other vehicles. Ten migrants have been killed near Calais since June trying to flee to Britain, five of them on the Eurotunnel site and five others on the motorway or near the port, according to Eurotunnel.On Friday, the United Nations called on France to draw up a civil emergency plan to accommodate the thousands of people living in makeshift camps in Calais.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.Others have bemoaned the seemingly cold reaction against migrants, for whom Mr. Haroun may now become a potent symbol of desperation.Chai Patel, policy officer at Migrants\u2019 Rights Network, said Friday that the case of Mr. Haroun showed the desperation of people fleeing conflict-ridden Africa, and the increasing unwillingness of European countries, including Britain, to take them in.\u201cMany European countries don\u2019t want them, and the U.K. has been unwilling to take up the slack,\u201d he said. He said that the criminalizing of Mr. Haroun\u2019s journey underlined a paradox of British policy and that of Europe as a whole. \u201cIf you block off the safe and legal routes into a country, and migrants try and get in, they are branded as criminals even though this is a fundamental human right,\u201d he said.Tuesday was not the first time a migrant had managed to get inside the tunnel. In June 2012, a migrant succeeded in entering the same southern tunnel that Mr. Haroun entered. He was arrested after getting stuck in a storeroom.Mr. Dufour said that Eurotunnel was investigating how Mr. Haroun had entered the tunnel undetected, despite heightened security. The Kent Police said that they were also investigating the incident. Britain\u2019s Home Office said it had been bolstering security for Eurotunnel platforms and improving surveillance with extra search teams that use dogs to protect the Eurotunnel site.\u201cIf someone is found to have no legal right to remain in the U.K., we will take action to remove them,\u201d it said in a statement.Mr. Dufour said that Mr. Haroun had left Calais around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday.An alert had been put in place overnight after hundreds of migrants tried to enter the Eurotunnel terminal, Mr. Dufour said, but Mr. Haroun was nevertheless able to make his way toward England. Three tunnels cross the channel: two that are used by trains, and a smaller service tunnel used for emergencies.Mr. Haroun used the southern rail crossing, Eurotunnel said.With security personnel on alert, Mr. Dufour said that traffic was halted in a roughly 10-mile stretch of the tunnel, and that inspectors searched the tunnel and sealed the entrance on the French side.Police officers scoured the area for intruders, leading to two-hour delays for some passengers. A \u201ctest\u201d train was also sent at a slow speed to inspect the tunnel, Mr. Dufour said.The British authorities said Mr. Haroun was finally caught in the southern Channel Tunnel and arrested near Folkestone, at 6:13 p.m., nearly 10 hours after his journey began. The police declined to disclose details of how he was apprehended.The journey made headlines on both sides of the channel, illustrating how a determined migrant could evade the authorities in what the daily newspaper Nord Littoral described as a dangerous \u201cgame of cat and mouse.\u201dThe newspaper noted that Mr. Haroun had risked his life in a \u201cmad race.\u201dMr. Dufour said Eurotunnel had been dealing recently with nearly 1,000 attempts a day by migrants trying to get to England by various means, although he said the number appeared to be decreasing in recent days.Many of the migrants in Calais come from conflict-ridden countries in the Middle East and Africa and have endured perilous journeys across the Mediterranean, often abetted by human traffickers. An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 migrants are housed in a camp near Calais. Britain last year received an estimated 25,000 asylum applications, compared with about 175,000 in Germany, according to the United Nations.The logjam caused by migrants trying to cross the Channel is costing the British economy as much as $390 million a day, according to some estimates. Nigel Farage, of the far-right U.K. Independence Party, recently has warned that unless something radical was done it was only a matter of time before British vacationers or a truck driver \u201cdies as a result of the Calais migrant crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Is a C.E.O. Worth? America\u2019s Confused Approach to Pay", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesDo corporate chief executives make too much money, or too little?On the other hand, the stewardship of large, complex companies is really important, and anyone who cares about the American economy should want the most capable people in charge of them.Publicly traded companies will now be required to disclose how much their chief executives are paid relative to their median workers. The idea is that those with particularly enormous pay gaps between their top executives and ordinary workers will face public and investor pressure to narrow them. It might even be enough to make boards think twice about giving their C.E.O. a raise, or make them more sympathetic to raising pay for the rank and file.We\u2019ll see. But the fact that this is the most significant policy initiative on executive pay of the Obama years \u2014 and that it took five years of rule-making purgatory since being initially legislated in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 reveals how conflicted public policy remains over why executive pay has risen so drastically and what, if anything, to do about it.There are competing (and not necessarily exclusive) theories as to why executive pay has soared so much.Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.One is that it reflects self-dealing by corporate boards, mutual back-scratching by corporate elites who overpay one another out of some kind of cultural solidarity. Another is that this is a manifestation of winner-take-all effects that are prevalent in the modern economy, where the very best at something earn vast rewards and everybody else is out of luck.In the first story, high C.E.O. pay is basically irrational, a fraud upon shareholders and workers alike. In the second story, high executive pay is more or less rational. If you are a director at a major company, it\u2019s worth paying tens of millions of dollars a year to get an executive who you expect will increase the company\u2019s value by billions. In this telling, Mr. McMillon vastly outearns a typical Walmart cashier for the same reasons that Mr. Pujols vastly outearns a minor league baseball player.But things get a great deal trickier if the second story is closer to the truth. If C.E.O.s are receiving eight-figure pay packages because in a modern economy they really are worth that, then boards should ignore whatever public pressure comes their way from disclosure of pay gaps.And if boards do respond to public pressure and slash C.E.O. pay, publicly traded companies could see an exit of top talent toward privately held companies that don\u2019t face similar disclosure rules, potentially making some of America\u2019s biggest and most important firms less well run as a consequence.In this version, if you believe that there is something fundamentally unfair about an economy that shifts more and more of the rewards of growth to the ultra-wealthy, you would want to deal with it with policies that apply to everyone, not just the chief executives of one subset of corporate America. For example, you could raise the marginal tax rate on income above some high number, and use the extra revenue to fund a higher earned-income tax credit that essentially subsidizes the working class. That, of course, would never pass a Republican Congress that is staunchly opposed to higher top tax rates. But it would apply equally to all the winners in the winner-take-all economy, whether they are elite baseball players, public company C.E.O.s or executives of privately held companies.So, in effect, the conservative argument that high executive pay reflects the market at work implies that fighting inequality requires a more radical set of policy responses than conservatives could ever get behind. And the liberal argument that it is a problem of bad incentives and corporate misdeeds implies that smaller interventions might do the trick, even if many on the left would prefer a more robust set of policies to reduce inequality.Either way, the five-year drama of the new C.E.O. pay rule that concluded Wednesday makes this clear: Even small changes to policy around executive pay won\u2019t come easy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bucks\u2019 Owners Win, at Wisconsin\u2019s Expense", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesMILWAUKEE \u2014 To own a professional sports team is so often to achieve your heart\u2019s desire.These opening feints were right out of the professional sports owner handbook. From start to desultory end, Milwaukee offered a case study in all that is wrong with our arena-shakedown age.Tim Sheehy, the president of the local chamber of commerce, talked with me last fall of the ineffable benefits of a pro team. \u201cIt gives the city an identity and gives us something different than Des Moines.\u201dEconomists are a fractious lot and rarely agree. If economists left and right share any single view, however, it\u2019s that local and state governments should eliminate subsidies to arenas and stadiums.The timing of the arena deal was inauspicious. The governor and legislators approved the arena just one month after they cut $250 million from the budget of the prestigious University of Wisconsin System.The political waters on this deal ran swift and deep. The new majority owners of the Bucks, Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry, are big donors to the Democratic Party. Lasry has bundled tens of thousands of dollars for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, and his hedge fund once employed her daughter, Chelsea.The private pursuit of a publicly financed arena, however, recognizes no partisan boundary.The hedge fund owners proved deft with ownership shares, handing these out to prominent Wisconsin businessmen and Republicans, including the developer Jon Hammes. Hammes has become national finance co-chairman for Walker, a Republican presidential candidate. The Capital Times recently reported that a political action committee connected to Hammes contributed $150,000 to the governor in late spring.Walker and his staff, despite professed fiscal conservatism, took the role of architect for this plan. Much of the time they worked closely and, four legislators said, in secret with the Milwaukee County executive, Chris Abele, a Democrat.Abele told me he detested the shakedown of cities and states to build private stadiums. \u201cIf Congress considered a law that would prevent any public financing for sports stadiums, I would support that,\u201d he said.The world, however, is what it is. Abele said he saw a chance to jump-start development in Milwaukee and so he helped draw up a generous public financing plan.Milwaukee County\u2019s portion of arena debt amounts to $4 million annually for 20 years; if the county fails to come up with its payments, the state could deduct the money from annual aid to the county. Abele has spoken of scrounging up the county\u2019s payment by allowing the state to crack down on the county\u2019s many debtors.That sounds fine in theory. In practice, it could mean hounding working-class homeowners for property taxes or pursuing residents who have delinquent ambulance bills. No county can afford to let taxes go uncollected, but that strategy registers as a touch repellent.Not all Milwaukeeans gave the new owners a hug. Last year, Southeastern Wisconsin Common Ground \u2014 a fine coalition of churches, synagogues, mosques and community groups \u2014 surveyed the city\u2019s pitted fields and dilapidated recreation centers and proposed that an arena bond issue should include money for Milwaukee\u2019s playing fields. The group also pushed for a public referendum.The local business community \u2014 which includes several members who have ownership shares in the team \u2014 dismissed such ideas as impractical.\u201cThe Bucks took control of the strategy from the start,\u201d said Bob Connolly, a member of Common Ground. \u201cThey pushed the referendum idea right to the side.\u201dMonths later, when Common Ground leaders turned to usually friendly local foundations for more funding, they found themselves turned away. You are, they were told several times, too political.Common Ground asks that no tears be shed on its behalf. Years ago it started a health cooperative, persuaded five banks to give it $33 million to rehabilitate foreclosed homes and preached hardheaded realism. It simply redoubled its organizing efforts.One of its organizers began digging into ownership records for the decrepit and foreclosed homes that hang like dead weights on many working-class Milwaukee neighborhoods. One day, a researcher called Keisha Krumm, the lead organizer for Common Ground, and said, You\u2019re not going to believe this.Nationstar, a nationwide mortgage servicer, manages some of the city\u2019s worst kept foreclosed homes, properties commandeered by raccoons and drug dealers. Edens, one of the Bucks\u2019 owners, is the majority stakeholder and chairman of Nationstar.I visited one of these abandoned homes, on a tree-laden street of handsome old homes in a tattered neighborhood. The remains of a decaying animal hung off the porch roof. Burned-out gaps in the back of the house allowed anyone, child or dealer, to walk into the house. (Nationstar has told Common Ground that it recently transferred this house to another servicer, which, I learned, has an even worse reputation.)This year Edens and his hedge fund, Fortress Investment Group, purchased yet another huge mortgage servicing company. Newspapers proclaimed him the king of subprime. As abuses in the subprime lending and servicing industry helped sink the national economy in 2008, and made the recovery painful for millions, that was not an unadulterated compliment.A Northstar vice president noted that Edens did not personally own these homes and that the company had \u201cworked diligently\u201d to reduce its foreclosures.None of these revelations slowed the negotiations. By June, lobbyists by the dozens, all in the pay of the hedge funders and their business allies, descended on the hallways of the State Capitol in Madison.Great pressure was applied to Democratic legislators from Milwaukee to vote yes on the arena bill. When Assemblyman Jonathan Brostoff spoke of grave doubts, some supporters told him he was betraying Milwaukee.\u201cWe are building an arena for two of the richest people in the U.S.A. and they are just asking for more,\u201d Brostoff said. \u201cIf aliens came down and looked at this, they\u2019d say, \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019\u00a0\u201dDavid Bowen, a young African-American assemblyman from Milwaukee, came under particular pressure. Milwaukee\u2019s population is 40 percent black, and the African-American vote is influential in local elections. The owners of the Bucks courted black leaders and gave ownership stakes to several African-American businesspeople.As the vote neared, Bowen stood accused of betraying his city and black Milwaukeeans. At least one online site serving the black community suggested he would face a primary opponent in the next election.Bowen was unmoved.\u201cThe owners acted as if they had no obligation to our community,\u201d he said. \u201cTo argue that we all have an obligation to them is kind of crazy.\u201dBrostoff and Bowen voted against the arena bill. It passed the State Assembly and the State Senate by reasonably large margins.The gift-giving did not end. Edens and Lasry formed a development company called Front of the Herd. Abele, whose office essentially controls land sales in Milwaukee County, sold 10 acres of vacant publicly owned downtown land \u2014 appraised at $8 million \u2014 to the developers for the exquisitely reasonable cost of $1.I know, Abele told me, that this looks like another favor for the wealthy. But the land had lain fallow for years. To his view, he had a rare chance to complete the renovation of downtown Milwaukee, which in too many places looked like a desert. For years, developers shied away from that site because they would have to remove a large sewer pipe at a cost of millions of dollars.As it turns out, say those close to the arena negotiations, the city will absorb the cost of removing that pipe as part of its share of the deal. Sometimes a sweet gift for a developer is truly sweet.Let\u2019s pause here: Based on state legislative estimates, and talks with negotiators, the real public cost of the Bucks arena, with interest payments and risky bond offerings tossed in, stands at about $500 million, or nearly twice what was proposed a year ago.More gifts were tucked like toys into a stocking. The city will build a $35 million parking garage, but half the revenue will go to the Bucks, along with all of the revenue from naming rights for the arena, worth perhaps $120 million.County Supervisor John Weishan, a Democrat, opposed the subsidies. Milwaukee County, he said, has to contend with a perilously high child-poverty rate, spiraling homicides in the city and a lack of Internet infrastructure that hobbles its ability to create jobs.\u201cIf I had asked the state government for a $200 million fiber-optic installation to bring Milwaukee into the 21st century,\u201d Weishan said, \u201cthey would have laughed me out of the State Capitol.\u201d City officials took only a small role in the state negotiations, and managed to tighten some terms. They did not want to play the role of sap. So they asked the owners to sign an ironclad agreement not to move the team for the 30-year life of the lease on the new arena.The Bucks\u2019 owners said no. They had signed agreements that would require them to pay off the remaining public debt on the arena if the team left early.As Small noted, it is the cultural and economic practice of the hedge fund man to buy low, push up value, divest and move on. Milwaukee would be left with an aging arena.\u201cIt was like a tidal wave; they pulled out everything they could from this deal,\u201d said Krumm, the Common Ground organizer. \u201cAnyone who raised questions was accused of wanting to lose the Bucks.\u201dWisconsin and Milwaukee did not lose the Bucks. They did spend a pile of public money to build an arena for billionaires.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Ukrainian Border Town Once Fenced by Soviets Blossoms Into a Shopper\u2019s Paradise", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMali Selmensti JournalMALI SELMENTSI, Ukraine \u2014 The main street is a lovely ribbon of asphalt these days, a far cry from the rutted moonscape that once prevented even buses from bouncing into the tiny, decrepit village.Lining the narrow road are an equally improbable series of sparkling shops, selling sports clothes, Gucci tank tops, dress shoes, Chanel perfume, flip-flops. There is even a sprawling wedding dress emporium where clusters of excited women contemplate a platoon of mannequins adorned with sequined chiffon and lace.\u201cIt was a small village at the end of the world,\u201d said Monika Mondok, standing outside a two-story emporium selling brand-name sportswear. \u201cBut then, when the gate opened, it blossomed.\u201dThe saga of this small Ukrainian village (population 200) and its Slovakian twin (population 400), reads like a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode joining the cruelty and absurdity of the 20th century with a most unlikely 21st-century denouement.Part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its collapse at the end of World War I, the two medieval villages had long ago intertwined, sharing a church, community center and schools. In 1919, the combined area was given to Czechoslovakia. In 1938, it became part of the Kingdom of Hungary.And then, after World War II, with Ukraine absorbed into a surging Soviet empire eager to claim as much territory as possible, a new international boundary was drawn smack through the center of town.Overnight, families and friends a few blocks apart found themselves living in different countries, separated by surly border guards and, for 61 years, rarely allowed to visit one another. Even talking through the fence was forbidden.During funerals, coffins were taken near the border so those on the other side could view the body. Residents outwitted the Russian guards by passing information in songs they sang in the fields. In one oft-repeated incident, a young girl who had been visiting her grandmother was separated from her parents and had to stand near the border fence several years later so her mother could see her in her wedding dress.Finally, in 2005, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and under pressure from residents and international attention, the Ukrainian and Slovakian governments allowed a pedestrian-only crossing to be cut through the fence.And then came, perhaps, the strangest twist of all.Since Slovakia is a member of the European Union, its citizens can travel into Ukraine \u2014 which is eager to get closer to Europe \u2014 simply by presenting a passport. But citizens of Ukraine must still get a visa, which takes weeks and is, at $38, beyond the means of many.At the same time, prices for most consumer goods are considerably cheaper in inflation-choked Ukraine. So shoppers from Velke Slemence and other nearby Slovakian towns poured through the new border gate in search of bargains, transforming the little town into something like an outlet center, while Ukrainians faced much greater hurdles to get into Slovakia.The result is that shops in Slovakia, where the national economy is considerably more robust, have withered, and almost the entire commercial life of the area has shifted to the crumbling Ukrainian side.\u201cToday, there are only three shops in all of Velke Slemence,\u201d said the village\u2019s mayor, Ludovit Toth. \u201cIn Mali Selmentsi, there are 30.\u201dIn the first years after the gate opened, more than 1,000 people a day passed through, some to visit long-lost relatives but most to shop. The number of stores rose to more than 70.Cigarettes were the main commodity, selling for a fraction of what they cost in Slovakia. But then, in 2008, after Slovakia changed its regulations to limit visitors to two packs per week, the number of shoppers fell sharply.Ibolya Palfi Szurte, the clerk in a crowded boutique near the border gate on the Ukrainian side, said business had fallen since the cigarette rules changed and many shops had to close. But there were still enough bargains to power the village.\u201cIn summer, we get people coming from as far away as the Czech Republic,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at this bottle of Versace perfume. We sell it for 5 euros and 50 cents. People can take it to Slovakia and sell it there for 30 euros, easily. In mall stores it sells for much, much more.\u201dShe is surrounded by luxury brand names on tank tops and running shorts; \u201cfor Slovakian shoppers, it is all about the brand name,\u201d she said.Outside, groups of shoppers carrying plastic bags and licking ice cream cones moved up and down the narrow road.\u201cThings have gotten better since the gate opened, no question,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy is better. People can fix up their homes. And the road, it has gotten so much better.\u201dThe mayor of Mali Selmentsi, Jozef Illar, said that while some families with homes near the border had seen a small windfall, he measured the spread of prosperity in a different way.\u201cBefore the crossing opened, there were 100 cows in the village,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, there are 30. From this we can see that people no longer feel they must keep animals to survive.\u201dJudging the opening of the border in terms of profit is the wrong way to look at it, said Tibor Bodnar, the former mayor of the nearby Slovakian town of Velke Kapusany.\u201cIt is really more a matter of setting right a historical wrong committed long ago,\u201d he said.Josef Ivan, 74, a retired bus driver whose pension is just $58 a month, stood in the middle of the road on the Ukrainian side roughly 200 yards from the border gate, about the point where the shops peter out and crumbling homes stretch toward the drab eastern horizon.\u201cThe day the gate opened, people were crying when they met,\u201d he said.Visits with relatives were possible during the Soviet years, he said. But they were limited to once a year, required a letter of invitation, weeks of wrestling with the bureaucracy and a 100-mile round-trip through the nearest border crossing.He still has a cousin living on the Slovakian side. \u201cFor a long time we were not acquainted and, truth is, we rarely visit anymore,\u201d he said.Too many years had passed. Family ties stretched, then snapped. And many who remember those years are elderly, or already gone.When the Soviets built the wall, Priska Tomoriova was with relatives on the Slovakian side, and was separated from her mother. In the following 44 years, until her mother died, they visited each other only four times.\u201cBut what could we do?\u201d asked Ms. Tomoriova, 81, seated beside her 85-year-old husband in their small, perfectly square living room, plaster reliefs of Jesus and Mary gazing down at them. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dShe thought back to some of the ways people coped with the situation.\u201cOur best trick was hiding notes under the wings of a chicken and sending it across the border,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Russians never discovered that one.\u201dNow, she said, her husband has difficulty walking. So even though the border is open, they rarely cross. She goes once a year to buy candles and flowers to decorate the family graves for All Saints\u2019 Day.\u201cIt all happened a long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is history, and what can you do about history? It is what it was.\u201dMiroslava Germanova contributed reporting from Velke Slemence, Slovakia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Get an M.F.A.?", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBookendsEach week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Siddhartha Deb and Ayana Mathis discuss the worth of graduate writing programs.By Siddhartha DebDo you care about the oppressive lack of diversity in M.F.A. programs?No advice is useful, as you, an aspiring writer, already know. You have read Rilke\u2019s letters to a young poet. I\u2019m sure you remember the first letter: \u201cNo one can advise and help you, no one.\u201d You know James Baldwin\u2019s words in his Paris Review interview: \u201cIf you are going to be a writer there is nothing I can say to stop you; if you\u2019re not going to be a writer nothing I can say will help you.\u201dStill, you persist. You scrutinize advertisements for M.F.A. programs, click through websites, attend open houses. You look at alumni who have gone on to publish. You study names of faculty members, wondering what this one or that one might be like as a mentor. You assess the fellowships and assistantships on offer. If your tastes run to a program in New York, perhaps you think of the readings, the agents, the editors, the magazines, the parties, the literary advances, the amorous advances, and think to yourself, \u201cM.F.A. + N.Y.C. = Me?\u201dWho am I to say that your persistence is false? I have never taken a creative-writing class, but I know a great many talented writers who teach in M.F.A. programs. How could anyone not learn from them? If an M.F.A. involves critiques, guidelines and deadlines, adding discipline and form to the creativity you\u2019ve always enjoyed, it\u2019s preparing you well for life as a writer. Then, there is the degree itself, allowing you in turn to teach creative writing, which may mean a steady paycheck and health insurance to supplement your writing income.You know all this, and you know that you do not live in Rilke\u2019s world or in Baldwin\u2019s. You can point out that Mark McGurl, in his book \u201cThe Program Era,\u201d locates the energy of postwar American literature in its writing programs, professionalized and institutionalized, yes, but always democratic, always creative. Against the argument that M.F.A. programs exemplify an assembly-line aesthetic, you assert that there are writers with M.F.A.s, like Rachel Kushner, who break the mold, and writers without M.F.A.s, like Jonathan Franzen, who produce conventional work.Faced with such certainty, should I raise the issue of student debt? Do you want to hear about the precarious creative economy, one involving low writing fees and adjunct positions that have far more in common with a factory shop floor than a workshop? Do you care about the oppressive lack of diversity in M.F.A. programs \u2014 what Junot D\u00edaz calls \u201cM.F.A. vs. P.O.C.\u201d \u2014 that seems to translate into the astonishingly narrow range of contemporary writing? How is any of this relevant for you?It depends on where you\u2019re coming from. If you are one of the truly privileged, you will probably do well with an M.F.A., locking into a publishing system fine-tuned to reward those already rewarded, those without debt, with cultural cachet, with the rent paid for. If you happen to be below that level, with just enough privilege to fool yourself to take on debt, you will probably use your M.F.A. to carry out the \u201cshadow-work\u201d of the creative economy, giving the successful their veneer of success. You will talk about their books, attend their readings, blog and tweet about their work, hoping to ascend to their level one day. And you might.But it is you, who are in neither category, whom I address when I say that you already know that you are operating in enemy territory. You might undertake an M.F.A. because it offers you some grant money and time, or because it gives you a student visa and an opportunity to escape. But you know it is not your friend. You know that writing is a political, ethical thing and that you will have to look outside the professional world of both N.Y.C. and the M.F.A. in order to keep that vision of writing alive. You know Baldwin\u2019s words, and you repeat them to yourself every day. \u201cFind a way to keep alive and write. There is nothing else to say.\u201d\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6By Ayana MathisThe formalized study of writing isn\u2019t an alchemic formula by which every student becomes Tolstoy.I heard the news about Charleston as I was writing a draft of this essay. I stared at the radio in disbelief, hoping NPR had gotten it wrong. I called my mother. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this would happen anymore,\u201d she said, with the muted shock that comes of living through 81 years of assault on black lives. After we spoke, I continued with my essay. I wanted to lie down and weep, but falling to pieces seemed indulgent somehow, when so many black people have had to keep working and living in the face of atrocity. I finished that first draft, and promptly deleted it \u2014 that day I couldn\u2019t have cared less about whether writers should get M.F.A.s, and what\u2019s more, the relevant question has to do with the literature we write, not whether we ought to go to graduate school to write it.In the weeks after Charleston I did what I always do when I am feeling gutted. I read. I read James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cDown at the Cross.\u201d I read Iris Murdoch\u2019s \u201cThe Bell,\u201d which couldn\u2019t be more remote from our current troubles, and yet, in its scope and intelligence, served as a kind of antidote to my hopelessness. \u201cThe Bell,\u201d like all of the best literature, resists reduction and simplification. This isn\u2019t to say that good books ought to be moralizing \u2014 on the contrary \u2014 but they should be capacious and striving, which requires capacity and seriousness from those who write them, and I do care very much about the books we write.To the point of those who write: New voices emerge from inside and outside the academic system, but it is true that M.F.A. programs have developed something of a gate-keeping function. The system is certainly flawed: Programs vary wildly in quality and cost. They can inspire inflated expectations \u2014 after all, the formalized study of writing isn\u2019t an alchemic formula by which every student becomes Tolstoy, or even publishes a book. It is also the case that the M.F.A.\u2019s workshop model, with its intense scrutiny of new work, can be crippling for some writers.Nonetheless, M.F.A. candidates spend a couple of years studying the craft of literature, immersed in its more esoteric and ineffable qualities, as readers and as writers. That\u2019s no small thing. My own M.F.A. experience at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop was extraordinary, and as a teacher in that same program I have seen the ways in which it can be transformative. A good program offers students artistic and, in some cases, financial support, as well as time to write and a professional network. Networks are of inestimable importance to all unpublished writers. At the highest levels, publishing remains a bit clubby and impenetrable. For students of color especially, networks created at an M.F.A. program can open doors to the hallowed, and strikingly undiverse, halls of publishing houses.Besides, M.F.A.s aren\u2019t going anywhere. Thus, the real questions have to do with the administration of these programs. Are they held to a standard of literary excellence? How are decisions made about who gets admitted? Considering that the work of writers of color, L.G.B.T. writers, working-class and poor writers, expands and enriches American literature, M.F.A. programs must take special care to admit and nurture such students. Diversity \u2014 in terms of race, class, style, genre, educational background (Faulkner, for example, was an autodidact) \u2014 must be a mandate, not empty policy-speak.When I was a student at Iowa, Marilynne Robinson told an anecdote about her visit to a women\u2019s prison in Idaho. After her reading, one of the women asked if she also taught writing. When Robinson answered in the affirmative, the woman said, \u201cTeach them to write good books.\u201d The current debate about M.F.A. programs is polemical, as are so many of our debates about race, about class and on and on. In the end, literature is what matters. We must write it well \u2014 as many of us as possible, by whatever means we are able.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 The Thai authorities on Tuesday said they were pursuing a man captured on video before the bombing of a religious shrine in Bangkok the night before, an attack that killed at least 20 people, many of them tourists.Security footage showed the man at the Erawan Shrine taking off his backpack and leaving it under a bench. The footage and other images, which were widely shared on social media, showed the man wearing a bright yellow shirt.\u201cIt is quite clear that he is the perpetrator in this case,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri, a spokesman for the Thai national police.The police described the man as a potential suspect based on analysis of more than a dozen security cameras in the area.Prayut Chao-ocha, the head of Thailand\u2019s military junta, said the blast could have been the work of groups based inside or outside the country.\u201cThere are individuals or a group of people in our country who have ill will to the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a movement that probably wishes for political gain, and to destroy the economy, destroy tourism, among other things.\u201dGeneral Prawut said the bomb detonated several minutes after the suspect departed on a motorcycle taxi. Investigators believe that materials for the bomb had been bought and assembled in Thailand, he added.\u201cThe bomber was a professional,\u201d General Prawut said.Among the dead were five Thais, two Malaysians, two mainland Chinese, two Hong Kong Chinese and a Singaporean. The police said that arriving at a precise death toll was difficult because bodies had been dismembered by the blast.With the city already on edge after the attack on Monday, video circulated on social media Tuesday of another explosion, under a Bangkok bridge. No injuries were reported, but the authorities said they were searching for links to the shrine explosion.The search for the suspect in the attack has been partly tainted by the country\u2019s poisonous political divides. After a decade of political turmoil that has turned Thailand\u2019s public institutions into factions warring for supremacy, what theories and information officials did offer were being met with skepticism.Map of an explosion in Bangkok\u2019s main shopping district.Officials also strongly suggested that elements allied with Thaksin Shinawatra, the ousted prime minister who is a political lightning rod in Thailand, were probably behind the blast.The rapid assertions followed a pattern of finger-pointing that has persisted here as the country\u2019s politics have grown ever more dysfunctional over the years. Faith in Thailand\u2019s institutions has become a casualty of its political wars, legal analysts said.\u201cThere is huge cynicism because there is an absolute politicization of Thailand\u2019s major institutions,\u201d said Sam Zarifi, the director of Asia-Pacific operations at the International Commission of Jurists, a human rights group. \u201cEvery institution is politicized: the military, the police, the courts. There is no trusted arbiter anymore.\u201dThe government\u2019s spokesman, Maj. Gen. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said several hours after the blast on Monday evening that the bombing \u201cwas probably conducted by the same group of people who lost privileges and who want to create disturbance in the country.\u201d His comments were widely seen as referring to supporters of Mr. Thaksin, whose political movement was ousted in the coup last year.Nattawut Saikua, one of the leaders of a political faction allied with Mr. Thaksin, said Tuesday that the government\u2019s accusation \u201cnot only affects the credibility of the government agencies but also creates mistrust among the people.\u201d\u201cThe Thai people absolutely want to know the truth as soon as possible as to who was the vicious person who conducted such crime,\u201d Mr. Nattawut, a leader of a movement known as the red shirts, posted on Facebook on Tuesday. \u201cBut it must come together with the reliable evidence.\u201dAfter police investigators worked into the night on Monday, cleaning crews arrived after daybreak to scrub blood from the pavement around the Erawan Shrine. The powerful explosion had torn through worshipers at the shrine and a rush-hour crowd on the sidewalk. As of midday, the bloodstains, some of which reached the second story of a shopping mall, remained as a reminder of the blast\u2019s power.Expressions of concern and sorrow poured into Thailand after the blast. The Rev. Joe Maier, a Catholic priest who runs Mercy Center, a foundation for children in a large Bangkok slum, wrote an email to the foundation\u2019s supporters saying that all of the street children that the center supports were accounted for and unharmed.\u201cThe children ask, why did these bad people want to hurt everyone,\u201d Father Maier wrote, \u201cand we have no answers.\u201dPoypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Growth Steady in July, Possibly Easing Path for Fed Action", "Date": "2015-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy delivered pretty much what was expected last month in terms of hiring, giving the Federal Reserve one more piece of evidence that conditions are strong enough to support an increase in the interest rate.The pace of employment growth was steady, if not spectacular; the economy added 215,000 jobs in July. While not as robust as the gains recorded in May and June, Friday\u2019s Labor Department report came in within 10,000 jobs of what forecasters had predicted, a notable feat of consistency in an economy that employs nearly 150 million people.The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent. If the current pace of job growth can be maintained, economists expect the jobless rate to sink below the crucial 5 percent level by late 2015 or early 2016.With the job market generally moving in the right direction, the Fed is likely to stay the course in its plans to raise short-term interest rates soon. Fed officials haven\u2019t given a definitive signal, but they\u2019ve indicated that a rate increase is possible at the next Fed meeting in September or at their last meeting of the year in December.While pockets of weakness remain \u2014 namely historically low levels of participation in the work force and very sluggish wage gains for most workers \u2014 private economists said on Friday that a September move by the central bank is a real possibility now, especially if job creation in August turns out to be as good as or better than it was in July.\u201cSolid enough to keep the September hike alive,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients shortly after the release of the data.Although the initial increase will be small, short-term interest rates have been near zero since late 2008. The Fed dropped rates to historically low levels during the depths of the financial crisis in a bid to stimulate growth and stave off panic.The Fed controls short-term interest rates, rather than the longer-term benchmarks like 10-year bond yields that help determine rates on mortgages, so ordinary Americans won\u2019t feel much of an impact at first.In fact, consumers could actually benefit from an increase in what\u2019s known as the federal funds target rate as it filters through the financial markets and causes yields on checking accounts and money market deposits to rise, according to Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.But the slow reversal of years of easy credit by the central bank has markets on edge, with traders and investors having grown used to very cheap borrowing costs. \u201cIt comes down to a shift in policy, and this will be a watershed event,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cInvestors are looking beyond the first rate hike to where rates will be two, three or four years down the road.\u201dDespite the overall healthy tone of Friday\u2019s report, areas of weakness remain.Wage growth has been sluggish. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in July, also about what was expected and better than comparable figures in June, when wages were flat.Over the last 12 months, wages have risen at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, not much more than the already-low underlying rate of inflation. The situation helps explain why many workers remain frustrated with what has been a fitful recovery.The proportion of Americans in the work force also did not bounce back in July after declining in recent months. At 62.6 percent, it remains at levels not seen since the late 1970s.The Labor Department\u2019s broadest measure of unemployment, which includes people working in part-time positions because they can\u2019t find full-time jobs, declined 0.1 percentage point to 10.4 percent.The mining and logging sector lost 4,000 jobs, a sign of the pain in the oil patch as energy companies cut drilling and other exploration efforts. The public sector added 5,000 jobs, while private employers increased payrolls by 210,000.The strongest areas for hiring included health care, retailing and professional and business services. Manufacturers added 15,000 jobs in July, the biggest monthly increase for the sector since late 2014.After years of slow gains, healthy consumer demand is finally persuading management at some factories to take the plunge and build up their work forces.In Morganton, N.C., Ekornes, a furniture maker, plans to hire 10 more workers by the end of 2015, bringing employment at its factory to about 50, said Peter Bjerregaard, president of North American operations for Ekornes.Like many manufacturing jobs, the new positions at the Ekornes factory pay a bit more than comparable jobs at nearby stores or restaurants. Workers earn $15 to $25 an hour and receive a generous benefits package.Based in Norway, Ekornes opened the North Carolina plant in 2013 to make high-end Stressless brand recliners and sofas, and sales have been surging because of the strong housing sector. \u201cFurniture gets hit first, and we are the last ones to get out,\u201d Mr. Bjerregaard said.Although more positive in recent days, economic data over the last few months has been uneven, with better numbers for trade and factory orders, but a lackluster overall growth rate recorded in the spring.These crosscurrents made the report on the labor market eagerly anticipated by traders and investors on Wall Street.Over all, the tone was slightly better than expected.The Labor Department also revised upward the number of jobs added in May and June by a total of 14,000, bringing the average monthly gain over the last three months to 235,000.The average workweek also grew slightly, another sign of economic momentum after a slow start to the year.\u201cThis is very supportive of a September rate hike by the Fed,\u201d said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cAt this stage, the Federal Reserve is looking for confirmation. They don\u2019t need to see additional strength, and this report pushes them one step closer.\u201dThe snapshot provided monthly by the Labor Department is of course prone to revision, and even the economists who track it closely each month warn that a difference of 50,000 or so jobs has only limited statistical significance in an economy where gross domestic product stands at roughly $17 trillion.Summer reports can be especially prone to seasonal variations caused by students entering the work force as well as temporary shutdowns of auto plants as carmakers retool, said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services.But Mr. Faucher said he was pleased with the data for July.\u201cIt\u2019s solid across the board with no red flags,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a nice gain in manufacturing, which is always good news, and financial services were also strong, and these tend to be well-paying jobs. The data is just consistent with broad-based economic growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Question for the Republican Presidential Debate", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe gasoline tax is currently 18.4 cents a gallon, and was last hiked by Bill Clinton in 1993, after a raise by George Bush in 1990. Average gasoline prices have fallen roughly a dollar a gallon in the last year, so a 5-cent increase would hardly be noticed. No matter, the Senate last week passed a six-year transportation bill, but funded it for only three years. And because Senate Republicans refused to pay for any of it with a gas tax, they raise the funds instead, in part, by selling oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is our insurance against another oil crisis. I\u2019m not making this up.House Republicans have yet to weigh in. Perhaps they\u2019ll propose paying for it by selling gold from Fort Knox or paintings from the National Gallery.Why is this such a key question? Because it cuts to the core of what is undermining the Republican Party today and, indirectly, our country: There is no longer a Republican center-right that would have no problem raising the gas tax for something as fundamental as infrastructure. Sure, there are center-right candidates \u2014 like Jeb Bush and John Kasich. But can they run, win and govern from the center-right when the base of their party and so many of its billionaire donors reflect the angry anti-science, anti-tax, anti-government, anti-minorities, anti-gay rights and anti-immigration views of the Tea Party and its media enforcer, Fox News?America has more natural advantages to thrive in the 21st century than any other country on the planet. But we prosper only by making the right investments and adaptations to maximize our strengths. That can happen only if there is a center-right party offering creative, market-based solutions to meet these opportunities and challenges \u2014 ready to compromise with a center-left party offering more government-oriented approaches. Bernie Sanders notwithstanding, the Democratic Party is still dominated by its center-left \u2014 Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In today\u2019s G.O.P., the far-right base is setting the agenda.What does it mean to be a center-right Republican? It means starting each day by asking, What world am I living in and how do I best align the country to thrive in that world? Offering market-based responses to science- and fact-based problems and opportunities. Being ready to compromise to get fundamentals like a transportation bill passed and making a distinction between an \u201cexpenditure\u201d and an \u201cinvestment.\u201d There is a big difference between funding energy research, bioscience or a new university \u2014 and some pork-barrel project.Making cuts across the board, like the sequester, is stupid.Taylor argues that \u201cthe risks imposed by climate change are real, and a policy of ignoring those risks and hoping for the best is inconsistent with risk-management practices conservatives embrace in other, non-climate contexts. Conservatives should embrace a carbon tax (a much less costly means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions) in return for elimination of E.P.A. regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions, abolition of green energy subsidies and regulatory mandates, and offsetting tax cuts to provide for revenue neutrality.\u201dThe center-left wouldn\u2019t agree with all of his trade-offs, but if that were the G.O.P. position \u2014 climate change is real and here\u2019s our market solution \u2014 I guarantee you we\u2019d have had a serious compromise national climate policy by now. We\u2019re paying a huge price for the way the Tea Party has marginalized the center-right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Stock Market Swings", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBy the close of the stock market on Friday, the recent ups and downs in share prices had worked out to a mild correction. In all, the market was down 6.6 percent from its all-time high in May.Yet it\u2019s hard to escape a vague sense of unease. The swoon that began a week before last was quickly attributed, at least in part, to China\u2019s economic problems. Just as quickly, many investors and policy makers concluded that China\u2019s leaders would manage those problems in ways that would allow the global economy to chug along. But what if they don\u2019t? A prolonged slowdown is more likely to provoke social unrest in China than in other developed economies, because stability there has been based on high growth rather than political and other institutional arrangements. The prospect of social unrest, in turn, raises economic and national-security concerns not raised by economic crises elsewhere.Closer to home, market volatility has significantly reduced the odds that the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates at its next meeting in mid-September. A delay is nothing to lament, because the still significant slack in the labor market would make an increase this year premature. The Fed has generally played down the potential impact of China and other international headwinds, while asserting that the negative effects of low oil prices and a strong dollar were likely to be temporary. But these forces are proving potent and long lasting \u2014 further reason to give the Fed pause.Renewed stock market downdrafts could disrupt the economy, and the Fed\u2019s plans, in other ways. The recovery in housing is an important gauge of economic health. But this year, the big increases in sales and prices have come at the high end of the market, where investment wealth is assumed to be more of a factor in the decision to buy than wages and salary. The very real possibility is that if the stock market falters again, so too will the housing market.It all works out to an economy growing at 2.5 percent. At that modest pace, the United States cannot be of much help if other economies falter. But it can rebound from a market swoon, at least for now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Turned to Risky Devaluation as Export Machine Stalled", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When Prime Minister Li Keqiang convened the Chinese cabinet last month, the troubled economy was the main topic on the agenda.The stock market had stumbled after a yearlong boom. Money was flooding out of the country. Most ominously, China\u2019s export machine had stalled, prompting labor strikes.In a little-noted advisory to government agencies, the cabinet said it was essential to fix the export problem, and the currency had to be part of the solution.With the government keeping a tight grip on the value of the renminbi, Chinese goods were more expensive than rivals\u2019 products overseas. The currencies of other emerging markets had fallen, and China\u2019s exporters could not easily compete.Soon after, the Communist Party leaders issued a statement also urging action on exports.It all set the stage for the currency devaluation last week that resulted in the biggest drop in the renminbi since 1994.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.The cabinet\u2019s call to action: The country needed to give the currency more flexibility and to reinvigorate exports. If officials did not act, China risked deeper turmoil at home, threatening the stability of the government.But the sharp focus on the domestic agenda also complicates China\u2019s global ambitions. By devaluing the currency, the authorities, who have been pushing a big expansion of global investments, are eroding some of the country\u2019s buying power overseas.China appears willing to make those trade-offs. Manufacturing, the core engine of growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is just too critical. And the pressures have been mounting, with exports last month plunging 8 percent compared with 2014.The weakness is creating problems elsewhere in an economy already rattled by a real estate slump. Across the country, millions of workers and thousands of companies are feeling the pain, as sales slip and incomes drop.Zhang Wei, a carpenter at a construction materials market in Guangzhou, says customers\u2019 orders are plunging. Hu Sheng, a seller of metal siding, had to cut prices to the bone, and even then his sales dropped by a third.At a covered market in Guangzhou, Zhang Xiaojun sat dejectedly behind a counter where half a dozen gutted, plucked chicken carcasses lay. \u201cI was selling 30 to 40 chickens a day last year,\u201d he said. \u201cNow at best I sell only 10 chickens in a day, and I can\u2019t make a living.\u201dAfter the top-level meetings in July, officials moved quickly. On Aug. 11, the central bank announced a new policy for determining the value of the renminbi, saying it would allow market forces to play a greater role.Although the central bank denied the decision was motivated by the export issue, officials were assured a quick, economic benefit. Once market forces were unleashed, they resulted in the sharp and swift decline of the currency, which dropped by 4.4 percent last week.But the devaluation creates uncertainty, potentially undermining confidence in what had been the world\u2019s steadiest and most enduring economy. It will also test President Xi Jinping and the leadership, as they try to balance their domestic needs and global expansion. A deteriorating economy could force them to pick between the two agendas.\u201cFor Xi Jinping, domestic stability is the top priority,\u201d said Willy Lam, a specialist in Beijing politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a higher priority than China\u2019s international responsibilities.\u201dThe biggest casualties of the economic woes are the workers.Zhou Ping, 23, moved from central China to Guangzhou in Guangdong Province three years ago and got hired cutting fabric at a garment factory. He lost his job three months ago and has been unable to find any work.\u201cCompetition is too intense; there are so many people fighting for each job,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I have no plans to return to my home province just yet. My friend is letting me take turns in his bunk bed.\u201dWhile China lacks reliable unemployment statistics, the labor market is under significant pressure. Pay is barely climbing faster than consumer prices. Millions of Chinese are looking for work.It is a sensitive issue. The leadership has indicated that slower economic growth is acceptable, provided the labor market remains strong. Any instability could prompt an internal debate about whether the government can manage a slowdown and still meet its global goals.If President Xi cannot deliver rising living standards, \u201cthat will undermine the long-term sustainability of the regime,\u201d said Li Daokui, an economist at Tsinghua University in Beijing.When Deng Xiaoping began opening the country\u2019s economy to capitalism and foreign investment in 1979, he started in a series of duck-farming villages in southeastern China\u2019s Guangdong Province, next to Hong Kong. His successors subsequently built on the plan, turning the experiment into the world\u2019s biggest hub of light industry manufacturing, producing items like microwave ovens and laptop computers.The area is a crucial backbone of China\u2019s economic story. Guangdong\u2019s main cities \u2014 Shenzhen, Dongguan and Guangzhou \u2014 developed into a vast urban sprawl, each with a population the size of Los Angeles.As exports surged, the country produced double-digit growth for decades. The newfound wealth prompted China to find opportunities overseas, which helped expand its international influence and support its domestic needs.But the export business is now suffering.Sales have slumped for furniture makers, for example, as demand overseas has flagged, particularly in Europe. Chinese families are also buying less, as sagging home sales and real estate prices mean fewer people need to decorate new apartments.\u201cMany furniture factories in the Guangzhou area have closed over the past year,\u201d said Rachel Wang, the sales manager at Hongyuan Furniture Manufacturing, a Guangzhou maker of home saunas. Hongyuan Furniture has helped offset a slowdown in Europe by expanding to Australia.Charles M. Hubbs, the owner of Premier Guard, which makes medical equipment in Guangdong Province, said the devaluation would help, estimating the currency drop would add $300,000 a year in profit. But it\u2019s not enough, he said, to make the company more competitive.Despite the problems in the job market, monthly factory wages, which have increased tenfold at Premier Guard over the last decade, remain high and eat into profit. Mr. Hubbs is considering moving part of his manufacturing operation to Texas, as a way to reduce freight costs and to avoid American import taxes.Even if the currency drops by 8 to 9 percent, it is \u201cnot going to bring any business back to China,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to come back to China,\u201d for fear the renminbi might strengthen later.As sales fall and factories close, strikes and other labor actions have been increasing, to nearly 200 a month, according to the China Labor Bulletin, a nonprofit group based in Hong Kong that calls for collective bargaining rights. Four years ago, it was around a dozen a month.At the Zhanheng Toys Electronics Company in Dongguan, 700 workers raucously demonstrated on Aug. 4, demanding back wages. Management had suddenly left and stopped paying workers.Such disappearances are common in China. If they stick around, managers of failed companies may be detained by the police, who search for signs of embezzlement and try to force executives to dig into their savings to pay creditors.\u201cThe Hong Kong boss ran away,\u201d said a security guard at Zhanheng\u2019s front gate on Thursday afternoon who declined to give his name. No managers were left to answer questions, the guard added. The local government ended up paying the back wages a day later. It is a routine practice after business failures in China, where local governments are responsible for maintaining social stability.Wu Yukan, a plastics distributor who is also the vice chairman of the local chamber of commerce, came to the factory gate in a black Audi with two aides.\u201cThis factory owes me hundreds of thousands of renminbi for raw materials,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy is not doing well. I have other clients who also owe me a lot of money, and from whom I have not been able to collect as well.\u201dOver a thousand miles away from the turmoil in Guangdong, at a monolithic building in Beijing, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, has the task of guiding the currency at a complicated time, at home and abroad.These charts show the relative currency strength of East Asia\u2019s three largest economies over the last 15 years.Tall, cerebral and urbane, he has written a series of books and long academic articles in Chinese on economics. He taught himself English. He has been steeped in Communist Party politics from childhood. His father, a deputy minister in the early 1960s, mentored a young Jiang Zemin, who later served as China\u2019s leader for a decade.Mr. Zhou needs those economic and political strengths, as the country tries to rev up exports and keep its international expansion on track.While he needs to let the renminbi respond to the market, he must also maintain control over the currency. Mr. Zhou also wants to convince the world that the renminbi deserves a place among the elite group of global reserve currencies, which includes the dollar, euro, yen and pound.In March, Mr. Zhou welcomed Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to a conference in Beijing. He told Ms. Lagarde and top global bankers that he would dismantle the many currency restrictions.\u201cA set of pilot policies and regulations will be released this year, to basically achieve the requirements for a currency that can be used more easily,\u201d he said.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.Mr. Zhou was making the case that China could meet the I.M.F. requirements for joining the basket of global reserve currencies known as the special drawing rights. The biggest test was whether the renminbi was considered \u201cfreely usable.\u201dFor years, China set an initial price for the renminbi in dollars each morning and then allowed the currency to trade in a narrow band. The initial price was somewhat arbitrary. A week before the devaluation, an I.M.F. report expressed concerns, suggesting a more market-oriented approach.Starting last Tuesday, the central bank said it would give the market more sway, basing the initial level on the previous closing price. The I.M.F. gave its cautious approval, saying it \u201cappears a welcome step.\u201d But the execution, the fund said, would be critical.Mr. Zhou faces a delicate task.He used to be able to set monetary policy without worrying that money would rush out of the country if interest rates were too low or the currency too high. With the loosening of controls on moving large sums of money, he must now navigate the pressures of the market.He also has to appease many constituencies.The commerce ministry has long lobbied for a weak renminbi to help the country\u2019s exporters. But Mr. Zhou can\u2019t let the currency drop too much, lest he antagonize the Chinese companies investing abroad and the Chinese families sending students overseas.\u201cYou see it as more than 100 million Chinese travel abroad, and there are more than 800,000 Chinese students studying overseas,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a former member of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. \u201cThey want a strong renminbi.\u201dErica Law, a 27-year-old Chinese investment banker, sat in a Starbucks in Guangzhou on Thursday, talking about her plans to buy an apartment in Europe.As a student, Ms. Law studied and traveled in Europe. She has since returned on vacations, maintaining a love affair with a continent that, with its clean air and well-preserved historic monuments, still seems so different from China.The exchange rate now factors into her plans.\u201cThe recent days of renminbi devaluation are not of that much concern,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, if the devaluation trend continues and reaches for example 10 to 20 percent, then it will really affect my travel and investment decisions \u2014 perhaps at that time, I will consider more vacation and investing options closer to home.\u201dMichael Forsythe contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Michael Schuman from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Alaska Visit Puts Climate, Not Energy, in Forefront", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile the Arctic is a fitting backdrop for the president\u2019s call to action, it is also a place where the conflicting threads of his environmental policy collide, and where the bracing public debate over how to address the warming of the planet is particularly animated.\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent on the one hand for President Obama to lead the world toward comprehensive action on climate change, while on the other allowing companies to pursue difficult, expensive oil in dangerous and remote places,\u201d said Michael LeVine, Pacific senior counsel for Oceana, an environmental group.The challenge is highlighted in Alaska, where many citizens are grappling with the devastating effects of climate change even as they depend on energy development for their livelihoods. In becoming the first sitting American president to visit Arctic Alaska, Mr. Obama is confronting those conflicting pressures.In his weekly radio address on Saturday, the president acknowledged, as he had in the past, that although he was pushing to transition the nation \u201caway from dirty energy sources that threaten our health and our environment,\u201d the economy was still reliant on oil and gas.At issue this time is a long-delayed application by Royal Dutch Shell, to which the Obama administration gave final approval two weeks ago, to begin drilling for oil and gas in untouched waters of the Chukchi Sea off Alaska\u2019s northwest coast. The president does not plan to interact with Shell during his trip, White House officials said, but he will travel to the town of Kotzebue above the Arctic Circle, where the company has set up some of its equipment.Kotzebue and many of its neighbors \u2014 Inuit villages that are being overtaken by the sea because of soil erosion, brought on by melting permafrost and stronger storms that come with higher temperatures \u2014 are potent real-time examples of what Mr. Obama has called a climate wake-up call.At a State Department climate conference in Anchorage on Monday, Mr. Obama will call for sweeping collective action on climate change, pushing for commitments designed to propel a global accord in December at a United Nations summit meeting in Paris. Then he plans to hopscotch the state bearing witness to the effects of rising temperatures, hiking Exit Glacier in Seward on Tuesday and meeting Wednesday with salmon fishermen in Dillingham, on pristine Bristol Bay, before journeying to Kotzebue.\u201cThis is an issue that is very here and now,\u201d said Brian Deese, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser on climate policy. \u201cThe issue of climate change is not an issue of the future tense in Alaska. It is affecting people in their lives and livelihoods in real ways.\u201dDouglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and the author of \u201cThe Quiet World,\u201d which documents conservation efforts in Alaska, said Mr. Obama had spoken privately of how difficult it was to get the climate change story across to the news media, particularly given that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t want to feel that they\u2019re doing something wrong driving the S.U.V. to pick up their kids at school.\u201d\u201cGoing up to glacier country is the most visceral way to do that, and it\u2019s really a culmination of President Obama going from being the climate change educator of America to trying to be seen now as a climate activist,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said.Still, in traveling to the Arctic \u2014 a region that has warmed twice as quickly as the rest of the world over the past six decades, with its northernmost reaches losing more than a football field a day of land because of coastal erosion and rising seas \u2014 Mr. Obama will also be implicitly making the case against the drilling he has authorized.\u201cThe glaring, inconvenient truth is that when you step onto ground zero and visit communities where they\u2019re falling into the sea because of rapidly melting ice, you are witnessing the dramatic impacts of continuing down this path of fossil fuel development,\u201d said Franz A. Matzner, director of the Beyond Oil Initiative at the Natural Resources Defense Council.Conservationists, native leaders and climate activists are holding a rally against Arctic drilling in Anchorage on Monday to coincide with Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival.At the same time, some Alaskans are asking for just the opposite. Last week, the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which represents the business interests of the Arctic Slope Inupiat tribe, released a television advertisement calling on Mr. Obama to \u201cstand with Alaskans and continue to support Arctic energy development.\u201dThe timing of the Shell decision was particularly awkward for the White House, coming so soon before Mr. Obama embarks on his Arctic sojourn. Advisers have argued that the president had no legal option but to process the permit based on leases sold to Shell for $2.1 billion by President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. More broadly, the administration argues that drilling off the Alaska coast is simply a matter of bowing to the reality that the country remains dependent on fossil fuels, and working to ensure that the work is done domestically and under stringent safety rules.\u201cWe might wish for an instantaneous transformation that was drastically less reliant on oil and gas and coal, or at least that used technologies for oil and gas and coal that reduced greatly the emissions associated with that, but we don\u2019t live in a magical world,\u201d said John P. Holdren, senior adviser to Mr. Obama on science and technology. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be using oil and gas, it\u2019s better to produce it here than somewhere else. We have by far the strongest environmental and safety oversight of any country.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name Mr. Matzner\u2019s environmental advocacy group.

Jails are filling, once again, with Kurdish activists and officials accused of supporting terrorism. Residents say they are stocking up on weapons, just in case.In the mountains, Kurdish guerrillas hastily set up vehicle checkpoints and then dissolve into the rugged terrain in a game of cat and mouse with Turkish soldiers. In the countryside, burned and mangled vehicles blight a landscape blackened by forest fires set by the Turkish Army \u2014 a tactic that destroys militant hide-outs but also apple and cherry orchards and stocks of feed for villagers\u2019 cows and goats.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like this,\u201d said Kudbettin Ersoy, 66, who sells watermelons here from a wooden cart. \u201cI was hopeful that peace would come and the blood would stop flowing. We are all citizens of this country.\u201dJune\u2019s vote gave no party a majority, and a deadline for coalition talks ended fruitlessly on Sunday, paving the way for a snap election in November.The war against the P.K.K. has also underscored the continued divide between the West and Turkey over how to handle the Middle East\u2019s raging wars.But since then, Turkey has carried out roughly 400 airstrikes against P.K.K. targets in the mountains of northern Iraq, where the group has bases, and inside Turkey, compared with three against the Islamic State. The imbalance has deepened a sense in the West that Turkey\u2019s priority is restraining Kurdish ambitions of autonomy that had gained momentum amid the region\u2019s turmoil, rather than fighting the Islamic State.The resumed war\u2019s toll so far can be measured in lives lost: more than 65 Turkish soldiers and police officers, and more than 800 people the government has identified as militants, according to the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency. The war is also being measured in the return of fear and old anxieties over a conflict that, through decades, claimed close to 40,000 lives.\u201cWhen the president couldn\u2019t make the government himself, he targeted the Kurds, and restarted this war,\u201d said Osman, who was sitting at a teahouse here one recent morning and gave only his first name because he was fearful of speaking openly against Mr. Erdogan.\u201cPeople working for the party are detained every day,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people are trying to protect their neighborhoods.\u201dThe forest fires near Lice, a P.K.K. stronghold outside of Diyarbakir, are a menacing reminder of the tactics the Turkish Army used in the 1990s, the conflict\u2019s cruelest decade.\u201cIt is to intimidate the local people, to say that we can go back to the 1990s,\u201d Mr. Tastan said.\u201cWe feel Erdogan personally restarted the war because of the elections,\u201d said Yesim Alici, an H.D.P. official in Lice. On the other side of the conflict, there are also signs of rising anger toward Mr. Erdogan and the government officials who have been attending, with great publicity, the funerals of Turkish soldiers killed by the P.K.K.A Turkish military officer whose brother was killed in a Kurdish attack lashed out Sunday during the funeral, in a video that was widely circulated on social media in Turkey.\u201cWho killed him? Who is the reason for this?\u201d Lt. Col. Mehmet Alkan shouted as he pushed through the crowd toward his brother\u2019s coffin.While the United States has long sought Turkey\u2019s help in fighting ISIS, getting its help has revealed a tangle of diverging interests in the region.\u201cIt\u2019s those who said there would be a solution, who now only talk of war,\u201d he said, in a statement many took to be a reference to Mr. Erdogan and his previous efforts, now abandoned, for peace.This is highlighted by the daily arrival of dead bodies of Kurdish fighters at the main cemetery here. They come from three battlefields: Iraq, Syria and Turkey. There are three teams of gravediggers working day and night, and cemetery workers have stocked up on wood for coffins and cloth for wrapping corpses.\u201cWhat the Kurds are doing in northern Iraq and in Syria against ISIS is not just for the Kurds, it\u2019s for all of humanity,\u201d said Mehmet Celik Kilic, who runs the cemetery.On a recent afternoon, a woman who gave only her first name of Pakize was visiting the grave of her son, a P.K.K. fighter who died in northern Iraq three years ago, during the last outburst of conflict.\u201cGod, this is enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThe soldiers, the guerrillas, they are all our sons.\u201dAcross the region, even as war has resumed, hopes for peace remain.In the mountains outside the city of Tunceli \u2014 called Dersim by the locals, and the site of a massacre against the Kurds carried out by the Turkish state in the 1930s \u2014 villagers who had been expelled from their homes in the 1990s had only in recent years begun rebuilding their lives. Many took out cheap loans to build houses or invest in beehives to harvest honey, taking part in the expansion of consumer credit and the booming economy that Turkey enjoyed over the last decade.On a recent morning, two women, sitting in the shade of an almond tree, said they already lost everything once, in the 1990s.\u201cOur house,\u201d said one of the women, Zarife Tasbas, who said she was about 60. \u201cOur animals.

{"Headline": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Slog: The Tortoise and the Hair", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn politics, the smallest things often turn out to be the most telling ones, and so it is with the man who was supposed to be the Republican front-runner, who once inspired such rapture among party elders and whose entrance into the presidential race they yearned and clamored for.They not only got their wish, they got it with punctuation: Jeb! That\u2019s Jeb Bush\u2019s logo, and the exclamation point is the tell. None of the other Republican presidential candidates has anything like it. None of the Democrats either. It\u2019s a declaration of passion that only someone worried about a deficit of it would issue. Methinks thou doth exclaim too much.Before Bush announced his candidacy, talk of his vulnerabilities focused largely on certain positions \u2014 his defense of Common Core educational standards, his advocacy for immigration reform \u2014 that were anathema to many voters in the Republican primaries. He was sure to catch flak.And Donald Trump\u2019s a demented peacock and I\u2019m a crotchety hippo. Reverse anthropomorphism is a fun game, but if you\u2019re playing it in the service of selling yourself, best not to summon a sluggish creature with a muted affect and an impenetrable shell.Republicans should have seen this turtle coming. In some sense they did. Bush\u2019s fans and backers praised him as a thoughtful \u201cpolicy wonk\u201d and conceded that he wasn\u2019t any dynamo at the lectern or on the trail.Sure, he speaks Spanish and has a Mexican-born wife, but Marco Rubio also speaks Spanish and has two Cuban-born parents. Sure, he was twice elected governor of a state that\u2019s not reliably red, but so were Scott Walker, Chris Christie and John Kasich.He\u2019s not the most eloquent or the most inspiring, so his backers began to pitch him as the most adult. But at that first debate, Kasich stole even that superlative from him.Oomph is what that big speech last week \u2014 in which he blamed Hillary Clinton for the rise of the Islamic State \u2014 was largely about. He was flexing his audacity and independence, showing that his surname wouldn\u2019t cow him from going after a Democratic rival on any matter, including Iraq. It took gall to edit his older brother out of the diatribe. It took guts to go with a diatribe in the first place.He runs afoul of the moment. Voters right now are more enamored of outsiders than usual, as the traction of not just Trump but also two other Republican candidates who have never held elective office \u2014 Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina \u2014 demonstrates.Voters have had enough of protocol and pieties. Thus Trump thrives in a party that he constantly browbeats and shows no real loyalty toward, while Bernie Sanders flourishes among Democrats though he has repeatedly railed against them and doesn\u2019t technically identify as one.For some alienated voters, supporting either of these two insurgents is the same as raising a middle finger to establishment politicians and to politics as usual, and tactful, tasteful Bush can never be a middle finger. More like a pinkie.It\u2019s a plausible scenario. But it\u2019s hardly a joyful one. And there\u2019s only one way to punctuate it \u2014 with a question mark.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Who Got China Right", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 2009, Jim Chanos began to ask questions about the Chinese economy. What sparked his curiosity was the realization that commodity producers had been largely unaffected by the financial crisis; indeed, they had recorded big profits even as other sectors found themselves reeling in the aftermath of the crisis.When he looked into why, he discovered that the critical factor was China\u2019s voracious appetite for commodities: The Chinese, who had largely sidestepped the financial crisis themselves, were buying 40 percent of all copper exports; 50 percent of the available iron ore; and eye-popping quantities of just about everything else. That insight soon led Chanos to make an audacious call: China was in the midst of an unsustainable credit bubble.Perhaps you remember Jim Chanos. The founder of Kynikos Associates, a $3 billion hedge fund that specializes in short-selling, Chanos was the first person to figure out, some 15 years ago, that Enron was a house of cards.Chanos and his crew at Kynikos don\u2019t make big \u201cmacro\u201d bets on economies; their style is more \u201cmicro\u201d: looking at the fundamentals of individual companies or sectors. And so it was with China. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day in 2009 when my real estate guy was giving me a presentation and he said that China had 5.6 billion square meters of real estate under development, half residential and half commercial,\u201d Chanos told me the other day.\u201cI said, \u2018You must mean 5.6 billion square feet.\u2019 \u201dThe man replied that he hadn\u2019t misspoken; it really was 5.6 billion square meters, which amounted to over 60 billion square feet.He also pointed out that much of the construction was for high-end condos that cost over $100,000, yet the average Chinese household made less than $10,000 a year.Can you guess how the financial establishment, convinced that the Chinese juggernaut was unstoppable, reacted to Chanos\u2019s contrarian thesis? It scoffed.The conventional view was that the Chinese economy would continue to grow at a rapid pace, and that Chinese officials, unencumbered by the messiness of democracy, could make quick adjustments if the economy started to slip.Chanos was undeterred. \u201cIt reminded me of 1989, when everybody said that we should emulate the Japanese model,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey used to say, \u2018They can get stuff done and we can\u2019t\u2019 \u201d \u2014 just as the supposed experts were now saying about China.As it turns out, China\u2019s economy began to slow right around the time Chanos first made his call. No matter: Most China experts remained bullish. Chanos, meanwhile, was shorting the stocks of a number of companies that depended on the Chinese market. And he was regularly sending out emails when he came upon articles that seemed to confirm his thesis: stories about newly constructed ghost cities and troubled banks and debt-laden state-owned enterprises.The moral of today\u2019s story is a simple one. Listen to the skeptics and the contrarians. You dismiss them at your peril.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexis Tsipras, Greek Prime Minister, Calls for New Elections", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Tsipras said in a nationally televised address that he would submit his resignation to Greece\u2019s president, clearing the way for a vote on whether he and his leftist Syriza party should be returned to power with a new mandate. Officials said he would seek to schedule the vote for Sept. 20.\u201cNow it will be to the people to decide,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said. \u201cI feel the deep moral, political obligation to submit to your judgment. Your vote will determine if we represented you courageously in talks with the creditors, if this agreement is enough for us to emerge from the crisis.\u201dFor weeks, Mr. Tsipras has been weighing new elections, amid a deep split among factions in Syriza over his embrace of the bailout plan. Elected in January, Mr. Tsipras took office as an anti-austerity renegade, pledging to win a better debt deal for Greece. Yet after several tumultuous months, the prime minister reversed course and agreed to a new bailout program with the country\u2019s creditors: the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the other members of the eurozone.The deal infuriated Syriza\u2019s far-left factions and managed to pass through Parliament only with the help of opposition parties. Defections from Mr. Tsipras\u2019s coalition had raised the possibility that he would not have the necessary support to prevail in a potential parliamentary test of confidence in his leadership \u2014 a possibility he avoided by calling for new elections.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.He now seems to be positioning himself as more of a centrist but still populist leader, intent on carrying out the terms of the bailout in a way that minimizes the harm to those at the lower end of the economic scale while battling entrenched interests.Some analysts had thought Mr. Tsipras might postpone snap elections until October, after the country faces the first review of its progress in meeting the terms of the bailout. Under the deal, Greece on Thursday received billions of euros in new aid from other eurozone countries, which the government used to repay existing debt, including a payment on government bonds held by the European Central Bank.The payment to the central bank was made on Thursday, the day it was due. Failure to pay would have put Greece into default and provoked another crisis.Critics say that the new bailout deal is merely a continuation of an austerity program that has driven the Greek economy to record levels of unemployment and a drastic downturn in economic output. Most of the new money allows Greece to meet obligations on existing debt but does little to rebuild the shattered national economy.Earlier, Greece missed debt payments to the International Monetary Fund before Mr. Tsipras struck the new bailout deal, raising the prospect that it might leave the eurozone. It has since paid the money with the help of a temporary loan from other eurozone countries.Less clear is whether Mr. Tsipras\u2019s call for snap elections might further destabilize the Greek economy in the short term. Depositors have withdrawn about \u20ac40 billion from Greek banks since December, and officials had hoped the bailout deal, which includes money to recapitalize the banks, would serve as an assurance that the public could return money. Yields on Greek government bonds rose on Thursday, an indication that investors see more economic risk as the country heads into elections.Politically, the most organized opposition within Syriza comes from Left Platform, a radical faction accounting for about a quarter of the party\u2019s members of Parliament. The leader is the former energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, who argues that Syriza was not elected to impose further austerity, and is calling for Greece to abandon the euro and return to its old currency, the drachma.Several other Syriza lawmakers, including the Parliament speaker, Zoe Konstantopoulou, also object to the terms of the new bailout, which include strict spending limits, new tax increases and a rise in the retirement age, while also opening various parts of the Greek economy to greater competition.In comments to reporters outside Parliament shortly before Mr. Tsipras\u2019s address, the former minister and Left Platform member Dimitris Stratoulis hinted at the formation of a new breakaway party. \u201cThe \u2018no\u2019 of the people to austerity will find political expression in these elections,\u201d he said, referring to last month\u2019s referendum result. \u201cThe forces of \u2018no\u2019 inside and outside Syriza will be united.\u201dMr. Tsipras is betting that Greek voters, weary of instability, will support him in a new vote and enable him to form a new government absent hard-line leftist dissenters. Despite his reversal on the bailout plan, Mr. Tsipras has remained highly popular, with the most recent polls in late July showing no other leader in a strong position to challenge him at this stage.Some analysts wondered if Mr. Tsipras would try to form a new coalition with opposition parties in Parliament, including some that he has depicted as part of Greece\u2019s corrupt establishment. But with the new election, Mr. Tsipras can try to win a clear endorsement, even if he may still be forced to build a new coalition.In calling for a new vote, Mr. Tsipras will again be testing his connection to ordinary Greeks. In early July, after months of tough negotiations with lenders, the prime minister unexpectedly called a referendum on the lenders\u2019 austerity proposals and asked voters to reject them with a \u201cno\u201d vote.While he got his \u201cno\u201d vote, Mr. Tsipras did not win better terms from creditors and days later was forced to backtrack and agree on the new, tough bailout deal.Early on Thursday, as rumors began to circulate that Mr. Tsipras would call for early elections, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, speaking in Parliament, said elections would not lead to political instability and called on Greeks to return their savings to banks.\u201cNow there is an agreement, there is a course ahead,\u201d he said, referring to the latest bailout, which formally took effect on Thursday after approval on Wednesday by the German Parliament and European officials in Brussels.The energy minister, Panos Skourletis, said on state television earlier in the day that elections were needed to deal with the split in Syriza. \u201cThe political landscape must be cleared up. We need to know whether the government has or doesn\u2019t have a majority.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surnames of the Greek prime minister and president. The prime minister is Alexis Tsipras, not Tspiras, and the president is Prokopis Pavlopoulos, not Pavlopoulios.Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens, and Jim Yardley from Rome.

{"Headline": "China Woes Send Stocks Into Tailspin", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets around the world plummeted on Thursday, signaling that investors have not gotten over the shock of China\u2019s devaluation last week and remain nervous about the health of the global economy.The selling began in Asia, punishing Chinese stocks once again. It then moved to Europe, walloping markets in Germany and Italy, and ended with a rush for the exits in the United States.\u201cIt was a bad day \u2014 everything came together,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. Mr. Silverblatt noted that the stocks of 76 companies in the S.&P. 500 were down at least 20 percent so far this year, a decline that officially puts them in a bear market. He added that 45 companies were up at least 20 percent.After several years of strong gains, the United States stock markets have struggled to move up this year. And in recent weeks, the worries have piled up.The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 358.04 points, or 2.1 percent, on Thursday to close at 16,990.69. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark favored by investors, declined 43.88 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,035.73, its lowest level in six months. The S.&P. 500 is down just over 1 percent for the year.Investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.07 percent, from 2.13 percent on Wednesday.The biggest source of uneasiness right now appears to be China\u2019s economy. The country surprised the world last week by announcing changes in the way it manages its currency, the renminbi, which led to the currency falling in value against the dollar.Many analysts assumed that the devaluation was in part motivated by a desire to stimulate China\u2019s economy, the second largest in the world. A cheaper renminbi would make Chinese goods cheaper in other currencies, increasing demand for them.But the devaluation stoked suspicions in the markets that the country\u2019s economy might be weaker than its official figures suggested.\u201cThe shock of China\u2019s move to devalue \u2014 you can\u2019t understate that,\u201d said Sharon Stark, chief fixed income strategist at D.A. Davidson. \u201cWhat that has done is put the world on notice that the economic conditions in China may be worse than they are reporting.\u201dInvestors are also fretting over what the Federal Reserve will do next with interest rates. Its loose monetary policy since the financial crisis helped push up stock markets around the world. Now, though, the Fed is contemplating raising interest rates, a move that could happen as early as next month.Minutes from the Fed\u2019s last monetary policy meeting, released this week, showed that central bank officials were wary about global growth. The meeting was held before China\u2019s devaluation. That event and the recent turmoil in the markets could persuade the Fed to delay a rate increase.Still, the mere specter of rising rates has prompted investors to pull money out of many markets around the world. This has particularly weighed on the economies of developing countries. If they weaken further, there would most likely be less demand around the world for the goods and services of United States companies.Caterpillar, whose stock has been hit by such fears, is down nearly 17 percent so far this year, and fell 1.29 percent on Thursday.The price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, took a hit early on Thursday, nearly falling to $40 per barrel but recovering as the day went on. The decline could keep gasoline prices lower, benefiting consumers but also weighing on energy companies in the United States, which have created thousands of jobs in the last few years.Fears unrelated to the global economy also buffeted the market on Thursday. Stocks in large media companies dropped steeply after an analyst at Bernstein released a research note that highlighted, in particular, the challenges to advertising revenue at television companies. Shares in Disney, one of the companies that Bernstein downgraded, skidded 6 percent.Elsewhere, Twitter dropped nearly 6 percent, to close at $26, the price at which it went public in 2013. Financial stocks have fared relatively well so far this year, but they weren\u2019t shielded from Thursday\u2019s sell-off. JPMorgan Chase slid 2.5 percent and Morgan Stanley was down 3.39 percent.Still, some analysts said they did not expect extreme declines in global markets. A Greek default appeared to have been averted for now, and Europe\u2019s central bank is pumping stimulus into the Continent\u2019s economy. China has the financial firepower to avoid an uncontrolled devaluation. Last fall, nervousness about the strength of the global economy roiled markets, but when investors calmed down, markets soared again.And if the United States economy continues to grow at recent rates, the whole world should continue to benefit, some analysts asserted.\u201cIt could all come out in the wash,\u201d said Raymond Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm focused on hedge funds. \u201cThe wheels aren\u2019t coming off the U.S. economy and we\u2019re not going into a recession.\u201d He added that valuations of stocks in the United States were not especially cheap right now, which makes them more likely to drop when investors get jittery.Or as Ms. Stark put it: \u201cWhat we are learning is that the market has a very low tolerance for uncertainty and instability.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Upside of a Downturn in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSilicon Valley had long since shaken off the doldrums of the dot-com bubble, but one of the industry\u2019s most respected venture capital firms was now counseling entrepreneurs to again \u201cbatten down the hatches\u201d \u2014 to cut costs, to focus on profit, to \u201cspend every dollar as if it were your last\u201d because \u201cit is going to be a rough ride.\u201dAs it happened, Sequoia\u2019s dire warnings never quite came to pass; the tech industry\u2019s good times merely paused for the recession.But the presentation has achieved the status of legend among venture capitalists. Tech investors are known for their strutting optimism, but the best of them are keenly aware of the motivating powers of impending doom.Some of the most successful tech investments of all time \u2014 among them Google and Facebook \u2014 came about in Silicon Valley\u2019s lean times. This is a paradox of invention, as well as of investing: Bad times feed good ideas, which in turn lead to good times, which breed complacency, waste and lots of bad business plans.No one in the tech industry knows if the recent stock market turbulence will prompt another opportunity to mourn good times. But some venture capitalists are beginning to plan for a leaner era ahead.That may just be what Silicon Valley needs. Many investors are optimistic about the clarifying possibilities of a downturn.The boom has made Silicon Valley soft: Companies are spending too much, investors are funding too many me-too ideas, and most founders have never had to confront any limits to their overweening ambitions. Venture capitalists won\u2019t quite say they are looking forward to a correction, but some do say that a bust could toughen up the place.And if a downturn in start-up funding is going to come anyway, you might argue that it couldn\u2019t come soon enough: Not just R.I.P. good times, but good riddance, and let the bad times roll.\u201cThe founders who start companies in bad times are the ones who are really driven,\u201d said Roelof Botha, one of Sequoia\u2019s partners. \u201cThey\u2019re not jumping on the bandwagon to get to Silicon Valley just because it\u2019s the fashionable thing to do today.\u201d\u201cMost of the people who were building start-ups in that era, including us at PayPal, had only seen one economic environment in our working lives,\u201d he said.But Michael Moritz, another Sequoia partner who was one of PayPal\u2019s board members, repeatedly counseled caution.\u201cHe was the one board member drilling into our heads, \u2018Guys, you need to work on the runway \u2014 how many months do you have left, and what are you going to do about it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Botha said, recalling Mr. Moritz\u2019s advice.At Mr. Moritz\u2019s prompting, PayPal\u2019s executives decided to take what was then an extraordinary step: They began to charge users a fee to use the payment service. The company also worked hard to keep its costs down.\u201cThat focus was instrumental in PayPal\u2019s survival,\u201d Mr. Botha said. \u201cWe could have been spending money willy-nilly and fallen by the wayside by accident.\u201dOver the last year, as money flowing into Silicon Valley went from a gush to a flood, Mr. Botha, like other venture investors, began advising start-ups to raise funds even if they didn\u2019t need them immediately, to have cash on hand for a potential downturn.The companies that did so will have a leg up, because a downturn offers a few immediate advantage for well-positioned start-ups: It lowers prices and wreaks havoc on more vulnerable competitors. Salaries for software engineers could fall, and they could become easier to recruit. The price of office space could go down. Other less tangible costs \u2014 Bay Area traffic, marketing, employees\u2019 overall cost of living \u2014 could also decline significantly.\u201cFor start-ups, the only thing that is easier during a boom is access to cheap capital,\u201d said Samuel H. Altman, president of the start-up incubator Y Combinator. \u201cEvery other thing is harder. And an environment of less noise and less competition makes it easier for people to do something that they\u2019re really committed to over the long term.\u201dSilicon Valley\u2019s established venture capitalists, too, will see some upside to a downturn. If the hedge funds and other global investors that have recently poured money into tech begin to pull back, competition for investment in the hottest start-ups will cool, allowing V.C.s to buy more of a company for less money.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re ready to declare that we\u2019re now officially in leaner times,\u201d said Scott Kupor, the managing partner of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.Still, Mr. Kupor noted that as a relatively young firm, Andreessen will likely be putting more money into start-ups over the next few years instead of looking to extract money through sales or initial public offerings \u2014 which means that lower prices for start-ups could be good for its portfolio.\u201cAll other things being equal, people would rather an environment where asset prices are lower and where there\u2019s less availability of capital, so if one of our companies breaks out, they have less competition from 10 other start-ups going after them,\u201d Mr. Kupor said.Danielle Morrill, co-founder of Mattermark, a company that collects and analyzes data on private market funding, pointed to another benefit that some start-ups may see in tougher times. They could begin to pitch themselves as money-saving services.Mattermark is a software as a service business \u2014 a firm that charges a subscription fee for access \u2014 and businesses of that type, Ms. Morrill said, can say that they are saving customers money over the competition.\u201cPeople are going to start talking about which companies are countercyclical,\u201d meaning they\u2019ll prosper in bad times, Ms. Morrill said. But she noted a problem with making such calls: \u201cYou don\u2019t really know if you\u2019re countercyclical until you go through a cycle like what we may have. And then you\u2019ll find out.\u201dAnd that gets to the biggest question if we do enter a gloomy period for start-ups: whether founders will be up for managing in a more stressful, frugal environment.Ms. Morrill said that the current market conditions \u201ccould totally affect my fund-raising, and there\u2019s only so much you can change in a week or a month about the way you\u2019re running your company.\u201d She added: \u201cI can say we shouldn\u2019t buy this expensive coffee, but that\u2019s $100. The scarier thoughts are, when will we have to lay off some of our staff? You look at yourself in the mirror and you say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be that C.E.O.\u2019\u201dIn good times, in other words, it\u2019s relatively easy to be a great start-up chief executive.

{"Headline": "Eurozone\u2019s Economic Growth Falls Short, Even as Greeks Shopped", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Eurozone economic growth disappointed on Friday, but don\u2019t blame Greece.Despite all the political haggling and hand-wringing over Greece\u2019s debt problems, the country\u2019s economic growth in the second quarter was unexpectedly brisk. The country grew more than twice as fast as the eurozone as a whole.The real trouble for the eurozone lurks elsewhere, especially in the big, slow-growth economies of the Continent, like France and Italy.Germany, too, could begin to waver, even though growth in the most recent quarter was solid. The country, which has the eurozone\u2019s largest economy, is heavily dependent on exports. Its industries could start to feel the effects in the coming months of flagging demand from China, an important customer for German machinery and cars.The eurozone economy continues to gain ground as it slowly recovers from the regional recession that followed the global financial crisis of 2008 and the eurozone\u2019s own debt-related problems in the years that followed.As a group, the 19 eurozone countries grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent from April through June, down from 1.5 percent the previous quarter. Greece grew 3.1 percent, from only 0.1 percent at the beginning of the year.But Friday\u2019s data showed that the recovery remained hesitant and that it was far too weak to quickly bring down the eurozone\u2019s unemployment rate of more than 11 percent.Greece, which accounts for a puny percentage of the eurozone\u2019s G.D.P., had little impact on the most recent growth figures. That point might be easy to overlook, considering all the political and financial capital that eurozone leaders have expended to keep Athens afloat.But foreign banks and other nongovernment investors have little remaining risk in Greece, having taken most of their money out of the country and gotten rid of the Greek bonds that they owned.\u201cSome spillover effects from the events in Greece had been observed in the euro area bond and equity markets,\u201d the summary said, paraphrasing a presentation on the economic situation by Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a member of the central bank\u2019s executive board. \u201cBut, over all, contagion to other euro area countries had been limited.\u201dFor European companies like Miele, a German maker of refrigerators, stoves, washing machines and other appliances, Greece has essentially been a nonevent.\u201cThe global economy showed itself to be more robust than expected, in view of political and economic crisis spots like Russia and the Ukraine, the Middle East and Greece,\u201d the company said in a statement on Thursday, as it reported that sales rose 8 percent to 3.5 billion euros, or about $3.9 billion, in the fiscal year that ended June 30.For Miele and many other exporters in the eurozone, any shock waves from Greece and from other trouble spots have been outweighed by positive factors, especially low energy prices and a fall in the value of the euro against the dollar and against other major currencies. A cheaper euro makes products from the eurozone less expensive for customers abroad. It also increases the value of sales in foreign currencies when they are converted into euros.\u201cThe big question is when the Chinese slowdown will start to hit the German economy,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients on Friday.Growth in the French economy was flat compared with the previous quarter. French consumer spending was weaker than expected, economists said, despite a fall in the price of energy. Typically, consumers spend what they have saved from gasoline and other energy costs on other goods, but that stimulus seems to have faded in France.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The lack of any quarterly growth in France suggested that the biggest problem for the eurozone economy was no longer the smaller countries like Greece, Ireland or Portugal, which preoccupied policy makers in recent years. Rather, it is the large, core countries that account for most of the eurozone economy but are unable to muster sustained growth.Growth in Italy during the quarter was also disappointing. And while Spain continued to emerge from economic crisis, unemployment there remained above 22 percent, second in Europe only to Greece\u2019s rate of about 25 percent.Economists fault Italy and France for being too slow to chisel away at the regulations that protect entrenched, politically powerful groups from competition and that impede entrepreneurship.\u201cToday\u2019s G.D.P. data show that the eurozone recovery must not be taken for granted,\u201d Tom Rogers, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in an email. That is particularly true, he added, \u201cin countries where little has been done to improve competitiveness and the climate for job creation.\u201dMuch of Europe\u2019s dynamism is coming from countries in the east. Latvia, a member of the eurozone, had the strongest growth in the European Union, while Poland and the Czech Republic, which are not in the eurozone, also performed well. In the 28 countries of the European Union, first-quarter growth was 1.7 percent on an annual basis.Finland\u2019s economic problems help explain why there is strong popular opposition in that country to more aid for Greece.Greece is expected to fall back into recession this year, as currency controls undercut consumer spending. But there are genuine bright spots in the Greek economy. Tourists have continued to flock to Greece\u2019s beaches despite the political turmoil.The TUI Group, Germany\u2019s largest provider of package tours, said on Thursday that bookings to Greece were up from last year, although it did not give precise figures.Greece\u2019s reduced ability to instill concern in investors is probably good for Europe and for the world, but not necessarily for the Greeks. If leaders of the other 18 countries in the eurozone no longer fear contagion from Greece, they have even less incentive to risk their taxpayers\u2019 money to prop up that country\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Devalues Its Currency as Worries Rise About Economic Slowdown", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As China contends with an economic slowdown and a stock market slump, the authorities on Tuesday sharply devalued the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, a move that could raise geopolitical tensions and weigh on growth elsewhere.The central bank set the official value of the renminbi nearly 2 percent weaker against the dollar. The devaluation is the largest since China\u2019s modern exchange-rate system was introduced at the start of 1994.China\u2019s abrupt devaluation is the clearest sign yet of mounting concern in Beijing that the country could fall short of its goal of roughly 7 percent economic growth this year. Growth is faltering despite heavy pressure on state-owned banks to lend money readily to companies willing to invest in new factories and equipment, and despite a stepped-up tempo of government spending on high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure projects.A steep drop in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in late June and early July, only halted by aggressive government actions, appears to have dented consumer demand within China. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced on Tuesday that nationwide car sales fell 7 percent last month compared with a year ago. Excluding months distorted by the timing of Chinese New Year, it was the steepest drop in sales since December 2008, at the depths of the global financial crisis.China\u2019s devaluation represents a difficult dilemma for the Obama administration. The United States Treasury has tried to use quiet diplomacy in recent years to encourage China to free up its currency policies, while blocking efforts in Congress to punish China for major intervention in currency markets over the past decade to slow the rise of the renminbi. Many in Congress have long accused China of unfairly building up its manufacturing sector at the expense of American jobs by undervaluing the renminbi, and the Chinese devaluation could fan those criticisms.In a seeming nod to such concerns, the central bank said that it would begin to use the market closing, not the previous morning\u2019s official setting, to calculate the renminbi\u2019s official daily fixing against the dollar. But China\u2019s economic weakness now means that further opening up of the currency to market forces could mean a weaker renminbi, not a stronger one. That, in turn, would make Chinese goods even more competitive in the United States and Europe.China\u2019s central bank \u201chas finally thrown in the towel on supporting the renminbi,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University. At the same time, he added, easing its grip on the currency\u2019s value \u201chas blunted criticism by combining the currency devaluation with a more market-determined exchange rate.\u201d The United States and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund have called on China to be more hands-off in managing the renminbi.The Chinese currency has been a global point of contention for nearly a decade. China officially ended the renminbi\u2019s fixed peg to the dollar in 2005. Since then, it has risen in two long, slow climbs. The first was from July 2005 to August 2008, when it was interrupted by the global financial crisis. The renminbi then resumed its rise from June 2010 to early last year, when it dipped slightly, then stabilized.The overall increase since 2005 has been more than 25 percent against the dollar. It has strengthened even more against other major currencies, like the euro and the yen.But the Chinese currency is not freely tradable, and its movements are tightly controlled by the government.Each morning in Shanghai, China\u2019s central bank sets a midpoint for the renminbi\u2019s value against the dollar and other major currencies. This can be as much as 2 percent higher or lower than the previous day\u2019s value, although the change is almost always a tiny fraction of 1 percent.But on Tuesday, the central bank fixed the value of the renminbi at 6.2298 per dollar, down 1.9 percent from Monday\u2019s official fixing. In a statement on its website, the central bank said it was seeking \u201cto perfect\u201d the renminbi\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar.The bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said it was reacting to trends in the market, where traders in recent months had been betting on a weaker renminbi. In trading in mainland China on Tuesday, the renminbi weakened further to close at 6.3231 per dollar, a drop of 1.8 percent from the close on Monday. By the end of the Asian business day, it had fallen even further in offshore trading to around 6.36 renminbi per dollar, a drop of about 2.7 percent, signaling overseas investors expected further weakening.The move also jolted the currencies of countries that depend heavily on China as a market for exports. The Australian dollar fell 1.1 percent against the United States dollar on Tuesday, and the South Korean won declined 1.4 percent.\u201cWhile China\u2019s policy makers have long suggested that foreign exchange reforms would happen, the abrupt nature of today\u2019s announcement has injected considerable volatility into the renminbi and other Asian currencies,\u201d analysts at HSBC wrote Tuesday in a research note.The central bank also said it would seek to prevent what it described as \u201cabnormal\u201d capital flows. Weaker economic growth has prompted sizable outflows from China in recent months, which have most likely been exacerbated by the country\u2019s stock market volatility. A falling renminbi generally increases the risk of more outflows.While China grew at a 7 percent rate in the first half of the year, that was made possible mainly because of a boost from the financial services industry, which benefited from the country\u2019s stock market boom. With the downturn in the nation\u2019s markets over the past two months, growth is slowing more evidently.This is despite an all-out effort by the government to prop up share prices. The measures included extraordinary support from state-run banks, which in July made new loans worth 1.5 trillion renminbi, or about $240 billion at the time, according to data released Tuesday. The last time Chinese banks approached that amount of lending was 2009, when Beijing was deploying 4 trillion renminbi in stimulus to stem the damage from the global financial crisis.A depreciating renminbi also has implications for China\u2019s pledges to open its economy and financial markets wider, including efforts in recent years to lift the currency\u2019s global prominence.The central bank has been lobbying the International Monetary Fund to include the renminbi among freely traded benchmarks like the dollar, euro and yen, so that other countries can include it as an official reserve currency.While acknowledging these efforts, the fund issued a report last week saying that \u201csignificant work remains outstanding\u201d before it could decide whether to include the renminbi as a global benchmark, adding that no changes were likely to be made before September of next year.The fund also singled out China\u2019s official daily fixing of the renminbi\u2019s exchange rate, saying this \u201cis not based on actual market trades.\u201dTuesday\u2019s devaluation \u201cis likely intended to improve the \u2018market-driven\u2019 quality\u201d of the exchange rate to appeal to the I.M.F., Wang Tao, the chief China economist at UBS, wrote Tuesday in a research note.\u201cHowever, we think it unlikely that the Chinese government will let only market momentum drive the renminbi exchange rate from now on,\u201d Ms. Wang added, \u201cas that can be quite destabilizing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

En Estados Unidos, el amplio \u00edndice Standard & Poor 500 cay\u00f3 3.9 por ciento al cierre del lunes, luego de un d\u00eda vol\u00e1til en las transacciones, y despu\u00e9s de que los mercados burs\u00e1tiles asi\u00e1ticos y europeos se desplomaran. El precio del petr\u00f3leo y otras mercanc\u00edas cay\u00f3, y el dinero se refugi\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente en la seguridad de los bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos.Lo fascinante es que no existe una historia clara y sencilla sobre el nuevo pron\u00f3stico para las tasas de inter\u00e9s, las ganancias de empresas en Estados Unidos y Europa, o para el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico en comparaci\u00f3n con la semana pasada, cuando el \u00edndice S&P 500 estaba 10 por ciento arriba.Aqu\u00ed tratamos de explicar esta historia, una que es verdaderamente global pues se extiende desde las calles de Shanghai, donde la inversi\u00f3n burs\u00e1til se ha convertido en el deporte de la clase media en a\u00f1os recientes, pasa por los campos petroleros de Medio Oriente y el centro de Estados Unidos, y llega hasta los pasillos del poder de la Reserva Federal en Washington.La causa inmediata de la volatilidad a nivel mundial fue China, donde la ca\u00edda brusca en las bolsas de valores el lunes continu\u00f3 una retirada que ha estado en marcha durante todo el verano, con pausas peri\u00f3dicas debido a las intervenciones gubernamentales.La econom\u00eda china est\u00e1 desaceler\u00e1ndose y la ca\u00edda de 38 por ciento en el \u00edndice compuesto de Shanghai desde el 12 de junio es, sin duda, una cifra enorme. No cabe duda de que este gigante est\u00e1 batallando con una transici\u00f3n del auge de inversiones y exportaciones hacia algo m\u00e1s sostenible.Sin embargo, algunos hechos hacen que los problemas de China no sean una explicaci\u00f3n totalmente satisfactoria sobre la turbulencia actual de los mercados mundiales. La bolsa de valores en China ha crecido r\u00e1pidamente en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o por las inversiones de millones de ciudadanos chinos de la clase media. Incluso despu\u00e9s de su pronunciada ca\u00edda este verano, la baja del \u00edndice de Shanghai es menor a uno por ciento para este a\u00f1o e incluso est\u00e1 por arriba del 43 por ciento del a\u00f1o pasado.Puede haber una historia m\u00e1s compleja sobre c\u00f3mo la aguda ca\u00edda en el mercado chino pudo haber ocasionado efectos mayores en la econom\u00eda mundial que la subida fuerte en los seis meses que la precedieron. El hecho de que el gobierno chino haya tomado pasos sin precedentes para intentar contener la liquidaci\u00f3n del mercado burs\u00e1til, lo que result\u00f3 poco \u00fatil, puede sugerir limitaciones en el poder del imponente estado chino.En otras palabras, la liquidaci\u00f3n de las acciones chinas puede ser muy importante en forma aislada. No obstante, nos dice mucho de la incapacidad de los l\u00edderes chinos de conducir la econom\u00eda de su pa\u00eds a un aterrizaje m\u00e1s suave. Y eso es aterrador.Los mercados emergentes, que se extienden desde Malasia hasta M\u00e9xico, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n pagando las consecuencias. Los precios de sus monedas, valores y bonos se han desplomado en la \u00faltima semana. Es muy probable que parte de esa ca\u00edda refleje su exposici\u00f3n a la econom\u00eda china. Sin embargo, otra parte refleja algo mayor.Llam\u00e9mosle el \u201cTaper Tantrum 3.0.\u201d (Rabieta por el ajuste)El \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d original ocurri\u00f3 en junio de 2013, cuando los mercados financieros del mundo enloquecieron al darse cuenta de que en el banco central de Estados Unidos, la Reserva Federal, se hablaba en serio sobre la reducci\u00f3n de su programa de expansi\u00f3n cuantitativa (o de manera m\u00e1s sencilla, que, con el tiempo la Reserva Federal, relajar\u00eda sus inyecciones de dinero en el sistema financiero). Luego, hubo una segunda explosi\u00f3n de volatilidad en octubre de 2014 cuando se volvi\u00f3 m\u00e1s claro que la Reserva Federal ten\u00eda la intenci\u00f3n de elevar las tasas de inter\u00e9s en el 2015.De hecho, las pol\u00edticas federales de dinero f\u00e1cil hab\u00edan llevado a los inversionistas del mundo a buscar valores de mayores rendimientos, y los encontraron en muchos mercados emergentes de crecimiento r\u00e1pido. El dinero se precipit\u00f3 hacia esos pa\u00edses en busca de mejores rendimientos desde 2010 hasta 2013, lo que elev\u00f3 el precio de los activos.Pero, como se acab\u00f3 la era de los d\u00f3lares baratos, retiraron ese dinero y crearon picos vol\u00e1tiles en las tasas de inter\u00e9s y afectaron a las econom\u00edas emergentes.La tormenta en los mercados financieros ha tenido un impacto particularmente grande en el precio de commodities, incluyendo el petr\u00f3leo, la mas importante de todas en materia econ\u00f3mica.El precio de un barril de petr\u00f3leo cay\u00f3 de $60 d\u00f3lares a finales de junio a menos de $40 d\u00f3lares este lunes. Con el tiempo, ser\u00e1n buenas noticias para los consumidores en Estados Unidos y Europa, pero existen curvas complejas de retroalimentaci\u00f3n que probablemente har\u00e1n que la liquidaci\u00f3n de las commodities sea una causa y un efecto del gran p\u00e1nico en los mercados emergentes.Cuando los precios del petr\u00f3leo se desplomaron por primera vez en el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o pasado, hubo predicciones extendidas de que la ca\u00edda del precio har\u00eda que la exploraci\u00f3n petrolera se cerrara en todo el mundo, lo que ayudar\u00eda a mantener el equilibrio del mercado. En vez de ello, los productores estadounidenses mantuvieron la producci\u00f3n y la oferta en niveles altos, a pesar de los precios m\u00e1s bajos.Aqu\u00ed tenemos una curva de retroalimentaci\u00f3n: La desaceleraci\u00f3n en China y otros mercados emergentes disminuye la demanda. Las grandes cantidades de petr\u00f3leo disponible y la poca demanda dan como resultado m\u00e1s precios bajos y repercuten en condiciones econ\u00f3micas m\u00e1s d\u00e9biles para los pa\u00edses productores de petr\u00f3leo como aquellos en Medio Oriente, Am\u00e9rica Latina y Rusia.En el trasfondo de todo est\u00e1 una decisi\u00f3n crucial que la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos tiene pendiente. Los funcionarios de la reserva han expresado confianza en que la econom\u00eda nacional va por buen camino y que es momento de elevar las tasas de inter\u00e9s despu\u00e9s de casi siete a\u00f1os de mantenerlas cerca de cero. Podr\u00eda hacerlo en su reuni\u00f3n del 16 y 17 de septiembre.Los funcionarios de la reserva han indicado su determinaci\u00f3n de basar las tasas de inter\u00e9s en lo que sea m\u00e1s adecuado seg\u00fan el estado de la econom\u00eda estadounidense y no exagerar ante las fluctuaciones en los mercados. La volatilidad reciente pondr\u00e1 a prueba esa determinaci\u00f3n.Los mercados de futuros financieros est\u00e1n apostando cada vez m\u00e1s a que la reserva federal se abstendr\u00e1 de subir las tasas de inter\u00e9s luego de evaluar el da\u00f1o a la econom\u00eda ocasionado por las m\u00e1s recientes presiones financieras. El lunes, el mercado consider\u00f3 una oportunidad de 24 por ciento en el incremento de las tasas en septiembre, en comparaci\u00f3n con el 48 por ciento de una semana atr\u00e1s.Y el valor del d\u00f3lar en los mercados de divisas cay\u00f3 1,6 por ciento el lunes (medido por el \u00edndice del d\u00f3lar) cuando los inversionistas consideraron una mayor probabilidad de que la Reserva Federal mantuviera las tasas bajas por m\u00e1s tiempo.Por supuesto, la misi\u00f3n de la Reserva es establecer la pol\u00edtica adecuada seg\u00fan la proyecci\u00f3n de a d\u00f3nde se dirige la econom\u00eda y no de d\u00f3nde viene. Si los mercados siguen cayendo, los prospectos de crecimiento de Estados Unidos podr\u00edan estar en peligro. Por otro lado, la reserva no tiene por qu\u00e9 proteger a los inversionistas de los riesgos de una recesi\u00f3n.Y si los \u00faltimos d\u00edas nos han ense\u00f1ado algo es que los mercados globales estar\u00e1n a la espera de una reacci\u00f3n grande, sin importar lo que haga el banco central.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Good Times or Bad, Brazil Banks Profit", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Political parties whose symbol is a red star tend to be unfavorable for bankers, but Brazil\u2019s ruling party has been a lucrative exception.Yet the gains have been much more impressive for the nation\u2019s banking industry, even as the manufacturing sector has stagnated and the broader economy has ridden the ups and downs of global commodity prices. The combined annual profits of Brazil\u2019s four biggest banks have grown more than 850 percent to just over $20 billion, from $2.1 billion, in the 12 years of Workers\u2019 Party rule.Bank earnings made up more than half of the total profits for companies on the S\u00e3o Paulo stock exchange in both 2013 and 2014, according to the consulting firm Economatica. While the stock market is a poor reflection of Brazil\u2019s economy \u2014 agribusiness and carmakers are barely represented \u2014 bank profits were never above a quarter of the total all through the previous decade.Brazil\u2019s largest and third-largest banks, Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, do not even have profit as their sole mandate. The government, which controls both, often obliges them to engage in less profitable operations as a public service.The two giant private sector banks, Ita\u00fa and Bradesco, consistently earn returns on equity \u2014 a measure of the earnings a company can squeeze out of each dollar invested \u2014 of around 20 percent. Big banks in the United States usually manage only about half as much.Government policies and economic trends have helped the banks here.One is interest rates at levels so high that they would leave borrowers in most other countries speechless.Brazilian academics argue over the reasons for such high rates, but a history of high inflation, sharp currency fluctuations and large government budget deficits mean that the government itself must pay a steep price to borrow money.Since banks can make good money by just buying government bonds, to take the effort and risk of actually making loans, they need an even greater profit.They can often find it. The average spread \u2014 the difference between what banks pay to gain access to capital and what they charge to lend it out \u2014 is 30.7 percentage points in the free credit market.But the spreads are easily wide enough to compensate, especially when the economy is growing.And when times are bad, the banks can look to the government.Brazil\u2019s Treasury not only sells bonds that protect investors against inflation, as certain United States Treasury bonds do; it also offers bonds that increase their payouts when interest rates rise or the currency devalues.When banks sense that the economy is about to deteriorate, they scale back their loans and migrate into these government-backed investments.As a result, many of Brazil\u2019s recent economic troubles, like inflation of nearly 9 percent, a plunging currency and rising interest rates, have actually bolstered banks\u2019 bottom lines.\u201cBanks here are experts at navigating economic instability,\u201d said Luiz Fernando de Paula, an economics professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. \u201cBecause of government bonds that offer protection, currency crises and interest rate shocks do not become banking crises. The government pays the price instead.\u201dA lack of competition may also be helping profits.Ever since a banking crisis in the 1990s threatened scores of financial institutions with insolvency, the authorities have encouraged a string of mergers and acquisitions.\u201cNo government official ever made a statement on the subject, but we have seen a regulatory bias that favors fewer but more solid banks,\u201d said Roberto Luis Troster, a former chief economist for the Brazilian Federation of Banks.By one measure, this policy has been a success. The way that many United States and European banks were rocked in the 2008 financial crisis is nearly unimaginable in Brazil.\u201cWith such high spreads on loans, traditional banking operations are so profitable that the banks here don\u2019t need to assume much risk,\u201d said Luis Miguel Santacreu, financial sector analyst at the Brazilian credit ratings agency Austin Rating. \u201cIt is very unlikely that any big bank would need a capital injection to survive.\u201dBut borrowers also have few options to shop for better prices.When President da Silva took office in 2003, the four biggest banks had 53 percent of the banking system\u2019s total assets, according to Brazil\u2019s central bank. They now have over 70 percent, and many of the smaller banks operate only in limited segments of the market.\u201cThere is some evidence that the banks have oligopoly pricing power,\u201d Professor de Paula said.Not only has the market share of the biggest banks risen, but the credit market itself boomed after first President da Silva, then President Rousseff changed regulations to make it easier for consumers and small businesses to borrow.Both groups responded enthusiastically. Many low- and middle-income consumers borrowed heavily to buy their first household appliances or cars.That is still low by global standards. In the United States, the ratio is closer to 200 percent, and even the Germans have more private sector debt relative to their economy\u2019s size than Brazilians do.But high interest rates make even modest debt a heavy burden. The average Brazilian household spends 22 percent of its monthly income on debt payments, according to the central bank. The National Confederation of Commerce puts the number even higher, at 31 percent.With borrowers overstretched, the banks\u2019 days of rapid growth may be coming to a close. Growth through acquisitions is also nearing its limit.And if Brazil\u2019s recession drags on much longer, default rates will rise. But even if earnings no longer grow as quickly as in the past, they will probably remain strong, even while the broader economy does poorly.\u201cThe banks are reducing their volume of loans, but interest rates are higher than before, spreads are also rising, and they\u2019re making money on government bonds,\u201d Mr. Santacreu said.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that they won\u2019t make a good profit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The parade rolled from the Lower Ninth Ward and down St. Claude Avenue, swelling as people joined along the way. \u201cAfter pain and sorrow, we get the second line bands together and listen to music and celebrate,\u201d said Shade Smith, 28, who was stranded for three days by the floodwaters in an apartment at the St. Bernard public housing project, until a family rowed by with a boat. \u201cThat\u2019s just how people reunite after something really sad, to celebrate a tragedy.\u201dFormer President Bill Clinton \u2014 the third president to visit New Orleans in three days \u2014 recalled coming here as a 3-year-old, the first city he had ever visited, and later as a 15-year-old aspiring jazz musician.In brief comments, he urged the city to celebrate the accomplishments of the past 10 years but not to ignore the profound racial and economic disparities that remain.It has been a week of art exhibits, dinners, panels and lectures \u2014 a week of extended discussions about what the last 10 years have been about, without arriving at any real consensus. There have been city-sanctioned talks about the recovery as \u201ca model for urban America\u201d and summit meetings about \u201cthe capitalist crimes inflicted on New Orleans\u2019s working class.\u201dYet playing underneath it all was the counterpoint of shootings, the unchanging routine of workers in the low-wage tourist economy and the occasional outbursts of raw grief from those reminded of the worst period of their lives. \u201cI think a lot of people have been kind of hunkering down and feeling ambivalent at best,\u201d said Justin Wolfe, a history professor at Tulane University here. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re this spectacle, and yet in all that spectacle, the horror of so much of what happened, the tribulation but also how many people ended up on the wrong side of that story, that gets lost.\u201dStill, an aversion to the onslaught of attention from the news media was mixed with a gratitude that so many people still feel invested in this city. More than 100 volunteers have worked at the Henderson house over the last few weeks, doing in that time what had not been done in 10 years of inadequate government disaster assistance, contractor fraud, break-ins and continuing bureaucratic nightmares.\u201cIt\u2019s not a celebration \u2014 it\u2019s a headache,\u201d Roberta Henderson said of the day\u2019s significance, describing the litany of stress-induced health problems that her husband, Carl, has endured since the first days after the flood. \u201cMany people wouldn\u2019t have lasted through this. They would have just died or given up.\u201d The Hendersons expect to move back into their home by Thanksgiving. By Saturday morning, the St. Bernard Project had rebuilt 615 homes in New Orleans, though its leaders emphasize that there is still a very long way to go.Elsewhere around the city on Saturday, life went on quietly. \u201cWe work during the week, so this is the day we clean up,\u201d said Larry Sambo, 60, who on Saturday morning was washing the family car on a street in Gentilly, a part of town that was under more than seven feet of water. He and his wife, Arlene, ran through their own brief Katrina commemoration: evacuation, months of moving around the South, three years in a trailer, insufficient rebuilding aid, dishonest plumbers, higher taxes, higher insurance costs and a street full of new neighbors. \u201cKatrina made things worse for us,\u201d Ms. Sambo said. \u201cWe take it one day at a time.\u201dIn the evening, around the same time as the event in the Smoothie King Center, the annual midsummer Mardi Gras parade was scheduled to roll uptown. The announcement on Facebook encouraged those attending to wear their costumes. It concluded with this clarification: \u201cPlease note that although this parade falls on Aug. 29, it is not an event commemorating the anniversary of Katrina.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s plan to combat the Islamic State? \u201cWe go in, we knock the hell out of \u2019em, we take the oil,\u201d he told Fox News on Tuesday.How would he handle China, should it keep devaluing its currency? \u201cWell, you have to take strong action,\u201d he said at a news conference here later in the day, right before he took the stage in a hall crammed with about 3,000 people.And what was his plan to improve race relations, someone asked him a moment later? \u201cYou need spirit, esprit de corps, cheerleading, and you need jobs.\u201dFor a man of so many words, Mr. Trump still has relatively little to say about the kinds of policies he would pursue as president.Even as he seeks to give his presidential campaign the kind of serious agenda befitting a candidate who is leading in the polls, so far the Trump Doctrine is not much more than this: \u201cTrust me.\u201dAfter repeated questions from reporters about what specifics he was offering to fix the economy and foreign policy he insists are so badly broken, he finally offered, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see lots of plans.\u201dOr maybe we won\u2019t.\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing, and that\u2019s what I am, I\u2019m a dealer,\u201d he said when he called a New York Times reporter after the speech. \u201cYou don\u2019t go in with plans. You go in with a certain flexibility. And you sort of wheel and deal.\u201dDemands for greater clarity on what his priorities in office would be have grown louder as he has risen in the polls. At one point in his 50-minute speech on Tuesday night, someone from the crowd shouted, \u201cSo how do you fix it?\u201dFor such a loud standing-room-only crowd, the hall in the Birch Run Expo Center here felt oddly quiet at times as Mr. Trump meandered through lines about the country\u2019s need for meaner negotiators, a tougher trade policy and, in a Trump administration, a large role for Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor. A little more than a half-hour into the speech, a few people started filing out.But when he started to drift too much, he would reach for his guaranteed applause lines. \u201cObamacare is a disaster.\u201d \u201cYou have to build a wall.\u201d The place then thundered with approval.Mr. Trump has tried over the last few days to move past the uproar over his public feud with Fox News and one of its top anchors, Megyn Kelly, since she asked him at the Republican debate last week if his remarks about women as dogs and pigs were appropriate for someone seeking to capture the presidency. In a response that some took as a reference to her menstrual cycle, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201dDonald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.Mr. Trump has denied he meant anything by the comment, other than that Ms. Kelly was obviously agitated.But his numerous televised interviews since then and his news conference on Monday evening, Mr. Trump did not appear to be in damage control mode at all. He does not believe there is any damage to repair.\u201cI cherish women,\u201d he said, rebutting notions that his comments would hurt him politically. \u201cAnd I will be great on women\u2019s health issues. Believe me.\u201dThe last few days have been a lot like most others in the Trump campaign. He has insulted his Republican rivals on Twitter. \u201cTruly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!\u201d he wrote. (Mr. Paul held a news conference this week calling Mr. Trump a bully and an \u201cempty suit.\u201d)He responded to a New York Post columnist who called him a whiner by agreeing not only was he a whiner, but the best whiner that exists.\u201cI am the most fabulous whiner,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cI do whine because I want to win. And I\u2019m not happy when I\u2019m not winning. I am a whiner. And I\u2019m a whiner. And I keep whining and whining until I win. And I\u2019m going to win for the country.

{"Headline": "European Publishers Play Lobbying Role Against Google", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Google attracting attention and ad revenue that once funneled to publishers, the goal is clear: Find ways to make more money, by strengthening copyright rules and limiting Google\u2019s power as an advertising platform.The publishers, including Axel Springer of Germany and Lagard\u00e8re of France, arguably have the most to lose from the dominance of Google and other West Coast companies, as they look for revenue on the web to replace losses in print. Some of the publishers, in an effort to buttress their business, have even turned to e-commerce and social networking \u2014 areas that have intensified the rivalry with Google and other tech companies.\u201cWhere else can they go if print is dying?\u201d asked Lucy K\u00fcng, a visiting fellow and specialist in digital transition at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford.\u201cNewspapers help set the agenda, so politicians have to listen to them,\u201d said Julia Reda, a German politician who helped shepherd recent digital copyright proposals through the European Parliament.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The push has awakened Google\u2019s powerful lobbying apparatus, setting off a clash in Brussels and elsewhere in the region as the company tries to co-opt some of its media adversaries and hamstring more stubborn rivals.Google and some other giant American tech companies already confront strong regulatory headwinds in Europe. Apple, Amazon and Facebook are all facing antitrust, tax and privacy investigations across the 28-member bloc. If Google is found to have broken the rules, it could face billions of dollars in fines.Google formally responded on Thursday to the accusations, saying its search products did not harm online competition and providing data that the company said showed that rivals had not been harmed.In recent weeks, several trade associations, including the Federation of European Publishers, have met with Friedrich Wenzel Bulst, a top European antitrust official, and other regulators to also push for stricter, Europe-wide limits on how Google and others may use publishers\u2019 online content. Many publishers are pushing the rules as part of an expected overhaul of copyright policy from G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a European commissioner with ties to Germany\u2019s publishing industry, by the end of the year.\u201cThe argument is simple enough: Publishers want money from Google,\u201d said Till Kreutzer, a German lawyer who has campaigned against these new copyright proposals. \u201cMany European politicians are open to listening to that type of proposal.\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t expand endlessly internationally because of the language issue,\u201d Ms. K\u00fcng said of Europe\u2019s publishers. \u201cJust acquiring other assets with the same problems is really just compounding the problem. The issue is monetizing content.\u201d\u201cThey have followed the eyeballs and the wallets,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as inconsistent.\u201dYet the effort is broad-based, involving written and personal appeals to European Union officials and national lawmakers by dozens of publishers\u2019 groups from at least 20 countries, including Switzerland, which is not a member of the European Union, according to European officials who have either met with industry representatives or seen the correspondence. The moves go well beyond steps taken by American media outlets to contain Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\u201cThis is not about protecting the legacy business,\u201d said Christoph Keese, executive vice president at Axel Springer and a vocal critic of Google. \u201cIt is about ensuring there is a level playing field and making sure that international companies respect European laws.\u201dGoogle has tried to woo magazine and newspaper groups, partly by creating a $172 million fund aimed at helping publishers adapt to the digital world. (The International New York Times, which is based in Paris, took part in a previous $65 million fund that Google created in France.) The company\u2019s executives also regularly point out that Google sends millions of daily visitors to European newspapers and magazines through its online news aggregation service. Those links \u2014 which can represent up to half of a newspaper\u2019s online traffic \u2014 generate much-needed online revenue for publishers.A Google spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Drummond\u2019s remarks.Over the course of last summer, representatives from newspaper and magazine industries, as well as Brussels-based trade associations, met several times with Mr. Almunia and his staff to ask them to renounce the settlement, according to industry executives who were either present or briefed on those meetings.\u201cThere were enormously long exchanges, and some pretty strong representations made\u201d by top publishing industry executives to Mr. Almunia, said one lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThe companies felt they were being served a settlement that was actually going to be injurious to their business.\u201d\u201cWe are afraid of Google,\u201d Mr. D\u00f6pfner said in his letter. \u201cOur business relationship is that of the Goliath of Google to the David of Axel Springer.\u201dEurope\u2019s publishers also took the fight to national capitals, industry executives said, asking governments to put pressure on Mr. Almunia to rethink the proposed settlement. By early September, Mr. Almunia officially rejected the settlement with Google after significant lobbying from both publishing groups and other companies connected to the case.Mr. Almunia left the investigation to his successor, Ms. Vestager, who announced antitrust charges against Google in April. Many publishers backed the move, saying the company\u2019s business model had limited online choice for consumers.\u201cEurope\u2019s publishers are well organized, well connected and a really powerful lobby,\u201d said Stefan Heumann, director of the European digital agenda program at the New Responsibility Foundation, a Berlin-based research organization. \u201cMany of them are struggling to grasp the realities of the new digital world.\u201dMark Scott reported from Berlin, and Nicola Clark from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Obama\u2019s Tough, Achievable Climate Plan", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt imposes the first nationwide limits on carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, the source of 31 percent of America\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. It will shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and give fresh momentum to carbon-free energy sources like wind and solar power, and possibly next-generation nuclear plants. And when taken together with the administration\u2019s other initiatives, chiefly the fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, it reinforces Mr. Obama\u2019s credibility and leverage with other nations heading into the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in December.The plan\u2019s opponents in industry, the states and Congress are already gathering their forces to try to undermine it on Capitol Hill and in the courts, claiming that the plan will cost thousands of jobs, drive electricity prices through the roof and irreparably damage the economy. But the truth is this: There is nothing radical about it.For more than a decade, carbon emissions from power plants have been declining \u2014 a result of a shift in energy generation from coal to cheap and abundant natural gas, regulation of other pollutants, like mercury, which has caused utilities to shut down older plants, and investments in cleaner fuels and energy efficiency.Coal generation, which 10 years ago provided just over half the nation\u2019s electricity, last year provided 39 percent. Meanwhile, renewable energy sources like wind and solar power \u2014 driven by federal tax credits, improvements in technology and state mandates \u2014 have risen sharply in that time.The new rules will codify and accelerate these trends, making sure that the shift to cleaner fuels continues quickly. Their main goal is a nationwide reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 32 percent by 2030, from a 2005 baseline. Among their many selling points is flexibility: The rules assign each state a specific target for reducing carbon pollution from plants inside its borders, but allows them to develop custom-tailored plans for meeting these targets. States can choose from a menu of options to meet their targets: switching from coal to natural gas, ramping up wind and solar, reducing energy consumption with so-called demand-side efficiencies, engaging in cap-and-trade systems with other states.And then there is the little matter of the coming presidential election. Even if the courts rule that the new regulations are fully consistent with the E.P.A.\u2019s authority under the Clean Air Act, a future president could rescind or delay them. Hillary Rodham Clinton has said she supports the plan and will carry it out. Republicans are unanimously opposed.Given the rules\u2019 importance \u2014 to the country, to Mr. Obama\u2019s negotiating leverage and, not least, to the planet \u2014 the politicians will bear watching.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How California Is Winning the Drought", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFOR California, there hasn\u2019t ever been a summer quite like the summer of 2015. The state and its 39 million residents are about to enter the fifth year of a drought. It has been the driest four-year period in California history \u2014 and the hottest, too.In 2014, the state\u2019s economy grew 27 percent faster than the country\u2019s economy as a whole \u2014 the state has grown faster than the nation every year of the drought.California has won back every job lost in the Great Recession and set new employment records. In the past year, California created 462,000 jobs \u2014 nearly 9,000 a week. No other state came close.The drought has inspired no Dust Bowl-style exodus. California\u2019s population has grown faster even as the drought has deepened.More than half the fruits and vegetables grown in the United States come from California farms, and last year, the third growing season of the drought, both farm employment and farm revenue increased slightly.Amid all the nervous news, the most important California drought story is the one we aren\u2019t noticing. California is weathering the drought with remarkable resilience, because the state has been getting ready for this drought for the past 20 years.The future of water is going to be turbulent for all of us \u2014 not far away, but right where we live; not in some distant decade, but next month or next spring. A sense of water insecurity is coming to many places that have never had a water worry. Here\u2019s what California\u2019s scorching summer of 2015 is showing us: We know what to do. We just have to do it.Mr. Michael returned to work the family farm in 1998, and has gradually transformed the mix of crops and how they are grown. In the past 10 years, he has spent $10 million installing drip irrigation on about half the land. When he grows tomatoes using drip hoses that squirt water right below where the plants emerge from the ground, he uses about 35 percent less water per acre than he would with traditional irrigation. But the plants produce more tomatoes \u2014 he says that he gets at least 70 percent more tomatoes per 1,000 gallons of water.Mr. Michael isn\u2019t an isolated example. He\u2019s part of a trend. Since 1980, the amount of California farmland watered by drip- or micro-irrigation has gone from almost nothing to nearly three million acres, 39 percent of the state\u2019s irrigated fields. In perfect parallel, farmland that is flood-irrigated \u2014 using more water to produce less food \u2014 has fallen to about 3.5 million acres from more than six million.California\u2019s urban areas are also slowly transforming themselves. East of Los Angeles is a quietly innovative water district called the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, providing water for just under a million people.The agency has an aggressive water recycling program, which cleans and resupplies 52 million gallons of water a day for an immediate second use, on farms, in factories and commercial laundries, in recharging the area\u2019s groundwater.And although it is dozens of miles from the Pacific Ocean, the agency also desalinates water. The Inland Empire sits over an aquifer that has been polluted by a legacy of careless agricultural and human habitation. The desalination process removes chemicals and salt, turning 35 million gallons a day of tainted brine into water at least as clean as tap.Those techniques expand Inland Empire\u2019s water supply without actually requiring any new water, and they represent the leading edge of an effort in Southern California toward \u201cwater independence.\u201d In water terms, California is famously a kind of teeter-totter: Most of the water is in the north, most of the people are in the south, and the water flows to the people.But across Southern California, the progress is quietly astonishing. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California now supplies roughly 19 million people in six counties, and it uses slightly less water than it did 25 years ago, when it supplied 15 million people. That savings \u2014 more than one billion gallons each day \u2014 is enough to supply all of New York City.In the town of East Porterville, in the central part of the state, the drinking wells began to go dry a year ago or more. Many residents rely on bottled water and water distributed at the fire station. Their taps, their toilets, their showers are dry \u2014 an astonishing level of deprivation in a state with great wealth.Farm production numbers look good partly because prices for produce are high. Irrigation water, which comes from surface water sources mostly in the north, is allocated based on history, law and availability. Despite cuts of irrigation water of up to 100 percent, farmers have continued to get water, pumping it from aquifers under their land.California is the only state in the nation that has never regulated groundwater \u2014 farmers are largely free to pump as much as they want, without even tracking what they use. In wet years, pumping well water is generally unnecessary and expensive. In dry years, it\u2019s survival.The farmers are saving themselves now, but they are inflicting long-term damage to the vast underground water supply that is really California\u2019s only remaining water cushion.California\u2019s progress has been bumpy. The second lesson is that a drought starkly reveals water absurdities that need to be fixed, often urgently.How can the largest agricultural economy in the country not require farmers to report how much water they use \u2014 and allow them to use groundwater without limit?How can the water-starved city of Los Angeles have an elaborate system of drains and pipes to collect the rain that does fall \u2014 often in brief, intense torrents \u2014 only to discard it in the Pacific instead of storing it?And the third lesson is how to use water insecurity to create its opposite. A drought like this one creates the opportunity to change things \u2014 even really big things \u2014 that couldn\u2019t be changed without a sudden sense of vulnerability.Last fall, prodded by Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s administration, the California Legislature passed a sweeping groundwater law, taking California from having the least regulated groundwater in the country to being a model. The concept is simple: No community will be allowed to pump more water from the underground aquifers than can refill those aquifers \u2014 either naturally, or with human help.The law is so innovative, it will eventually remake water use across the state, and if other states pay attention, across the nation. The law could inspire new techniques for getting rainwater to refill overtaxed aquifers.In May, the water district for all of Southern California decided to use the drought to change attitudes about lawns. It increased funding more than fivefold for a program that gives rebates to homeowners who replace their lawns with desert-appropriate landscaping. Las Vegas helped pioneer such \u201ccash for grass\u201d programs as a water-saving technique, removing 170 million square feet of turf \u2014 thousands of lawns \u2014 since 1999.The response in Southern California, where $340 million was allocated for the program, stunned even experienced water managers. After five weeks, all the rebate money had been spoken for. The amount of turf set to be removed: about the same square footage that Las Vegas needed 16 years to take out.One of the wonderful ironies of water is that the more attention you pay to it, the less you have to worry about it. By the drought of 2045, the way California uses water will have been transformed again. Just as powerfully, the way ordinary Californians regard water will have been transformed. More than any water conservation practice in particular, it\u2019s that attitude that will save the state \u2014 and the rest of us, as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As China Reduces Local Spending, Cities Woo Private Investors", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The wide new boulevards that cut across parts of Weifang in eastern China are largely free of traffic, a quiet reminder of the coastal city\u2019s big ambitions.\u201cIt\u2019s empty here, and I always come here to dry my wheat,\u201d said a 77-year-old farmer surnamed Zhang who, along with his wife and son, was spreading grain on a sidewalk in one of the city\u2019s newer districts on a recent summer day.There is just one hitch: Weifang can\u2019t pay for all the projects.In the past, city officials would have turned to low-cost loans from state-owned banks, as the national government encouraged local spending to spur economic growth. But the Chinese leadership, worried about the country\u2019s ballooning debt problem, is backing away from that strategy.Like hundreds of cities across China, Weifang is now wooing deep-pocketed private investors, both local and overseas, to help pay for public infrastructure and services. Behind the spot where Mr. Zhang dries his wheat, a gleaming new hospital dominates the skyline, built in part with outside capital.\u201cIf the project suits the public-private partnership model, we will try to fund it that way,\u201d said Liu Xitian, the deputy director of Weifang\u2019s finance bureau. \u201cThe next step will be to improve public services. We will release lots of projects in that area.\u201dThe push reflects the precarious financial state of many cities and towns.Although the country escaped the worst of the global financial crisis six years ago, it did so on the back of a borrowing binge by local governments, which spent heavily on new but often unprofitable infrastructure projects. Now, many local governments are mired in debt.In Weifang, a city known for seafood processing and an annual kite-flying festival, rapid urbanization over the last decade has saddled the local government with debts totaling 88.4 billion renminbi, or $14.2 billion, as of June 2013, the most recent data available.Since 2007, China\u2019s overall local government debt has risen at an annual rate of 27 percent. It now totals almost $3 trillion, according to estimates from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.Companies, too, have gorged on cheap credit in recent years. Altogether, China\u2019s total debt stands at 282 percent of its gross domestic product \u2014 a high level that raises the risk of a financial crisis should borrowers prove unable to repay and a wave of defaults ensue.It has created a conundrum for the country. China\u2019s leaders want to wean the country from this debt-fueled growth model. But they also need to continue stimulating the economy, particularly at a time when growth is slowing.Part of Beijing\u2019s solution has been to help local governments lower their borrowing costs through refinancing. Local government-controlled companies that are struggling to pay bonds are being encouraged to exchange them for new loans at lower interest rates from state-run banks. China\u2019s Ministry of Finance recently expanded this local government debt refinancing program to 3 trillion renminbi, or nearly $500 billion, up from 1 trillion renminbi just a few months ago.China has also begun a national campaign to encourage private investment in local infrastructure projects.In May, the nation\u2019s top economic planning agency released a list of more than 1,000 projects worth 2 trillion renminbi that local governments across the country are seeking to finance with outside investment. Analysts estimate that is on top of roughly 1,500 other projects worth 3 trillion renminbi that had been previously announced by the local authorities.A decade ago, the MTR Corporation, the Hong Kong subway operator, was an investor in Beijing\u2019s fourth metro line. Beijing had won the right to host the 2008 Summer Olympics and was expanding its transport network at a blinding pace.By the time it opened in 2009, passenger flows on the new line were much higher and revenue much lower than either party had forecast. This prompted huge subsidy payments from the Beijing government to the MTR, which did not sit well with local officials.So city officials simply rewrote the contract. The new terms reduced subsidy payments to the MTR, and were on balance more favorable to the city government. MTR, as the minority shareholder, had little room to object.Ren Yuhang, general manager of the finance department at Beijing Infrastructure Investment, the city government company charged with financing subway investment, compared such deals to a marriage.\u201cIt takes a lot of negotiation and compromise,\u201d he said.Xie Hua, a deputy manager at the MTR in charge of business development in China, said local officials often failed to appreciate the long duration of rail partnerships, which can extend to 30 years. Also, some local officials tend to focus too narrowly on just getting money.Foreign investors bring expertise, and they want a say in how a project is run, but local officials often reply that their \u201cbiggest problem right now is funding,\u201d Mr. Xie said. \u201cThe two sides have mismatched solutions.\u201dSuch experiences, say analysts, could limit the appetite of foreign investors.\u201cThe initial wave of all these projects definitely is going to be more suited to the local players,\u201d said Stephen Ip, a partner and the head of government and infrastructure business at KPMG China, based in Shanghai. Foreign investors \u201ccan\u2019t really make the leap of faith at the moment.\u201dIn Weifang, the local government has a list of nearly 70 projects it hopes to finance through the private-partnership model, for a total investment of 124 billion renminbi \u2014 about a quarter of the city\u2019s economic output.Officials hope the money will help the city cope with rapid transformation. Farmland is giving way to new roads, rail lines and other large-scale infrastructure projects. A huge industrial park on the outskirts of town is busy with construction activity, but it is also dotted with symbols of previous booms that have fizzled.Part of the idea behind bringing in private investment is to help offset a slowdown in other parts of the local economy, including real estate. Evidence of the property market slump can be seen in half-finished projects in the same industrial park, like Jinhe Aristocratic Family, a luxury housing development.The six-tower complex was supposed to be completed this year, but the developer ran out of money. Dormant construction cranes tower over the site. Wild grass has since overtaken much of the freshly cleared earth.\u201cIf you are interested, I would suggest you purchase after the construction restarts,\u201d said a lone security guard living at the Jinhe site, declining to give his name.The falling property market has cut deeply into local coffers. In Weifang, land sales, which account for a major share of the city\u2019s income, plunged 40 percent last year, according to figures from Deutsche Bank.Weifang officials had some early success in attracting private capital.The new hospital, built with funding from Sunshine Insurance, a company based in Beijing, aims to be the biggest medical facility in Shandong Province. The insurer, which this year spent $230 million to buy the Baccarat Hotel in New York, has local connections. The company\u2019s chairman, Zhang Weigong, is a native of Weifang.One of the biggest projects in Weifang is the local section of a new high-speed rail line connecting the major cities of Jinan and Qingdao. It is the country\u2019s first high-speed rail project to secure private financing.But the definition of private is a bit stretched, in some cases.The Weifang government is responsible for 4 billion renminbi of the 26 billion renminbi budget for the 147-kilometer, or 90-mile, portion that will run through the city. The main outside investor is the Postal Savings Bank of China, a sprawling, state-owned bank. Temasek Holdings, the Singapore state investment firm, has also agreed to participate in funding at the provincial level, according to local officials.Even if the enthusiasm of private investors fails to keep pace, the force of urbanization seems unlikely to slow.In the sleepy village of Beiying on the outskirts of Weifang, a farmer who gave his surname as Pei is worried that the rail project will force him out of his home.\u201cI was born in this village and have worked as a farmer my whole life,\u201d said Mr. Pei, 50, who grows fruits and vegetables a few hundred yards from where construction on the rail line will start soon. \u201cWhat else can I do if I don\u2019t farm?\u201dNeil Gough reported from Hong Kong, and Cao Li contributed research from Weifang, China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Week\u2019s Market Sell-Off May Not Be Such a Bad Thing", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThe 3.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index on Friday culminated the worst week for United States stocks since 2011, and put the index 7.5 percent below its recent peak on May 21. Many global markets have performed even worse, with stocks down across Asia and Europe. And the price of oil and emerging market currencies around the world continued a decline that dates to last year.It\u2019s about time.That\u2019s not to minimize the losses investors have incurred, or to say that each of these moves can be completely justified by data, and certainly not to predict what will happen next week or next month. But if you step back just a bit, what has happened in financial markets this week looks less like a catastrophe in the making and more like a much-needed breather when various markets had been starting to look a little bubbly.Market commentators offer a range of specific explanations for the sell-off, including a drop in oil prices thanks to a global supply glut (which will affect the profits of energy companies and oil-dependent emerging markets alike), a slowdown in the Chinese economy that is becoming more apparent by the day, and a credit squeeze in other emerging markets. But those explanations, while accurate, are part of a bigger story.Markets have been priced for perfection, and we\u2019re getting some reminders that the world economy is far from perfect.The United States stock market, as measured by the S.&P. 500, is the clearest example. It fell 5.8 percent this week and is now down 4 percent for the year. But that only pulls the index down to October 2014 levels. Against a longer time horizon, the recent drop looks more like a trivial downward bounce within a consistent range rather than something more dire.Flat stock prices in 2015 mask what came before: a remarkable run-up in stock prices in the preceding half-decade. From mid-2009 to mid-2014, stock prices rose much faster than corporate earnings, or gross domestic product, or pretty much anything else you might think of as fundamentals.In effect, investors became more and more willing to take the risk inherent in owning stocks, so much so that they were willing to pay very high prices for shares relative to the profits of the companies they were buying a piece of. Thus, by definition, they were accepting low returns (low by absolute standards and relative to the very low interest rates offered on safer investments like government bonds).Just over three years ago, in July 2012, investing $100 in the S.&P. 500 captured more than $7 in annual earnings; putting the same money in a 10 year United States Treasury bond paid out only $1.55.In other words, stocks might have been risky, but investors were being compensated nicely for that risk.A mix of interventionist policies from the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and a global glut of investment capital have created a mismatch between the global economy, which has grown glacially, and markets, which have been on fire.The big question now is whether the fundamentals driving the recent sell-off \u2014 the oil glut, the emerging market strains \u2014 get worse or better. That matters a lot for businesses and individuals in China and other countries under stress, and for oil producers globally. But for the United States economy and even for most companies traded on American exchanges, it\u2019s much less clear that it should create a major hit.Consider that in 1997 and 1998, an emerging markets crisis rippled across East Asia and Russia. It turned out that 1999 was a blockbuster year for United States economic growth and corporate earnings anyway.In the meantime, the best response for most investors trying to grapple with the latest bout of volatility is to take a deep breath, appreciate the remarkable run-up of the last five years, and remember that if you panic at the thought of losing 6 percent of your money in a week, that money really shouldn\u2019t be invested in the stock market to begin with.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Josh Brown\u2019s company. It is Ritholtz Wealth Management, not Ritholtz Capital Management.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Defaults on Bond Payment", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rico defaulted on a $58 million bond payment on Monday, a risky move that seemed to intensify the pressure on creditors for broader debt renegotiation, but might also make future borrowing far more difficult.Whether Puerto Rico would make the payments was a subject of intense speculation among legal and financial experts for days as Monday\u2019s deadline approached. Although the island made a payment on the interest of about $628,000, it said it lacked the funds to pay the full amount.In a statement, Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, which owes the money, said: \u201cThis was a decision that reflects the serious concerns about the commonwealth\u2019s liquidity.\u201dPuerto Rico is carrying immense debt, in excess of $72 billion, that has raised serious questions about its financial future. Although it has come close to default before, the step on Monday was the first since it came under jurisdiction of the United States 117 years ago. The bank attributed the decision not to make the payment to a failure by the legislature to appropriate the money.But some big institutional bondholders are disputing the idea that a global restructuring is necessary and are warning that unilateral actions by Puerto Rico will cause disruption and pain on the island, similar to the dislocations in Greece.Now, though, the ratings are deep in junk territory, and many of those ordinary investors are facing a rough ride.\u201cThis is a first in what we believe will be broad defaults on commonwealth debt,\u201d said Emily Raimes, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Standard & Poor\u2019s took a similar stance, saying in a statement: \u201cWe believe the default signals severe liquidity distress, whereby Puerto Rico must now choose among which financial obligations it can honor.\u201d It also predicted other defaults were possible over the next few months.While Puerto Rico made some other bond payments that were due on Monday, attention in the financial markets was focused on the decision to skip the $58 million in payments due on about 20 so-called moral obligation bonds. Those bonds were issued by a subsidiary of the Government Development Bank for a variety of projects \u2014 including school construction and the creation of landfills.Although this particular type of bond does not carry with it a legal requirement for repayment in the absence of a budget appropriation, market experts said Puerto Rico\u2019s decision not to pay amounted to a default and left them perplexed about the strategy of paying some bonds while letting others lapse.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a kamikaze strategy,\u201d said Sergio M. Marxuach, public policy director at the Center for a New Economy, a research institute in San Juan.Mr. Marxuach said the government seemed to be hoping to attract attention in Congress, where a bill that would give certain public enterprises on the island access to bankruptcy court has been languishing. He predicted that Congress would do nothing for Puerto Rico before the August recess, and in the meantime the default would bring market turmoil and opposition.As of Friday, Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds over all had already lost more than 10 percent of their value from the start of the year, closing at their lowest point since July 2009 as it became clear that the government was unlikely to make the $58 million payment. J. R. Rieger, who tracks a broad sample of Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, said that he was concerned not just about the portfolio losses but also that the market for Puerto Rico bonds might now dry up completely.\u201cOnce a bond defaults, the number of buyers who are able to buy truly distressed debt is smaller,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWill there be enough buyers to sustain an orderly market in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds?\u201dIf demand for Puerto Rico\u2019s debt dwindles, the financial institutions that now hold its bonds will be unable to unwind their positions without realizing losses. The scale of the losses could vary widely, though, because Puerto Rico\u2019s total $72 billion of bonded debt has been issued by multiple entities, using a bewildering array of terms, repayment mechanisms, governmental guarantees and other features.Confusing the situation further, the bonds that defaulted on Monday were sold with a guarantee, in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit issued by the Government Development Bank.The letter of credit made the bonds look safer. It said that in the event the Public Finance Corporation failed to make a payment, a trustee for the bondholders would be able to draw the money owed them from the Government Development Bank.But as investors have prepared for the default, they learned that the bonds\u2019 prospectus does not describe this safety feature the same way the bonds\u2019 indenture does, leaving confusion about what it takes to activate the letter of credit, or whether the guarantee is meaningful at all.Officials in Puerto Rico have said that the bonds were backed by yearly budget appropriations, and that if an appropriation did not happen, the bonds would not be paid that year and the holders would have no legal recourse \u2014 in effect, there would not be any default to cure.Ms. Acosta said that $628,000 was available for a partial payment because that much money was left over from appropriations in previous years. \u201cThe terms of these bonds,\u201d she said, \u201cstipulate that these obligations are payable solely from funds specifically appropriated by the legislature.\u201d Market participants dispute that assertion. But they said on Monday that investors might have to file suit in a Puerto Rico court to get a declaration of default, and there was no guarantee that the court would issue one. Then Puerto Rico might be able to turn around and sue the investors, saying their accusations of default had caused it irreparable legal and financial harm. That could cast the overall debt in an unflattering light of Wall Street versus the people, possibly hardening the positions taken on other debts as the situation evolves. Investors in the bonds of Puerto Rico\u2019s big electrical authority have been negotiating for months on a consensual restructuring of its $9 billion in bonds, for example. It was not clear on Monday whether those talks could continue, given that lack of payment on the moral obligation bonds. Dwindling demand for Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds could intensify the island\u2019s mounting liquidity problems. Puerto Rico stands to lose whatever ability it still has to borrow at an acceptable price, and it needs more cash to continue normal government operations. As recently as last week, its officials were talking about possibly borrowing as much as $500 million.\u201cSince Puerto Rico is not a sovereign country, and we\u2019re not a state of the union, we\u2019re really in limbo,\u201d Mr. Marxuach said.If Puerto Rico were a state, he said, it would have the power to send its cities, school districts and other units of government into Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy. But as it is not a state, Puerto Rico has no such standing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kazakhstan\u2019s Currency Plunges", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Kazakhstan\u2019s currency, the tenge, plunged by about a quarter on Thursday after the central bank stopped managing the exchange rate, prompting fears that a wider emerging market currency rout could be coming.The surprise move in Kazakhstan was in response to falling prices of oil, the country\u2019s main export, and earlier devaluations by its two main trading partners, Russia and China.Also on Thursday, Vietnam devalued the dong, and currencies as far afield as the Brazilian real and the South African rand started to skid.The next to drop, financial analysts say, will most likely be the currencies of Kazakhstan\u2019s neighbors in Central Asia, a poor region with a population of about 50 million people: the Kyrgyz som, the Turkmen manat and the Tajik somoni.The Kazak government had spent about $28 billion propping up the tenge over the last two years, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a televised meeting with the directors of major Kazakh companies. Continuing support for the tenge after China\u2019s devaluation, he said, risked spending down hard currency and gold reserves, and hurting domestic producers.\u201cThe price of this policy would have been shrinking output in the country, a loss of jobs and burning hard currency, that is, our reserves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state would have moved toward ruin.\u201dEarlier in the day, Prime Minister Karim Massimov had announced that the central bank would pursue inflation targeting rather than an exchange-rate-targeting policy, in essence withdrawing support for the currency, prompting a run on banks and automated teller machines, which quickly ran out of dollars.Led by China, emerging market economies are slowing, and Kazakhstan, the most commercially dynamic and wealthy of the former Soviet Central Asian states, is no exception. Growth averaged about 6 percent from 2011 until 2014, but the oil-dependent economy is expected to grow only 1.8 percent this year.The currency devaluation was inevitable, Mr. Nazarbayev told the company directors. He asked the executives to buy tenge with hard currency earnings from exports to help ease the decline, mirroring a policy Russia used to soften a plunge in the ruble last winter.\u201cIn a bad and unclear situation on our foreign markets,\u201d he said, \u201cthis was a necessary measure and we had no alternatives. You know, we planned our programs differently, but a crisis always brings changes.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Less Defiant Germany Seems Prepared to Clear a Path for a Third Greek Bailout", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Germany softened its resistance to a third bailout package for Greece on Wednesday, raising the chances that a draft plan could be approved in time for the country to make a crucial debt payment next week.While a political obstacle course still lies ahead, officials in Berlin and Brussels spoke of a markedly improved negotiating climate. Eurozone finance ministers scheduled a meeting on Friday in Brussels at which they could give their imprimatur to the bailout deal.The bailout requires approval from parliaments in Germany, Greece and other countries before Aug. 20, when Greece must repay \u20ac3.2 billion it owes the European Central Bank. The plan has stirred significant opposition in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, and Ms. Merkel and other senior government members have taken pains to cast themselves as careful stewards of public money. That stance made Wednesday\u2019s cautious welcome to the Greek plan all the more significant.\u201cThe direction of the agreement is right,\u201d said Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Ms. Merkel. Nevertheless, he said, the government needed several days to assess the plan before it could recommend it to Parliament for approval. And officials in Berlin continued to speak of giving Greece a temporary loan rather than rushing to reach an accord.As if to demonstrate the watchdog role it intends to play, the German Finance Ministry sent Brussels a two-page commentary on the draft agreement, posing questions for which the eurozone finance ministers should demand Greek answers. A Finance Ministry official declined to give more detail about the commentary but explicitly denied a report in the German newspaper Bild that Berlin had rejected the proposed bailout program.In Athens, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, also faced resistance to the deal in Parliament, which would need to approve 200 pages of legislation by Friday to qualify for the aid. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the speaker of the Parliament and a dissident in Mr. Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party, was using her control over procedure to delay a vote on the bailout.But Mr. Tsipras said on Wednesday that he was confident the deal would be approved in time.\u201cWe will prove wrong those who doubt us, and we will manage to rebuild the country,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said.To qualify for its third bailout in five years, Greece must agree to sweeping changes to the way it manages its economy. Among other things, the draft agreement reached on Tuesday requires Greece to overhaul tax collection procedures, deregulate the natural gas market and change foreclosure laws.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.In Brussels, officials praised cooperation they received from Athens, which contrasted with the rancor that prevailed when Yanis Varoufakis, a combative economics professor and outspoken populist, was serving as the Greek finance minister. The official who replaced him, Euclid Tsakalotos, has been seen as a more practical and cooperative negotiator.Given the brinkmanship and ill will that had characterized relations between Greece and its eurozone creditors, particularly Germany, the new mood seemed almost jarringly upbeat. But Greece has accepted almost all of the creditors\u2019 demands, making it difficult for Germany to obstruct the deal. The questions ahead include whether the government of Greece can carry out the changes it is promising \u2014 assuming the country\u2019s lawmakers vote to embrace them and the Greek people cooperate.The draft agreement with eurozone countries includes 29 pages of details about how Greece should modernize its economy and its public administration, for example by curtailing early retirement, giving businesses more freedom, privatizing state-owned industries like railroads and airports, and fighting corruption.\u201cAll last details have been clarified,\u201d Annika Breidthardt, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told a daily briefing in Brussels on Wednesday.While many economists see the changes as necessary, many Greeks resent what they see as micromanagement of their economy by outsiders. For example, the plan contains detailed instructions on how Greece should change its foreclosure laws to make it easier for banks to collect unpaid debts. More than a third of Greek loans are classified as nonperforming, a serious threat to the banking system.And many experts say the plan is predicated on an unrealistically speedy turnaround in the Greek economy. After shrinking 2.3 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2016, according to the plan\u2019s forecasts, the Greek economy is supposed to rebound sharply, rising 2.7 percent in 2017 and 3.1 percent in 2018.\u201cI am a little bit stunned because those numbers have no relationship to reality,\u201d said Ashoka Mody, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now a professor at Princeton University. He said the growth estimates were incompatible with the strict spending limits that creditors are imposing on Greece.Greece\u2019s two previous bailouts, whose lack of success has made a third one necessary, ran afoul in large measure by making growth forecasts that the austerity-sapped economy could not meet.The authorities in Brussels have battled a perception, particularly strong among some German legislators, that the deal reached with Greece this week was done too hastily.On Wednesday, though, Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman was less critical than German officials had been earlier in the week.\u201cIf you consider where we\u2019ve come over the past months in this discussion, this is a substantial result,\u201d Mr. Seifert said. \u201cIt is true that the Greek government was constructive and results-oriented in its discussions with the institutions. Negotiations took place in an atmosphere that we hadn\u2019t experienced in the past months.\u201dA crucial issue is whether the terms of the agreement will allow participation of the I.M.F. in the early stages of the bailout.The fund, another of Greece\u2019s creditors, participated in drafting the agreement reached with Athens on Tuesday night. But the I.M.F. has said it will not take part in any program that does not include debt relief for Greece. That is a potential sticking point, because the German government and others want to ensure that Greece starts living up to its promises before offering longer maturities or reduced interest rates to ease its debt burden.The Greek government owes more than \u20ac315 billion, mostly to other eurozone countries. But it still owes the I.M.F. \u20ac20 billion, and the new program assumes Greece might borrow still more from the fund.Germany has not ruled out giving Greece years if not decades to repay its loans, however, which could satisfy the I.M.F. Leaders in Germany regard the fund as a crucial participant because of its expertise in dealing with overly indebted countries and making sure they adhere to bailout terms.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, held separate telephone calls with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Ms. Merkel on Wednesday about the deal. In addition, officials from the finance ministries of the 28 European Union member states planned to talk by phone Wednesday evening on the bailout plan.A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, J\u00fcrg Weissgerber, noted on Wednesday that Berlin was still waiting for important figures and exact details on the size of the proposed package. He also insisted that the idea of temporary financing remained an option if there was no agreement on the new bailout in time for Athens to make the Aug. 20 payment to the European Central Bank.Last month, Ms. Merkel faced open rebellion from 60 deputies in her center-right bloc when the Bundestag voted to approve opening negotiations with Greece. And exchanges among conservative lawmakers this week have suggested that the opposition to giving more money to Greece may have grown in the interim.Ms. Merkel can rely on the Social Democrats, partners in her coalition government, to ensure parliamentary approval. But in Germany\u2019s consensus-minded political system, a rebellion against the authority of a chancellor is unusual, and thus significant.As is her custom, Ms. Merkel has returned quietly from vacation this week and not spoken publicly on Greece or other matters since Mr. Seibert confirmed that the chancellor had talked with Mr. Tsipras on Monday and Tuesday.But Mr. Seibert dismissed a report in Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper that Ms. Merkel and the Greek prime minister engaged in a \u201cloud,\u201d or heated, exchange.Ms. Merkel is scheduled to go to Brazil next week on a state visit. If all goes as planned, the German Parliament could be recalled from vacation to vote on the package before she leaves.Alison Smale reported from Berlin, Jack Ewing from Frankfurt and James Kanter from Brussels.

Over the past several years the United States and other Western powers have engaged in an economic, clandestine and political war against Iran to force it to give up its nuclear program.Over the course of this siege, American policy makers have been very explicit about their goals. Foremost, to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. Second, as John Kerry has said, to force it to dismantle a large part of its nuclear infrastructure. Third, to take away its power to enrich uranium.Fourth, as President Obama has said, to close the Fordo enrichment facility. Fifth, as the chief American negotiator, Wendy Sherman, recently testified, to force Iran to come clean on all past nuclear activities by the Iranian military. Sixth, to shut down Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. Seventh, to have \u201canywhere, anytime 24/7\u201d access to any nuclear facilities Iran retains. Eighth, as Kerry put it, to not phase down sanctions until after Iran ends its nuclear bomb-making capabilities.Iran wins the right to enrich uranium. The agreement does not include \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d inspections; some inspections would require a 24-day waiting period, giving the Iranians plenty of time to clean things up. After eight years, all restrictions on ballistic missiles are lifted. Sanctions are lifted once Iran has taken its initial actions.Wars, military or economic, are measured by whether you achieved your stated objectives. By this standard the U.S. and its allies lost the war against Iran, but we were able to negotiate terms that gave only our partial surrender, which forces Iran to at least delay its victory. There have now been three big U.S. strategic defeats over the past several decades: Vietnam, Iraq and now Iran.The big question is, Why did we lose? Why did the combined powers of the Western world lose to a ragtag regime with a crippled economy and without much popular support?The first big answer is that the Iranians just wanted victory more than we did. They were willing to withstand the kind of punishment we were prepared to mete out.The president hoped that a deal would change the moral nature of the regime, so he had an extra incentive to reach a deal. And the Western, Russian and Chinese sanctions regime was fragile while the Iranians were able to hang together.This administration has given us a choice between two terrible options: accept the partial-surrender agreement that was negotiated or reject it and slide immediately into what is in effect our total surrender \u2014 a collapsed sanctions regime and a booming Iranian nuclear program.Many members of Congress will be tempted to accept the terms of our partial surrender as the least bad option in the wake of our defeat. I get that. But in voting for this deal they may be affixing their names to an arrangement that will increase the chance of more comprehensive war further down the road.Iran is a fanatical, hegemonic, hate-filled regime. If you think its radicalism is going to be softened by a few global trade opportunities, you really haven\u2019t been paying attention to the Middle East over the past four decades.Iran will use its $150 billion windfall to spread terror around the region and exert its power. It will incrementally but dangerously cheat on the accord. Armed with money, ballistic weapons and an eventual nuclear breakout, it will become more aggressive. As the end of the nuclear delay comes into view, the 45th or 46th president will decide that action must be taken.Economic and political defeats can be as bad as military ones. Sometimes when you surrender to a tyranny you lay the groundwork for a more cataclysmic conflict to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hotel Goes Up, and His Latino Views Barely Raise Eyebrows", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRio de Janeiro Journal\u201cI\u2019m a Latin and I have to say, I didn\u2019t get offended at all with his comments,\u201d said Paulo Figueiredo Filho, 33, a Brazilian real estate mogul and self-described conservative libertarian who is building the lavish new Trump Hotel here.\u201cI spend a lot of time in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Figueiredo added, \u201cand I have seen a lot of illegal immigrants that are causing problems, causing trouble in the country, and I actually agree with him.\u201dThe relative paucity of tension around Mr. Trump\u2019s lavish new hotel venture here \u2014 in contrast to reactions elsewhere in the Americas, where some media giants and other companies have cut ties to Mr. Trump \u2014 may reflect how Brazil is changing, and how it is not.\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to have a Trump property in our city,\u201d said Alfredo Lopes, the president of the city\u2019s hotel association and the Rio Convention and Visitors Bureau, emphasizing that he had not paid much attention to the controversies surrounding Mr. Trump in the United States. \u201cThis project is a gift to Rio that will serve a very exclusive segment of the market.\u201dBut there is a cultural dynamic at work as well. Scholars attribute some of the indifference here about Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration remarks to an entrenched tradition in Portuguese-speaking Brazil of seeing the country as separate from its Spanish-speaking neighbors in Latin America, despite energetic diplomatic efforts in recent decades to forge stronger ties in the region.Many \u201cBrazilians are not offended by Trump\u2019s remarks concerning Latinos because they don\u2019t think his nasty remarks\u201d refer to them, said Maxine Margolis, an anthropologist at the University of Florida who is a leading authority on Brazilian emigration to the United States. \u201cHe is talking about a population they see as \u2018the other.\u2019\u00a0\u201dEstimates vary widely on the number of Brazilian immigrants in the United States because most of them are thought to be there illegally, but Dr. Margolis placed the number at around 900,000 to one million, close to the figures used by Brazil\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry.While some Brazilian immigrants returned to Brazil in the years after the 2008 financial crisis, a period when Brazil\u2019s economy was booming, Dr. Margolis said it now appeared that Brazilians were moving yet again to the United States as Brazil\u2019s economy remains mired in a multiyear slowdown.Of course, Mr. Trump and his new landmark have their fair share of detractors. In a city long defined by its enormous gap between rich and poor, not everyone agrees that Rio needs yet another luxury hotel, much less one planning to charge $500 a night for rooms with floors made of imported Turkish marble.Adding to the extravagance, the 13-story hotel, which is designed with jagged, terraced suites facing the Atlantic, will feature an infinity pool made of glass suspended above a nightclub with capacity for 600 people.\u201cInstead of focusing on ways of alleviating that inequality, there\u2019s a push to use the Olympics to benefit the most privileged sectors of society,\u201d Ms. Williamson added. \u201cThe Trump Hotel is just the latest fixture in a city where bolstering the playgrounds for the rich is a priority for the authorities.\u201dStill, criticism of the $120 million hotel, which is scheduled to open before the Olympics, remains subdued in Rio. Despite the economic headwinds in the country, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the group remained bullish about doing business in Brazil. And even as Mr. Trump faces criticism in various parts of the region, she said, \u201cThere is tremendous support for Trump and the brand across Latin America.\u201dMr. Trump also recently expressed optimism about Brazil, even though the construction of another of his organization\u2019s projects in Rio, a complex of five office towers in the gritty area around the port, has been delayed, with no public completion date.\u201cI love Brazilians, especially Brazilian women, which are absolutely incredible,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a 2014 interview with Veja, a Brazilian magazine. Mr. Trump boasted that he had something to teach the Brazilian people, emphasizing that his lessons for Brazilians would involve providing an example of entrepreneurism and good service.\u201cI love teaching,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a great teacher.\u201dWhen asked in the same interview if he had met Dilma Rousseff, Mr. Trump, apparently unaware that she is both a woman and the nation\u2019s president, responded: \u201cNo. Who is he?\u201dBeing less than reverential toward the Brazilian president, whether unintentional or not, did not seem to fan the flames, either. After all, dismissive views about Ms. Rousseff are fashionable in Brazil these days, as she grapples with approval ratings in the single digits. Huge street protests have called for her impeachment over the country\u2019s sagging fortunes and a colossal graft scandal at the national oil company.When Mr. Figueiredo\u2019s blunt-spoken grandfather was stepping down in 1985, he remarked that he preferred the smell of horses to people. When asked what he wanted Brazilians to think of him, the four-star general replied, \u201cI want them to forget me.\u201dBut the frustrations with Brazil\u2019s government have given new momentum to right-wing groups, and some in Brazil\u2019s antigovernment protests are now openly calling for a return to military rule, a subject that was until recently politically taboo. Mr. Figueiredo exudes pride when talking about his grandfather, and he heaps praise on Mr. Trump, a figure under fire elsewhere in the region.\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most recognized businessmen in the world, and if anything, we\u2019re getting more exposure,\u201d Mr. Figueiredo said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going to decide not to stay in a fantastic hotel just because of his political views.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Support: Even More Unequal Than U.S. Incomes", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016So here\u2019s a different framework for thinking about Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenge, perhaps one that will resonate with his supporters: inequality.It is tempting to look at Mr. Sanders\u2019s huge crowds and assume that he has a good chance. To me, that\u2019s as convincing as saying the Connecticut economy is booming because the houses in Greenwich are so big and pretty.Call it the Berni coefficient. It\u2019s just like the Gini, except instead of looking at the distribution of money among people, we\u2019re looking at the distribution of Sanders volunteers among congressional districts. A coefficient of one would mean that all Sanders\u2019s volunteers were in one congressional district; zero would mean every district had the same amount.By this measure, the Sanders coalition is even more unequal than the wealth in the United States. The Sanders coefficient clocks in at 0.483. It basically resembles the state of Connecticut, the second-most unequal state in the country (New York is No. 1).Many people look at Connecticut and see one of the country\u2019s wealthier states, epitomized by its stately towns. But the wealth of Greenwich doesn\u2019t change the difficulties of a place like nearby Bridgeport, where 25 percent live in poverty.It\u2019s the same thing for the Sanders campaign. In places like Seattle; Portland, Ore.; and Burlington, Vt., more than a thousand people showed up to house parties. But in 12 congressional districts, there were no Sanders events at all.It\u2019s a theory that\u2019s not too different from trickle-down economics, which holds that wealthy investors, free of taxes and burdensome regulations, can invest in growing industries that ultimately produce jobs and a better life for the rest of the population.But trickle-down campaigning might not help Mr. Sanders as much as he hopes. The reasons he has such little support among moderate and nonwhite voters run much deeper than name recognition.It is not at all clear that Mr. Sanders\u2019s big organizing efforts in San Francisco, Seattle or New York would do much to improve his numbers in Charleston, S.C., or Detroit, any more than the dynamic postindustrial economy of San Francisco has helped the workers remaining in Detroit.Even if these voters were closer to Mr. Sanders\u2019s organizers, they would still be a tough sell. Moderate or conservative Democrats simply do not start the campaign with the assumptions about the Democrats or Mrs. Clinton that make many white, Northern, liberal voters ripe for Mr. Sanders.Most Democrats, for instance, do not share the assumption that Mrs. Clinton is a tool of Wall Street, something that supporters of Mr. Sanders took for granted long before he entered the race. Many moderate and less educated voters do not pay much attention to politics, and usually end up siding with well-known establishment figures against reformist candidates.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Election Poses New Economic Risks", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe upcoming Greek election may reopen the can of worms that the 86-billion-euro bailout deal with creditors was supposed to close. Given that no party is likely to emerge from the Sept. 20 vote with a majority, it may be hard to form a strong government that can implement the program. There\u2019s even a risk that there will be yet more elections, tipping Greece back into crisis.When Alexis Tsipras set the election in motion by resigning as prime minister, he probably thought he would win fairly easily. After all, opinion polls in July showed him head and shoulders above his opponents. Mr. Tsipras\u2019s idea was to get rid of the members of Parliament in his left-wing Syriza party who opposed his deal with the eurozone and secure a new mandate to carry out the program, worth the equivalent of $96 billion.But opinion polls that came out last week paint a different picture. In all, Syriza is the leading party, but its gap over the center-right New Democracy party has narrowed sharply.What\u2019s more, Mr. Tsipras\u2019s approval rating, which used to be sky-high, has come down to earth. In a poll by the University of Macedonia, only 30 percent of those asked had a positive view of him, down from 70 percent in March.In the past, Mr. Tsipras seemed like the Teflon prime minister, who remained popular despite terrible decisions that took the country to the edge of an economic abyss. But it looks as if the mud is beginning to stick.The civil war inside Syriza is also taking its toll. One hard-left faction, which wants to bring back the drachma and is furious that Mr. Tsipras agreed on a deal with the eurozone despite previously saying he wouldn\u2019t, has already created a new party.The election campaign has barely started, and opinion polls during the August holiday season are not considered particularly reliable. Despite those caveats, it doesn\u2019t look likely that any party will emerge with a majority in the 300-seat Parliament even after taking account of the fact that the one with the most votes gets an extra 50 seats.This presents a problem. True, the vast majority of the members of Parliament elected next month are likely to belong to parties that are committed at least in theory to the bailout. The snag is that Mr. Tsipras has said he won\u2019t be prime minister of a government including New Democracy or two smaller centrist and center-left parties. What\u2019s more, it is touch-and-go whether his favorite coalition partner, the far-right Independent Greeks, will secure any seats at all.If Mr. Tsipras can\u2019t form a government, there may have to be yet another election, which would be the third this year. This could cause further economic mayhem because Athens would fall seriously behind in implementing its bailout deal. People might speculate again that Greece could leave the euro.The Greek people might well punish Mr. Tsipras if he forced a third election. They already seem unhappy that a second ballot has been called \u2014 not to mention the referendum on an earlier version of the bailout program that Mr. Tsipras held in July.Given that, Mr. Tsipras might yet form a coalition with the center and center-left parties he has pledged not to deal with.He does, after all, have a track record of going back on his word.Such an outcome might lead to an effective execution of the bailout. But there is a risk that Mr. Tsipras will not dump all the rebels from his party because he is afraid of swelling the ranks of the splinter group.In that case, he could find that his government starts with a majority, but that its unity melts away when it has to make tough decisions, again leading to elections. This situation might be avoided if any party invited to join a Tsipras-led coalition insists on all the other centrist parties being in the government, too. That would probably give it a big enough majority to withstand future defections.Any putative coalition partner should also insist that Mr. Tsipras appoint skilled ministers, including some technocrats, to his cabinet. His first government was plagued with incompetence.Another idea is that Mr. Tsipras could support some form of national unity government, but not as its prime minister. He could propose another Syriza politician or some technocrat for the post. But this would raise the concern that Mr. Tsipras wanted to wash his hands of the program he had previously signed up to, which in turn would make it harder to implement.All these calculations will, of course, change if New Democracy wins the election. New Democracy would find it easier to form a coalition because it has promised to work with any democratic party after the vote. It has even said that it would work with Syriza in what would be a national unity government. While that, indeed, might be the best outcome for Greece, Mr. Tsipras is unlikely to agree to it.Even if the worst situations are avoided, the risk is that amid the political fighting, what is most beneficial for the Greek people does not end up driving events forward.Hugo Dixon writes a weekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

How do we think about where the housing market is going, and where we\u2019re positioned? Second, people hear how hard it is to get a mortgage, and so there\u2019s some reluctance there. So we have to demystify that in terms of the process. And because of the economy of the last few years, people have been in a situation where maybe there were issues with them having a job that could support buying a home; maybe they were living in their parents\u2019 basement. But we\u2019re starting to see the homeownership formation rate start to grow \u2014 people moving into the rental markets. That\u2019s a good thing, because those folks will eventually move into the home-buying market. We insure the loans that get sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We can also insure loans that a bank keeps in their portfolio, but the vast majority of what we do are loans that Fannie and Freddie will purchase. We had decreased our pricing over the last few years as F.H.A. had been increasing their pricing.

We purchase unemployment insurance for consumers who are getting a 3 percent-down loan; it lasts for the first two years of the loan. The credit is at a point today where we see very few defaults in comparison. The default rates today are below what they normally would have been; I don\u2019t know it off the top of my head.

{"Headline": " 9 Opposition Candidates Barred From Venezuela\u2019s December Ballot ", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when a government agency stripped him of his right to hold public office, scuttling his candidacy, he found himself caught up in a different kind of wave \u2014 of government measures that appear aimed at weakening the opposition ahead of a make-or-break legislative election in December.\u201cIt was a message to the Venezuelan people: \u2018Look, we can do whatever we want,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Scarano said of the move to bar him and at least eight other prominent politicians and activists from running for office. He said the goal was \u201cto discourage people from voting and to create an internal conflict\u201d in the opposition\u2019s Democratic Unity coalition.His 10-and-a-half-month sentence ended in February, and in May he won the primary to be the local congressional candidate for the opposition. But on July 15 the national controller\u2019s office ruled that he was prohibited from holding public office for a year. The reason: The controller\u2019s office said Mr. Scarano was late in filing a financial disclosure required of all public officials after they leave office.Mr. Scarano said he filed the papers in time \u2014 the dispute centers on the date he was officially removed from office by the court. But even if he missed the deadline by a little less than three weeks, as the controller contends, he argued that he should have been fined, not lost his right to run for office.The controller, Manuel Galindo, dismissed criticism of the actions, saying in a recent speech that his office \u201cdoes not conduct political persecutions of anyone. It simply is in charge of safeguarding public property.\u201dBasic goods are in short supply: A supermarket in a mall that also houses the mayor\u2019s office in this city of about 157,000 people had no rice, beans, eggs, flour, sugar, cooking oil, dishwashing soap or many other staples.Mr. Maduro, whose movement boasts an almost uninterrupted string of election victories going back to 1998, blames enemies, including the United States, for waging an economic war aimed at overthrowing his government. Yet most economists say government policy is the cause of the crisis, pointing to tight foreign currency and price controls, a vast increase in the money supply and prodigious deficit spending. Most opposition parties have agreed to field a single slate of candidates under the Democratic Unity banner, which they have used in recent presidential elections and the last time the legislature came up for renewal, in 2010.Government officials frequently highlight signs of weakness in the coalition, and recent measures seem to be aimed at trying to accentuate its internal divisions.Mr. Scarano was running in a district that is overwhelmingly pro-opposition, so removing him as a candidate is not likely to give the government an edge there on Election Day \u2014 he is being replaced by another member of his Open Books Party. But it could keep a popular figure who says he has aspirations to run for governor or even president from gaining a wider national audience.Only about 40 of the opposition candidates for the 167 National Assembly seats were chosen through primaries, and it took weeks of often strained negotiations for the coalition to agree on a full list of candidates, in part because each party wanted to maximize the number from its ranks.So barring some candidates creates the potential for further divisions.That was the case after the controller declared Ms. Machado ineligible for public office because of inconsistencies in a financial disclosure, which Mr. Galindo said involved the failure to declare income from government food coupons that were part of her compensation when she served as a legislator.Ms. Machado sought to name the candidate that would replace her, but the coalition said that under its rules a different candidate should be designated. The dispute threatened to create a rift in the organization, although Ms. Machado ultimately ceded.That was also the case after the Venezuelan Supreme Court last month removed the leadership of the influential center-right party Copei and chose the new leaders. Copei is a critical member of the Democratic Unity coalition, but after the court-imposed change, coalition officials said they would not work with a party whose leadership was picked by the government. They then replaced the 27 Copei candidates on the coalition slate with members of other parties.But analysts said the releases could be an effort, with an eye toward the December elections, to reduce the profile of the men, whose presence in prison had brought international attention. Mr. Ceballos is one of the politicians recently barred from running for office. One of Mr. Baduel\u2019s sons, Ra\u00fal Emilio Baduel, is also in prison on charges related to last year\u2019s protests. He was going to run for Congress from jail, but was also barred from the election.The government has put up obstacles not only to its traditional opposition but also to a newly emerging opposition on the left. Electoral officials in May refused to allow a dissident group that broke off from Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party to register as a political party. The group, Socialist Tide, said it would run candidates on the slates of other small leftist parties.Nicmer Evans, a leader of Socialist Tide, blamed both the government and the opposition coalition for wanting to keep his group off the ballot, saying that both saw it as a threat. He criticized \u201cthe encumbrances and arbitrary actions\u201d of electoral authorities and said, \u201cWe are fighting to overcome all of these attempts to exclude us politically.\u201dPatricia Torres contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Costs of Malay Supremacy", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Malaysia is in crisis. The economy is faltering and the government is floundering, struggling to explain away unprecedented financial scandals. Critics ascribe these problems to a lack of transparency and good governance, but these are merely symptoms. The root cause of Malaysia\u2019s current troubles is ketuanan Melayu: the ideology of Malay supremacy espoused by the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the party that has dominated the country\u2019s politics for more than six decades.Malaysia has a vast system of institutionalized preferences for Malays, the majority of the population, which grants them economic and other privileges over ethnic Chinese, Indians and other minorities. Although in place for more than four decades, these policies have failed to significantly help poor Malays. At the same time, they have created a grand quid pro quo between other segments of the Malay population and the UMNO government: For fear of losing their advantages, beneficiaries of the preferences don\u2019t hold UMNO to account when it falls short. Malaysia\u2019s affirmative action program was supposed to right a historical wrong. In 1969, deadly racial riots broke out between Malays and Chinese in several cities, and the country was placed under emergency rule. UMNO blamed British colonists for the unrest, claiming that until Malaya\u2019s independence in 1957 they had sidelined Malays and favored the Chinese in the economy. In 1970, the population of Malaysia was about 53 percent Malay, 36 percent Chinese and 11 percent Indian, yet Malays held only 2.4 percent of all shares in the stock market, whereas the Chinese controlled 27 percent (Indians had about 1 percent, with the bulk, more than 63 percent, in foreign hands).When the state of emergency was lifted in 1971, the government promulgated the New Economic Policy (NEP), giving Malays (officially called bumiputera) preferential treatment in all spheres of public life. Senior positions in the civil service were reserved for Malays. Special schools were established for them exclusively. It was decided bumiputera should control 30 percent of all corporate equity by 1990. Malay home buyers were entitled to a discount of 5 to 15 percent on new developments. The NEP was ostensibly designed to uplift Malays, but it soon became a means for UMNO to cement political support, creating a rentier system with dubious economic results. During the 1980s and 1990s, when Mahathir Mohamad was prime minister, major infrastructure projects \u2014 the North-South Expressway, the Petronas Towers, the planned city of Putrajaya \u2014 were awarded to Malay companies with ties to UMNO. A vast privatization program also multiplied connections between the party and Malay big business, as many public utilities became so-called government-linked companies, or G.L.C.s, tasked with representing and promoting bumiputera interests. Today, G.L.C.s are said to control about one-third of the capitalization of the stock exchange. They vastly dominate banking and finance, transportation, utilities, the oil and gas sector and retail trade. According to a 2013 report by the Asian Development Bank, G.L.C.s were stifling competition in many areas of the economy and deterring private investment. Yet even periods of financial turmoil have not convinced the government to rethink the NEP or dismantle the preferential economy. UMNO elites could not suffer reforms for fear of losing their own privileges or the support of other beneficiaries. When Prime Minister Najib Razak came to power in 2009, he convened a group of economists to devise a new economic plan. The panel recommended replacing the existing racial preferences with need-based policies that would help any Malaysian, regardless of ethnicity, at the bottom 40 percent of the population in terms of household income. After encountering strong opposition from within UMNO, Mr. Najib dropped the idea and instead established yet another agency, Teraju, to encourage bumiputera participation in the economy. Promoting Malay supremacy not only undermines government accountability; it makes for unsound economics. Take Proton, the national car project that was started in 1983. For years, a slew of tariff and nontariff barriers have been applied to foreign cars in order to keep the made-in-Malaysia Proton comparatively cheap. But Proton, the car, is of poor quality and its production has yet to reach an economy of scale. And Proton, the company, has asked the Malaysian government for some $700 million in subsidies. Yet Mr. Mahathir, now the chairman of Proton, argues that the state must continue to protect it because it buys parts mostly from Malay vendors and employs almost only Malays.Or consider companies undertaking I.P.O.s, which are required to reserve a set percentage of their shares for Malay interests. (The requirement used to be 30 percent; now, it is 12.5 percent.) These \u201cbumi\u201d shares have sometimes been sold at below market price in order to meet the quotas. According to a list of recipients published a few years ago, the stocks have gone mostly to people connected to senior government officials and politicians from UMNO. And in 2009 Mr. Najib revealed that only 2 billion ringgit of the 54 billion ringgit (about $12.8 billion at today\u2019s rates) in bumi shares allocated since 1971 remained in Malay hands. Market discipline, transparency and good governance are falling by the wayside in the name of Malay supremacy. And for what? After more than four decades of preferential treatment, many bumiputera businesses remain uncompetitive and rely on the government for their survival. Non-Malays are leaving the country in droves, undermining the economy\u2019s long-term prospects. Although the educational levels of Malays have improved tremendously, their median household income still lags behind those of all other ethnic groups. The pro-Malay affirmative action policies must be abandoned. The Malay Agenda is hurting Malaysia. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As South Korean Villages Empty, More Primary Schools Face Closings", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNogok JournalNow, Nogok is about to lose an important symbol of youthful vitality: Next spring, the local primary school will close when its only student, a 12-year-old named Chung Jeong-su, graduates.\u201cVillages around here have no more children to send,\u201d the school\u2019s only teacher, Lee Sung-kyun, said recently, looking over an empty, weed-filled playground surrounded by old cherry trees. \u201cYoung people have all gone to cities to find work and get married there.\u201dNogok, which lies 110 miles east of Seoul, is typical of many rural South Korean towns. An idyllic cluster of 16 hamlets, it is nestled in a series of narrow valleys surrounded by lush hills. In the hills and valleys, farmers tend crops of potatoes, beans and red peppers; in town, persimmon and apricot trees grow in the well-tended gardens of every home. But the town also bears scars from the country\u2019s rapid industrialization, a great transformation that places like Nogok helped unleash.And the primary school itself played a large part in those changes.Like countless other parents in the aftermath of the Korean War, the slash-and-burn farmers of Nogok saw education as the ticket for their children to escape lives of backbreaking work and poverty. Every morning, they would send them to study at Nogok Primary, with some of the children walking as many as five miles each way.Later, the children joined streams of rural youths migrating to cities to seek higher education or factory jobs from the 1970s and onward, providing cheap and disciplined work forces to fuel the economy.Many children from Nogok Primary, for instance, moved on to work as welders and painters at shipyards on the southern coast of South Korea, earning wages their fathers could hardly have imagined as they toiled on their hardscrabble plots in the hills around Nogok.This exodus also overlapped with a government birth-control campaign that started in the 1960s and continued into the 1990s. In Nogok, married men reporting for mandatory army reserve training would receive condoms or exemptions from serving if they agreed to free vasectomies. Across South Korea, birthrates dropped from 4.5 children per woman in 1970 to 1.2 last year, one of the lowest rates in the world. Over the same period, the number of primary school students decreased by more than half to 2.7 million.Hardest hit by this demographic shift were rural towns like Nogok and their public schools. Since 1982, nearly 3,600 schools have closed across South Korea, most of them in rural towns, for lack of children.Today, many villages look like ghost towns, with houses crumbling and once-bustling schools standing in weedy ruins, windowpanes cracked or full of cobwebs. In Nogok, the only store in the town center was closed during a recent visit in the afternoon.\u201cThere are only old, useless people left here,\u201d said Baek Gye-hyun, 55, a farmer here. \u201cIf we come across a young woman with a child, we stop and stare as if they were an endangered species.\u201dIn 1960, Nogok had 5,387 people, 2,054 of them age 12 or younger. In 2010, the last year the government conducted a general census, the town reported a population of 615. Only 17 were 14 or younger.Jeong-su, the Nogok Primary student, is the youngest child, and his 52-year-old father, Chung Eui-jin, the youngest married man in their village of Hawolsan-ri, which is part of Nogok. The school has not had a first grader since Jeong-su enrolled there five years ago. After two sixth graders graduated this spring, he was the only student left.\u201cIt\u2019s cool to have all the school to myself,\u201d said Jeong-su, a shy boy with glasses, who said he wanted to become a veterinarian.When asked what he would remember the most from his school days, he mentioned playing table tennis with his teacher, Mr. Lee.Mr. Lee said the personalized attention was obviously good for Jeong-su. But he said he felt bad that the boy had no classmates with whom to share school memories later in life.\u201cUntil last year, when we had several students, we used to play mini-soccer,\u201d he said, referring to a stripped down version of the game for small numbers of players. \u201cNow, that has become impossible.\u201d At recess, Mr. Lee said, he and Jeong-su now spent their time throwing paper airplanes.Most South Koreans now live in the tall apartment buildings that are spread out like dominoes across South Korean cities, but many still bemoan the shrinking of rural communities. The slow death of rural schools is particularly poignant in a culture that cherishes hometown and school ties.Even decades after leaving rural hometowns, many urban migrants stay connected through \u201cdongchanghoe,\u201d or school alumni associations, whose bonds are so strong that politicians often use them as vote-gathering tools.\u201cIt\u2019s a sorry sight,\u201d said Mr. Baek, a graduate of Nogok Primary, pointing at the weeds in the school\u2019s playground. \u201cWhen I was a student here, 300 children were crawling all over there, giving weeds no time to grow.\u201dIn 1990, for the 60th anniversary of the school, graduates pooled money to build statues of an elephant and a lion, as well as a monument that urges students to nurture their \u201cdreams into the future, into the world.\u201d But by 1999, the school had lost so many students it became a branch of another school, Geundeok Primary School, in the nearby town. Today, the monument stands forlorn, overlooking a basketball hoop, slides and soccer goal posts rusting in the school field.Inside the two-story concrete school building, it is oddly silent.The wooden floors creaked when Jeong-su, Mr. Lee and the school\u2019s janitor, Lee Dong-min, walked in on a recent school day. Walls lined with crayon drawings and origami created by former students bore witness to a busier past.Gathering dust in empty classrooms were big-screen TVs, table tennis tables, computers, a drum set, a piano, telescopes, anatomical charts, book-filled shelves, and desks and chairs, all empty.Painting and guitar instructors visit the school twice a week to give Jeong-su lessons. A yellow van operated by the local educational office delivers lunch for the boy and his teacher.It cost more than 100 million won (about $87,000) a year to run the school, Mr. Lee said.\u201cYou can\u2019t say all the excess is justified by one student,\u201d said Kim Bok-hyun, 71, a Nogok villager.Mr. Kim used to sell pencils, gum and toys to Nogok Primary students from a shop in front of the school. But he closed up years ago because of a lack of customers. He now spends most of his time sitting on a chair on the roadside, watching the few buses and trucks that pass by.Some rural towns started campaigns to save their schools, hiring buses to transport children from neighboring towns and even offering free housing for couples moving in with school-age children.Similar efforts did not work for Nogok, said Kim Jong-sik, 58, a village chief in the area.\u201cThere is no one coming in to live here, only people moving out,\u201d said Mr. Kim, who said all his own children lived in cities. \u201cWith all the best schools, jobs and shopping malls concentrated in big cities, their attraction for young people has become irreversible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Value of Iran Sanctions Relief Is Hard to Measure", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe best answer appears to be that nobody really knows, not even the Iranians themselves. As in the broader dispute over whether the agreement would block or pave Iran\u2019s pathways to a nuclear weapon, conflicting claims on both sides have clouded the issue.The money sits in foreign banks, out of Iran\u2019s reach. Estimates of the sum that could become available to Iran range from $29 billion to as much as $150 billion.Accumulated partly from Iranian sales of oil and other goods, the money is one of the most important, and perhaps misunderstood, components of the nuclear deal reached last month.The money has been impounded for years in accounts in China, India, South Korea and other Iranian trading partners because of American sanctions that would penalize those countries if Iran were permitted access. Under the accord, Iran could reclaim the money by complying with verifiable guarantees that Iranian nuclear work is peaceful.Opponents of the accord, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and leading Republicans in Congress, have described the money as a windfall, a jackpot and a signing bonus, valuing it at the upper end of the estimates. Some contend that the money may not even rightfully belong to Iran and is more analogous to the seized booty of a drug cartel.Proponents of the accord, led by the Obama administration, say the total amount is much less than critics are asserting and would not be quickly accessible, a process that could take months.Mr. Szubin estimated that Iran has $100 billion to $125 billion in foreign exchange assets worldwide, but that \u201cour assessment is that Iran\u2019s usable liquid assets after sanctions relief will be much lower, at little more than $50 billion.\u201dThe obligations include delayed payments to creditors, including China, one of Iran\u2019s biggest trading partners.A short overview of highlights from the Iran nuclear pact.\u201cI am not going to say $56 billion is not a lot of money, but it\u2019s not $150 billion, and it cannot be all used because they need to keep some foreign reserves to run their economy,\u201d Mr. Lew said.He also sought to refute critics who assert that Iran would almost certainly use the money nefariously, arguing that Iran\u2019s leaders face urgent economic problems.\u201cWe can\u2019t say that there won\u2019t be any more money going toward malign purposes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the order of magnitude is way, way smaller, and it\u2019s in line with the kinds of spending they have been doing anyway.\u201dCritics of the agreement have challenged the administration\u2019s lower estimate of sanctions money, and what they call its imprecise accounting. \u201cAre they going to write a $50 billion check to Hezbollah? No,\u201d Mr. Wallace said. Still, he said, \u201csome of the facts of this deal, the American people are finding troubling.\u201dMr. Wallace, a former diplomat at the United States Mission to the United Nations who worked on the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain, acknowledged that \u201cthere is hyperbole on both sides\u201d over the nuclear agreement, including the amount of impounded money.\u201cIt is opaque,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think the administration is trying to lower the number even further.\u201dSome economists have contended that Iran will have even less money at its disposal than Treasury officials have asserted.They also contend that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who has staked his political survival on improving the lives of Iranians, is far likelier to use the freed money to rebuild Iran\u2019s economy than to underwrite military adventurism or terrorism.\u201cThis money is going to be a lifeline for the government,\u201d Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said.As for the estimates of $100 billion or more, he said, \u201cthat number doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dIf Iran had accumulated such a sum in its impounded foreign accounts, he and others argue, it would be partly reflected in a stronger foreign-exchange rate for the rial, Iran\u2019s currency, on the anticipation that the government would soon be awash in dollars.Instead, the rial has remained stable or slightly weakened against the dollar over the past year.Last week, Valiollah Seif, the governor of Iran\u2019s central bank, said that of roughly $77 billion held abroad, only $29 billion would be usable because the rest had already been committed to petrochemical investments or as collateral for Chinese-financed development projects.But that could have been an attempt to dampen public expectations, Dr. Vaez said.\u201cThe Iranian government is coming under intense lobbying by different interest groups who are seeking to earmark these resources,\u201d Dr. Vaez said in an email. The fear, he said, is that efforts to invest the money wisely \u201ccould drown in the swamp of pent-up public expectations of rapid economic recovery.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as in the earlier debate, President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton drew the most criticism from the Republicans.By MICHAEL BARBARO and NICHOLAS CONFESSOREThe rambunctious presidential debate Thursday night left some Republican candidates shining and others stung. Here are some highlights and low lights from the prime-time showdown.Donald J. Trump came out of the debate with more airtime than any other candidate. He had almost three times as many opportunities to speak as Rand Paul or Gov. Chris Christie, through direct questions from the moderators and rebuttals to other candidates. Darker bars indicate responses that were longer than 60 seconds.BROOKLYN \u2014 The big winner here on Thursday night? Lauren Haugli, who prevailed in the bar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debate bingo competition for Republican turns of phrase.Her winning combination included mentions of Benghazi, defunding Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare.For her efforts, she was gifted a copy of a book by Ben Carson, which she began skimming as the debate neared its end. The rest of the evening, she suggested, was of little educational value.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have learned that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m definitely not going to vote Republican,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Haugli, 25. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRand Paul is surprisingly sexy. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBROOKLYN \u2014 The clear winner in this room of mostly empty beer mugs and moldering finger food was Donald J. Trump, whose closing statement earned a protracted, if sarcastic, ovation. Chants of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u00e2\u0080\u009d filled the beer hall, teeming with voters eager to see him run next year.Karen Finney, a spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, spoke about Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments on immigration at the first Republican debate.It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very high in the polls but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a clue about how to govern, a person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead. And of course, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking about Hillary Clinton.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mike HuckabeeDonald J. Trump apparently is not planning to stick around for too much small talk after the debate. According to data from Flightwise.com, Mr. Trump\u2019s plane is scheduled to depart Cleveland about 45 minutes after the debate ends. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump\u2019s flight from La Guardia Airport was delayed, causing him to land in Cleveland about an hour late.SIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 When Senator Rand Paul declared, twice, that he is a different kind of Republican, Sarah Newswander, 32, noted that he was stating the obvious: \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said with a smile.When Senator Ted Cruz promised to undo all of President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive orders, Ms. Newswander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband, Bryan, 34, was impressed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Ben Carson earned appreciative chuckles when he noted that he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only one to separate Siamese twins.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMike Huckabee, not surprisingly, strongly opposed the idea of permitting transgender people to serve in the military, with the kind of vivid quote that he is known for. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military to kill people and break things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it was, in fact, not a particularly tough statement by Mr. Huckabee on this issue, particularly compared with how he approached it when he ran for president in 2008. Indeed, gay rights issues were an undercurrent in this debate, but just an undercurrent. John Kasich said that he opposed same-sex marriage, and in the next breath said he had attended a same-sex marriage. There have been many indications over the past year that this issue is not as powerful as it once was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and tonight was another reminder of that.BROOKLYN \u2014 When Senator Rand Paul referenced his visits to Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a bid to cast himself as a different kind of Republican, appealing to new constituencies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the remark suggested to one attendee that perhaps he, too, belonged on the stage.\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he just say he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been to Baltimore? Is that a bragging point?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Andrew Kraemer, 35, as the bar began to clear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been to Baltimore.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn fact, Mr. Paul was criticized earlier this year, amid an uproar in Baltimore, after saying he was relieved a train he was on did not stop there.Donald J. Trump led in airtime, speaking more than double the amount of time as some other candidates.Senator Marco Rubio offered a forceful explanation for why he is pro-life and appeared offended at the notion that he had ever wavered on the issue.However, it allowed for exceptions if the life of the mother was at risk and if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.The Republican candidates repeated their opposition to the nuclear agreement reached with Iran by President Obama and other world leaders in part on the concern that Iran would profit from the lifting of sanctions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving them $150 billion plus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Donald J. Trump said. more The world powers are not giving Iran money, but by easing or terminating sanctions they would allow Iran to have access to many billions of dollars of its own money that have been frozen in overseas accounts. Much of the money came from Iranian sales of oil and other goods and has been frozen in China, India, South Korea and other countries for years.The governor of Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central bank said last week that of roughly $77 billion held abroad, only $29 billion would be usable because the rest had already been committed to petrochemical investments or as collateral for Chinese-financed development projects. But critics said those estimates are too low and an attempt to shape the political debate.By LYNN VAVRECKAn experiment showed that people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evaluations of the candidates were affected by which media outlet they were assigned to watch.By JEREMY W. PETERSWithering glances. Long silences. Pointed questions. Combativeness before millions of viewers. And that was just Megyn Kelly, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier.He has had among the least amount of speaking time so far, but on the debate\u2019s final topic of foreign policy, Ted Cruz has led the debate.I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because someone doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the way I do doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about them or can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them. And I would accept them because, you know what, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taught when we have strong faith. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gov. John KasichSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 As the debate began to wind down, Mel Adema, 72, leaned over to his wife and whispered that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida had surprised him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just figured he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do a good job, but to me, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much shining and doing a great job,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Adema said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoy, his answers have been great. He just flows right through them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no stuttering, no stammering, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look uneasy, he just looks very comfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA reminder of the potential problems Jeb Bush faces among conservative voters came in the form of the question asking him about his affiliation with Michael Bloomberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s education philanthropy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which, among other things, made heavy contributions to Planned Parenthood. Mr. Bush said he was not aware of that record of contributions (you better believe the opposition researchers in the other campaigns are checking that claim right now) and reiterated his opposition to abortion. That said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reminder of the kind of advertisements opponents can run against him in states like Iowa, where Planned Parenthood has become the face of abortion excesses. (Not to mention, by the way, that having an affiliation with Mr. Bloomberg may not be the best credential to have in a Republican primary.)BROOKLYN \u2014 Several attendees were pleasantly surprised at the remarks of Gov. John Kasich, particularly as he discussed same-sex marriage, saying he would love and accept his children without hesitation if they were gay.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says things that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t embarrassing, that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sensational, that seem too reasonable to be from a Republican\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jonathan Earle, 28, adding a bit of praise that Mr. Kasich might not welcome in a primary: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most appealing to a Democrat.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBROOKLYN \u2014 When the bar\u2019s projector screen suddenly went dark, several attendees made do, crowding around a small corner television. Others, too far away to hear the audio, mimicked the hand gestures of the man on screen, Donald J. Trump, pursing their lips in one of his signature expressions.Dozens roared in apparent approval of Mr. Trump\u2019s bar-imposed silence, as the staff worked feverishly to restore the main visual.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could only read his lips,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Don Lilly, 26.SIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 When Gov. John Kasich of Ohio finished a passionate answer on gay marriage, saying he would love his daughters unconditionally if they were gay \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a lesson imbued by his faith \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Norma Adema, 68, nodded in approval.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was a good answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.Senator Marco Rubio stressed the importance of repealing the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that President Obama signed into law in 2010, arguing that it had \u00e2\u0080\u009cwiped out\u00e2\u0080\u009d a staggering number of small businesses. more While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that surveys of small banks show that their managers believe Dodd-Frank has had a punishing effect on their business, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear that this is actually the case. The Dodd-Frank bill went out of its way to exempt small community banks from many of the regulations it gave rise to.SIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 Voters here have met most of the candidates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often at least twice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and some of tonight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lines rang, well, familiar. Pointing to Gov. Scott Walker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anecdote about tying yellow ribbons around trees in honor of the Iran hostages, Suzan Stewart, 63, a lawyer, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard him say that three times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it when they just repeat their stump speech,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty jaded out here. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen all the people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBROOKLYN \u2014 Robert Carroll, 28, likened Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign to a Republican version of the movie \u00e2\u0080\u009cBulworth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d about a staggeringly blunt politician.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of great comedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chelsea Davis, 28, said of the debate.Nadya Stevens, 32, who works for a local labor union, visibly shuddered as Mr. Trump set off on a monologue about his real estate past. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying that he should control the finances of the entire country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00a0Jeb Bush accused the political left of accepting 2 percent annual economic growth as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe new normal.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn fact, many Democrats have argued for making faster economic growth a top priority. In her campaign launch speech, for example, Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiddle class needs more growth and more fairness.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFirst of all, these lenders aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re living in a world of the make-believe.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald J. Trump, on lenders who lost money on him Mr. Trump has gotten a disproportionate amount of time to speak, in part because moderators have tried repeatedly to get him to answer questions directly and because he has interrupted moderators before the questions were finished.Gov. John Kasich of Ohio suggested that the best way to deal with inequality is to focus first on increasing economic growth, then to use the gains from that growth to boost workers at the bottom. more In fact, recent research, most prominently from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, suggests that this ordering may be backward. It turns out that high income inequality slows growth, so in order to boost growth, the government might first need to focus on reducing inequality. BROOKLYN \u2014 As Jeb Bush appeared again on-screen, two viewers teamed up for a bit of simple arithmetic.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many years would it be total if Jeb Bush served two terms?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Theo Moore, 33, of the New Kings Democrats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like 20 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of Bush,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a peer, Robert Carroll, 28.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a fatigue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Carroll said moments later. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same fatigue people worry about with Hillary Clinton.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe claim, however, left out the reality that his opposition came well after the war was already underway. The war began in March 2003.It was that next year that Mr. Trump spoke against the war, in interviews with Esquire and Larry King. \u201cI do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we\u2019ll be getting out,\u201d Trump said on \u201cLarry King Live\u201d in November 2004.Still, the antiwar sentiment did not stop Mr. Trump from supporting George W. Bush during his 2004 re-election. He spoke of that support, in light of the Iraq war, during an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly.\u201cI voted for Bush because I think he\u2019s got certain things that are excellent, including a tax policy that\u2019s excellent and going to prove to be excellent,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut I am not a big fan of the war in Iraq, and I\u2019ve let a lot of people know about it, and perhaps that\u2019s being proven to be correct.\u201dSIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 During the commercial break, guests used the time to restock on homemade brownies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and take stock of the field. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like what Governor Kasich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach has been.

Typically, one would do that by going after the candidates at the head of the pack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Donald J. Trump or Jeb Bush. Mr. Christie decided to go after Rand Paul, attacking him for his opposition to national antiterrorism surveillance policies. On one hand, that allows the New Jersey governor to invoke the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the threat of terrorism and portray Mr. Paul as being out of the Republican mainstream on these issues. But Mr. Christie sure walked into it as Mr. Paul tied him to President Obama on this issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 quickly invoking Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hug with the president during the final weeks of the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mr. Obama went to New Jersey in the midst of Hurricane Sandy.BROOKLYN \u2014 After harboring some concern that the moderators for Fox News might go easy on the candidates, left-leaning attendees were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the questions, at least some of the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought that this was going to be the Donald Trump show, and it was just going to be focusing on Clinton and Obama,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sara Shoener, 33, as Jeb Bush fielded a question on the Common Core educational standards. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty illuminating.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile several of the candidates made repeated jabs at President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rand Paul also engaged in back-and-forth exchanges with Gov.

Trump made two other claims in his answer on immigration: 1) that immigration was \u201cnot on anybody\u2019s mind\u201d until he made controversial comments about Mexican immigrants, and 2) that there have been \u201cmany killings, murders\u201d by illegal immigrants. more The first claim seems hard to back up. Immigration has been a frequent topic in Washington for the past seven years as President Obama fought for a comprehensive overhaul and later issued broad executive actions. Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, the topic of immigration has been a subject of much political commentary.Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of \u201cmany killings, murders\u201d was not very specific, but at least one organization, the American Immigration Council, says that immigrants are \u201cless likely to be criminals than native-born Americans.\u201dA report the organization released last month noted that the foreign-born share of the population in the United States grew to 13.1 percent from 7.9 percent between 1990 and 2013. In the same period, crime rates reported by the F.B.I. declined 48 percent, the group said.SIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 Upon hearing Donald J.

{"Headline": "After Protests for Racial Justice, Activists Ask: What Next?", "Date": "2015-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFERGUSON, Mo. \u2014 Leaning on a chain-link fence, Charles Mayo surveyed what was transpiring before him with a heavy dose of skepticism.A crowd of several dozen decided to take an on-again, off-again demonstration into the street last Tuesday night. Wandering into the middle of West Florissant Avenue, Mr. Mayo said, would bring the police, which would bring confrontation, which would generate Twitter posts, which would attract more of a crowd. Sure enough, droves of officers in riot gear quickly marched in, a tense shouting and shoving match ensued, and Mr. Mayo, 45, raced to the front of the crowd to try to talk down both the police and the demonstrators.\u201cI\u2019m for defusing the situation,\u201d he said.Mr. Mayo has been a regular on these streets since the shooting death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old, by a white officer in Ferguson last year sparked a fierce national debate over race and policing. But Mr. Mayo has been pondering a vital question: Is protest enough?As the streets here have largely cleared a week after hundreds gathered to commemorate the first anniversary of Mr. Brown\u2019s death and the nationwide movement it spurred, people inside and outside the protest community were calculating what comes next. For all its success in raising national awareness about police shootings, the movement remains diffuse in goals and structure, making it difficult to coalesce around a concrete agenda and strategy to achieve change, activists said.What started as a call for justice for Mr. Brown has morphed into a tapestry of organizations with a range of demands \u2014 police body cameras, better officer training, more job opportunities for low-income blacks, prison reform, an end to urban violence. Even when they are sympathetic to one another\u2019s causes, they do not necessarily speak with one voice.And their strategies have varied. For some, street protests organized through social media remain the most effective approach. Others have called for economic boycotts. Still others want to turn to political activism and the voting booth.\u201cI\u2019ve seen more dialogue, but I\u2019ve not seen the institutional change in Ferguson,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, 60, who himself has been criticized by some younger activists as being out of touch. Protest leaders, he added, must prove they are building \u201ca longstanding, permanent movement.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see who has the depth and who is temporary,\u201d he said.The occasional tussles between the police and demonstrators last week in and around Ferguson, and the spasms of gunfire on the fringes of the demonstrations, raised another question for the activists: How does violence affect the movement?To many protesters, those outbursts of violence \u2014 not to mention the rioting and looting from a year ago \u2014 were manifestations of the anger festering among the poor and thus helped dramatize the need for change. But those raw emotions, some say, have also distracted from the peaceful campaign for change and caused it to lose supporters.In a sign of the search for coordination and perhaps more permanent roots, about 1,500 activists from almost every state and several countries gathered in Cleveland last month for strategy sessions and an inward look at the Black Lives Matter movement, which has been notable for its decentralized leadership model.\u201cWe weren\u2019t just talking tactics and eradicating police violence,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, 36, a New York activist who helped to organize the event, \u201cbut also, \u2018What is the vision for the world we want?\u2019\u00a0\u201dJonathan Pulphus, 20, a St. Louis activist who helped to start a group called Tribe X, said the conference was a chance for activists to \u201cget on the same plane\u201d ideologically and to discuss real differences in priorities and problems from one city to another. Tribe X, which organizes around urban poverty and violence in addition to police shootings, has helped organize protests around St. Louis over the past year.\u201cWe recognize what may work in Ferguson may not work in Baltimore,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say: \u2018Should you focus on police brutality? Or should you try to bring the conversation to things like voting, things like grocery stores and access to quality food?\u2019 Pretty much, people agreed that these are all issues that are all interconnected.\u201dMr. Mayo, a floor technician who lives in nearby Jennings, said protesters had done a great job of spurring a national conversation and bringing awareness to the issues facing many blacks, particularly police violence. But protests without clear goals have their limits, he said.\u201cIt just can\u2019t be marching and chanting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m for protest, but I\u2019m for active protest. I need to see something done.\u201dRather than simply shutting down Interstate 70 in suburban St. Louis, as protesters did last week, Mr. Mayo said, the demonstrators might have achieved more by taking petitions to elected officials in the state capital and Washington. He also suggested boycotting businesses to push them to support minority hiring, among other demands.For Anthony Shahid, 60, a local activist, change starts with the economy. Improving access to jobs for blacks would go a long way toward preventing unrest, he said. Getting there could require major policy changes, like expunging criminal records so ex-convicts can be hired, he said.Change would come through economic pressure, Mr. Shahid asserted. He said he would call for four and a half days of civil disobedience this week, including blocking highways, boycotting businesses and picketing at local convention and visitors\u2019 centers. If conditions do not improve for young men in inner-city communities, he said, unrest will continue.\u201cThe most dangerous man in the world is the man who doesn\u2019t have nothing to lose,\u201d he said.Such unrest marred peaceful demonstrations last Sunday night when, the police said, rival groups hanging out near protesters began shooting at each other. The ensuing fracas reportedly led several plainclothes detectives to shoot and wound Tyrone Harris Jr., 18, who the police said had fired at them.While the shooting might undermine support for change, Mr. Shahid said, it might also help keep the public\u2019s attention focused on the problems of poor minority communities in cities like Ferguson. Instead of criticizing the young people accused of looting and setting fires during the unrest over Mr. Brown\u2019s killing, Mr. Shahid said, older activists should put them at the fore of the movement and help them channel their aggression.Many activists believe they already have effected meaningful change.Ashley Yates, 30, emerged as a protest leader last year in St. Louis and has since moved to Oakland, Calif., to continue her activism. She said she saw her role as \u201cculture shaping.\u201d\u201cPeople are now questioning police narratives more,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tentative Greek Debt Accord Might Do Little to Revive Economy", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The Greek government on Tuesday appeared to be on the verge of clinching a deal for a new international bailout worth as much as $95 billion in exchange for accepting harsh austerity terms and making sweeping changes to the way the country does business.European officials on Tuesday cautioned that approval of the accord was far from certain. And Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in a phone call that Berlin was skeptical about the deal, saying talks should continue \u201cfor a few weeks,\u201d according to a Greek government official.The deal in its current form offers no relief on Greece\u2019s staggering debt, which now exceeds \u20ac315 billion, or $345 billion, despite insistence by International Monetary Fund and Greek officials that an easing of that burden be part of any package. And the uncertainties surrounding months of bailout negotiations have further damaged the Greek economy, potentially making an eventual recovery more difficult than ever.While Greek officials were quick to announce early Tuesday that an agreement worth up to \u20ac86 billion had been reached after a 20-hour negotiating session in an Athens hotel, European officials said that a final accord had not yet been achieved.\u201cWhat we have is a technical-level agreement,\u201d Annika Breidthardt, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told a daily news conference on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have at the moment is a political agreement.\u201dMs. Breidthardt said that the deal was worked out by representatives of the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the I.M.F. and the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.It was unclear whether all members of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza party would support the bailout plan as it moved to Parliament for a vote this week. As it is, Mr. Tsipras has hinted that he may call new elections as soon as next month, a move that could usher in another period of instability.Any deal also needs approval from other European countries, in some cases requiring a vote by national parliaments, most notably that of Germany. The deadline is Aug. 20, when Greece needs help to make a crucial \u20ac3.2 billion payment to the European Central Bank. It remained unclear late Tuesday whether the draft accord will satisfy Germany, which several weeks ago exhorted Greece to get a deal done or risk crashing out of the euro currency union.The German government has said numerous times since then that it would prefer to arrange a short-term loan to let Greece avoid defaulting on that payment to the European Central Bank, rather than rush through an agreement that might not prove to be durable.At issue is whether Greece will stick to pledges to make fundamental economic changes that creditors say are needed to revive the depleted economy, including cracking down on corruption and improving tax collection. In the last few weeks, the Greek Parliament has passed more than 900 pages\u2019 worth of new laws, containing measures like tax increases and further cuts to state spending on pensions, steps that creditors had demanded to begin discussions on the new bailout plan. Some of the measures had been promised but not put into effect by previous Greek governments.In telephone conversations Monday and Tuesday, Mrs. Merkel told Mr. Tsipras that Germany would prefer to grant the short-term loan rather than hurry to seek approval for the broader bailout package, according to a Greek official with knowledge of the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWhy are you rushing?\u201d Mrs. Merkel asked Mr. Tsipras, according to the official. Mr. Tsipras responded that talks between Greece and creditors were proceeding on the basis of the agreement struck by eurozone leaders on July 13, when both sides agreed to begin talks on a third loan program.A spokesman for the German government confirmed that the first call had taken place but would not discuss the content. He was unable to be reached about the second call.In a sign that other European officials were pushing back against Germany, a prominent European lawmaker late Tuesday urged Mrs. Merkel not to use \u201cdiversional tactics\u201d to derail a deal, saying the accord reached between Greece and its creditors should be good enough for Berlin, too.\u201cWe ask the chancellor to keep the commitment taken at the last European Council and not to bring to the table further conditions, like the full involvement of the International Monetary Fund,\u201d said Gianni Pittella, the president of the Socialists and Democrats group at the European Parliament.Mr. Tsipras had also spoken by phone on Monday with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and the European Commission president, Claude Juncker, among others, according to the Greek official. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Juncker were \u201cvery positive\u201d about the prospective agreement, the official said.Still unknown is whether the board of the I.M.F. will approve the draft agreement. In recent months, the fund and its managing director, Christine Lagarde, have indicated they will not participate in a new bailout that does not include somehow relieving Greece\u2019s debt burden, on the assumption that otherwise Athens will never be able to repay its loans.The I.M.F. had no immediate comment on Tuesday, but indicated its position had not changed.The draft agreement reflects the damaging dynamic that this year has gripped the Greek economy, which in 2014 had begun to recover from a nearly five-year recession.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.\u201cThe good news is that Greece has given up its confrontational strategy and seems to be willing to collaborate with its creditors to avoid \u2018Grexit,\u2019\u201d Peter Vanden Houte, an analyst at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. He was alluding to the prospect that Greece might be forced to leave the euro currency union if no agreement could be reached. \u201cHowever,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe economic situation has strongly deteriorated over the last eight months.\u201dAthens did apparently win at least one major concession that Mr. Tsipras had been seeking since he rode to power on pledges to repeal austerity. Creditors agreed to reduce the amount of money that Greece is required to set aside in its coffers, the so-called primary surplus, which is cash left over before debt and interest payments.Greece has long argued that the creditors\u2019 insistence that Athens hold a large surplus was keeping money from being invested in the economy. According to the draft, Greece will be allowed this year to run a primary deficit of 0.25 percent of gross domestic product, in contrast to the 3 percent surplus that the creditors had demanded in an earlier bailout proposal.The deal would allow Greece\u2019s teetering banks to be shored up until end of this year with \u20ac10 billion in new capital. That means there is \u201cno longer any risk whatsoever\u201d that the Greek government might need to confiscate money in savers\u2019 accounts, the Greek official said, addressing a widespread fear that had gripped the country just a few weeks ago.Under the draft accord, Greece agreed to follow through on promises, including some that previous governments had pledged to undertake \u2014 but had not put in place \u2014 as conditions for receiving two earlier bailouts, totaling \u20ac240 billion.The so-called prior actions that Greece must legislate, according to the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini, include ending fuel subsidies for Greek farmers, opening all professions that are closed to competition, deregulating the energy and natural gas market, and proceeding with the privatization of major national assets like seaports, airports and the railway.But a European official with knowledge of the discussions, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said the unresolved issues included a disagreement over how to handle consumer insolvencies. Greek banks have been struggling with increasing numbers of problem loans, which amount to more than a third of all outstanding bank loans. Creditors have been pushing for changes to Greek law that would make it easier for banks to foreclose on borrowers who are unable to repay their loans.The Greek government would not agree to demands by the creditors for legislation that would allow bundles of problem loans to be sold on the open market to investors who would then have the right to pursue repayment.The investment companies try to collect what they can from borrowers or, in some cases, repossess homes and other property. The government wants to preserve, at least through the end of this year, a law that prevents banks from foreclosing on a borrower\u2019s primary residence.The spending discipline required of Greece will be \u201cquite a challenge in a country that is tired of austerity,\u201d said Mr. Vanden Houte, the analyst. \u201cAnd the complete structural overhaul of the Greek economy the creditors are imposing seems a herculean task.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a conference call to discuss Greece on Tuesday. Officials from the finance ministries of European Union members were to participate, not officials with the European Union Finance Ministry.

{"Headline": "Fed Minutes Show Caution in Discussion on Rates", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials are struggling to get comfortable with the persistent sluggishness of price inflation as they move toward raising interest rates later this year.Several analysts said the uncertain tone of the minutes suggested the Fed was somewhat less likely to start raising rates at its next meeting, in mid-September. Investors, too, reduced their bets on a September liftoff, as reflected in the prices of financial assets tied to interest rates.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 2.129 percent on Wednesday as investors bet rates would remain a little lower a little longer. Stock indexes recovered from their lows for the day after the 2 p.m. release of the minutes before falling back again. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at 2,079.61, down 0.83 percent.\u201cThe bet is still that they achieve liftoff in September,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, wrote in an analysis after the Fed distributed its latest bag of tea leaves. \u201cHowever, Fed officials need to telegraph that soon if they actually intend to do so.\u201dThe Fed has held its benchmark rate near zero since December 2008 as the centerpiece of its campaign to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, has said the Fed plans to wind down that campaign by gradually raising rates back toward a more normal level, starting later this year and continuing for the next few years.The minutes said most of the meeting\u2019s 17 participants \u201cjudged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.\u201dThe Fed did not clarify how soon it planned to complete the journey.Kenneth J. Taubes, chief investment officer at Pioneer Investments in Boston, said that he was not concerned about the exact timing, but would not mind getting it over with. Noting that equity markets stopped climbing about eight months ago, he said that markets seemed to be waiting for the Fed.Some investors fear that disruptions will intensify when the Fed finally pulls the trigger, but Mr. Taubes said he has a more optimistic view. He said any short-term disruptions were likely to fade as investors recognized that the Fed was still holding rates at unusually low levels, maintaining a significant degree of stimulus.\u201cIf anything,\u201d Mr. Taubes said, \u201cit might be a buying opportunity.\u201dFed officials, in the minutes and in recent public statements, have sounded increasingly convinced that the central bank is approaching the limit of its ability to improve labor market conditions. The share of Americans with jobs remains much lower than before the recession, and wage growth has been slow despite the fact the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.3 percent as of July. Historically, the Fed has been reluctant to let the jobless rate fall too much lower than that, fearing it will unleash faster inflation by doing so.\u201cMany members thought that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated in the near term if economic activity evolved as they expected,\u201d the minutes said, describing the view that the unemployment rate is nearing the lowest level consistent with stable inflation.The Fed\u2019s standard view, widely shared by outside economists, is that tighter labor market conditions will contribute to faster inflation as workers are able to extract larger wage increases. Last September, the Fed predicted that prices would rise between 1.6 and 1.9 percent in 2015.But that has not happened yet. The Fed\u2019s most recent forecast, in June, predicted inflation this year of 0.6 to 0.8 percent. The minutes also noted that Fed officials still did not see clear evidence of faster wage growth, despite glimmers in recent data. And, the account said, the Fed staff had once again reduced its own separate forecast of likely inflation over the next several years.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Fed officials continue to predict inflation will increase in the coming months, and the latest data provided some support for that view. Prices excluding food and energy rose 1.8 percent over the last year, and the Fed regards that measure as a better predictor of future inflation.A minority of Fed officials argues that the central bank should wait to raise rates until prices are rising more rapidly, a position the International Monetary Fund has repeatedly endorsed. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, suggested in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the Fed should be expanding its stimulus campaign.That view, however, has gained little traction in an internal debate that is mostly about when, not whether, to raise rates.By contrast, some officials said the economy\u2019s cumulative progress since the Great Recession is now sufficient that the decision to start raising interest rates should not turn on the latest batch of economic data.The minutes laid out another argument for moving sooner rather than later: \u201cA prompt start to normalization would likely convey the committee\u2019s confidence in prospects for the economy.\u201dOf course, Fed officials first must decide that they are confident.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Venezuela to Iraq to Russia, Oil Price Drops Raise Fears of Unrest", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil, the lifeblood of many countries that produce and sell it, appears to be rapidly turning into an ever-cheaper economic curse.Even in wealthy Saudi Arabia, where the ruling family spends oil money lavishly to preserve its legitimacy, the government has been burning through roughly $10 billion a month in foreign exchange holdings to help pay expenses, and it is borrowing in the financial markets for the first time since 2007. Other Arab countries in the Persian Gulf that are dependent on oil exports, including Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain, are facing fiscal deficits for the first time in two decades.While the price has been declining for months, forecasts have always been hedged with the assumption that oil would eventually stabilize or at least not stay low for long. But new anxieties about frailties in China, the world\u2019s most voracious consumer of energy, have raised fears that the price of oil, now 30 percent lower than it was just a few months ago, could remain depressed far longer than even the most pessimistic projections, and do even deeper damage to oil exporters.\u201cThe pain is very hard for these countries,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 G. Ortiz, former secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and former energy minister of Ecuador. \u201cThese countries dreamed that these low prices would be very temporary.\u201dMr. Ortiz estimated that all major oil exporting countries had lost a total of $1 trillion in oil sales because of the price decline over the last year.\u201cAn awful lot of producers who enjoyed good times were more dependent on Chinese economic growth than they recognized,\u201d Mr. Yergin said. \u201cThis is an oil shock.\u201dAlthough the price drop has most directly hurt oil exporters, it also may signal a new period of global economic fragility that could hurt all countries \u2014 an anxiety that already has been evident in the gyrating stock markets.The price drop also has become an indirect element in the course of Syria\u2019s civil war and other points of global tension. Countries that once could use their oil wealth as leverage, like Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, may no longer have as much influence, some political analysts said. Iran, which once asserted it could withstand the antinuclear embargo of its oil by the West, appeared to have rethought that calculation in reaching an agreement on its nuclear activities last month.Of course, lower oil prices confer economic benefits, too. The average American household, for instance, buys 1,200 gallons of gasoline every year. And gasoline, on average, has sold for most of this year by roughly a dollar a gallon less than in 2014. But even while lower oil prices stimulate economies of consuming countries, a protracted decline carries many unanticipated consequences \u2014 starting with the economic weakness in developing countries that buy increasing amounts of goods from the United States and others in the industrialized world.A supply glut has been evident for some time, driven partly by a vast increase in Saudi production and a growing energy self-sufficiency in the United States, which was once heavily reliant on Middle East oil.Saudi Arabia not only is producing a record amount, but also is increasing the number of rigs drilling for future production. And its Gulf allies, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, are following suit. Even with the turmoil wrought by the Islamic State, Iraq\u2019s production has jumped nearly 20 percent since the beginning of the year.The surge in production may seem counterintuitive, since lower prices can cause self-inflicted economic wounds and potentially incite more political and social trouble. But all the exporters in the Middle East are struggling with each other to protect Asian markets, now that the United States is using much less of their oil.Had these producers curtailed their production late last year, he said, \u201ca flood of new oil supplies from the U.S., Canada, the deep offshore and other basins would have continued to undermine the oil markets, and prices would have collapsed to where they are now in any case.\u201dThe global glut is likely to worsen if the nuclear deal with Iran is approved, potentially releasing as much as one million more barrels onto the 94-million-barrel-a-day global market in a year or so.Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, has made no secret about his country\u2019s intentions. \u201cWe will be raising our oil production at any cost, and we have no other alternative,\u201d he was quoted Sunday in Iran\u2019s state-run news media as saying.The big change in recent years has been the surge of United States oil production, adding more than four million barrels a day to global supplies. But in recent months the oversupply has been driven primarily by the Saudis, who have flooded the market in what economists regard as a deliberate attempt to drive down the price so that other high-cost producers can no longer compete \u2014 most notably the Americans.Still, production in the United States has not declined as much as foreseen by the Saudis, who thought the price of oil would stabilize at about $50 a barrel. Now it may be headed to $30, the lowest level since the 2008 global economic recession.The Saudis, the most important member of OPEC, have resisted calls by other members to reduce output. The result is that nearly all OPEC members, who together control much less of the global market than they once did, are pumping more oil.\u201cThe hemorrhaging of government budgets reliant on oil will force dramatic cuts in spending or dangerous increases in borrowing, if not both,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said. \u201cThe countries without significant foreign exchange reserves are most at risk, and they include Nigeria, Angola, Algeria, Venezuela and Iraq. The countries which need to sustain investment to maintain political legitimacy need to be worried, and that\u2019s Brazil, Russia and even Iran.\u201d\u201cNot only is fighting ISIS an expensive endeavor, but many of the political deals that need to be done to keep different groups supportive of the Iraqi government require money to sustain,\u201d she said.But Ms. O\u2019Sullivan expressed a longer-term worry about possible miscalculations by Saudi Arabia, on both the duration and magnitude of the oil price drop.\u201cWith a burgeoning population looking for jobs, education and health care every day,\u201d she said, \u201cthe expensive social contract between the royal family and Saudi citizens will get more difficult, and eventually impossible, to sustain if oil prices do not recover.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nationally, enrollment in teacher preparation programs dropped by 30 percent between 2010 and 2014, as Rich reported.How do we make teaching more rewarding, so that it beckons to not only enough college graduates but to a robust share of the very best of them?There\u2019s also the issue of autonomy.Others focus on primarily letting teachers chart the day-by-day path to the goals laid out for them, so that they\u2019re not just obedient vessels for a one-size-fits-all script.

{"Headline": "Bank of America Starts to Pull Clients\u2019 Money Out of a Paulson Fund", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bank told its financial advisers on Tuesday that it had submitted a full redemption request for client money in Paulson\u2019s Advantage fund. The bank has also closed another Paulson fund, the Special Situations fund, to new client money and put it under review, citing concerns \u201cregarding significant concentration in illiquid investments, as well as heightened volatility and risk profile for the funds,\u201d according to a document that was sent to advisers and was reviewed by The New York Times.The move by the bank was based on months of discussions and related to multiple factors, according to one person knowledgeable about the bank\u2019s thinking, who spoke on condition of anonymity.A spokesman for Paulson & Company declined to comment.Some of Mr. Paulson\u2019s biggest bets have turned sour this year. He is one of a handful of bold hedge fund managers who poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Greece, wagering that its economy would recover after years of crisis. Mr. Paulson is also one of Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest hedge fund investors, betting that the commonwealth will emerge from its debt crisis. Many analysts say that prognosis looks increasingly tenuous this week after Puerto Rico\u2019s first bond default.Investors in the Special Situations fund have seen particularly wide swings, in part because of its exposure to Greece. The fund, which was set up in 2008 to make bets on a recovery in the United States and is now focused on Europe, has lost 3.8 percent this year through June. The fund is the second-biggest shareholder after the government in Greece\u2019s largest bank, Piraeus Bank Group. It also bought a 10 percent equity stake in the Athens water monopoly, Athens Water Supply and Sewage, in 2014 for $137 million. At the time, the company had little debt and investors expected it to be privatized. Today, it has yet to be privatized and is unable to collect payments on its bills.At the end of June, the Greek government announced that it would close all Greek financial institutions in an effort to stop their collapse, as the country teetered on the brink of financial ruin. It also closed the Athens stock exchange.When the stock exchange opened on Monday after a five-week shutdown, shares of some of Greece\u2019s biggest companies plummeted. The banks were particularly hard hit.The Advantage fund, which has $2.5 billion of investor money, makes bets on mergers and acquisitions and buys debt in bankrupt companies, holding the investments until they are converted into equity. Once this year, two positions in the fund grew to 40 percent of the entire fund, causing some investors to worry about the risks of such concentration.Bank of America client money in Paulson\u2019s Advantage fund will be returned to investors by the beginning of October, according to the letter sent internally to Bank of America financial advisers. Through June, the fund returned 2.2 percent for investors.\u201cAs part of our commitment to our clients, we provide rigorous initial due diligence and ongoing detailed analysis of all funds on our platform, and remain in constant dialogue with fund managers regarding changes to the funds or their management,\u201d Julia Ehrenfeld, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said.The bank\u2019s financial advisers are in discussions with clients to determine if a replacement investment in another Paulson fund would be appropriate, said one person with knowledge of the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Client money remains in two other funds, one focused on gold and another on mergers and acquisitions bets.Bank of America advised its clients to consider investing in one of Mr. Paulson\u2019s merger funds or another hedge fund, York Capital Management, if they were not comfortable with Mr. Paulson\u2019s risk profile, documents sent to the bank\u2019s advisers said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain and France Point Fingers as Migrant Crisis Becomes a Political One", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 More than 4,500 vehicles are stuck along one of Britain\u2019s main highways, caught in the chaos over efforts by desperate migrants to make their way through the Channel Tunnel from the French port city of Calais, 31 miles away. Another 4,500 cars and trucks are stuck on the other side of the English Channel.Food is rotting, drivers are exasperated and commerce is delayed. Would-be vacationers bound for the Continent are furious, and the British news media is on a rampage, with The Daily Mail wondering how migrants could invade Britain when Hitler could not and calling for the army to be deployed.Under pressure to show that the government is in control, Mr. Cameron emerged on Friday to promise more high-tech security fencing and sniffer dogs for the French and the use of Defense Ministry land in Kent to park some of the waiting trucks, to get them off the highway.\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely on it,\u201d he said, but then conceded, \u201cThis is going to be a difficult issue right across the summer.\u201dThe British are blaming the French, the French are blaming the British, and both are blaming the European Union for an incoherent policy toward the thousands of people, many of them fleeing political horrors at home, who are trying to find jobs and a better future for themselves and their families in Europe.The migrant crisis in Calais is hardly new, going back more than 15 years, but numbers are increasing, tactics are shifting and the political heat is rising.The migrants, most of them from Libya, Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan, are finding new strategies to exhaust the French police, cut through fencing, stow away on trucks and try to get to Britain through the Channel tunnel. In the nightly game of attack and run, chase and release, traffic through the tunnel has been badly disrupted, and at least nine migrants have died in their attempts since June.Some estimates are that the mess is costing the British economy 250 million pounds, or about $390 million, a day, while local governments in southern England are struggling to cope with at least a doubling of illegal migrants, who must be housed and fed, especially those who are minors.Paul Carter, leader of the County Council in Kent, the county that is home to the British entrance to the tunnel, said the number of migrants under 18 in his care has doubled to 605 in the last three months, leaving the county a multimillion-pound funding gap, and, he told the BBC, \u201crising day by day, week by week.\u201dThat burden, as well as dealing with the increased security for tunnel traffic and huge delays on the main highway leading to and from the tunnel, was having a major impact that the central government in London has only begun to consider, he said.Bernie Gibson, managing director of Compass Fostering, which finds foster homes for illegal minor migrants, mostly male and many with little English, said finding \u201cfoster carers nationally for Compass is challenging anyway, but imagine on top of that these children are very traumatized, they don\u2019t speak English, and often they come from very different cultural experiences.\u201dIn fact the numbers of migrants in Britain illegally are relatively small compared with other European countries, in part because Britain is so hard to enter. And more than 80 percent of them are people who have entered legally but overstayed their visas, said Franck D\u00fcvell of the Center on Migration, Policy and Society at Oxford University.\u201cThe anxiety about irregular entry remains disproportionate,\u201d he said.Peter Sutherland, a former European Union commissioner and now the United Nations special representative for international migration, said that the British reaction is \u201cgrossly excessive in terms of Calais,\u201d characterizing the calls to stop economic migrants \u201ca xenophobic response to the issue of free movement.\u201dHe said Britain receives far fewer asylum applications than some other European countries, around 25,000 last year compared with 175,000 in Germany. Sweden, France and Italy also received more asylum claims than Britain did. At the same time, a country like Turkey is coping relatively quietly with more than 1.7 million registered refugees from Syria, and Jordan is coping with more than 800,000 refugees, according to the United Nations.By contrast in Calais, Mr. Sutherland said, there are \u201ca relatively small number in the context of what other countries are having to do \u2014 who are in terrible conditions and have to be dealt with by France and/or Britain.\u201dThe number of asylum applications increased 5 percent in the year ending in March, the Home Office said, but remained less than a third of the peak number in 2002.Britain\u2019s total illegal population is thought to be less than one million, but a Home Office spokeswoman said that last year alone border officials intercepted 39,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally, and that the numbers have risen considerably in the last month.According to the National Crime Agency, the number of illegal immigrants actually caught trying to enter Britain more than doubled last year, with a 300 percent rise in the numbers coming from North Africa, especially Libya, through Italy.The problem, analysts all agree, is Europe-wide, with increased instability throughout North Africa and the Middle East stemming from the Libyan and Syrian civil wars but encompassing chaotic, repressive or failing regimes in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan and Kosovo.The 28 member states of the European Union received 570,800 claims for asylum in 2014, up 44 percent from the year before, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, with Germany and Sweden alone accounting for 43 percent of those claims.But there is no unified immigration or asylum system and only a voluntary willingness, after a major fight among European Union countries, to sharing even 40,000 refugees.Mr. Cameron has been accused of insensitivity by highlighting the problems posed to \u201choliday makers\u201d and referring to \u201cswarms\u201d of migrants, a term that critics said dehumanized people trying to get to a better life. Yvette Cooper, a leadership candidate for the Labour Party, criticized Mr. Cameron for playing politics and said that \u201conly serious Europe-wide and international intervention\u201d will \u201cget to grips with this problem.\u201dAn open fight with France over a few thousand migrants would not be helpful, and Mr. Hollande, too, wants an end to the trouble that is damaging his own fragile economy.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Most Likely to Succeed,\u2019 by Tony Wagner and Ted Dintersmith", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere, then, is yet another book about success. This time it\u2019s not grit that helps children succeed. Nor is it having a Tiger Mom or letting children walk home alone or allowing them to skin their knees or teaching them Arabic or Mandarin. It\u2019s not about supporting their spiritual development or eliminating the gluten in their diets or teaching them about white privilege or the importance of team sports. No, this new tract aimed at the heart of parental anxiety \u2014 \u201cMost Likely to Succeed: Preparing Our Kids for the Innovation Era,\u201d by Tony Wagner and Ted Dintersmith \u2014 argues that the only way to ensure any kind of future security for our children is to totally upend the education system and rethink what school is for. \u201cDisrupt\u201d is a buzz word these tech-world gurus use sparingly, but that\u2019s what they mean. Wagner works at Harvard\u2019s Innovation Lab, Dintersmith in venture capital, funding education and tech start-ups. Both appear frequently on the lecture circuit; you can almost see the \u00adPowerPoint peeking out from beneath their prose. Their argument is this: Public education in America is based on antiquated late-19th-century priorities, on the need \u201cto educate large numbers of immigrants and refugees from farms for basic citizenship and for jobs in a growing industrial economy.\u201d Most of the stuff children are forced to know, and on which our culture\u2019s sense of achievement is based, is unnecessary in the age of Google. But tests and test-makers still run the show, and kids are required to \u201cjump through hoops\u201d and drill and drill to assimilate reams of facts (\u201ccontent\u201d) instead of learning the skills that will keep them employed and employable for years to come \u2014 which is to say, the skills to be entrepreneurs. After the revolution Wagner and Dintersmith imagine, college will no longer be a scandalously expensive universal requirement but an option for only the most academically minded. They propose an overhaul of the SAT scoring system in which adolescents would be sorted into categories of collegiate preparedness: \u201cIn Good Shape,\u201d \u201cIt Won\u2019t Be Easy\u201d and \u201cThink Different.\u201d Those in the last two categories might be satisfied, and indeed better served, in free or low-cost apprenticeships or by taking vocational courses. It\u2019s clear that American education overemphasizes test scores and grade-point averages at the expense of the deep curiosity and creativity that characterize real learning. Many of the disruptions the authors suggest \u2014 an interdisciplinary approach; hands-on, project-based learning; student-directed curriculums \u2014 are already in place in some of the country\u2019s best schools. Less convincing is the assumption that undergirds this whole tract: that every person can \u2014 or should \u2014 be molded into an entrepreneur. Is an entrepreneurial mind-set really the key to success? Will a culture that hyperventilates over self-made innovators who march, individually, to their own drums really fare any better than one that obsesses over test scores? Is it possible that the authors are just swapping one American dream fantasy for another, with version 2.0 represented not by the immigrant who works hard and stays in school and saves to send his kids to college but by Bill Gates and other Harvard dropouts who have found conventional education too constraining for their own freewheeling brilliance? The book is laced with real-life examples of these inspiring cases, including one that describes a young woman, Rebecca, who in high school ditched her A.P. classes in favor of a research project and then ditched Harvard to start her own company. \u201cIf we can reach kids earlier,\u201d Rebecca says, \u201cmaybe we could have hundreds of people who would try being entrepreneurs in their early 20s.\u201d The problem the authors identify is a real one, but no system works for everyone, and the value system underlying this manifesto presumes that Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Rebecca (or Wagner or Dintersmith, for that matter) are the ultimate exemplars of success. Which leaves whole classrooms full of gifted memorizers, not to mention regular humans who never aspired to be or ever will be a Bill Gates \u2014 which is to say, most of us \u2014 without a path to follow.MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEEDPreparing Our Kids for the Innovation EraBy Tony Wagner and Ted Dintersmith296 pp. Scribner. $27.Lisa Miller is a contributing editor at New York magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Ricans Brace for Crisis in Health Care", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThese are a cascade of cuts that will have disastrous, gigantic implications,\u201d said Dennis Rivera, the chairman of the Puerto Rico Healthcare Crisis Coalition, a group of doctors, hospitals, health care advocates, unions and insurance companies lobbying the Obama administration and Congress. \u201cHealth care in Puerto Rico is headed for a collapse.\u201dThree-quarters of the Medicare population on the island is enrolled in Advantage, and patients, many of them poor and chronically ill, worry about the impact of the cuts on costs and benefits.The cuts are expected to lead to higher co-pays for medication and hospitalization, among other things, said Dr. Richard Shinto, the president and chief executive of InnovaCare, an insurance company with three Advantage plans in Puerto Rico.\u201cThere will also be certain services we might have provided in the past that we can\u2019t now,\u201d Dr. Shinto said. Free rides to doctor\u2019s offices are an example.In addition, several hundred doctors are already losing their contracts with major managed care companies. InnovaCare has terminated 200 contracts, Dr. Shinto said.\u201cThat\u2019s one way on the island we are trying to manage the significant revenue reductions we\u2019re to have \u2014 narrow our network of physicians,\u201d he added.This is in part because of how doctors practice here; they tend to be in solo practices, making it difficult to meet all requirements. Lower funding levels also complicated efforts to meet standards.The island\u2019s Medicaid program \u2014 called Mi Salud, or My Health \u2014 serves nearly 1.6 million people, or 45 percent of the island\u2019s population, the largest share in the United States, and it is also struggling, said Ricardo Rivera, the executive director of the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, which carries out the Medicaid program.Health care makes up 20 percent of the Puerto Rican economy, which has been in a slow decline as manufacturing jobs have disappeared and the government has borrowed more than it could pay back. Because of the island\u2019s precarious finances, the Medicaid program lacks access to credit and is so short on cash that it owes providers $200 million, a figure it has whittled down from $350 million. It is also spending a one-time $6.4 billion federal grant at a much faster pace than expected, Mr. Rivera said.The Medicaid program, which relies on both federal and commonwealth funds, could run out of the grant money as early as the end of 2016, three years earlier than anticipated, Mr. Rivera said. This could mean that 900,000 people will have to be dropped from the program.A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency was aware of the growing concerns and was working weekly with a group of politicians, health care officials, advocates and insurance companies here to find solutions. So far, none have been offered.The reduction in Medicare Advantage funding is meant to bring federal payments for that program more in line with traditional Medicare fee-for-service rates in Puerto Rico. Advantage plans on the mainland have received cuts in recent years for the same reason, although generally not as big.But Puerto Rican officials and health care experts have long criticized the federal formula for calculating its fee-for-service rates as unfair, and point out that even the Virgin Islands, a much smaller commonwealth, gets considerably more money for Advantage.Puerto Rican lawmakers and doctors warn that it will be more expensive for the United States to ignore the problem for one reason: Those who need medical care can quickly settle with relatives on the mainland, where it is pricier.\u201cMy message to the federal government is simple: If you continue to treat Americans living in Puerto Rico poorly, they will exercise their rights and move to the U.S. mainland, where they will immediately be entitled to equal treatment,\u201d said Pedro R. Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives.\u201cIf the medical plan stops covering it or I lose the plan, I die,\u201d said Mr. De Hoyos, a former worker at a canned tuna factory. \u201cI am praying that God puts his hands into this.\u201dMr. De Hoyos typifies the health care challenges facing Puerto Rico, which has among the highest rates of diabetes and asthma in the United States. The same is true of Mayag\u00fcez, a city that once relied on manufacturing but now depends greatly on the health care industry.\u201cThere are health conditions on the island that are just mind-blowing,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tremendous burden of poor health, tremendous costs, a tremendously dependent population and a Medicaid program whose per-capita payment is a fraction of the U.S. per-capita rate.\u201dIn San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital, beds in hospital emergency rooms line the hallways. There are so few nurses that people often hire their own private nurses during hospital stays.Doctors, too, are preparing themselves.Dr. Luis R. Vicenty, 55, a longtime Mayag\u00fcez internist, recently received termination letters from two Advantage companies.Like many doctors from the island, a group that is well-trained, board-certified and bilingual, Dr. Vicenty received a job offer on the mainland, at a hospital in Washington State.The crush of doctors who have left has created a serious shortage of specialists. Most medical school graduates do not even bother looking for jobs here; almost none are available, and those on the mainland typically pay double.\u201cDoctors can leave,\u201d Dr. Vicenty said. \u201cSo this will get worse.\u201dEasy solutions to the health care crisis do not exist, mostly because it stems from the disparity in funding, something that only Congress can change. Mr. Pierluisi has introduced legislation to address some of the problems.Puerto Rico\u2019s health care woes began in 1968, when Congress placed a cap on Medicaid in the United States territories that sharply limited the federal government\u2019s contribution.For Medicaid, this means that Puerto Rico typically gets $373 million a year from the federal government and has to pick up the rest of the $2.5 billion tab, Mr. Rivera of the Puerto Rico Health Care Coalition said. Last year, Oklahoma, which is wealthier than Puerto Rico, received $3 billion from the federal government, according to data compiled by the coalition. Mississippi, also not as poor as the island, received $3.6 billion.A similar discrepancy exists with Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors are 40 percent lower than the mainland\u2019s, and the Medicare Advantage program is paid 60 percent of the average rate in the states, according to coalition data.Dr. Johnny Rull\u00e1n, a health care expert who was once head of the island\u2019s Health Department, said Puerto Rico was not asking for more. It was asking for equity.\u201cWe just need equal funding,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will take care of the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Board Ruling on Joint Employers Leaves Some Companies Scratching Their Heads", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision could threaten the business model of staffing agencies and other firms that provide their customers with temporary workers, business groups say.\u201cThis is very disturbing to many of our members,\u201d said Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cIf the ruling stands, it makes it likely that the reason to hire a subcontractor goes away. It takes away the financial advantages, and removes any regulatory or legal protections that a customer gets from hiring them.\u201dThat sent a chill through those in the temporary staffing industry. The labor board\u2019s ruling is a narrow one that would come into play only if workers provided by subcontractors seek union representation \u2014 something fairly few have done. But it potentially opens companies that use such workers to the kinds of employer responsibilities and liabilities that they have historically avoided by outsourcing their staffing.The labor board\u2019s action is in line with the view of the Obama administration that the rise of franchising, contracting and similar arrangements in recent decades has made it more likely that workers will be deprived of such protections as minimum wages, overtime pay and the right to unionize.\u201cA lot of our members there have complained to us that it\u2019s almost impossible for them to get contracts outside of Massachusetts,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other state will touch them. It points the way to what could happen here.\u201dOthers in the industry are taking a more cautious view of the ruling\u2019s implications. The American Staffing Association, a trade group, notes that the decision affects only workers who unionize \u2014 and it thinks few will do so.\u201cPrior board decisions that effectively made it easier for temporary workers to unionize did not demonstrably result in increased unionization,\u201d Stephen C. Dwyer, general counsel for the American Staffing Association, said in a statement. \u201cThat largely remains the case today.\u201dFranchised businesses like fast-food outlets, hair salons and automotive repair shops are run by independent owners who operate with varying degrees of autonomy from their parent brand. Those owners are concerned about the idea that the company that sold them the franchise might be considered a joint employer of the workers they view as being under their sole control.\u201cMy freedom and autonomy \u2014 the entire reason I wanted to own my own business \u2014 will vanish,\u201d he said.The vagueness of the labor board\u2019s ruling is the hardest part for franchise operators and owners, industry representatives say.The Browning-Ferris ruling does not go into detail about how the labor board expects it to affect franchises, and the board\u2019s decisions on McDonald\u2019s have not given the specifics lawyers would like, regarding what precise actions might result in a joint-employer ruling.Franchise owners and operators are struggling to figure out if the labor board will view them more as a McDonald\u2019s or as a Freshii.\u201cWe have people today who don\u2019t know if they are an employer or not,\u201d said Robert Cresanti, the executive vice president for government relations at the International Franchise Association. \u201cYou could pay 100 lawyers to sit for hours and opine, and they would only be guessing. There\u2019s no bright line any more.\u201dMore rulings, and court challenges to those rulings, will come next, but some franchise operators are already taking steps to insulate themselves.Franchisers that do not wish to be considered joint employers should focus on controlling their customer deliverables, but leave the specific processes for creating them \u2014 \u201cthe things that aren\u2019t part of what the customer sees\u201d \u2014 in the hands of their operators, he said.Mr. Seid and Mr. Gray say they expect the labor board\u2019s ruling to lead to years of litigation as companies try to clarify what has become a murky area of employment law.\u201cIt will probably end up at the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cThe sky is not falling, but it\u2019s certainly indicative of a change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We have lost a good fight.\u201dBut in an interview with Reuters later in the day, Mr. Rajapaksa stopped short of conceding, saying only that he was unlikely to lead Sri Lanka\u2019s next government. \u201cI will support good policies and oppose bad things,\u201d he said.His opponents refrained from claiming victory, and results were still being tallied Tuesday morning in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest city. Election officials said results would not be announced until midday. Should Mr. Rajapaksa indeed lose, the country would be left firmly in the grasp of reformers intent on dismantling most of his policies and completing corruption inquiries that have been closing in on him and his family.The election, held peacefully with high voter turnout, will determine the makeup of Sri Lanka\u2019s 225-member Parliament. Mr. Rajapaksa is expected to easily win a seat. But unless his political coalition can win a majority, he has no chance of being named prime minister, the second-most powerful job in Sri Lanka\u2019s government. And it was this majority that he and his supporters seemed to agree on Tuesday had eluded them. Instead, the results appear to have strengthened his archrivals, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the odd-couple political partners who joined forces to oppose Mr. Rajapaksa. In January, they struck the first blow against Mr. Rajapaksa by defeating his quest for an unprecedented third term as president. In the months since, they have teamed up to begin tearing down Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s most cherished project \u2014 building an elaborate hierarchy that gave him and his family immense, unchallenged power over the nation\u2019s military, economy and news media. If the latest results reaffirm January\u2019s rejection of Mr. Rajapaksa, the changes proposed by Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe will continue, including nascent efforts to bridge deep divisions left when Mr. Rajapaksa brutally crushed a 26-year Tamil uprising in 2009. A defeat for Mr. Rajapaksa also increases the likelihood that there will be a careful accounting of his decade in power. His opponents accuse him and his family of plundering billions of dollars from the national treasury, a charge that Mr. Rajapaksa has vehemently denied. \u201cWhatever you may say, we are not thieves,\u201d he told reporters last week. But the roster of his former ministers and close associates under investigation is steadily growing, and several inquiries are now aimed directly at Mr. Rajapaksa and his family.In April, Sri Lankan police arrested his brother Basil Rajapaksa, the former economic development minister, on charges of misappropriating public funds. The same month, another brother, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, was summoned to appear before the nation\u2019s Bribery Commission. In June, his wife, Shiranthi Rajapaksa, was questioned by the newly formed Financial Crime Investigation Division. This month, government sources accused one of his sons, Yoshitha Rajapaksa, of ordering the killing of Wasim Thajudeen, a member of Sri Lanka\u2019s national rugby team, in a dispute over a woman. According to officials, three members of his father\u2019s security detail have been identified as the men who abducted, tortured and killed Mr. Thajudeen in 2012. As part of his campaign this summer, Mr. Rajapaksa pledged to stop many of these investigations, portraying them as nothing more than a political witch hunt. Monday\u2019s loss, though, means \u201calmost certain prosecution\u201d for Mr. Rajapaksa, said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, who runs an election monitoring group and a policy research organization in Sri Lanka. Mr. Rajapaksa also sought to mobilize voters against a United Nations investigation into suspected war crimes during the last stages of the war against Tamil separatists. United Nations officials have estimated that as many as 40,000 civilians died in the final assault on the Tamil-dominated north in 2009. \u201cAre you going to vote to divide this country and take us to court in Geneva?\u201d Mr. Rajapaksa asked at one recent rally.Monday\u2019s election also has geopolitical ramifications. As president, Mr. Rajapaksa aggressively courted China, building economic and military ties that alarmed India and the United States. Neither country is keen for China to gain a larger presence on an island strategically situated along the maritime trade routes between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe have put the courtship on pause, saying the relationship with China needs to be \u201crebalanced.\u201dDharisha Bastians contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Big Spenders Pull Back, as Stock Market Shudders", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of Hong Kong\u2019s busiest shopping streets winds past the Times Square center, under slick signs for brands like Mont Blanc, Cartier, Gucci and Burberry.But inside the towering luxury mall, the hum of the crowds below fades into the quiet of rows of mostly empty boutiques.A sales attendant greeted a few people outside a Chanel shop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you have to queue,\u201d she said, waving her hand toward a seemingly imaginary line of shoppers. But few people entered the store on what would usually be a bustling weekend shopping day.The quieter scenes at Times Square and other luxury department stores in Hong Kong paint a stark contrast to the fevered spending of recent years, when young, upwardly mobile Chinese seemed to have insatiable appetites for Chanel handbags and Herm\u00e8s scarves.After growing by double digits in the last decade, spending on luxury goods in China contracted for the first time last year to about $18 billion, shrinking 1 percent, according to the consultancy Bain & Company.On top of the market turmoil, moves by the Chinese government to devalue the renminbi and concerns over further rounds of devaluation cast a new pall on the luxury marketplace.\u201cThis is going to hit hard,\u201d said David Friedman, the president of Wealth-X, a luxury intelligence firm. Mr. Friedman, who is based in New York, added, \u201cIt\u2019s the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for luxury brands that looked at the Chinese consumer as a driver of their revenue growth.\u201d\u201cIs the Chinese consumer still incredibly important to luxury brands? The answer is absolutely yes. But is the Chinese consumer over the next several years going to be the same economic juggernaut of consumption for these brands? The answer is no.\u201dThese jitters stem from how disproportionately global luxury brands have leaned on China for growth. Greater China drives as much as 25 percent of sales at Burberry, and 20 percent of sales at Prada, according to estimates by Exane BNP Paribas. The Swatch Group, whose brands include Omega, Harry Winston and Balmain, derives as much as 35 percent of its sales in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.Those percentages would be even higher if they took account of all the luxury goods that Chinese tourists snap up overseas, where items are often cheaper than in Beijing or Shanghai, where shoppers must pay import duties. According to Bain, nearly half of Chinese luxury spending occurs outside China.A weaker renminbi would make it more expensive for Chinese consumers not just to buy foreign luxury products in China, but also to travel overseas to cities like New York or Milan to buy luxury goods. A shakier economy and market turmoil back home would damp travel, as well as demand.\u201cThings are becoming more expensive, people are traveling less, and market turmoil is causing people to retrench and think about their luxury spending,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, a senior equity analyst in specialty retailing and luxury for Nomura Securities. \u201cSo you walk down Fifth Avenue, and you see emptier stores.\u201dStill, it is important to keep the effects of the market rout and devaluation in perspective, said Luca Solca, head of global luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. According to simulations run by Mr. Solca, a 5 percent devaluation of the renminbi would push sales down less than 1 percent at most global luxury brands he tracks, including Burberry, Herm\u00e8s, Prada, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and the Swatch Group.Even a 20 percent devaluation of the renminbi would hardly make a dent of 5 percent in those companies\u2019 sales, according to Mr. Solca\u2019s calculations.\u201cIt is often the case that markets react harshly to major surprises, a sort of \u2018Shoot first, ask questions later\u2019 approach,\u201d Mr. Solca said. \u201cThis looks like financial turmoil, not turmoil in the real economy. If it continues to grow, though, it will at one point have an impact on the real world, too.\u201dChinese travelers are drawn overseas partly by a hunt for value, she explained. Because of high tariffs, a Furla luxury handbag her firm examined recently cost $310, or 1,980 renminbi, with the steepest discounts available in China, but it sells for just a third of that price at the Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome.\u201cThe new yuan depreciation is not nearly enough to deter the very strong urge of Chinese shoppers to buy luxury goods overseas,\u201d she said.At the Tai Koo Li mall in central Beijing, a gleaming expanse of luxury retailers including Lanvin, Versace and Vera Wang, several shoppers shrugged off the recent currency moves.Xu Zijin, 19, a sophomore at a university in California, said she normally bought luxury goods in the United States because \u201cthe price is always very high in China,\u201d and she would continue to do so.For some brands, like Coach, which manufactures a majority of its handbags in China, a weaker renminbi could even be a positive, Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at the Cowen Group, said in a recent report. Gross margins at Coach, for instance, would benefit from lower input costs \u2014 especially lower wages for Chinese workers \u2014 if currency rates remained at their current level, Mr. Chen said.Andrea Shaw Resnick, head of investor relations and corporate communications at Coach, said it was still too early to project the impact of the weaker renminbi on sales trends.Still, \u201cwe\u2019ve been managing through exchange rate fluctuations for many years,\u201d Ms. Resnick said. \u201cImportantly, our sourcing of both finished goods and raw materials in the region provides some degree of natural hedge,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dUltimately, the future of Chinese luxury spending \u2014 and who is able to attract more of it \u2014 hinges on longer-term shifts in global currencies, as well as economic growth back home.The eurozone and Japan have been bolstered by an influx of Chinese tourists, thanks to the weakness of their currencies, which have each fallen almost 10 percent against the renminbi over the last 12 months \u2014 even after the recent devaluation.The dollar, on the other hand, has strengthened against major currencies over the last year, and it is up about 4 percent against the renminbi from 12 months ago, despite the recent devaluation. The strong dollar is weighing on tourist spending in the United States; Macy\u2019s recently blamed dwindling tourism dollars for lackluster earnings in the second quarter.Mika Tsuruta, 25, an employee at the Japanese handbag brand Samantha Vega, sat smoking by an enormous robot outside the Times Square mall. She usually works in Tokyo but was sent to the retailer\u2019s Hong Kong store to train the staff in customer service.During her time in Hong Kong, she has noticed Chinese customers looking for a less expensive alternative to the big-name luxury brands, she said. Samantha Vega fits the bill \u2014 a handbag from the Japanese retailer sells for about 2,200 Hong Kong dollars (around $280), a fraction of the 25,000 Hong Kong dollars (nearly $3,225) a Chanel flap bag can fetch.\u201cThey say they are looking for something good, something cheaper,\u201d she said.Leo, an 18-year-old student from Jiangsu, in eastern China, about to start university in Hong Kong, walked around another lavish shopping center, the Landmark. He took photos through the store window of S.T. Dupont, gawking at the gold-embellished pens and lighters on display, and at ads featuring members of the British royal family.Leo, who wished to be identified only by his English name, insisted that the point of his trip to the mall was not to shop. The state of the economy and the currency devaluation worried his family, he said.\u201cIt means I need to spend more money on my studies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to buy too much.\u201dAn article on Thursday about slowing sales of luxury goods to Chinese customers referred incorrectly to the head of investor relations and corporate communications at Coach, who commented on the situation.

{"Headline": "Investigation Lifts a Cloud Over President of Mexico", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 A seven-month conflict-of-interest investigation into the purchase of luxury homes by President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife and his finance minister from a government contractor found no wrongdoing, Mexico\u2019s comptroller said Friday.Neither the president nor Finance Minister Luis Videgaray intervened to steer government contracts to Grupo Higa, the company that built and sold the houses, the investigation concluded. Also, both houses were bought in 2012, before Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto became president that year, which meant their purchase did not break any law, said the comptroller, Virgilio Andrade.The conclusion of the investigation lifts any legal cloud over Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Mr. Videgaray, but it is unlikely to lift the shadow that has hung over the administration since the deals were revealed last November.\u201cFrom the judicial point of view there is no conflict, but from the ethical point of view, this is about an immoral action,\u201d said Alfonso Z\u00e1rate, a political analyst.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office portraying himself as the modern face of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which governed for seven decades through a blend of corruption, coercion and favors until losing power in 2000. \u201cIt is very clear to me that the image of the president is very damaged,\u201d said Mauricio Merino, an anti-corruption specialist at the CIDE, a Mexico City university. \u201cIt will be even more damaged after this conclusion.\u201dIn Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s most direct acknowledgment yet that the scandal had cost him credibility, he apologized on Friday. \u201cThe investigation shows that my and my wife\u2019s conduct followed the law completely,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I am aware and I recognize that these events gave rise to interpretations that hurt and even outraged many Mexicans. To all of them, I offer a sincere apology.\u201dHiga also sold a house adjoining a golf course to Mr. Videgaray in October 2012, when he was the leader of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidential transition team and the expected finance minister.Mr. Andrade revealed that Ms. Rivera canceled her contract to buy the White House the month after the first report about it appeared. The company repaid what she had paid toward the purchase contract \u2014 almost $1 million at the time \u2014 and she paid about $710,000 to cover three years\u2019 rent.Mexican law made it almost impossible to prove any wrongdoing by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto or Mr. Videgaray, Mr. Merino said. \u201cTo show a conflict of interest, you would have to have proven that the president personally granted one of the contracts,\u201d he said.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saving Tunisia From ISIS", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe carnage at Sousse exposed the Tunisian authorities\u2019 inability to tackle on their own the country\u2019s growing security challenges. Tunisia\u2019s successful transition to democracy, the legitimacy of its government and the bravery of its armed forces are not enough to save it. Nor should anyone in Europe and the West comfort themselves with the idea that the jihadist movement will eventually self-destruct.From their new theater of operations in Tunisia, the terrorists aim at extending their caliphate to Europe and beyond \u2014 a stated ambition of the Islamic State. In a video released in February of the brutal execution of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya, an Islamic State leader gazes out across the Mediterranean horizon and, in flowery classical Arabic, compares the coming battles in Europe to early Islam\u2019s struggle against Rome.The instability in Libya that followed the ouster of Muammar el-Qaddafi has turned that country, Tunisia\u2019s immediate neighbor to the east, into a vast training camp and huge arms bazaar for Islamist terrorists of all stripes. The Islamic State, as the most barbaric, determined and messianic of them all, has been gaining ground there.Tunisia\u2019s vulnerability has its roots in the postcolonial era. Habib Bourguiba, the first president after independence in 1956, was eager to modernize his nation, but he was wary of the military coups that plagued other countries in the region at the time. So he spent a great part of the national budget on education and starved the army of resources. His successor, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, continued on the same path, but as his administration turned dictatorial, he developed a strong police force.As a result, after the 2011 revolution that deposed Mr. Ben Ali, Tunisia inherited a discredited police force and a small army, which, though professional, was poorly funded and ill equipped. The police force was largely disbanded by the new authorities and has yet to be effectively reconstituted.To prevent the Islamic State from making Tunisia a beachhead for attacks on Europe, Mr. Cameron, along with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, should make a joint visit to Tunis. To provide Tunisia\u2019s army and reorganized police force with greater support in the fight for control of their country, the European powers should offer Tunisia a security commitment that includes free access to arms, military training and intelligence-sharing.Since the United States has already named Tunisia a \u201cmajor ally,\u201d why not also invite Tunisia to become an \u201caspirant country\u201d for eventual membership in NATO on the basis of shared democratic values and common security interests? These values and interests are, after all, directly opposed to those of the Islamic State and its ideological kin.Europe has a strong interest in a secure, democratic Tunisia and must come to its aid. Only if it does so can we ensure that the question \u201cWho lost Tunisia?\u201d is one we will never have to answer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Growing Migrant Crisis Prompts Call for Urgent Meeting of E.U. Officials ", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With increasing public consternation about the flow of migrants and asylum seekers to Europe and the dangers of their passage, Germany, France and Britain made a joint call on Sunday for an urgent meeting of European Union interior and justice ministers to find \u201cconcrete\u201d measures to cope with the escalating crisis.In a quick response, Luxembourg \u2014 which holds the revolving presidency of the European Union \u2014 called such a meeting for Sept. 14 in Brussels.What is most urgent, the interior ministers of the three countries said, is agreement on the establishment of welcome centers in Greece and Italy to house, feed and screen migrants and asylum seekers, and to decide who should be allowed to remain as a legal refugee and who should be sent back home.Similarly, the ministers said, the European Union must agree on a list of \u201csafe countries of origin,\u201d from which people would be considered migrants, not refugees, and therefore allowed to be sent home. The ministers\u2019 appeal included the prospect of an emergency summit meeting of bloc leaders to follow.The interior ministers \u2014 Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re of Germany, Theresa May of Britain and Bernard Cazeneuve of France \u2014 had come together to address how to improve security on Europe\u2019s trains, especially in the open-border Schengen zone, after a young Moroccan gunman tried to attack a train from Amsterdam to Paris on Aug. 21 before being foiled by passengers.The gruesome discoveries last week of 71 migrants\u2019 bodies in a truck on an Austrian highway and of more than 100 people who drowned off Libya have intensified pressure on the European Union to come up with a safer common system for the surge of migrants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Syria, Iraq, Sudan and other countries in crisis.In the latest crisis, tens of thousands are racing to Hungary before a border fence is finished.\u201cThere is a need to take measures immediately to face up to the challenge from these migrant flows,\u201d the three ministers said in a statement.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has spoken out for a compassionate reception of migrants after weeks of silence on the issue. She was pressed in part by proposals from important members of the Social Democrats, who are junior members of a grand coalition with her Christian Democrats.A senior German official, who requested anonymity to address a diplomatic issue, noted that the article had not been written with the interior minister, Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re, a Christian Democrat, in a clear effort to distinguish the Social Democrats in the minds of voters.There should be \u201cno tolerance for those people who question the dignity of others, no tolerance for those who are not willing to help where legal and human help is required,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, condemning violent protests as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cvile.\u201dThe German government said last week that Syrians would be allowed to apply for asylum in Germany, even if they entered the European Union through another country. Under the Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers are required to apply for protection in the first European Union country they reach.The failure of the Dublin rules became part of this summer\u2019s turmoil as enormous pressure mounted on Greece and Italy \u2014 nearly all 310,000 migrants this year have entered in those countries. Overwhelmed Greece and Italy \u2014 and now Hungary and other Balkan countries \u2014 are moving migrants through their countries to richer and more welcoming nations like Germany, Sweden and France.On Sunday, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, sharply criticized Hungary and other countries that have simply forwarded migrants instead of helping them. \u201cWith regard to all those people who are politically chased out of their country, we have to be able to welcome them,\u201d Mr. Fabius told Europe 1 radio. \u201cEvery country has to respond to that. France, Germany, others have, but when I see certain countries that do not accept these groups, I find that scandalous.\u201dHe criticized \u201cin particular eastern European states \u2014 they are extremely harsh.\u201d He criticized Hungary especially for trying to put up a wall against migrants, saying that the country \u201cis part of Europe, which has values, and we do not respect those values by putting up fences.\u201dMs. May, the British home secretary, offered sharp criticism of her own on Sunday, calling Europe\u2019s migration system broken. She blamed the unrestricted travel in the Schengen area, of which Britain is not a member, for worsening the migrant crisis and promoting human smuggling, and in a regular British complaint, she demanded tighter rules on the freedom of movement of even European Union citizens within the bloc.\u201cThe events of this summer have shown that the most tragic consequences of a broken European migration system have been borne by those at risk of exploitation,\u201d Ms. May wrote in The Sunday Times of London. \u201cAs countries in Europe are increasingly realizing, these tragedies have been exacerbated by the European system of no borders.\u201dRising net migration to Britain is a difficult political problem for the Conservative government of Ms. May and Prime Minister David Cameron, who promised five years ago to reduce the annual increase to \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d Last year annual net migration to Britain hit a record high of 330,000, according to figures released last week. That is double the figure from 2010, and as much as half of the number came from European Union citizens moving to Britain for jobs in its decently growing economy.Mr. Cameron wants to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s European Union membership before a national referendum on the membership due to be held by the end of 2017, and he is searching for ways to discourage more European Union immigration here, including restrictions on social and tax benefits for up to four years.\u201cWhen it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits,\u201d Ms. May said. \u201cWe must take some big decisions, face down powerful interests and reinstate the original principle.\u201d She suggested admitting only European Union citizens who already had a job offer in Britain, terms that the other countries are unlikely to accept.The British government is clearly anxious that the chaos over migration, legal and illegal, will make it harder to persuade British voters to remain inside the European Union, even with some negotiated changes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Simon and Cory Booker on \u2018Show Me a Hero\u2019 and the Future of Cities", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the elevator door at the housing project opens onto two men seemingly dealing drugs, a young mother, loaded down with groceries, wordlessly opts to lead her small children lugging backpacks up the decrepit stairs. Across town, an all-white mob fumes before an all-white city council, which eggs it on. Later, a man spits on the mayor, who defies the angry crowd.A new HBO mini-series, which kicks off on Sunday, looks back on a notorious episode of racial discord that unfolded just north of New York City: Some three decades ago, Federal Judge Leonard B. Sand ordered the city of Yonkers to desegregate. Back then, Yonkers (population 188,000) was 85 percent white, with nearly all its black and Hispanic residents clustered in housing projects to the west. The court mandated 200 units of low-rise subsidized housing to blend into white neighborhoods to the east. Local officials, caving in to white constituents, nearly bankrupted the city by resisting the judge\u2019s ruling. A 28-year-old former policeman, Nick Wasicsko, became mayor on a pledge to oppose integration.Then Mr. Wasicsko took office. Mounting federal penalties cut local services and threatened more and more layoffs. The young mayor changed course and saw to it that the city obeyed the law. He was soon booted out, but, grudgingly, Yonkers began to integrate. \u201cShow Me a Hero,\u201d a six-episode series about the controversy, created by David Simon (\u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cTreme\u201d) and based on a 1999 book by Lisa Belkin, a former reporter for The New York Times, stars Oscar Isaac as the ill-fated Wasicsko. Like so much of Mr. Simon\u2019s work, the show puts a human face on all sides of the conflict.For the occasion, we asked Mr. Simon to join Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, in Mr. Booker\u2019s Washington office (and in follow-up emails), to talk about the show, cities, race and space. As a boy, Mr. Booker experienced something of the Yonkers tale. His was the only black household in a middle-class white New Jersey neighborhood. He became a young mayor, too, in Newark, a city with its own history of racial tension and housing troubles.After desegregation, Yonkers suffered white flight and its schools took a hit. The population in 2010 was 56 percent white. The city changed but it also moved past the deep racial divide that defined the struggle in the 1980s. In the edited conversation that follows, Mr. Booker and Mr. Simon traded ideas about cities as America\u2019s future, where not just the economy and creative capital but also equality and justice need to be worked out.Q. David, you\u2019ve wanted to tell this Yonkers story for a while. [Yonkers] was such an obvious allegory for a world that a lot of people want to pretend is post-racial, but is actually an even greater tangle now that the country\u2019s being asked to actually contemplate not just sharing space, which is problematic enough, but sharing power.This was 1969, and so I was a senior in high school in \u201987 when this [series starts]. What most Americans don\u2019t realize is a lot of the challenges we\u2019re struggling with today are the result of conscious housing policies. In fact, so many families in America made their wealth or secured their status as middle class through housing, and you have the government systematically devaluing neighborhoods \u2014 taking away that wealth, in effect \u2014 then concentrating poverty very consciously. Newark is called Brick City, because it had these canyons of high rise [projects]. So, when you showed that woman trying to get into the elevator, I have those memories of guys playing dice against the wall, of seeing mothers taking stairways filled with all kinds of depressing or painful realities. Many people ascribe those things to African-Americans, but that is their government creating this outrageous policy to create dense poverty in the very areas where jobs and resources were leaving.And then very often failing to provide assistance and money to sustain those projects, so leaving the people in them with no resources. David, your mission is clearly to humanize abstract issues like housing, poverty and race for television.Nowadays, there\u2019s an increasingly entrenched libertarian notion in our political culture: Well, why is the government even providing housing to anybody? What is this public housing you speak of, and why are we dealing with it? It\u2019s sort of an astonishing moment of political amnesia, because the concept of public housing has its origins in the New Deal. These structures were built for white people in the Depression to allow families to regroup and retrench in hard times and to move on from there, and then it had a second generation in terms of the returning veterans when there was a housing shortage after World War II.These projects were white, and nobody had the slightest doubt that this was effective government policy at the time. But of course you can\u2019t take it forward two generations to a time where deindustrialization has happened. The same economic levers for getting out of the projects are no longer there, and now the clientele for public housing is people of color. It creates a completely different dynamic.For me in Newark, it was this interesting reality, right? We were able to reverse the trend from 60 years of losing population. Now people were coming in, but we didn\u2019t want to make the mistake we saw in other places. We wanted to get to a 24/7 downtown, building all these loft apartments, but we were very aggressive [about being] 40 percent affordable, 50 percent affordable.How much do you think a mini-series can change the conversation about race and housing? And, Senator, the crime rate has fallen dramatically.So when you go down to the corner and you grab the five guys who have vials in their pockets and you leave the guy who just shot three people in the last month, the whole neighborhood knows it.

{"Headline": "Is Hillary Clinton Really in Danger of Losing the Primary?", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016Bernie Sanders is said to be surging, Joe Biden is considering jumping in the race, and Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s unfavorable ratings are the worst they\u2019ve been in her 23-plus years in national politics \u2014 worse than they were in 2007 or 2008.Whether you call it wishful thinking or a worst-case scenario, it\u2019s enough to make some people say the Clinton campaign is in serious trouble. But is it? Has she forfeited the huge advantages she held at the start of the year? Does Mr. Sanders, or another Democrat, have a real chance to beat her in the primary? Has she done great damage to her chances in the general election?Probably not. At least not yet. It could change if the investigation into her email account takes a more serious turn, or if another problem arises. But for now, the damage to Mrs. Clinton has been overstated.You might not know it if you\u2019re reading the various articles about Mr. Sanders\u2019s rise in the polls, but Mrs. Clinton still holds as strong a position as any primary candidate in history. And oddly, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have helped clarify that strength.A closer look at the polls shows that he is simply not within striking distance of winning the nomination. His support has run into a wall: Women, blacks and Hispanics continue to support Mrs. Clinton by a wide margin, as do white moderate and conservative Democrats.This doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Sanders can\u2019t make further gains. But it does mean that he will need to broaden his appeal to voters who may be far less receptive to his message. The rapid consolidation of progressive activists is over, and additional inroads into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s coalition will be hard to come by.Her commanding advantage among party elites has not been shaken by the concerns about her email account. Just ask Joe Biden.Mr. Biden is the party\u2019s natural emergency alarm option. Party leaders aren\u2019t breaking the glass.If they do, it will be reason to reassess.Mrs. Clinton may be a primary juggernaut, but she could surely lose to a Republican in November 2016. President Obama\u2019s approval ratings are in the mid-40s, so Mrs. Clinton may not benefit from the party\u2019s incumbency. On paper, the race is more or less a tossup. In such a close contest, it might seem reasonable to argue that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unfavorable ratings are hugely important.But the case for that argument isn\u2019t so strong. Much of the variation in presidential election results can be explained by underlying factors like the president\u2019s approval rating, the economy and partisanship.Many political scientists go a step further. Whether people have a favorable opinion of presidential candidates is as much about rationalizing a latent partisan preference \u2014 shaped by the underlying political and economic fundamentals \u2014 as it is about the candidates themselves. From this perspective, much of the damage to Mrs. Clinton among Republican-leaning independents was inevitable, while the damage to Democrats can be overcome by partisan loyalty.It\u2019s useful to imagine a counterfactual: What if the economy had been stronger, and George H.W. Bush had had a 60 percent approval rating, on Election Day in 1992? Mr. Clinton wouldn\u2019t have had a chance against those numbers, of course, but Mr. Bush wouldn\u2019t have been running just on his record. He would have attacked Mr. Clinton\u2019s character and he would have maintained a lead in the polls as a media narrative coalesced around a simple explanation: Mr. Clinton, with his weak numbers, was a smooth-talking womanizer who couldn\u2019t be trusted. After his defeat, Mr. Clinton would have been remembered as yet another weak Democratic candidate in the footsteps of Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, fatally damaged before the campaign had even begun, rather than as one of the more talented politicians of our time.For some, this line of thinking offers an uncomfortably deterministic theory about American presidential politics. But it helps explain a lot, such as why favorability ratings can move so much, even when there is relatively little new information about a candidate. It helps explain why, on the other hand, supposed game-changers often seem to have no effect. And it helps explain why, in the end, the polls move toward the fundamentals as the campaign evolves.Nate Cohn is a Washington correspondent for the New York Times.videoAdvertisement"}

But by the end of the day, Apple and the rest of the market had yielded to the gravitational pull of investor fear.Investors are now trying to separate the fact from the fear, as they digest how China\u2019s problems will affect the rest of the world. And the process could make for some messiness in the markets, particularly in the United States, where investors have been lulled into a sense of security by a long bull run in stocks.By 2 p.m. Monday, Gregory J. Blank, an independent financial adviser based in New York, had already fielded nearly 20 phone calls from anxious investors. He handles assets for about 200 clients, a mixture of younger adults and retirees.\u201cThey see it in the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get worried. They call.\u201d Mr. Blank said that the older investors were more concerned, since it was harder for them to replenish whatever they had saved up for retirement. But the worst thing to do right now is to panic, he advises them.One retiree, a former secretary at a global investment bank, was among the concerned callers. \u201cShe started the phone call with \u2018Should we sell?\u2019\u201d Mr. Blank said. \u201cBy the end of the phone call, she said, \u2018Well, maybe we should buy.\u2019\u201dBut staying put is not always the best option for everyone \u2014 creating the sort of selling pressure that could add to the tumult.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.David Enrico, a 31-year-old model from Los Angeles, eyed the market with growing anxiety on Monday. Mr. Enrico and his wife are preparing to buy a home and are concerned about the short-term effects on their savings.\u201cI just saw this, and I got a little nervous because I don\u2019t want my nest egg, my down payment for the house, to be subject to the market volatility,\u201d he said.Mr. Enrico emailed Mr. Blank to make sure that he could liquidate his positions immediately if need be, but so far hasn\u2019t pulled the trigger.\u201cIn the short run, market sell-offs are limited by psychology,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. The biggest risk here is that we all collectively lose our nerves at the same time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that enough of a frenzy will be whipped up that people could hunker down,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen, but that\u2019s the biggest risk.\u201dAdvisers and corporate executives are now trying to assure investors that a slowing Chinese economy isn\u2019t necessarily a big problem for most American companies.And Mr. Cook\u2019s comments, which were sent to Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d did help Apple weather the worst of Monday\u2019s trading. After opening down more than 10 percent from Friday\u2019s close, Apple\u2019s shares quickly rebounded, helping the Dow Jones industrial average recover somewhat from an early plunge of more than 1,000 points.Like Mr. Cook, many Wall Street seers insist the overall data doesn\u2019t foreshadow an economic slump \u2014 or worse.\u201cValuations aren\u2019t stretched, and there isn\u2019t a general economic downturn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very tough to trade these markets, but that view applies to a much smaller slice of the population.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, China, while an important source of earnings gains for large American companies, isn\u2019t expected to tumble into the kind of outright recession the United States went through from 2008 to 2009. It just may not grow at the 7 percent that Chinese leadership is targeting.\u201cEven the most pessimistic observers think China will still grow by 4 or 5 percent,\u201d said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, a brokerage firm based in St. Louis. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have 4 or 5 percent growth in this country.\u201dShe said that the long, steady rise of the stock market this decade, with relatively few downdrafts, is only adding to the sense of panic now.\u201cIt\u2019s been four years since we\u2019ve had a correction like this, and that\u2019s a long time to go without one,\u201d Ms. Warne said. \u201cWhen stocks drop, it\u2019s always scary, but it seems more scary this time because we haven\u2019t had this recently.\u201dOf course, these explanations are cold comfort as ordinary investors watch their savings shrink. Still, some individuals, having survived the trauma of the recession, are showing a bit of sang-froid because of the fear that has overtaken trading floors from Shanghai to New York to Frankfurt.Margaret Matteson of Folsom, Pa., said she heard about the market sell-off on NPR as she was driving to work. She said she would only become worried if there were broader economic implications \u2014 she lost her last job in 2009 during the recession. The latest bout of volatility didn\u2019t make her nervous, but she said she was a bit puzzled about what was behind it.Ms. Matteson, 33, who manages a software database for an art museum, says she only cares if it affects her job. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it does to my portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to sit there for 20 or 30 years.

{"Headline": "In Providing Debt Relief to Greece, the Devil Is in the Details", "Date": "2015-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyHow unsustainable are Greece\u2019s borrowings? This question has moved center stage after the eurozone agreed last Friday to lend Athens up to 86 billion euros, or more than $95 billion, in a new bailout program.The eurozone is eager for the International Monetary Fund to also lend money in the bailout. But the I.M.F. thinks Greece\u2019s debt is unsustainable and won\u2019t provide more loans unless the eurozone gives Athens relief on its existing borrowings. The snag is that several eurozone countries, including Germany, are reluctant to cut the debt burden.This isn\u2019t something that ought to scuttle the deal. The eurozone has agreed to proceed without the I.M.F., in the hope that the I.M.F. will join in later. The eurozone will consider debt relief after the first review of the new bailout, which could be as soon as October. But the eurozone won\u2019t agree to a haircut, or reduction, to the face value of the debt.So there should be the basis for an agreement. This would involve giving Greece longer both before it starts repaying its debt and before it needs to finish the job. But the devil will be in the details, in particular in the measuring of debt sustainability.The traditional approach, looking at ratios of debt to gross domestic product, is not suitable for Greece because the eurozone loans already have long grace and repayment periods, as well as extremely low interest rates. A crude debt-to-G.D.P. ratio \u2014 which, in Greece\u2019s case, is expected by both the eurozone and I.M.F. to peak at about 200 percent \u2014 doesn\u2019t take any account of these benefits.An alternative would be to look at the present value of Athens\u2019 debt \u2014 what its total future debt payments will be worth in today\u2019s money. The European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, says that all the concessions so far given to Greece have reduced the present value by the equivalent of 49 percent of G.D.P. If one subtracted that from the headline ratio \u2014 assuming, for simplicity, that all the other debt is kept at face value \u2014 one would be left with 150 percent of G.D.P.One can also calculate the present value of the \u20ac86 billion in new loans, which will pay interest at only 1 percent and have an average maturity of 32.5 years. The present value of that loan package is about half its face value.By giving Athens such generous terms, the eurozone has already given it further debt relief of about \u20ac40 billion. Subtract that, and Greece\u2019s borrowings would be under 130 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 still high but not out of line with those of other indebted European countries, such as Italy.But it is also important to look at other yardsticks. The one increasingly favored by both the I.M.F. and the eurozone is gross financing needs. This measures how much a country needs to find each year to pay interest and repay debt as a percentage of its G.D.P. It looks at a government\u2019s debt burden from a cash-flow perspective.The I.M.F. says a country like Greece shouldn\u2019t have financing needs above 15 percent, but in fact its needs are projected at more than that. Again this is useful but not enough on its own.The I.M.F. is implicitly treating Greece as an emerging market. Although this is reasonable in the midst of the current crisis, it may not be the right way of looking at the country in the future. After all, if the bailout works, Greece will eventually become a reasonably advanced economy and may then be able to support higher financing needs a decade or so from now.Another problem is that if the I.M.F.\u2019s numbers are correct, other countries may need debt relief.Figuring by gross financing needs also lumps interest and debt repayments together. This is too crude. After all, a country that just needs to refinance its debt will find it easier to raise funds in the market than one that needs to borrow to pay interest. This is why it is also important to look at a government\u2019s interest payments as a percentage of G.D.P. By this yardstick, Greece doesn\u2019t look too bad, because its debt has low rates. It has to find 4 percent of G.D.P. to service its borrowings, less than the 5 percent that Italy and Portugal have to pay, according to Paul De Grauwe of the London School of Economics.When looking at the health of a company, it is wise to examine its balance sheet, cash flow and profits. Similarly, with a government, one should look at its debt, gross financing needs and interest payments. Taking such a holistic approach, Greece needs some debt relief. But the eurozone can probably achieve this by stretching out still further the amount of time Athens has to repay its loans. It may not be necessary therefore to cut their face value.Hugo Dixon writes a weekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "U.S. Is Playing Catch-Up With Russia in Scramble for the Arctic", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosABOARD COAST GUARD CUTTER ALEX HALEY, in the Chukchi Sea \u2014 With warming seas creating new opportunities at the top of the world, nations are scrambling over the Arctic \u2014 its territorial waters, transit routes and especially its natural resources \u2014 in a rivalry some already call a new Cold War.\u201cWe have been for some time clamoring about our nation\u2019s lack of capacity to sustain any meaningful presence in the Arctic,\u201d said Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the Coast Guard\u2019s commandant.Aboard the Alex Haley, the increased activity in the Arctic was obvious in the deep blue waters of the Chukchi Sea. While the cutter patrolled one day this month, vessels began to appear one after another on radar as this ship cleared the western edge of Alaska and cruised north of the Arctic Circle.To deal with the growing numbers of vessels sluicing north through the Bering Strait, the Coast Guard has had to divert ships like the Alex Haley from other core missions, like policing American fisheries and interdicting drugs. The service\u2019s fleet is aging, especially the nation\u2019s only two icebreakers. (The United States Navy rarely operates in the Arctic.) Underwater charting is paltry, while telecommunications remain sparse above the highest latitudes. Alaska\u2019s far north lacks deepwater port facilities to support increased maritime activity.All these shortcomings require investments that political gridlock, budget constraints and bureaucracy have held up for years.Russia, by contrast, is building 10 new search-and-rescue stations, strung like a necklace of pearls at ports along half of the Arctic shoreline. More provocatively, it has also significantly increased its military presence, reopening bases abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Russia is far from the only rival \u2014 or potential one \u2014 in the Arctic. China, South Korea and Singapore have increasingly explored the possibility that commercial cargo could be shipped to European markets across waters \u2014 outside Russia\u2019s control \u2014 that scientists predict could, by 2030, be ice-free for much of the summer.\u201cThe United States really isn\u2019t even in this game,\u201d Admiral Zukunft said at a conference in Washington this year.He lamented the lack of urgency in Washington, contrasting it with the challenges of the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union confronted each other in the Arctic and beyond. \u201cWhen Russia put Sputnik in outer space, did we sit with our hands in pocket with great fascination and say, \u2018Good for Mother Russia\u2019?\u201dPolar OppositesIn January, the president created an Arctic Executive Steering Committee, led by the director of the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology, John P. Holdren. The committee is trying to prioritize the demands for ships, equipment and personnel at a time of constrained budgets.Dr. Holdren said in an interview that administration officials were trying \u201cto get our arms around matching the resources and the commitment we can bring to bear with the magnitude of the opportunities and the challenges\u201d in the Arctic.What kind of frontier the Arctic will be \u2014 an ecological preserve or an economic engine, an area of international cooperation or confrontation \u2014 is now the question at the center of the unfolding geopolitical competition. An increasing divergence over the answer has deeply divided the United States and its allies on one side and Russia on the other.Decades of cooperation in the Arctic Council, which includes Russia, the United States and six other Arctic states, all but ended with Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing war in eastern Ukraine. In March, Russia conducted an unannounced military exercise that was one of the largest ever in the far north. It involved 45,000 troops, as well as dozens of ships and submarines, including those in its strategic nuclear arsenal, from the Northern Fleet, based in Murmansk.\u201cOil and gas production facilities, loading terminals and pipelines should be reliably protected from terrorists and other potential threats,\u201d Mr. Putin said when detailing the military buildup last year. \u201cNothing can be treated as trivial here.\u201dIn Washington and other NATO capitals, Russia\u2019s military moves are seen as provocative \u2014 and potentially destabilizing.\u201cWe see the Arctic as a global commons,\u201d a senior Obama administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters of national security. \u201cIt\u2019s not apparent the Russians see it the same way we do.\u201dAlthough the commission might not rule for years, Russia\u2019s move underscored the priority the Kremlin has given to expanding its sovereignty. The United States, by contrast, has not even ratified the law of the sea treaty, leaving it on the sidelines of territorial jockeying.\u201cNobody cared too much about these sectors,\u201d said Andrei A. Smirnov, deputy director for operations at Atomflot, which operates Russia\u2019s fleet of six nuclear-powered icebreakers, \u201cbut when it turned out that 40 percent of confirmed oil and gas deposits were there, everybody became interested in who owns what.\u201dSome have questioned whether Russia, whose economy is sinking under the weight of sanctions and the falling price of oil, can sustain its efforts in the Arctic.\u201cIt is rather difficult to find rationale for this very pronounced priority in the allocation of increasingly scarce resources,\u201d said Pavel K. Baev of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. He added that Russian claims that it was protecting its economic interests from NATO were \u201centirely fictitious.\u201d\u201cThe only challenge to Russian exploitation of the Arctic came from Greenpeace,\u201d he said.Adm. William E. Gortney, head of the Pentagon\u2019s Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said that Russia was increasing its capabilities after years of neglect but did not represent a meaningful threat, yet. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing activity in the Arctic, but it hasn\u2019t manifested in significant change at this point,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Despite concerns over the military buildup, others said that some of Russia\u2019s moves were benign efforts to ensure the safety of ships on its Northern Sea Route, which could slash the time it takes to ship goods from Asia to Europe. Russia had pledged to take those steps as an Arctic Council member.\u201cSome of the things I see them doing \u2014 in terms of building up bases, telecommunications, search and rescue capabilities \u2014 are things I wish the United States was doing as well,\u201d said Robert J. Papp Jr., a retired admiral and former commandant of the Coast Guard. He is now the State Department\u2019s senior envoy on Arctic issues.Less Ice, More TrafficAboard the Alex Haley, the crew made contact with each of the ships it encountered plowing the waters, recording details of the owners, courses and the number of crew members who might need to be plucked from the sea in case of disaster.The cutter\u2019s captain, Cmdr. Seth J. Denning, was a young ensign when he first crossed the Arctic Circle just north of the Bering Strait 19 years ago. \u201cI never really realized that the Arctic was going to open up as much as it has \u2014 enough to allow this much activity,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it surprised many people.\u201dWhat had been a brief excursion for Ensign Denning when the Arctic was choked with ice has now become routine.The Alex Haley \u2014 named after the author of \u201cRoots,\u201d who was a 20-year Coast Guard veteran \u2014 is one of five ships that the Coast Guard is deploying to the Arctic from June to October. It will be replaced by an advanced cutter, the Waesche, based in Alameda, Calif. The Coast Guard has also stationed two rescue helicopters at the airport at Deadhorse, the town where the Trans-Alaska Pipeline begins.The deployments are part of an annual summer surge that was started in 2012 when Shell first explored the oil fields off Alaska\u2019s North Slope. The challenges of the new mission have been exacting, given the vast distances and limited support infrastructure on land. For several days this month the Alex Haley\u2019s only helicopter, which operates from a retractable hangar on the ship\u2019s aft was out of service, awaiting a spare part that had to be flown in on several hops from North Carolina.This year\u2019s deployments are intended to assess the requirements for operating in the Arctic, but the expected increase in human activity there will put new demands on the service.\u201cAs a maritime nation, we have responsibility for the safety and security of the people who are going to be using that ocean,\u201d said Mr. Papp. \u201cAnd we have a responsibility to protect the ocean from the people who will be using it.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the United States\u2019 race to catch up to other nations that are competing over the Arctic resources created by the melting of the polar ice cap misattributed, in some editions, comments about the United States\u2019 policy in the Arctic.

{"Headline": "Bangkok Bomb Attack at Popular Shrine Kills at Least 20", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt least 123 people were reported wounded in what Thailand\u2019s top police official and others called a vicious act meant to target civilians.The explosion came at a particularly busy time of day at the Erawan Shrine, an important tourist attraction in Bangkok\u2019s main shopping area.Map of an explosion in Bangkok\u2019s main shopping district.A spokesman for the police, Lt. Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri, told a Thai television interviewer that \u201cwe haven\u2019t concluded anything.\u201d The authorities said they were reviewing footage from 15 security cameras in the area but that the rush-hour crowds made deciphering the video difficult.\u201cThe shrine was very crowded,\u201d General Prawut said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear even looking at the CCTV footage.\u201dThe bomb, General Prawut said, was placed under a bench on the outer rim of the shrine\u2019s grounds. Initially, the police said they had discovered at least two additional devices that they suspected were unexploded bombs inside the shrine and said other bombs may have been placed in the area, yelling at bystanders: \u201cGet out! Get out!\u201dBut the Thai news media reported later that the suspicious devices did not appear to be bombs, and on Tuesday the Thai authorities spoke only of one bomb.Debris and at least five motorcycles were scattered in the intersection, including one in flames, as dozens of emergency vehicles arrived on the scene. Bloodstains were visible at a nearby shopping mall, an indication of the force of the blast.Some news accounts said an explosive device had detonated on the flaming motorcycle. But the head of Thailand\u2019s national police force, Gen. Somyot Poompanmoung, said on television that the explosion \u201cwas not a car bomb.\u201dGeneral Somyot said whoever was responsible knew there would be many bystanders at a busy time for the shrine. He described the attack as \u201cvicious and ruthless.\u201dThai officials said it was premature to conclude the attack had been politically motivated. But The Bangkok Post reported that all 438 city schools would be closed on Tuesday for safety reasons.A Defense Ministry spokesman, Kongcheep Tantrawanich, was quoted by the newspaper as saying the bombing was \u201cthe work of those who have lost political interests and want to destroy the \u2018happy time\u2019 of Thai people.\u201dThe authorities said a citizen of the Philippines and a \u201cChinese\u201d person were among the dead, without specifying that person\u2019s citizenship. A statement issued by a nearby hospital said that one of the victims was a young girl.While bodies of the dead were ripped apart, the shrine itself appeared not to have suffered extensive damage. Shards of glass littered the immediate area, but a small pavilion inside the shrine compound appeared to remain largely intact.Charoen Sida, 37, a security guard who was preparing to start a 7 p.m. shift at a shopping mall next to the site, witnessed the immediate aftermath.\u201cEveryone was screaming and running,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a huge fire coming from a motorcycle. No one dared to go into the intersection.\u201dWinai Petploy, a rescue worker who carried away the remains of the dead, said that bodies had been torn apart by the blast. \u201cI carried one out, and then I carried the other half out,\u201d he said.A police officer at the scene said the authorities were focused on a woman who was seen arriving at the shrine around 15 minutes before the explosion. She placed a bag at the shrine and then left. The officer, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said the woman had been overheard speaking Thai.More than two hours after the blast, the police led teams of dogs through the area in a search for further explosives.The Erawan is a Hindu shrine popular with both Thais and foreign tourists, especially ethnic Chinese visitors from Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere in East Asia.

Any adverse effect on venture-backed companies is likely to be uneven and more complicated than a straight bust. Instead, the effect of a stock market rout is set to move slowly across the start-up landscape, creating a gulf between well-run companies with achievable business plans and those that were funded as part of the back-everything frenzy that began earlier in the decade. But once negative sentiment takes hold, a more widespread downward spiral could quickly unfold.The reason that there will most likely be no uniform start-up deflation is rooted in the pricing of private company stocks. The prices for start-up shares, which are closely held by small groups of investors, generally reset only when the founders go into the market to raise money. (In contrast, public stock prices rise and fall every day in response to a company\u2019s performance and market sentiment.)Over the last few years, start-up share prices have gone up nearly every time a private company has raised money. Investors were largely optimistic and generous because they assumed that a variety of factors \u2014 including low interest rates, a strengthening American economy and the growing Chinese middle class \u2014 would keep the markets positive. Spending more to help a start-up grow into a huge company seemed like a reasonable bet.It is only when companies absolutely need to collect new financing that the rubber may hit the road \u2014 that\u2019s when investors may want more reassurances that the start-ups can survive without the crutch of venture money to subsidize growth. If a start-up cannot provide those reassurances, or if a company has burned through all of its money from previous funding rounds without reaching agreed-upon goals, that could spell trouble.So in the immediate future, a downturn that spreads to Silicon Valley start-ups \u201cwill affect those companies that need to raise capital,\u201d said Matthew Rubin, the director of investment strategy at the asset management firm Neuberger Berman. He said it could take several months for a market collapse to affect the valuations of high-flying private tech names.Start-ups that cannot adapt to a world that prizes profit over growth may ultimately be forced to raise money at the same or lower valuation than in the past, something referred to as a \u201cdown round.\u201d Those can be debilitating: Employee stock options usually become less valuable when a company\u2019s valuation falls, making it harder to retain people. If a company has raised many rounds of capital, later investors often have protections that guarantee a specific cash payout or return on investment. In a down round, those protections are paid for out of the returns that would have gone to earlier investors and employees.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures, said the phenomenon of high-valuation tech start-ups and a market awash in easy money encouraged companies to spend at breakneck speeds.Kevin Mak, the director of Stanford\u2019s Real-Time Analysis and Investment Lab, said financing was still readily available for young companies. He is also an adviser to a three-year-old commerce start-up called Massdrop that closed a $40 million investment two weeks ago.\u201cWe started the fund-raising process two and a half months ago when the market was falling, and it didn\u2019t have a major effect,\u201d Mr. Mak said. \u201cWhen and if we see the market fall 20 percent or more, it will filter through more. But it will primarily be the frothiness of the market coming down.\u201dIt is probably not a bad thing if some private companies stumble, since the start-up market lately has been like Lake Wobegon, a place where all businesses have been above average. Any venture capitalist will also say that the majority of start-up investments lose money and the few bets that pay off offset the losses. So it may be better to identify ailing companies, especially among the enormous $1 billion valuation club, earlier rather than later.\u201cLots of founders today weren\u2019t around in 1999, and they don\u2019t know a thing about financial markets beyond what\u2019s happened in the last 24 months,\u201d Mr. Gurley said in an interview. \u201cTo them that\u2019s how this game is played, money is cheap and everything goes up. That\u2019s why we have cycles.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Says Hudson Tunnels Need Grants, Not Loans to States, From U.S.", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo weeks after the federal government\u2019s top transportation official urged the governors of New York and New Jersey to meet with him about how to solve the problems plaguing rail service between their states, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Sunday that such a meeting would be pointless unless federal officials offered grants, not loans, to finance new tunnels under the Hudson River.Speaking to reporters before the Dominican Day Parade in Manhattan on Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said he was willing to meet with the secretary of transportation, Anthony Foxx, who had asked for a meeting by Monday, \u201cbut there\u2019s no reason to meet now, because it\u2019s very simple.\u201d The states could not afford to pay back a loan, Mr. Cuomo said; only cash would do to help cover the estimated $14 billion cost.\u201cI don\u2019t need your advice; I know we need the tunnel,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll build the tunnel \u2014 I\u2019ll go out there with a shovel myself \u2014 but we need the money.\u201dA whole canyon seems to separate the bargaining positions of Mr. Cuomo and Department of Transportation officials, who say they are offering a good deal under the circumstances, arguing that a loan is the only way to get this crucial project started.From the federal officials\u2019 perspective, a federal grant of significant size seems unlikely at best. Amtrak, the owner of the current tunnels, has proposed building new tunnels, but Congress heavily cut financing for the rail system this year.\u201cWe\u2019re willing to go to extraordinary lengths to help move this project forward using existing federal resources,\u201d said Suzanne Emmerling, a spokeswoman for the transportation department, repeating a statement she first made on Friday, after Mr. Cuomo sent a letter to Mr. Foxx rejecting the offer of a loan. She added that the department was willing to consider trying to obtain money from Congress as well, but first needed all the partners to agree on a way forward.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey canceled an earlier tunnel project in 2010, saying the project, known as ARC, placed an unfair financial burden on New Jersey taxpayers, and neither state has since proposed an alternative. But the issue broke into the open again in July, when a series of crippling train delays disrupted tens of thousands of commutes several days in a row.Shutting either existing tunnel to make the repairs would paralyze transit around the region, significantly cutting the number of trains that could travel between New Jersey and New York, Amtrak officials have said. To make up the difference and increase capacity in the long run, Amtrak has proposed building two one-track tunnels under the Hudson River and committed $300 million to the project, known as Gateway.In his letter asking both governors to meet, Mr. Foxx offered to use a federal railway financing program to help pay for the rest, but emphasized that neither Amtrak nor the individual states could get the job done alone. Both governors have also said their states are willing to contribute to Gateway.\u201cWe\u2019re also going to have to provide some leadership here to move this all forward,\u201d said State Senator Loretta Weinberg of New Jersey, the vice chairwoman of the oversight committee. \u201cWe can\u2019t just everybody point in somebody else\u2019s direction.\u201dAmong those set to testify on Monday are Stephen Gardner, an executive at Amtrak, as well as several New Jersey-based transportation advocates.Senator Robert M. Gordon, the oversight committee\u2019s chairman, said the tunnel project deserved federal funding because of the region\u2019s outsize contribution to the national economy.\u201cUnless we do something about this, we\u2019re going to drive companies to Atlanta or the Carolinas, where getting to work doesn\u2019t require an act of God,\u201d he said. \u201cThere really is no alternative to investing in and improving the transportation system and increasing its capacity to accommodate the growth it\u2019s expected to have.\u201dMr. Cuomo noted on Sunday that the tunnel project, like the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement and La Guardia Airport, has needed attention for many years.\u201cI\u2019m very big with stopping the talk and getting to action,\u201d he said, claiming credit for kick-starting the bridge and airport projects. \u201cThis cross-harbor tunnel is the same thing. Everyone has talked about it for years \u2014 we need it, we need it, we need it. We haven\u2019t gotten anywhere.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba Revenue Misses Expectations; $4 Billion Stock Buyback Is Planned", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors who bought into Alibaba\u2019s growth promise during the roadshow are also more skeptical \u2014 and less forgiving of any stumbles, especially as turbulence in China\u2019s stock market spreads to Chinese companies listed in the United States. Before Wednesday, Alibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, had fallen about 35 percent from its November 2014 highs and it was just 14 percent above the I.P.O. price of $68.Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, has said he is focused on the long term rather than on short-term stock movements. But in a move to shore up the share price, the company said on Wednesday that it would authorize a $4 billion share buyback program over two years. The program is intended to help offset dilution of shares from employee compensation tied to stock.And to signal confidence in the company, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, Joseph Tsai, said neither he nor Mr. Ma would sell their Alibaba shares. Their first opportunity to do so is next month.\u201cI usually don\u2019t speak on behalf of Jack, but on this one he\u2019s authorized me to talk on his behalf,\u201d Mr. Tsai said. \u201cJack and I have zero intentions to sell other than a small amount that is in our charitable trusts.\u201dAlibaba\u2019s swings illustrate the up-and-down nature of the hype cycle that technology companies often undergo. When Alibaba executives pitched the company to international investors last year, they said its future success relied on three engines of growth: growing numbers of Chinese Internet users, a boom in online shopping and a fast-growing Chinese economy.Yet Alibaba has since faced setbacks on each front, such as a slowing growth rate in the number of Chinese Internet users, rising online competition and the bumpy domestic economy. At the same time, several prominent strategic investments and acquisitions have yet to spur growth.\u201cI think most of the disappointment is from the monetization rate, which dropped after the I.P.O.,\u201d said Elinor Leung, an analyst at the brokerage and investment group CLSA, referring to the amount the company makes from each user of its services. \u201cThe reasons for the monetization drop are temporary and don\u2019t change the fundamentals of the business.\u201dIn its earnings statement on Wednesday, Alibaba said that in the quarter that ended June 30, revenue rose to $3.27 billion. Net income that excluded investment gains, which does not meet generally accepted accounting principles, was $1.5 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.The hiring of Mr. Evans followed accords with 20 global clothing brands, whose products Alibaba agreed to begin selling on its e-commerce sites. The hope is that the new exposure will connect foreign companies with middle-class and newly wealthy Chinese looking for the status and quality of foreign products.The company on Wednesday also pointed to signs it was becoming better at making money from smartphones. Alibaba said mobile revenue for its online marketplaces was $1.3 billion, accounting for 51 percent of its retail marketplace revenue in the quarter.Despite the progress, its largest rival, Tencent, still has more users on its banner mobile app, WeChat. The app, which also has an array of online shopping features, has 600 million monthly average users, compared with the 307 million users Alibaba said it had at the end of JuneDuring the earnings call, Mr. Zhang said that along with bringing brands into China, the company would continue trying to help small Chinese businesses sell across the globe.\u201cWe have a very clear international strategy, and this is a core strategy for the coming decades,\u201d he said.Chi Tsang, an analyst at HSBC, said that while Alibaba\u2019s investment in Suning might alienate other retailers, the combination of Alibaba\u2019s online skills and Suning\u2019s rural presence would be \u201cvery powerful.\u201dHe also said Mr. Zhang\u2019s appointment seemed to have pleased the company\u2019s employees.\u201cMy sense is the rank and file really like Daniel Zhang,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hits a high bar, and it\u2019s a good transition.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Candidates Follow Trump to the Bottom on Immigration", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBefore Donald Trump, Republican presidential candidates could deflect tough questions on immigration with vague promises to secure the border and oppose all \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants.Not anymore. Mr. Trump has offered a plan to \u201ctake back our country\u201d from what he calls the rapist-murderer-job stealers being exported from Mexico. He is full of ideas. He would expel 11 million immigrants, and their families, and let only \u201cthe good ones\u201d back in. He would restrict legal immigration, and impose a national job-verification system so that everyone, citizens too, would need federal permission to work. He would build a 2,000-mile border wall and force Mexicans to pay for it. He would replace the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of citizenship by birth with citizenship by bloodline and pedigree, leaving it to politicians and bureaucrats to decide what to do with millions of stateless children. He would flood the country with immigration agents and \u2014 it almost goes without saying \u2014 dismantle the economy and shred America\u2019s standing as an immigrant-welcoming nation.You could say the front-running Mr. Trump has put his opponents in a bind. Or you could say he has given them a gift: the opportunity to be specific in return about what they would do to fix the immigration mess. And to be forthright in rejecting his despicable proposals. Because his plan is so naked \u2014 in its scapegoating of immigrants, its barely subtextual racism, its immense cruelty in seeking to reduce millions of people to poverty and hopelessness \u2014 it gives his opponents the chance for a very clear moral decision. They can stand up for better values, and against the collective punishment of millions of innocent Americans-in-waiting.But as Mr. Trump swells in the polls, his diminished opponents are following in his wake, like remoras on a shark. Several have shuffled onto the anti-birthright-citizenship bus, including Rick Santorum, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Carson and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Even Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who once fought for smart bipartisan immigration reform, wants to repeal birthright citizenship. As does Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a birthright citizen himself. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s other restrictionist proposals, several are firmly lodged again in the playbook of a Republican Party that briefly tried to reform itself after the Mitt Romney debacle. Some candidates are even willing to try to trump Mr. Trump in xenophobia: Mr. Carson is talking about using armed military drones at the border. That\u2019s right \u2014 bombing Arizona.Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida understand immigration issues deeply and presumably want the Latino vote and are well aware of the dangers of having their party hijacked by far-right ideas. They should be opposing Mr. Trump at every turn. But in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s success, their objections are mild, and oddly muted. The danger is that when the campaign is over, no matter what becomes of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, he will have further poisoned the debate with his noxious positions, normalized an extremism whose toxicity is dulled by familiarity and is validated by a feckless party. He has emboldened the fringe lawmakers whose \u201chell no\u201d on any positive immigration legislation has stymied reform for years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Russia the New Iran?", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Whenever Russians think about Iran, soul-searching ensues. Some look at the Iranian system favorably, and some despise it, but in the aftermath of the recent deal to limit Iranian nuclear production in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions and increased commercial contacts with the outside world, many Russians, worried by their country\u2019s growing status as an international pariah, have begun to ask themselves: \u201cAre we the new Iran?\u201dThis may sound strange to foreign ears, but it is not really so far-fetched. Many Russians, both inside and outside the Kremlin, admire the Iranian way of dealing with a hostile world. They respect the country\u2019s determination to develop its own nuclear power, regardless of widespread global opposition. And Tehran\u2019s toughness in the face of crippling economic sanctions struck a chord with President Vladimir Putin and his supporters, who have succeeded in presenting Western sanctions over Moscow\u2019s misdeeds in Crimea and Ukraine as a sinister attack upon their sacred motherland.Many Russians feel much as Iranians felt when their country was hit with sanctions years ago: defiant and eager to prove that no sanctions can affect them. Mr. Putin and his acolytes never tire of declaring that Russia will stand up to the West and prosper on its own.And yet Russia played an important role in negotiating the American-led agreement with Iran. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was a key voice among representatives of the six-nation coalition, never letting the U.S.-Russia conflict over the Ukrainian crisis and other issues get in the way of talks with Iranian officials.Perhaps President Obama was taking this into consideration when he acknowledged Moscow\u2019s contribution to the Iranian accord. Referring to Washington\u2019s tensions with Moscow, Obama said in an interview after the agreement was reached in Vienna that \u201cPutin and the Russian government compartmentalized on this in a way that surprised me.\u201d He added: \u201cWe would have not achieved this agreement had it not been for Russia\u2019s willingness to stick with us.\u201dBut now that Iran is opening up, Russia simply won\u2019t be competitive enough with the West to deliver the kinds of consumer goods and technology that a post-sanctions country would want. In reality, the nuclear deal will increase Russia\u2019s political isolation and hurt its economy \u2014 already reeling from the steep drop in oil prices, a plunging ruble and the effects of Western sanctions. Investors, wary of the Kremlin\u2019s cavalier approach to contracts, prefer to seek opportunities elsewhere. And many of the country\u2019s most talented people, troubled by its dictatorial approach to government, are seeking their future abroad.Meanwhile, high-profile delegations from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries that include dozens of corporate representatives have begun visiting Iran. \u201cEven in the past couple of weeks we have approved more than $2 billion in projects in Iran by European companies,\u201d Reuters quoted the country\u2019s deputy economy minister, Mohammad Khazaei, as saying last month. Iranian officials are hoping for renewed access to consumer goods and are planning a massive revamp of the country\u2019s antiquated infrastructure. Hard-liners may want the bomb, but the leaders who have prevailed want their citizens to have new clothes and gadgets, automobiles and airplanes. Tehran already has announced that it plans to buy as many as 90 aircraft a year from Boeing and Airbus as soon as the sanctions are lifted. If Obama\u2019s gamble to reopen the country pays off, Iranian and Western interests can merge.Russia can certainly compete with the West in the energy sector as well as the arms trade (although the United Nations embargo on weapons sales to Iran won\u2019t be fully lifted for five years). But it still faces a difficult paradox. While the Iranian business climate waxes, the Russian climate will wane. The lifting of sanctions in one nation will further complicate economic conditions in the other. Some international companies, including the same car and equipment manufacturers that are now interested in Iran, are leaving Russia, and even more may follow. Western investors worried by what might await them in Russia are lining up to compete for more lucrative deals in Iran.Mr. Putin supported the Iranian accord because he realized that disrupting negotiations that both Iran and the West wanted to succeed would have only deepened Russian isolation. Perhaps he also has realized that he\u2019s been alone on the world stage all too often. Russia\u2019s aggression against its neighbors, its military games of chicken with NATO, and his own often-comic chest-thumping, are setting him up to take Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s place in the world.Mr. Putin probably realized that he had to support the Iran deal in order to stay in the game. That is why he recently pushed a plan for a \u201cunited front\u201d to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Though this is unlikely to materialize, given that the front would include forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, it\u2019s real purpose was to present our president as an important and engaged global leader.Far more important to we Russians, however, is how and on what terms our country stays in the game. Today it seems as though we are proudly and foolishly marching into the position hastily being vacated by Iran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Prices Jump 17 Percent in Two Days, Despite Glut", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Oil prices jumped for a second day on Friday, sending the United States benchmark past $45 a barrel, a gain of 17 percent in only two days. \u201cThere is no substantial change in either the demand or supply side,\u201d said Tobias Read, chief executive of Swift Worldwide Resources, a Houston-based global oil and gas staffing firm.One event moving the oil markets on Friday was a report of a Saudi ground offensive in northern Yemen, which raised concern that renewed Middle East turbulence might disrupt energy supplies.But the oil market has roughly followed the mood on Wall Street in recent weeks, which has been shaken by fears about China\u2019s economic outlook.The two-day rebound in prices, which had dipped as low as $37 a barrel in recent days and which remain more than 50 percent below last summer\u2019s levels, suggested to some analysts that the market might have established or approached a low.In an investor note on Friday, Morgan Stanley identified several possible catalysts for an oil price recovery, including a potentially large Chinese fiscal stimulus package to foster greater economic growth, more resilient United States economic growth, a future decline in American oil production, and a congressional vote against the Iran nuclear deal, which it said \u201ccould undermine confidence in the deal\u2019s success.\u201dOne reason for the recent price decline is the prospect that Iran could provide as much as a million more barrels a day to the 94-million-barrel global market in a year or so if sanctions are lifted. The market today is as much as two million barrels a day oversupplied.But most oil company executives remain skeptical that oil prices will again approach the $100-a-barrel level anytime soon. They note that China faces continuing economic turmoil that could deplete demand for energy throughout the developing world economies that have been supplying it with raw materials and buying its manufactured goods.They also note that Saudi Arabia and Iraq show no sign of slowing their record-breaking production, while American production has been surprisingly resilient in the face of slumping prices. Oil inventories remain at record levels for this time of the year in the United States.\u201cMarkets and analysts are increasingly pessimistic about demand growth and supply declines materializing,\u201d said Badr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil company based in the United Arab Emirates. \u201cThe global supply surplus remains in place, with inventories continuing to build worldwide.\u201dMotorists continue to benefit from the low prices as the summer driving season enters its final weeks. The average national price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $2.51, according to the AAA motor club, down 12 cents from a week ago and down 92 cents from a year ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spotlight Holds Perils for Carly Fiorina", "Date": "2015-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 There is a strong desire in Republican circles for Carly Fiorina to be on the main stage in the next presidential debate.Few in the party say Mrs. Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, has any chance of winning the nomination or even think she is the best candidate.Instead, they argue that a party that has a problem with female voters can ill afford a sizable top-tier field that is exclusively middle-aged or older men. Moreover, they love her slashing attacks on Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom Mrs. Fiorina frequently calls a liar.Mrs. Fiorina obviously would relish greater visibility, and her supporters anticipate that unlike in the first presidential debate, on Aug. 6, when she was on the undercard, she will be in the main event on Sept. 16.If so, there will be a new level of scrutiny that she may not find altogether welcome.There are two basic rationales for the Fiorina candidacy: She is not a politician, and she was a successful business executive who knows how to run the economy and has dealt with world leaders.The trouble is, she was a politician. She ran for the Senate in California in 2010 and lost by more than a million votes to the incumbent, Barbara Boxer.True, California is a Democratic state, but that was a banner year for Republicans, and Ms. Boxer has never been as popular a vote-getter as the state\u2019s other Democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein.During that campaign, Mrs. Fiorina was seen as smart but politically na\u00efve. She displayed a tendency \u2014 one that remains evident in her presidential quest \u2014 to go into attack mode, which created sympathy, even some Republicans acknowledge, for the hard-edged Ms. Boxer.But her central liability in that campaign was the qualification she held up as her chief asset: her experience as a high-level business executive.Starting as a receptionist, she climbed the corporate ranks. In 1999, she was named chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, the renowned global technology company.She was No. 1 in Fortune magazine\u2019s first list of the most powerful women in business.Not long after arriving at HP, she engineered the deal of the year, a huge acquisition of Compaq, the personal computer company.That soon went south. Profits disappointed, the stock plummeted, she alienated the families of Hewlett- Packard\u2019s founders, along with many employees, and she lost the confidence of the board of directors. In 2005, she was fired. She walked away with $42 million in severance, stock options and pension benefits, which could be hard to explain to voters struggling with jobs and stagnant wages.She still insists that she was a victim of a \u201cboardroom brawl\u201d and dismisses criticism of her record. She says the company doubled in size and added jobs on her watch. That is true, but only because of the Compaq acquisition, which many analysts consider a catastrophe. The company is now splitting into two divisions. Mrs. Fiorina usually dismisses criticism of her claims of success as partisan or politically motivated.She also boasts of her international experience, claiming she has dealt with more heads of state than any candidate other than Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state, and that she understands President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Yet many of her international meetings were with business groups; she had one rather short one-on-one session with Mr. Putin in 2001.Mrs. Fiorina, 60, has an appealing story beyond her rise in business. She is a breast cancer survivor, and is admirably transparent about the death of her stepdaughter from drug abuse and has committed herself to fighting this scourge.And if she gets on the big stage, she might be the one to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, who often disparages women, including Mrs. Fiorina.Nonetheless, her two chief calling cards \u2014 as a successful business executive and a nonpolitician \u2014 may create more problems than opportunities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Greek Bailout Deal Passes, Alexis Tsipras Faces Rebellion", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe dissent may force Mr. Tsipras to soon call for a vote of confidence in his government.But the terms, which also include raising the retirement age and opening various parts of the Greek economy to greater competition, have proved unacceptable to a growing number of lawmakers in Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government.While the measure received the support of some members of the opposition, it had the backing of only 118 lawmakers in the government coalition \u2014 fewer than the 120 lawmakers that Mr. Tsipras needs to survive politically.Among the 149 members of the Syriza party in Parliament, 42 broke ranks with Mr. Tsipras, either by voting against the bailout or abstaining. One other was absent.After the vote, an official close to Mr. Tsipras said the prime minister would call for a vote of confidence in his government after Aug. 20, when Greece needs to repay a \u20ac3.2 billion debt, or $3.6 billion, to the European Central Bank. Mr. Tsipras is counting on the bailout being approved by all parties by that day, so that Athens can make the payment.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.In a stormy parliamentary debate that began at 2 a.m. and lasted until 9:30 a.m. on Friday, Mr. Tsipras eventually took the floor and defended his decision to press for the loan agreement.The bailout deal, which has severely undermined Mr. Tsipras\u2019s base in Parliament, was \u201ca necessary choice\u201d to avoid returning to the drachma, the currency before Greece joined the eurozone, which would have been the equivalent of \u201ccommitting suicide,\u201d the prime minister told lawmakers during the all-night debate.\u201cI do not regret choosing compromise,\u201d he said, adding that accepting the bailout would allow Greece to eventually emerge from recession and \u201cstart returning to growth\u201d by 2018.The new signs of instability in the Tsipras government raised fears among some of Greece\u2019s eurozone critics that Athens could not be counted on to carry out the tough terms of the bailout plans.But the eurozone finance ministers overcame those doubts on Friday, as well as months of bitterness that threatened to split the single currency.The finance ministers ended lengthy talks in Brussels after finessing the final elements of the deal. The sticking points had included the role of the International Monetary Fund and the possibility of reducing Greece\u2019s debt-repayment burden and the process for recapitalizing the country\u2019s beleaguered banks.\u201cThe past six months have been difficult,\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the European Union executive body that helped broker the deal, said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we have looked into the abyss. But today, I am glad to say that all sides have respected their commitments,\u201d he said.The managing director of the I.M.F., Christine Lagarde, said in a statement that the agreement in Brussels \u201creverses much of the policy backtracking that caused the previous program to run seriously off track.\u201dBut Ms. Lagarde said that the fund was not yet in a position to lend more money to Greece. She called on \u201cGreece\u2019s European partners make concrete commitments\u201d during a coming review of the whether Greece was sticking to its promises and targets \u201cto provide significant debt relief, well beyond what has been considered so far.\u201d Only then would the \u201cFund\u2019s Executive Board to consider further financial support for Greece,\u201d said Ms. Lagarde.The I.M.F. was not directly represented at the meeting in Brussels on Friday but participated by conference call, eurozone officials said.In a sign of the mounting political turmoil that Mr. Tsipras faces, however, Zoe Konstantopoulou, a Syriza hard-liner and the speaker of Parliament, had resisted Mr. Tsipras\u2019s entreaties to speed up a vote on the bill so that it could be completed before the finance ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels. Ms. Konstantopoulou sought to stall the vote with a series of grinding parliamentary procedures, which did not block the eventual outcome but did mean that lawmakers had to stay up all night.And before the vote, the former energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza\u2019s radical Left Platform, took the first step toward breaking away. In a statement signed by a dozen other leftists, he said that his group would form a new antibailout movement, one opposed to the memorandum specifying the details of the new loan program. Of the signers, only Mr. Lafazanis is a member of Parliament.\u201cThe struggle against the new memorandum starts now,\u201d Mr. Lafazanis said, \u201cby mobilizing people in every corner of the country.\u201dSpeaking to reporters on Friday after the vote, a government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, indicated that a vote of confidence, possibly followed by new elections, might be coming. \u201cWe will follow the regulations of Parliament and the Constitution,\u201d she said.But first, she said, \u201cthe government will do all that is necessary to stabilize the country\u2019s economic situation.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the signers of a statement.

{"Headline": "Paul Smith\u2019s College Will Get $20 Million, if It Changes Its Name", "Date": "2015-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPAUL SMITHS, N.Y. \u2014 To administrators of the financially troubled college here, Joan Weill\u2019s appearance on campus more than 20 years ago may have seemed like the arrival of a fairy godmother.As the only four-year college in the six-million-acre Adirondack Park, Paul Smith\u2019s is well known in the region for its hotel-management and wildlife and forestry programs. The college\u2019s $36.6 million annual budget is both an economic driver and a source of pride and identity for the rural community in northern New York State. Its student body of about 1,000 doubles the area\u2019s population.For more than two decades, Mrs. Weill has been actively involved in the college\u2019s development and governance, and has served on the board for 19 years. During her tenure, the college added its four-year baccalaureate program; it previously offered two-year degrees in its programs. She and her husband donated millions of dollars to the college over the years. Their contributions helped build a new library and a student center, both of which are named for her. Now Mrs. Weill, the college\u2019s most generous benefactor, has pledged a $20 million donation, one that the college president, Cathy S. Dove, says is critical to the school\u2019s future. But the gift comes with a controversial requirement. In accepting the money, the college\u2019s board must agree to change the name to Joan Weill-Paul Smith\u2019s College.The college was created with money and land bequeathed by its founder, Phelps Smith, to honor his father, a celebrated hotelier. When Mr. Smith died in 1937, his will directed that the school be built on the site of the former Paul Smith\u2019s Hotel. The will also required that the institution be \u201cforever known\u201d as Paul Smith\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences.The requirements imposed by both Mr. Smith in his will and by Mrs. Weill in her proposed gift leave the college in a sticky and increasingly common philanthropic situation. When a benefactor\u2019s gift includes strings, for how long does the recipient have to adhere to those restrictions? In other words, how long is forever?In the college\u2019s case, the decision will most likely be made in court.On Tuesday, Justice John T. Ellis of State Supreme Court in Franklin County plans to consider the college\u2019s request to be released from the \u201cforever\u201d requirement in Mr. Smith\u2019s will.The petition lays out the college\u2019s challenges. It operated at a loss of nearly $2 million in 2013. Its current $27 million endowment cannot keep the college operating in the long term. The college must enroll more students in order to survive. The demographics of college students are changing: They are increasingly coming from ethnically diverse and lower-income households.The high cost of operating, and the college\u2019s $36,000-a-year price tag for students, means that it \u201cis not very selective, accepting approximately 76 percent of all applicants,\u201d according to its court filing.Given those factors, Mr. Smith\u2019s \u201cforever\u201d requirement \u201cnearly fatally impedes\u201d the college\u2019s ability to seek large gifts from a single donor to adapt and grow, the petition said. Holding the school to the provisions of its founder\u2019s will \u201cmay make it impossible to maintain the institution for higher education in the future, as was the general purpose of the gift,\u201d according to the filing.The proposed name change has brought head-scratching opposition from alumni and neighbors, who say they appreciate Mrs. Weill\u2019s generosity but do not understand why the college should change its name.Scott van Laer, a 1993 alumnus who works as a forest ranger in nearby Ray Brook, strongly opposes the addition of Mrs. Weill\u2019s name. \u201cSelling off your naming rights like a sports venue, it calls into question your integrity,\u201d Mr. van Laer said.One commenter, Cai DeGrave, wrote on the college\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cI appreciate her donation but a true beneficiary or philanthropist does not expect anything in return but good will.\u201dBut John W. Mills, who retired last summer after 14 years as president of Paul Smith\u2019s, said that he supported the college\u2019s proposal, and that Mrs. Weill was a \u201cphenomenal woman who has done wonders for that school.\u201dMrs. Weill was attracted to the college\u2019s mission, offering hands-on professional training to students who \u201ccare more about real work than school work,\u201d Dr. Mills said, quoting a faculty member\u2019s description of Paul Smith\u2019s students.Dr. Mills also pointed to the college\u2019s role as an employer offering benefits to about 150 faculty and staff members. \u201cThe point is, in the Adirondacks, every middle-class job counts,\u201d he said. The college\u2019s survival, he added, \u201cis so critical for the lifeblood of the middle-class economy of this place.\u201dDebbie McLean, who lives in Lake Placid and noted that the school had produced some excellent chefs, said: \u201cThe college really, really needs the money. If this is what they have to do, 10 years from now no one will remember the drama.\u201dBecause the college is a nonprofit, the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which oversees nonprofits in the state, must sign off on the change. The office filed a brief with the court that its charities bureau had no objection to Paul Smith\u2019s request. After the brief was filed, the office said it would accept public comment on the issue. About 300 people have written to the attorney general\u2019s office, a spokesman said.A lawyer from the office will make a presentation to the judge at the conference on Tuesday, according to a spokesman from the attorney general\u2019s office.College officials announced on July 20 that the State Board of Regents had approved the new name, and that the change would go forward if the court granted the school\u2019s petition.Mrs. Weill did not respond to a request for comment through the office of the family\u2019s foundation. But she told The Daily Enterprise that she offered the gift in part because the college was unable to raise enough money from its alumni.\u201cPart of my job is to help everyone continue thinking about the very real benefits that our school will enjoy through such a prominent association with Joan Weill,\u201d she added. \u201cJoan and Sandy are held in high esteem among the world\u2019s most generous philanthropic and educational circles, and her name will bring us new opportunities to introduce our school to other supporters of higher education.\u201dElaine Sater grew up in faculty housing at White Pine Camp, near the college\u2019s main campus, and moved back to the area after a career in the Air Force. Both of her parents graduated from Paul Smith\u2019s, and her father taught in the college\u2019s forestry department.Ms. Sater does not think the name change will make much difference in the region.\u201cPeople are still going to call it Paul Smith\u2019s,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The States Show Up Congress on Road Repairs", "Date": "2015-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAs the nation\u2019s bridges and roads deteriorate and Congress dawdles over a serious solution, statehouse politicians have been stepping up at a surprising rate to make some difficult choices.At least half the states have passed transportation funding measures in the last two years to raise some of the billions of dollars needed to repair frayed bridges, highways and mass transit systems that increasingly bedevil commuters and businesses, threatening safety and undermining local economies.States still need the federal funds that they rely on for about half their capital expenditures related to transportation. But governors and legislatures, fed up with delay, have been approving higher fuel taxes, vehicle fees and construction bonds with little hesitation, while the Republican Congress remains stuck on its no-new-taxes campaign mantra.Indeed, instead of confronting the clear need for durable long-term funding, Congress began its August recess by resorting to another temporary patch to keep the depleted federal highway fund operating through October. This was the 34th such patch since 2009, continuing long years of congressional procrastination; the 18.4-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax has not been raised since 1993, truly a disgrace.New roads, bridges and transit systems vital to jobs and local economies can\u2019t be built overnight; they require plenty of advance planning and confidence that the money will be there when construction begins. Hence the rise of do-it-yourself financing initiatives. Iowa, where presidential primary candidates\u2019 denunciations of tax hikes can be deafening, has nevertheless enacted a 10-cents-a-gallon tax increase on gasoline, as statehouse politicians have kept an eye on the worsening road problems.\u201cI don\u2019t know of a state that\u2019s not having the conversation,\u201d Iowa\u2019s transportation director, Paul Trombino, told The Associated Press, speaking as vice president of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.Meanwhile, Idaho raised the gas tax by 7 cents, Nebraska by 6 cents. California legislators have advanced a proposal for a 12-cent-a-gallon rise in the state\u2019s 42-cent gas tax. Connecticut approved $2.8 billion in new transportation bonding across the next five years. Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee has been barnstorming the state for more road funds, bucking fellow Republican critics and warning, \u201cThe need is not going to go away.\u201dAnxious localities aren\u2019t waiting for a federal master plan either. Gas taxes have been enacted in Spokane, Wash.; Normal, Ill.; and Osceola County, Fla.The federal tax is failing to raise enough revenue to meet an annual shortfall of about $16 billion in federal transportation obligations \u2014 a consequence, in part, of the otherwise positive rise in the number of fuel-efficient cars, including electric and hybrid models. A promising alternative solution \u2014 charging fees for miles driven \u2014 has been advanced by Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, and is gaining traction, but whether this Congress is open to such innovation is doubtful.Fortunately, states are showing the way, with Oregon and California experimenting with various schemes, including metering, to find an answer to the gas-tax dilemma. Mr. Blumenauer aside, such thinking is unlikely on Capitol Hill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Cuomo Should Get on Board", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialGovernor Christie\u2019s willingness to discuss what\u2019s called the Gateway Program is encouraging news, especially after he unwisely canceled New Jersey\u2019s participation in an earlier rail tunnel project started in 2010. Now that he is on board, however, it is Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York who needs to come to the table.Mr. Christie has complied. Mr. Cuomo, however, has unhelpfully (and wrongly) suggested that the tunnel is mainly New Jersey\u2019s problem, and has made it clear that he thinks any serious tunnel talks are premature. He said Wednesday on NY1 television that he agreed that a new tunnel was needed, but said the state also has other big needs \u2014 redoing La Guardia Airport, for example, and rebuilding the Tappan Zee Bridge. As for the Gateway Program, Mr. Cuomo said: \u201cThe federal government has to go first. They have to pay the lion\u2019s share.\u201dSenator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has offered a reasonable way forward, proposing the creation of a nonprofit corporation to organize the planning and eventually the financing of the tunnel. That could work. But it means that someone, perhaps Mr. Foxx, will have to corral senior officials from New York, New Jersey, Amtrak, the transit agencies, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the federal government to work together.What\u2019s already clear is that the money for a project of this magnitude has to come from multiple sources \u2014 the Port Authority, the states and, mostly, Washington. If Mr. Christie can agree that a tunnel is worth the money and effort, Mr. Cuomo can, too. As New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, said this week, the increasing delays and breakdowns are \u201cholding back New Jersey\u201d and \u201calso holding back New York.\u201d Mr. Cuomo can always negotiate over the state\u2019s share, but he should engage from the beginning in the planning and support for this critical project.Advertisement"}

It would also further tarnish Germany\u2019s leadership role in Europe.Approval for the Greek package is not in doubt, for Ms. Merkel can rely on the votes of her Social Democratic partners in the coalition government and on opposition Green deputies for the measure to pass the 631-seat Bundestag.\u201cThe greatest interest is not whether the Greek package passes, but what are the political costs for the chancellor?\u201d said Theocharis N. Grigoriadis, a lecturer on the politics of Greece and Eastern Europe at the Free University in Berlin.Mr. Grigoriadis noted that other European parliaments, including in Austria and Spain on Tuesday, had already approved the package and that it would go against the pro-European stance of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats to block the Greek package now.\u201cThey are taking a certain risk if they adopt an anti-European attitude,\u201d he said of the potential rebels.The German newspaper Bild, which in recent months has campaigned steadily against Ms. Merkel and what it sees as her indecisiveness, speculated over the weekend that as many as 100 or even 120 deputies could turn against her. Other news organizations have published much more cautious estimates.Ms. Merkel\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who talked openly of a possible Greek exit from the euro currency before the third bailout was agreed, has spoken up strongly in favor of a yes vote on Wednesday. Unusually, the finance minister, a political veteran who is Parliament\u2019s longest serving member, will present the government\u2019s case before the vote.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble is widely admired in the conservative party and his personal commitment to the new Greek package could sway potential rebels to vote for it.In a 20-minute appearance on German television on Monday evening, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble brushed aside talk of rifts in Europe, emphasizing instead what Berlin is depicting as the newfound willingness in Athens for a serious overhaul of the Greek economy.In Athens itself, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has pushed through changes he was elected in January to oppose, indicated that he might maneuver to postpone any vote of confidence. Political commentators have suggested he would lose any such vote, which would force early elections.An early Greek election could rattle the new confidence that European leaders say they have that the Greek government will continue to approve and put in place economic overhauls, including in sensitive areas like pensions.The International Monetary Fund has yet to join the latest rescue, delaying a decision until a meeting of its board in October. Both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said that Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, would recommend joining the bailout.Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said Monday night that participation by the fund was \u201cindispensable.\u201dMs. Merkel seems to have been already turning to Europe\u2019s other major crisis, the steady flow of migrants seeking safety and economic opportunity on the Continent. Germany is taking in the largest numbers of refugees of any European nation, and Ms. Merkel on Sunday noted the crisis \u201cwill occupy us much, much longer than Greece and the stability of the euro.\u201dThomas Oppermann, a leader of the Social Democrats, told reporters on Tuesday that he expected the number of people seeking asylum to total 700,000 to 800,000 this year.

{"Headline": "Free Puerto Rico, America\u2019s Colony", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe problem is not Puerto Rico, or even the vulture funds that have refused to renegotiate the island\u2019s debts: It\u2019s the rigged capitalism the United States has forced on its Caribbean colony.The United States \u201cliberated\u201d Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898. The following year, Hurricane San Ciriaco destroyed millions of dollars in property and nearly the entire year\u2019s coffee crop. Banks swept in, buying land at a steep discount.Even worse, in 1901, property taxes on every remaining farmer in Puerto Rico were raised. Farmers were forced to borrow from American banks at usurious rates; many lost their land to foreclosure. By 1930, 34 percent of land in use was managed on behalf of absentee owners.A once-diversified island harvest (coffee, tobacco, sugar and fruit) was turned into a one-crop economy, dependent on sugar. By 1930, a collection of syndicates controlled all of the island\u2019s sugar farms.With no money, crops or land, Puerto Ricans left for cities like San Juan, Ponce and Mayag\u00fcez. The Legislature enacted a minimum-wage law, but the United States Supreme Court did not recognize the constitutionality of the law until decades later.In the 1950s, the United States began giving companies tax exemptions to produce cheap products like bras and razors on the island. But once the corporations found cheaper labor in Asia, the factories disappeared.The most unfair law of all is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which requires that every product that enters or leaves Puerto Rico \u2014 cars from Japan, engines from Germany, food from South America, medicine from Canada \u2014 must be carried on a United States ship.A foreign-flagged vessel may directly enter Puerto Rico \u2014 but only after paying taxes, customs and import fees that often double the price of the goods it carries.If the Jones Act did not exist, neither would the island\u2019s debt, and tens of thousands of maritime jobs would shift to the island from Jacksonville, Fla., where the giant carriers Crowley, Horizon Lines and Sea Star Line conduct their offloading and reloading for shipment to Puerto Rico.The island\u2019s Legislature has done what creditors and bond rating agencies have demanded: Since 2010, it has laid off workers; raised prices for water, gasoline and electricity; increased property, sales and small-business taxes; cut public pensions and health benefits; raised the retirement age; and closed schools.No surprise that over the past 10 years, nearly 400,000 Puerto Ricans have moved, many to Central Florida. With a shrinking tax base, Puerto Ricans are unable to meet this burden. Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla calls it a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201dWhat can be done? The Jones Act must be repealed, right away. Congress will have to overcome opposition from lobbyists for the Jacksonville-based carrier companies that control trade to the island.All import fees levied on foreign-flagged vessels should be paid into the Puerto Rican Treasury, not the merchant marine. Any tax abatement deals for corporations should require the reinvestment of a stipulated percentage of profits into Puerto Rican infrastructure and industrial development. Puerto Rico must be permitted to develop its own shipping industry and, eventually, negotiate its own international trade agreements.Independence is the only solution, for Puerto Rico and the United States. After 117 years, many Puerto Ricans are victims of Stockholm syndrome, fearful of losing the \u201csafety net\u201d of United States benefits. But it\u2019s clear that the safety net is a chimera. A gradual transition to independence (like that of the Philippines in 1946) would allow both island and mainland to adjust to a sovereign and self-sustaining Republic of Puerto Rico. It is the only way to end this colonial tragedy.Nelson A.

{"Headline": "Greece Makes Payment to European Central Bank, Avoiding Default", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut most of the new aid package will be used to repay existing debt rather than to rebuild the shattered Greek economy, leading to criticism that eurozone creditors are repeating the same austerity policies that delivered six years in a row of recession in Greece. To qualify for the aid, Greece had to agree to maintain strict discipline while carrying out a long list of changes intended to improve the functioning of its economy.Those harsh terms have split the ruling left-wing Syriza party in Greece. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is now expected on Thursday to call new elections for Sept. 20. While Mr. Tsipras is gambling that voters will give him a clear mandate, his decision could create political turmoil and hamper efforts to stabilize the economy.Still, the money puts Greece on more stable ground.The latest aid, some 13 billion euros, or nearly $14.4 billion, arrived just in time for Greece to repay \u20ac3.2 billion that was due Thursday on government bonds held by the European Central Bank. Failure to pay would have put Greece into default and provoked another crisis.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The Greek economy could benefit in the short term from receding fears that the country would default on its debt and be forced out of the eurozone. Investors may be more willing to risk money on Greece if they believe the country will remain a member of the bloc.Greece faced a particularly heavy debt-repayment burden during the summer, but it has fewer large payments in the months to come. While Greece missed payments to the I.M.F. this year, heightening fears that it would leave the euro, it has since paid the money with the help of a temporary loan from other eurozone countries.Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, on Thursday urged Greeks to take money \u201cfrom under mattresses and from abroad\u201d and redeposit it in banks. The decision by eurozone leaders to support another aid package \u201cguarantees all deposits,\u201d Mr. Tsakalotos said in Parliament.George Aronis, the general manager for retail banking at Alpha Bank, Greece\u2019s fourth-largest lender, said that \u201ca small amount\u201d of deposits had returned to branches in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic, but these things can\u2019t change with the push of a button,\u201d he said.The European Stability Mechanism, the agency responsible for administering aid money on behalf of the 19 countries in the eurozone, said in a statement on Thursday that it had approved giving Greece \u20ac13 billion immediately to meet obligations to the central bank and the International Monetary Fund.A spokesman for the European Central Bank confirmed Thursday that it had received payment for Greek bonds that matured on Thursday. The central bank acquired the bonds as part of an effort to stabilize Greek borrowing costs in 2010.\u201cToday\u2019s E.S.M. disbursement will allow Greece to meet its urgent financial obligations to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, and other budgetary needs,\u201d Klaus Regling, the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, said in a statement. \u201cI am relieved that after intense negotiations with the Greek government and approval by our members, all conditions are now in place to make this disbursement in time.\u201dThe board of directors of the European Stability Mechanism, which consists of finance ministers of eurozone countries, also approved \u20ac10 billion to help stabilize Greek banks. The money could further reassure depositors that the banks will not fail and encourage them to put cash back in their accounts. Greece must apply for the money first, however.There are already some tentative indications of pressure easing on the Greek banks, whose functioning is vital to the economy. This week, the European Central Bank lowered the amount of emergency cash it is making available to Greek banks by \u20ac700 million, to just under \u20ac90 billion.The reduction was considered a good sign. The Bank of Greece, the country\u2019s central bank, requested less emergency funding because the lenders no longer need as much, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was considered confidential.This week, the Greek government slightly relaxed its restrictions on bank transfers that were imposed in late June to prevent any more money from leaving banks. Greeks may now transfer abroad up to \u20ac500 and make larger transfers to pay for college tuition and living expenses. However, Greeks are still not allowed to withdraw more than \u20ac420 a week in cash.\u201cThe worst is behind us,\u201d Mr. Aronis of Alpha Bank said. \u201cBut it will take a while for trust to be fully restored.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.F.L. to Weigh Three Teams\u2019 Proposals on Moving to Los Angeles", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 For two decades, N.F.L. owners in search of public funding for their stadiums have often played a trump card: threatening to move to Los Angeles. In a few months, that ultimatum may ring hollow.After years of stalled negotiations and unused blueprints, the N.F.L. is as close to returning to the city as it has been since the Raiders left for Oakland and the Rams departed for St. Louis in 1995.The Raiders, the Rams and the San Diego Chargers have unveiled plans to build stadiums near Los Angeles, a potential bonanza for the teams and the league. The concentration of fans and companies in the Los Angeles area, the nation\u2019s second-largest market, could lift sales of tickets, merchandise and sponsorships and enhance the N.F.L.\u2019s media rights.But placing one or more teams in Los Angeles, where fans have many other diversions, is no guarantee of success, and it would mean abandoning Oakland, St. Louis or San Diego, which have been solid, if less lucrative, N.F.L. markets.While the owners are unlikely to vote this week, the meetings are a milestone. For years, owners have claimed to be looking at Los Angeles without seriously developing plans to build there. Real estate tycoons have declared plans to build stadiums but have not had teams to fill them. The N.F.L. even considered building a stadium itself.Now, ingredients are falling into place. E. Stanley Kroenke, the Rams\u2019 owner, has plans to build a stadium in Inglewood as part of a new entertainment district, while the Chargers and the Raiders want to build a stadium in Carson, near the intersection of two major freeways. In both cases, developers and financing have been lined up, city approvals have been received and messy negotiations over public funding have been avoided.While the owners are eager to put a team in Los Angeles, they must decide how many can move there as early as next season. One or two teams would be sustainable, but three would be too many. According to some sports experts, moving the Chargers and the Raiders into a new stadium simultaneously would give a boost to two of the league\u2019s least valuable franchises. But if the N.F.L. leaves Oakland, St. Louis or San Diego, it might alienate sponsors and fans.\u201cIt would be robbery to lose our team,\u201d said Johnny Abundez, a member of Save Our Bolts, a Chargers fan group. \u201cFor the past decade, we blamed the City Council, the mayor. But we\u2019ve been working with the mayor this time\u201d to keep the team in San Diego.Under league bylaws, a move needs approval from at least three-fourths of the owners. They must consider public financial support and the condition of a team\u2019s current stadium, as well as \u201cthe willingness of the stadium authority or the community to remedy any deficiencies in or to replace such facility.\u201dMayor Kevin L. Faulconer of San Diego, like his counterparts in Oakland and St. Louis, knows those rules well. To convince the N.F.L. that the city wants the team to stay, he assembled a task force that recommended that a stadium be built next to the Chargers\u2019 current home on city-owned land in Mission Valley. He helped speed up an environmental review so a public vote could be scheduled for January.After more than a decade of false starts, the Chargers say they do not have time to wait for the city to get its stadium approved because the Rams are intent on moving to Los Angeles and grabbing a chunk of the Southern California market. Rather than get caught up in what they consider the city\u2019s unworkable efforts, the Chargers walked out of discussions in June.\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for 14 years in San Diego, and unfortunately the city\u2019s 11th-hour proposal is simply too little, too late,\u201d said Mark Fabiani, the Chargers\u2019 special counsel. \u201cThe Chargers can\u2019t stand idly by and pass on a certain opportunity in the L.A. market while the city of San Diego insists on a plan to skirt California\u2019s environmental laws that will ultimately be thrown out by the courts.\u201dFrustrated, the city has gone around the team.\u201cWe have all the resources in San Diego, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking our case directly to the N.F.L.,\u201d said Faulconer, who has spoken to Commissioner Roger Goodell and others at the league office. \u201cMake no mistake: You can\u2019t have a final plan without a willing partner. You can only achieve success if you work together.\u201dThe dynamic in St. Louis is different. A group of civic leaders backed by Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri has been working on a plan for a $998 million stadium downtown near the Mississippi River. Last week, the group passed a key hurdle when a judge ruled that the stadium authority could roll over its existing bonds to help pay for the new site.Where the Chargers have openly pushed their point, the Rams have mostly stayed mum. The team\u2019s chief operating officer, Kevin Demoff, has attended planning meetings, while Mr. Kroenke, the team\u2019s owner, has remained out of the spotlight.Mr. Demoff \u201chas done everything he can to not impede our cause and tried to help,\u201d said Dave Peacock, a leader of Mr. Nixon\u2019s stadium task force. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get in our way.\u201dFor years in San Diego, it seemed the team and the city could not get out of each other\u2019s way. The Chargers have a sweetheart deal in their current home, Qualcomm Stadium. But it is one of the oldest and most outdated stadiums in the league, and that has restricted the team\u2019s potential revenue. The Chargers are the 26th most valuable franchise in the N.F.L., according to Forbes. (The Raiders are ranked 28th, and the Rams are last.) The Chargers have lobbied for a new stadium since at least 2003, but each attempt has been undone by political and economic events. In 2003, the city was forced to plug a gaping hole in its pension plan and was nicknamed Enron-by-the-Sea, leaving less money to help the team. The collapse of the real estate market ended other bids, and sites that the team looked at did not come through, partly because of political opposition.The mayor\u2019s office also became a revolving door. One mayor was convicted on charges of wire fraud and extortion, and another resigned after being caught up in a sexual harassment scandal.Mr. Faulconer said that while he could not undo the past, he was committed to keeping the Chargers in San Diego.\u201cThere\u2019s so much speculation about what\u2019s happening in L.A., but I need to focus on what we can do in San Diego,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have such positive momentum with our economy.\u201dKnowing that someone somewhere will be hurt if a team moves to Los Angeles, the owners must also consider the chance that the league will be sued. A spokesman for the mayor\u2019s office said San Diego had no plans to file an antitrust suit against the N.F.L. and the Chargers. But someone else could start a case that would further complicate the N.F.L.\u2019s return to Los Angeles.\u201cThe issue for the owners comes back to who raises more of a risk of dragging the N.F.L. into a lawsuit,\u201d said Mark Rosentraub, a director of the Michigan Center for Sport Management. \u201cThis could get nastier before it gets better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "End the Call for a Centralized Eurozone", "Date": "2015-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe Greek crisis has given new life to the superficial argument that the eurozone isn\u2019t working because its monetary union hasn\u2019t been accompanied by fiscal and political union.President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France has called for a eurozone government, with its own budget, which would be accountable to the people via a new eurozone parliament. Pier Carlo Padoan, the Italian finance minister, has backed the idea \u2014 also advocating a eurozone unemployment plan.The European Union\u2019s \u201cfive presidents\u201d \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank, Martin Schulz of the European Parliament, Donald Tusk of the European Council and Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Eurogroup \u2014 have given nuanced support for these ideas. In their June report, they called for a eurozone treasury (effectively a finance ministry for the bloc) and a \u201ccommon macroeconomic stabilization fund\u201d that could help countries weather shocks.The five presidents first want eurozone countries to converge toward best practice on improving competitiveness. They then want legally binding rules to ensure they stay competitive. They also advocate more coordination of macroeconomic policy between the bloc\u2019s 19 countries, with ultimately some joint decisions on national budgets.Such an ambitious centralization of economic power is neither needed nor desirable. Nor is it politically achievable.Creating a common eurozone finance ministry, government, parliament and budget would require a new treaty. This would need the unanimous approval of the 19 countries in the bloc, and probably of the nine other members of the European Union that do not use the euro, like Britain.Even if many eurozone governments agree that political union is needed, they do not agree on the details. Germany, for example, thinks more fiscal discipline is the main imperative. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, its finance minister, was reported last week by The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to want to take away from the commission its current power to police budget rules on the ground that it is too political and soft.Some other governments, by contrast, think the eurozone has already signed up to too much austerity. Not only is there the original growth and stability pact; there is also the six-pack, the two-pack and the fiscal compact \u2014 a bewildering array of budgetary rules that are so constraining in theory that they have often been breached in practice.But say the governments could agree on what they wanted. Given the sharp rise in euro-skepticism, there is little prospect they could then persuade their people to back them.If Mr. Hollande called a referendum, Marine Le Pen of the National Front would have a fantastic platform to rail against the loss of French sovereignty. Even the Italians are becoming euro-skeptic: Beppe Grillo, leader of the Five Star Movement, the country\u2019s second most popular party, has called for Italy to abandon the euro, describing it as an \u201cantidemocratic straitjacket.\u201dDoesn\u2019t this then mean the eurozone is doomed? If 19 countries share the same currency and lose the ability to devalue when they hit problems, surely they also need a common treasury to cushion the blow? And then they need a common government and parliament to give legitimacy to their actions, right?Not so fast. The crisis of recent years has two main causes: lack of competitiveness and excessive government borrowing. There are better ways to address problems of competitiveness than by agreeing on a treaty to mandate it; and we have already seen that treaties requiring fiscal rectitude have been pretty useless.To lift competitiveness, the eurozone needs to free up markets. This will also allow the bloc\u2019s economies to adjust more rapidly to shocks rather than millions of people being turfed out of work.To be fair, the five presidents acknowledge this. Action is needed at a pan-European level to complete the single market in services, the Internet and energy. Creating a capital-markets union would soften the blow when a national economy suffered a downturn by spreading the pain across Europe.The presidents also rightly call for more efficient national labor and product markets. They want each country to set up an independent competitiveness authority to drive this forward.While this may be a good idea, the presidents are wrong to suggest that common standards for competitiveness should be hard-wired into laws applying to all 19 countries. This looks like a recipe for rigidity that will hamper innovation.What about debt? Surely there have to be rules to stop countries from borrowing too much?Not really. Market forces also provide a possible solution. The key is to allow excessively indebted eurozone states to go broke. Preventing this was the cardinal sin in the Greek crisis.If investors knew that governments could go bankrupt, they would be more cautious about lending to them in the first place. The discipline of the markets would replace the discipline of the bureaucrats. The German Council of Economic Experts backed this idea in their special report on the Greek crisis last week.So there are market-based alternatives to political union that could keep the eurozone\u2019s monetary union on the road. They don\u2019t involve a large transfer of sovereignty to Brussels or the imposition of one-size-fits-all policies on 19 diverse countries. As such, they are also preferable.Hugo Dixon is a freelance columnist and the author of \u201cThe In/Out Question: Why Britain Should Stay in the EU and Fight to Make It Better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doubt Starts Chipping Away at the Market\u2019s Mind-Set", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameIn the stock market, until recently, just about any news was good news.Company earnings stumbled? Investors shrugged them off, sending shares higher. Economic growth was disappointing? So what.But now that is changing.But investors seized on the fact that demand for the iPhone and the company\u2019s new smartwatch didn\u2019t meet expectations. Apple\u2019s shares have lost 11.3 percent since then.The reaction to China\u2019s devaluation was even more telling. Instead of viewing it as a competitive tool to lift exports and stimulate growth \u2014 as was the case when Japan took steps to devalue the yen \u2014 global investors were rattled, fearing that it meant the Chinese government was convinced that its economy was in much worse shape than conveyed by official statistics.As investors absorb the meaning of these moves, they also seem to be opening their eyes to other market wonders that may prove ephemeral. The question is, Are we seeing signs of a sea change in investors\u2019 attitudes?Another example is the recent rout in shares of Keurig Green Mountain, the maker of specialty coffee and single-cup brewing systems. A former highflier that traded as high as $137 in January, the stock collapsed after the company warned on Aug. 5 that sales and earnings would decline this year. The shares lost 30 percent the following day and are down 62 percent year-to-date.Trying to plumb the mind-set of investors is always a tricky exercise, of course. But when one investment assumption is questioned \u2014 a perpetually strong Chinese economy, say \u2014 other bits of conventional wisdom go under the microscope too.Doubts may be creeping into the notion that companies with no earnings should trade at sky-high valuations. Some are starting to wonder whether corporate profits are being artificially elevated by share buybacks or other tactics.Then there\u2019s the biggest assumption of them all \u2014 that the Federal Reserve will always be there to save the day.An aging bull market often coincides with investors\u2019 starting to question these kinds of assumptions, strategists say.\u201cThis is the third-longest bull market in 80 years, and we are starting to see some deterioration develop,\u201d Mr. Stack said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cIf you look at market breadth, the number of stocks participating has been narrowing.\u201dEven as the Nasdaq was reaching new highs this year, for example, other indexes, including those made up of transportation stocks or utilities, were trading well off their highs. This divergence is not the sign of a healthy market, Mr. Stack said.Mr. Gannon noted that fully one-third of the companies in the Russell 2000 stock index do not earn any profits, the highest percentage in a nonrecessionary period. And through the second quarter, a majority of the performance in the Russell 2000 index came from companies that lost money before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, he said.\u201cThe laws of finance have been suspended for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Gannon told me last week. \u201cNow this is starting to crack. I think we are on a road to normalization.\u201dIf market sentiment is indeed changing, Mr. Stack is concerned that many investors may be quick to sell their shares in a swoon, amplifying a downturn. He\u2019s especially worried about two groups: investors who have bought shares on margin, using borrowed money, and those who have been pushed into the market in search of returns because of low interest rates.\u201cMoney borrowed to buy stocks tends to be nervous money,\u201d Mr. Stack said.Equally nervous may be the legions of traditional savers who felt compelled to buy equities to generate a viable yield on their investments. \u201cThe multigenerational low in interest rates has driven a lot of people into stocks who would not normally be there,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cThat money could exit the markets quickly once rates start to normalize.\u201dAs an active fund manager who buys shares of companies with established operations and genuine earnings, Mr. Gannon says he is eager for a market in which investors behave more rationally.\u201cThis particular cycle has been affected by the actions of the Fed and the many unintended consequences of what the Fed has done,\u201d Mr. Gannon said. \u201cWe think we are at a point where that is beginning to change.\u201dDistinct market shifts are visible only in hindsight, of course. Still, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to be watchful for them and for the profits \u2014 and losses \u2014 they may bring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "El Salvador Cracks Down on Crime, but Gangs Remain Unbowed", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosSAN SALVADOR \u2014 Seven bus drivers are killed in four days. A morgue worker slowly counts 224 stab wounds on a murder victim. Police officers post memorials to slain comrades and photographs of \u201celiminated\u201d suspects on Facebook.In an offensive started at the beginning of the year \u2014 the latest front in a decades-long struggle to control crime \u2014 the police have pushed deep into the slums where gangs hold sway and three units of elite troops stand by to join the battle on the streets for the first time.But the strategy has backfired, and the violence is intensifying.In June, 677 people were murdered \u2014 twice as many as six months earlier \u2014 in a population of just over six million. About 300 gang members have been killed by the police this year.At the center of the conflict are the main gangs in El Salvador; Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, and two factions of Barrio 18, which operate independently. Their foot soldiers battle for the smallest of spoils, killing each other, those who resist them and anybody who stumbles into the crossfire.Their presence is everywhere in the neighborhoods where they sow fear. They extort shopkeepers and delivery trucks, they sell drugs, they drive those suspected of being informants from their homes and protect turf so fiercely that children living in one gang\u2019s territory cannot cross into a rival\u2019s to go to school.The government crackdown is intended to expel gangs from these neighborhoods, and the police \u2014 as they surge into densely packed slums to round up suspects \u2014 are given free rein to shoot in self-defense under rules announced by the government.President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n said in April that almost 30 percent of the killings in March involved gang members shot in skirmishes with the police.Although his crackdown is politically popular, a growing number of voices are beginning to warn against the abuses as innocent people are caught up in the police sweeps and reports emerge that police are killing gang suspects. Human rights violations in the crackdown \u201cwill lead us into a vicious circle from which it will be difficult to leave,\u201d said the Jesuit-run Central American University in a recent editorial.Mario Vega, an influential evangelical pastor, wrote in the daily El Diario de Hoy, \u201cWhile the current government is the one that most consistently talks about preventing violence, in practice it is the most repressive government since the war.\u201d\u201cThe current government has taken repression to the level of excessive use of force, arbitrary detention and summary executions,\u201d he wrote.On the streets, officers argue that they need even more flexibility to confront gangs that are becoming better armed. \u201cWe are limited by human rights,\u201d said Samuel Hern\u00e1ndez, an officer on a recent night patrol.To show what his days are like, he pulls out his phone to flick through pictures: the body of a teenager, shot by the police after he fired on them; another teenager, his head swaddled in bandages after a beating by rivals.\u201cThis is a problem that has been growing for years, that was never confronted at its birth and was allowed to grow practically without any clear policy,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Dada, a former economy minister and legislator. \u201cNow the dimension of violence in the country is enormous.\u201dMr. S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n\u2019s offensive is a decisive rejection of a truce that was tacitly approved by the previous government. The deal, which was reached with imprisoned gang leaders, cut homicide rates in half for 15 months until it began to break down about two years ago.As part of that agreement, the government moved gang leaders to poorly guarded prisons where many continued to run their businesses by cellphone. That ended in February when the government returned the gang leaders to a maximum-security lockup and cut them off from their lieutenants.\u201cIt is clear to us that the government is beating the drums of war,\u201d said a gang leader who would identify himself only as Santiago. He attributed the violence to the move, which separated the leaders from the rest of the gang\u2019s loosely organized structure and lifted all controls over violent local cells.\u201cThe base is left like a family without its father,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe cannot mobilize the way we need to in order to reduce the homicides.\u201dSome analysts say that the previous government\u2019s truce is responsible for the violence because it showed the gangs they could use it as a tool to back their political demands. Henry Campos, a law professor at the Central American University and a former security official, said the spike in murders is a tactic to force the government to negotiate.But in a handwritten letter smuggled out of the maximum-security prison and addressed to a citizens\u2019 advisory group and the country\u2019s justice minister, the gang leaders charged that the government\u2019s recent crackdown \u201chad increased gang violence disproportionately\u201d and asked to open a dialogue with civil society organizations.While San Salvador was crippled by the transport shutdown in July, Mr. S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, a former guerrilla commander during the civil war, replied to the gang leaders. \u201cI want to tell these murderers, these criminals, that they won\u2019t break the will of the government and the Salvadoran people,\u201d he said.\u201cAt no time is our government prepared to negotiate with these criminals,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are going to hunt them down, capture them and put them on trial.\u201dThe government argues that the crackdown is part of a broader approach to improve education and job creation in the most violent communities, rehabilitate gang members, and strengthen the rule of law.The strategy\u2019s road map is an ambitious $2.1 billion plan developed with the help of the private sector, churches and aid groups.But El Salvador\u2019s limping economy cannot create the jobs that are needed to provide an alternative to the gangs. Growth has hovered around 2 percent for years. Remittances from Salvadorans working in the United States account for about 17 percent of national income, and half the work force toils in the informal economy.\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce security from economic reactivation,\u201d said Rafael Pleitez, an economist who helped draw up the plan.Where the money will come from is unclear. El Salvador\u2019s tax collection is full of holes, and many in the conservative private sector would rather create their own charity initiatives than sign on to a vast program directed by a government led by former leftist guerrillas.Mr. L\u00fcers said that even if there were money, \u201cthese plans for social inclusion won\u2019t work in a climate of conflict.\u201dThat contradiction is playing out in Ilopango, a suburb on the rural edge of the capital where the loquacious mayor, Salvador Ruano, received masked gang leaders in his office two years ago to negotiate a local cease-fire.Since then, Mr. Ruano has used his small budget and some international aid money to create jobs for gang members and their families and set up a few technical schools.\u201cWe are delivering fewer murders in Ilopango,\u201d Mr. Ruano said. \u201cWe have nothing to hide.\u201dIn past weeks, he had to shut down a bakery he set up for gang members after a police crackdown swept up some of the boys working there. The police burst into a tomato greenhouse and trampled the crop, ostensibly looking for guns. Only a modest chicken farm is still operating undisturbed, where teenagers in gang attire cup their hands gently to move tiny chicks under a heat lamp.Others have questioned whether the government will keep its promises.\u201cAs long as there is no political will to care about youth, this scourge will grow,\u201d said Raquel Montoya, who works in gang neighborhoods and prisons for the evangelical San Andr\u00e9s Foundation. \u201cEverybody has opinions, but they don\u2019t put anything into practice.\u201dGene Palumbo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Yet by the end of the upswing on Thursday, investors\u2019 gloom had eased.In the United States, stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, have climbed more than 6 percent from the low at Tuesday\u2019s close. And after days of dizzying declines, Chinese stocks ended their day Thursday over 5 percent higher, after a last-minute rally. On Friday, the main index in Shanghai was up more than 1 percent in early trading.Bystanders were left struggling to understand the market gyrations. Do the pessimists have a stronger case than optimists right now? Or perhaps they are both right in certain ways, which is why even Wall Street pundits struggle at times to make sense of all the swings and apparent crosscurrents.At the end of the day, discerning the messages coming from the financial markets can be a fruitless task. \u201cThe market tends to whisper,\u201d said Kenneth J. Monaghan, a portfolio manager who focuses on high-yield bonds at Amundi Smith Breeden, an asset management firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of background noise that makes it harder to hear that whisper.\u201dAt the best of times, investors\u2019 mood swings can make stock markets hard-to-follow indicators that reflect as much ignorance as knowledge. But the action in the markets this week has been particularly confusing.The S.&P. 500 closed up 47.15 points, or 2.4 percent, on Thursday. It is now down 6.7 percent from its record high, reached in May. But on Tuesday, when the index closed at its lowest level this week, it was 12.4 percent off that high.At those lows, a bear market \u2014 when stocks decline 20 percent or more \u2014 did not seem out of the question. But after two strong up days, it seemed plausible that the six-year bull market that started in 2009 might now resume. \u201cWhat has happened the last couple of days gives you some confidence,\u201d said Philip J. Orlando, a senior portfolio manager at Federated, a mutual fund firm. \u201cIt was a little bit of a panic and an irrational move,\u201d he added, referring to troughs earlier in the week.The Dow Jones industrials average leapt 369.26 points, or 2.3 percent, to 16,654.77 on Thursday. It is now down 9.05 percent from its all-time high, which means it is no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for a market decline of 10 percent or more. The Nasdaq, which contains a lot of technology stocks, was up 2.5 percent on Thursday. It was even a good day for the price of oil, which has borne the brunt of the bearishness over China and the global economy. The benchmark New York crude contract jumped $4.18, or nearly 11 percent, to $42.78 a barrel.Stock and bond prices are driven by things that happen in the real word, like corporate earnings and economic releases. During the selling, then, it was important to ask whether major economies and profits were really going to weaken considerably. After all, a scare about global growth last fall forced stocks sharply lower, only to rebound strongly in the following months.Plenty of problems exist in the world that could flare up and drag down global growth. China\u2019s economy, for instance, appears to be in a bind, underscored by what appears to be erratic policy making by its leaders. Those leaders have intervened to shore up the stock market, promote bank lending and loosen monetary policy. But such moves could stifle the role of market forces as the country aims to reorient its economy so that consumer spending plays more of role in driving growth.\u201cThe pace of monetary easing seen in recent months, and the relative lack of communication to explain it, has created the impression, rightly or wrongly, of an increasingly panic-stricken Chinese central bank,\u201d Christopher Wood, an analyst at CLSA Limited, a leading brokerage firm in Asia, wrote on Thursday in a research note.The pressure on developing countries is likely to remain. In particular, companies from emerging markets that have borrowed heavily in dollars may now find it harder to pay back such debts as the dollar increases in value against emerging market currencies. If economies in developing countries then slow, they might buy less from the United States and Europe, damping growth in both places.And if global market mayhem does weigh on growth, central banks like the Federal Reserve can step in to stimulate economies. Central bank interventions can provide some support and certainty to financial markets. After all, Mr. Dudley\u2019s remarks \u2014 in which he expressed less enthusiasm for a possible increase in interest rates by the Fed next month \u2014 helped set off the latest rallies in stocks.\u201cQ.E. has become the go-to policy response for central banks, but low productivity and heavy debt overhangs will continue to weigh on growth,\u201d analysts at RBS wrote in a research note on Thursday. But for all the skepticism about quantitative easing, it appears to have helped stoke stronger growth in the United States than in other developed countries. Or perhaps the bulls are right for now about the stimulus, and the bears will be vindicated when it finally ends.No one really knows when the stimulus will end, of course. Over the coming months, that means markets will most likely move unpredictably as investors interpret pronouncements from central bankers. Still, people who are not investing actively can be reassured by one thing: Recent history shows that short-lived stock market corrections that do not turn into bear markets typically do not cause businesses to stop investing and people to stop spending. Or as Mr. Dudley put it on Wednesday: \u201cThe stock market has to move a lot \u2014 and stay there \u2014 to have implications for the U.S. economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the percentage increase in the Shanghai Composite Index on Thursday. It was 5.3 percent, not 5.4 percent. The error was repeated in a capsule summary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Markets Vex China's Leaders", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 1992, Bill Clinton came up with the famous formula that won him the White House: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d Chinese leaders have taken this approach to a stratospheric level. They feel a need to deliver economic miracles at all times and under all circumstances. This insistence on appearing to be omnipotent is among the reasons why the Chinese government allowed a stock market bubble to form and why it is now trying desperately to prevent it from bursting. Since mid-June, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index has declined by about 30 percent. While a precipitous fall of share prices is worrisome, even after the recent market routs the Shanghai index is still some 65 percent higher than it was a year earlier, while the shares of China\u2019s small- and medium-cap companies remain among the most expensive in the world. Still, Chinese leaders appear determined to reverse the market declines. Some of their measures have been extreme and sweeping: a massive share-purchase program by the government, prohibiting sell-offs by major shareholders, banning new I.P.O.s, suspending trading of many shares, investigations into short-selling \u201cwith a malicious intent,\u201d and dispatching a public security official to examine trading records.The bull run started a year before the tumble in June. The Shanghai index was at 2,051.71 points on June 12, 2014, and it peaked at 5,166.35 on June 12, 2015. Before this surge, the most significant contribution of China\u2019s stock markets had been their irrelevance to the real economy. The Shanghai index hardly increased between 2000 and 2013 \u2014 except for 2007, the year of euphoria before the Beijing Olympics \u2014 while the Chinese economy grew rapidly, overtaking Japan as the second largest economy in the world. By comparison, the Sensex index in Mumbai quintupled in the same period, in a country that many consider an economic laggard compared with China.But during the bull run preceding the June crash, the financial sector became linked to the rest of the economy through the extensive use of margin trading \u2014 the practice of using borrowed funds to purchase shares. Margin debt increased fivefold during this period, and it was the singular force that fueled the market rise. Chinese financial regulators justified their recent market interventions on the grounds that defaults on the margin trades can pose systemic risks to Chinese banks. There is some merit to this argument, but the logic is similar to the one used by the boy who pleaded for leniency because he was an orphan \u2014 after he had killed his parents. The current mess is entirely due to the active encouragement by the authorities to invest in the markets and to lax regulations. Editorials in People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, talked up the market, and regulatory authorities tacitly permitted the dangerous practice of margin trading. The fundamentals for the market surge were noticeable only in their absence. G.D.P. slowed substantially during this time, and many companies reported deteriorating earnings. The economy\u2019s overcapacity worsened, and Europe, an important trading partner with China, was mired in a recession. Yet the stock markets surged. This was not irrational exuberance; it was exuberant irrationality. People outside the small band of policy elite do not know why these leaders chose this course, but there is a long obsession among Chinese officials for impressive G.D.P. numbers. Maybe the statistical hawks gained the upper hand in arguing that anything short of miracle growth would be a disaster for the leadership. After President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang ascended to power in 2013, they wisely began to tone down the G.D.P. expectations by talking about \u201ca new normal\u201d \u2014 the notion that growth would be around 7 percent a year rather than 9-to-10 percent a year. This was sensible. After 30 years of supercharged expansion, the Chinese economy is much bigger today \u2014 and it is simply much harder to grow fast from a higher base than from a lower base. By 2014, China had picked much of the low-hanging fruit for economic growth, such as simple labor-intensive manufacturing and export processing. To transition to the next phase of growth \u2014 powered by technology and innovations \u2014 requires time, patience and, above all, economic and political reforms. Despite the new normal formula, the growth imperative returned. Between November 2014 and May 2015, the central bank cut interest rates three times and then another time in June to support the stock market. This liquidity injection, finding nowhere to go in an economy saddled with overcapacity, helped fund speculation in the stock market. In the short term, the market run provided superficial solutions to a range of problems brought about by G.D.P. slowdowns. Higher valuations make companies look less debt-ridden than they are in reality and, for consumers, rising share prices can make up for the losses of labor income and induce much-needed consumption.Rather than accepting a moderation of growth rates and deepening reforms, the Chinese leaders pressed on with a risky strategy of inflating and preserving asset bubbles as a way to show they still had the magic touch. The irony is supreme. One of the singular achievements of the Chinese leaders since 1978 is that they have moved the country away from the Mao era of government omnipotence by opening the country to trade, foreign investment, private entrepreneurship and to a capital market not fully controlled by the state. The Chinese economy boomed not because the state has become more powerful but because the state has become less powerful. Chinese leaders are often their own worst enemies. They suppress press freedom despite the fact that a free press is the best deterrent to corruption, an endemic problem that Mr. Xi has spent major political capital to combat. They arrest lawyers who check and balance the power of local officials, whose abusive behavior taints the reputation and the legitimacy of the central government. And they picked a mercurial and unpredictable institution \u2014 Chinese stock markets \u2014 to showcase their skills and know-how to deliver growth. By unleashing margin trading, the government has inadvertently imported the volatility of the stock markets into what many Chinese believe to be the pillar of stability and safety: the country\u2019s banking system. The amount of wealth lost \u2014 estimated between $3 trillion and $4 trillion \u2014 is simply too big for any intervention program to make whole. The biggest loss, however, is the credibility of a government that insists on being judged on the basis of omnipotent power it no longer has. Advertisement"}
