{"Headline": "Soothing Talk by Federal Reserve Official Buoys Wall Street", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce again, the Federal Reserve helped save the day for investors.The United States stock market soared in late trading on Wednesday, shrugging off earlier declines in China and Europe. The powerful rally, which came after several days of severe plunges in the world\u2019s major stock markets, was inspired by soothing words from an influential Fed policy maker. At a news briefing in New York, William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the recent turmoil in the financial markets was a risk to the United States economy. Crucially, he added that he found the prospect of raising interest rates next month \u201cless compelling.\u201d Mr. Dudley\u2019s words were manna for investors who had been starved of good news in recent days. On Thursday, stocks in Asia opened broadly higher for the first time since last week, including in Shanghai, where the main index was up more than 2 percent. Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial, said the remarks were \u201clikely to have influence well beyond today.\u201d On Wednesday in the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broad measure of the market, closed 3.9 percent higher, at 1,940.51. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial average gained almost 4 percent, or 619 points, to end at 16,285.51. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained more than 4.2 percent to end at 4,697.54. It was the first positive day for all three market indicators after six days of losses.The respite from selling may yet prove to be temporary, but the trading on Wednesday showed that the Fed still holds a strong sway over investors\u2019 sentiment.Until the recent sell-off, investors had been betting that the Fed would raise interest rates for the first time in nine years at its September meeting. Now, after Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments, a rate increase next month appeared to be all the more unlikely. \u201cFrom my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September F.O.M.C. meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u201d he said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that steers monetary policy. Mr. Dudley is a member of the committee.Those words raised hopes that a long-running era of cheap money that has buoyed markets would run a bit longer, at least past the next F.O.M.C. meeting on Sept. 16 and 17. \u201cI do not believe that Fed officials thought financial markets were quite as fragile as they proved to be in the last week, and they tend not to want to tighten policy during these periods of market turmoil,\u201d said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon, who keeps a close watch on the Fed.More broadly, Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments on Wednesday underscore a relationship between the Fed and financial markets that some analysts have come to describe as unhealthy.During the financial crisis about seven years ago, the Fed became the central bank to the world, providing emergency loans to global banks and funneling dollars to countries where there were shortages. The stimulus helped bring the financial system back from the brink of collapse and fueled a recovery in the United States that has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs.Still, in recent years, the Fed\u2019s ultralow interest rates may have also pushed stock and bond prices to what appeared to be unsustainable highs. Many investors even saw the plunges of the last few days as a healthy corrective to the ebullience. And some analysts have asserted that a September rate increase might be a good thing for stock and bond markets, because it would remove a nagging source of uncertainty.If the Fed does hold off on raising rates, it may seem like an indulgent overreaction, especially if stocks climb back to their recent peaks.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Stock market slides need not do collateral damage to the real economy \u2014 which Mr. Dudley seemed to acknowledge on Wednesday. \u201cThe stock market has to move a lot \u2014 and stay there \u2014 to have implications for the U.S. economy,\u201d he said. He also suggested that a September rate increase could still occur if economic and financial conditions were to steady.Even with Wednesday\u2019s rally, the S.&P. 500 is down nearly 6 percent this year, but it is no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for a market\u2019s being down 10 percent or more from its most recent high. After the rally, the benchmark is now down 8.9 percent from its high, reached in May. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 11 percent from its high, also reached in May. The stock market was powered higher on Wednesday by technology stocks, including Google, which rose 8 percent on the day. Trading was less volatile than it has been in some recent sessions, with Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge, the Vix index, down for a second consecutive day. In other markets, oil was weaker, with the benchmark United States crude contract falling 1.91 percent, to $38.56 a barrel.The recent sell-off in stocks has wiped about $1 trillion of value from the S.&P. 500, depleting households\u2019 nest eggs and perhaps delaying some spending. The S.&P. 500 is now lower than its peak in 2000, adjusting for inflation, according to data compiled by Prof. Robert J. Shiller of Yale.Still, stock market corrections have often come and gone, usually with little consequence. And, importantly, they do not always signal tough economic times ahead.\u201cCorrections are generally three times as frequent as recessions,\u201d David Bianco, a strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said in an email, referring to the period since 1960. \u201cThis time I think the cause isn\u2019t about U.S. recession risk.\u201dThe last time the stock market declined more than 10 percent was in 2011. But the United States economy has mostly grown steadily since then. Corrections hit the stock market in 1997, 1998 and 1999, according to data from S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, and in each of those years the United States economy grew by more than 4 percent. This shows that stock market corrections can be relatively isolated events that are driven more by concerns about the strength of corporate profits. Mr. Bianco noted that the profits of companies within the S.&P. 500 had been flat in recent quarters and were likely to remain sluggish for a while. \u201cI believe that is the cause of the correction,\u201d he said.The recent wave of selling was set off in part by China\u2019s surprise devaluation of its currency, the renminbi, on Aug. 11.Since the country\u2019s stock market started plunging in June, after a rally that more than doubled share values in a year, China\u2019s leaders have been scrambling to prop up the markets. But shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen have continued to slide. Officials now appear to be tacitly acknowledging the failure of their efforts to rescue shares.Li Kui-Wai, an associate professor of economics and finance at the City University of Hong Kong, said such measures amounted to \u201cfinancial socialism.\u201d\u201cBasically they just try to bail out everything,\u201d Mr. Li said on Wednesday. \u201cThe market is unsure about what China can do or will do, other than interfering in it,\u201d he added, referring to the state measures.Binyamin Appelbaum, Neil Gough and David Jolly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Turmoil Prompts New Speculation on the Fed\u2019s Timetable", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the first public indication that Fed officials had been rattled by recent market turbulence, which had already led many investors to conclude the Fed would wait a little longer before raising rates.\u201cFrom my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September F.O.M.C. meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u201d Mr. Dudley said, referring to the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.Even if the Fed hesitates, Mr. Dudley said he would hope to move later this year, at a subsequent meeting in October or December. He has emphasized previously that he does not want the timing of a move to come as a surprise for investors.\u201cNormalization could become more compelling by the time of the meeting as we get additional information on how the U.S. economy is performing and more information on international and financial market developments, all of which are important in shaping the U.S. economic outlook,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.For all the hedging in Mr. Dudley\u2019s comments, some analysts saw them as confirmation the Fed is unlikely to move at its meeting next month, scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17. Market-based measures of investor expectations, which have fallen alongside the stock market, already put the odds of a September rate increase at just 24 percent Wednesday.\u201cThe odds of a September rate hike have just dropped further, and we have to push our forecast for the first move to December,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told clients Wednesday afternoon. \u201cA massive payroll number next week, coupled with strength in August auto sales, retail sales and the ISM surveys, could yet persuade the Fed to move, but markets would have to rebound significantly too, and this all seems a bit too much to ask.\u201dBut Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in an email on Wednesday that he still saw a real chance for a September increase, provided markets behaved and the domestic economy continued to show strength.\u201cI do think he left the door open to September just a tad, which makes sense given that markets and payrolls can surprise in a bunch of ways,\u201d Mr. Feroli said.The Fed is marching toward higher rates because officials are concerned the economy will eventually overdose on easy money. While recovery from the recession remains incomplete, monetary policy works slowly, and the Fed is wary of the risk that the economy will overheat in coming years. The unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent in July, and policy makers at the central bank are hesitant to push it much below 5 percent.The government reported Wednesday that orders for durable goods rose 2 percent in July, the latest in a string of positive data. Analysts expect the government on Thursday to raise its estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product.But an economic slowdown in China, and that government\u2019s troubled response, have buffeted global financial markets in recent weeks, driving down equity prices, contributing to a new round of declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, and sending a rush of money into safe assets like United States Treasury securities.Some developments, like lower oil prices, will benefit American consumers. Others, like the decline of stock prices, are erasing wealth that might have been spent.The question confronting Fed officials is whether they are sufficiently confident about the resilience of domestic growth to raise interest rates.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, is scheduled to speak Saturday at an annual conference for monetary policy makers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Other Fed officials also plan to attend the gathering, where the impact of recent market developments will certainly be a major topic of discussion.Even as Mr. Dudley suggested a September rate increase was less likely, he cautioned on Wednesday against assuming the Fed would significantly alter its plans. He dismissed the possibility of a new round of stimulus.But the Fed might decide to wait a little longer. Markets have not found their balance, and Mr. Dudley noted that it was too soon to gauge the impact of the market downturn in broader indicators. The government, for example, will release next week a report on August job growth based on a survey conducted earlier in the month.William Lee, the head of North American economics at Citigroup, described Mr. Dudley\u2019s remarks as careful and balanced. If the market downturn continues, and broadens, Mr. Lee said he would expect the Fed to delay raising rates. If markets find their balance, he said he still expected the Fed to move in September.\u201cIt\u2019s a little more violent than people would like,\u201d Mr. Lee said of the market correction. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than people would like. But is it surprising? It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dMore important, he said, was the continued strength of domestic economic data.But Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon and a close Fed watcher, said that the Fed, in effect, was already tightening domestic financial conditions by standing still while central banks in other countries, including China, were racing to stimulate their economies. Raising domestic interest rates under those conditions, he said, would be \u201ctoo much, too fast.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated where Mr. Dudley held a news conference.

{"Headline": "Investors Find Ways to Indirectly Profit From Valuable Start-Ups", "Date": "2015-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Airbnb\u2019s valuation has ballooned over the last few years as large financial firms like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price have rushed to invest in the start-up. But a small San Francisco-based hedge fund called Pier 88 Investment Partners has decided that the fervor for Airbnb shares creates a different kind of opportunity.Frank Timons and LeAnne Schweitzer, the co-founders of Pier 88, believe there is money to be made on this big gap between public and private company valuations. In their view, the public companies are such relative bargains that they will make great acquisitions for purchasers that want to better compete with upstarts like Airbnb. Then, when those publicly traded companies are snapped up \u2014 often for a premium of more than 50 percent \u2014 Pier 88 can profit from the bet.\u201cPeople think there\u2019s something inherently wrong with public assets because they\u2019re cheaper,\u201d Mr. Timons said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m buying decent assets at a relative discount to the private marketplace, the risk-reward is probably in my favor.\u201dPier 88 is an example of how some investors are trying to take advantage of the current start-up boom without directly investing in the start-ups themselves. While venture capitalists and large investors like Fidelity, BlackRock and Tiger Global have the deep pockets and connections to buy into start-ups, many other investors have neither the capital nor contacts to get a chunk of popular companies like Airbnb, Uber and Snapchat. As a result, they are coming up with roundabout ways to get a piece of the action.For Pier 88, the growing valuation gap between start-up and publicly traded companies makes some stocks seem like even better bargains for buyers, and there is an increasing number of such disparities to bet on. So much money has been poured into fast-growing technology start-ups in the last few years that there is now a herd of \u201cunicorns,\u201d the privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion, and \u201cdecacorns,\u201d which are valued at more than $10 billion.It\u2019s not perfectly accurate to directly compare market capitalization and private company valuations, since private companies keep their true financial pictures hidden.Still, \u201cthe easy private financing environment has created an interesting trade opportunity,\u201d said Kenneth J. Heinz, the president of Hedge Fund Research, which tracks hedge funds and their performance. \u201cWith such a disparity between public and private multiples, it\u2019s a reasonable fundamental approach to believe that in this environment, the public company valuation will come up or the company will be acquired.\u201dThe last time so many private companies were more expensive than their public company counterparts was in the late-1990s dot-com bubble, said David Walrod, a former partner at the venture capital firm Oak Investment Partners who sits on Pier 88\u2019s board. After that bubble turned into a bust, investors placed more value on the fact that publicly traded shares are easy to sell and that the companies disclose detailed financial information.Mr. Walrod added that he was not as worried about the big valuation gaps this time around because the new boom is spurred by structural factors like low interest rates and lots of venture money, and many unicorn companies have legitimate businesses.The co-founders set up their fund to invest in publicly traded tech and health care companies that will eventually be acquired by buyers seeking innovation, with the private valuation boom just one factor that could spur an acquisition.Pier 88 said its investing strategy required patience since it took time for its holdings to rally or be acquired. The firm\u2019s first group of investors agreed to have their money locked up in the fund for three years so that Pier 88 would have time for its strategy to work. For those investors, the firm charges no management fee and a 10 percent performance fee.Ms. Schweitzer said the three-year lockup period also lets her firm invest with a longer horizon than the average hedge fund, an approach that can create a lot of ups and downs. Reid Sanders, a Pier 88 board member who founded the $29 billion mutual fund firm Southeastern Asset Management, thinks about it this way: \u201cPrivate valuations are really all over the place, too, but there\u2019s just no daily price quote to make you sick to your stomach.\u201d\u201cThese companies aren\u2019t perfectly analogous with their private counterparts, but we\u2019re looking at neighborhoods to find assets that could be useful to lots of different companies,\u201d Mr. Timons said. \u201cPandora could make a nice fit in a media or Internet company. Jive could be a nice tuck-in for a big enterprise company or, given its huge cash balance sheet, it would be a great private equity target.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Warning on China Seems Prescient", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookKenneth Rogoff has long warned of a potential financial crisis in China.Mr. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University, accurately predicted the eurozone debt crisis and for years has been telling anyone who would listen that China posed the next big threat to the global economy. He is starting to look right, again.\u201cIn economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they happen faster than you thought they could,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said on Monday from Cambridge, Mass., repeating a favorite line from Rudi Dornbusch, the German economist. (Mr. Rogoff sat in on Mr. Dornbusch\u2019s class at M.I.T. in 1977.)Mr. Rogoff, who is a chess grandmaster, has made a career of studying financial crises. After the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Rogoff co-wrote \u201cThis Time Is Different,\u201d a seminal book that examined eight centuries of financial crises.Every financial crisis, he and his co-author, Carmen M. Reinhart, concluded, stems from the same simple problem: too much debt.To understand the wild machinations of the stock market in recent days in the United States and abroad, you need to look no further than China\u2019s astounding debt load and sputtering economy \u2014 and its ability to infect the rest of the world.\u201cChina is the classic \u2018This time is different\u2019 story,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said, rattling off all the different rationalizations for why the country convinced itself \u2014 and many others \u2014 that it could load up on debt but was somehow immune to the laws of economic gravity. He cited the government\u2019s control over the markets, the hundreds of millions of workers migrating to cities and the country\u2019s saving rate of about 30 percent of disposable income as just some of the reasons China was said to be impervious to a severe downturn. \u201cIt\u2019s very vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Rogoff added. \u201cThere is a lot of debt.\u201dHow much debt remains an open question, given the opacity of China\u2019s market. The country\u2019s debt load rose from $7 trillion in 2007 to $28 trillion by mid-2014, according to a report published earlier this year by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, China. \u201cAt 282 percent of G.D.P., China\u2019s debt as a share of G.D.P., while manageable, is larger than that of the United States or Germany,\u201d said the McKinsey study. \u201cSeveral factors are worrisome: Half of loans are linked directly or indirectly to China\u2019s real estate market, unregulated shadow banking accounts for nearly half of new lending, and the debt of many local governments is likely unsustainable.\u201dA look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.The question then becomes how interconnected China\u2019s economy is to the rest of the world. That\u2019s exactly what investors have been trying to determine over the last several weeks as China\u2019s government has devalued its currency and tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to stabilize its plummeting stock market. The drop has been worsened, in part, by debt as overextended Chinese speculators who borrowed money to buy stocks are now being forced to sell, creating a vicious cycle.\u201cHow does all that ricochet to emerging markets?\u201d Mr. Rogoff said in discussing the effect of China\u2019s slowdown on commodity producers like Brazil, whose economy is in a tailspin. \u201cLook at Russia. It\u2019s amazing they haven\u2019t had a financial crisis yet.\u201dMr. Rogoff is not the first person to identify China as a potential risk. Earlier this year, this column highlighted the views of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary and a Sinophile, who said, \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not a question of if, but when, China\u2019s financial system will face a reckoning and have to contend with a wave of credit losses and debt restructurings.\u201d And the hedge fund manager James Chanos has been sounding the alarm on China for years, recently declaring, \u201cWhatever you might think, it\u2019s worse.\u201dThere are, of course, significant political reasons China needs to convince the world and its own citizens that it can manage its convulsing financial markets and slowing economy. \u201cFinancial meltdown leads to a social meltdown, which leads to a political meltdown,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said. \u201cThat\u2019s the real fear.\u201dMr. Rogoff pointed to another factor that has contributed to China\u2019s financial woes.\u201cThe crisis in Tianjin fed into the mix,\u201d he said, referring to the deadly explosion on Aug. 12 in the port city, which killed more than 100 people. Mr. Rogoff said the explosion had undermined the credibility of the Chinese government because so many questions remained unanswered, and the response had been inadequate.So does Mr. Rogoff believe that China is headed for a terrible \u201chard landing\u201d that will lead to a global recession?Well, despite the market tumult and his persistent warnings, Mr. Rogoff says he believes that the last several weeks have raised the prospects of a meaningful crisis. But with China\u2019s trillions of dollars in reserves, he thinks the country may have sufficient tools to prevent a calamity that spreads across the globe \u2014 at least for now.\u201cIf you had to bet,\u201d Mr. Rogoff said, \u201cyou\u2019d still bet they\u2019d pull it out.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Currency Stabilizes After 3-Day Slide", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s currency stabilized on Friday, ending a three-day plunge that shook markets globally during the renminbi\u2019s steepest devaluation in decades.These charts show the relative currency strength of East Asia\u2019s three largest economies over the last 15 years.The renminbi responded by strengthening 0.1 percent, ending the week at 6.392 per dollar. Still, that meant the People\u2019s Bank of China had effectively devalued the currency 4.4 percent. It was the steepest drop since the country\u2019s modern exchange rate system was set up in 1994.China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.China\u2019s stock markets are still struggling after a sell-off that began in mid-June. The government took extraordinary measures to support share prices, including barring major shareholders from selling stocks and ordering state agencies to buy, with backing from state banks. But they had little lasting effect.The renminbi\u2019s fall should provide a modest boost to the country\u2019s exporters, as the prices of their goods become relatively cheaper to overseas buyers. But officials at the central bank have denied that was why they pushed the currency down, saying instead that they wished to move closer to an exchange rate guided by trading.Instead of ignoring movements in the currency market, the central bank said it would begin to use them as the reference point in its daily setting of the exchange rate. The renminbi\u2019s reaction to this change, they said, was a \u201cone-off\u201d adjustment.The currency had been under pressure to weaken as China\u2019s economy slowed. But the central bank kept it closely linked to the dollar, which had strengthened against most other major currencies because of the rebounding economy in the United States.\u201cChina\u2019s equities market crumbled this summer because its regulators were incapable of acting in the face of a bubble,\u201d Daniel H. Rosen, a founding partner of the consultancy the Rhodium Group, wrote in a research note. China\u2019s central bank \u201cwas determined not to repeat that mistake with the currency,\u201d he added.By Friday, China had made clear it would allow the currency to move with the markets. But the central bank also showed it would not hesitate to step in if needed. And the renminbi\u2019s daily swings are still capped at a rise or fall of 2 percent.The central bank set the exchange rate at 6.397 per dollar on Friday, a tiny 0.01 percent gain from Thursday\u2019s market close. It remained steady around that level throughout trading on Friday, despite heavy volume, suggesting that the central bank was acting to keep the currency stable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Money Managers Look for Stock Bargains in Turmoil", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThe steep market sell-off has spared hardly anyone. Even some of the country\u2019s top-performing portfolio managers have been hit. A fund run by William Miller, the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, gave back all of this year\u2019s gains of 14 percent. Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, lost about 10 percent over the last month. Both funds are now roughly flat over the last year.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been in this business for 35 years, as I have, you prefer a fast death to a slow death,\u201d Mr. Smead said when I reached him in the midst of this week\u2019s turmoil. \u201cWe\u2019re not technical people, but for this bull market to have another leg, you have to have something like this happen.\u201dThat\u2019s because sustained market rallies come not during periods of complacency and optimism, but when most investors have given up and thrown in the towel (think of March 2009). \u201cIt had been a long while since we\u2019ve seen anything that looks like this sort of capitulation,\u201d Mr. Smead said.Mr. Miller said he met with his team on Monday after two days of unabated selling, and told them: \u201cWhat happened today and Friday is that the froth is being blown off the beer. The beer is better without the froth.\u201dThere\u2019s no way to know where markets are headed next, of course. By some measures, United States stocks are still expensive relative to expected earnings.The AlphaSimplex Group in Cambridge, Mass., which follows a strictly quantitative, computer-driven approach, significantly lowered its exposure to United States stocks on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s in response to the above-average risk we\u2019ve seen in the market, not just in the past few days, but building up over recent weeks and months, which includes the risk of contagion from abroad,\u201d said Alexander D. Healy, director of strategic research at AlphaSimplex.But one thing is certain: Stock prices are much lower today than they were a few weeks ago, with every major index, both in the United States and overseas, down more than 10 percent, which is the definition of a correction. (A decline of 20 percent or more is considered to indicate a bear market.)Both Mr. Miller and Mr. Smead told me they saw what looked like significant bargains emerge from the sharp drop, and they were using the opportunity to add to positions in their favorite stocks.Mr. Miller told me he was struck that this week\u2019s selling was across the board, affecting virtually all regions and sectors. \u201cThe selling was indiscriminate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s prospects have not changed identically and for the worse. That means there are opportunities.\u201dSo what was Mr. Miller buying this week? He said he was pursuing his themes of home builders (\u201ccompletely unaffected by China\u201d), airlines (\u201cscreamingly cheap, especially with low oil prices\u201d) and money center banks (\u201cgenerating huge amounts of capital\u201d). He also said he was intrigued by Twitter, which was trading below its initial public offering price this week.Mr. Smead\u2019s Smead Value Fund (investor class) ranks first among large cap blended funds over five years, with a five-year annualized return of just under 19 percent, according to Morningstar.He continued: \u201cWe try to take a long-term view. There are 86 million people in this country between the ages of 19 and 37. They don\u2019t own stocks, they do drive cars, and they want to buy a house. This is nirvana for them\u201d \u2014 because they haven\u2019t lost any money in the market, gas prices are plunging and mortgage rates are likely to remain low \u2014 \u201cand great for the United States economy.\u201dMr. Smead said he was buying four stocks, which he considered solid value propositions: Amgen, Berkshire Hathaway, American Express and News Corporation.If opportunities are appearing in the United States market, they are even more evident overseas, even in China, whose faltering economy and currency, and plunging markets, have been the trigger for the recent global market turmoil.In part that is because many emerging markets were already in a bear market before the recent plunge.\u201cEmerging markets are generally looking attractive relative to their historic valuations,\u201d said James Syme, a senior fund manager at J O Hambro Capital Management in London, although he added that there was a big difference between manufacturing exporters like China, Taiwan and South Korea, whose stocks \u201cseem incredibly cheap,\u201d and countries that rely heavily on commodity exports, like Brazil and Russia.The JOHCM International Select Fund ranks first over both three- and five-year periods in its category, which is foreign large cap growth funds, according to Morningstar, with annualized returns of 14 percent over three years. The fund is closed to new investors, but Mr. Syme manages the JOHCM Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund, which isn\u2019t. Over the last year, it is down roughly 20 percent, which nonetheless puts it near the top of its category, which is diversified emerging markets.\u201cWe\u2019re overweight in China, and we\u2019re using periods of weakness to top up positions,\u201d Mr. Syme said. \u201cThere are obviously stresses in the Chinese economy, but Chinese policy makers have plenty of tools to address those challenges. Interest rate cuts and currency weakness are two of those tools, and we expect to see results from their recent actions during the second half of the year.\u201dMoreover, he added, \u201cChinese stock valuations are pricing in an awful lot of bad news.\u201d He noted that the current forward price-earnings multiple on Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks is nine, \u201cwhich is about where it was after the collapse of Lehman.\u201d At the same time, his fund is avoiding \u201cthe commodity exporting nations.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very underweight Latin America, Indonesia and Malaysia, and have only a few select positions in Russia and South Africa,\u201d Mr. Syme said.Besides adding to positions in Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares, Mr. Syme said he was buying leading Asian technology companies, such as Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor.With the markets soaring on Wednesday and grinding higher in Thursday trading, purchases made earlier in the week look smart, for now.If the volatility continues and the indexes drop further, investors should remember what Mr. Miller says is a rather simple math lesson.\u201cIf you sell when stocks go down, you\u2019ll end up owning nothing when they hit bottom,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cYou should be doing the opposite.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about money managers who are looking for bargains after a global market sell-off, rendered incorrectly parts of the names of an asset management firm and two of its funds. It is J O Hambro Capital Management, not J. O. Hambro Asset Management, and the funds are the JOHCM International Select Fund and the JOHCM Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund, not the J.O. Hambro International Select Fund and the J.O. Hambro Global Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund.The Common Sense column on Friday, about money managers who are looking for bargains after a global market sell-off, misspelled the surname of the director of strategic research at the AlphaSimplex Group, who discussed the firm\u2019s investment strategy. He is Alexander D. Healy, not Healey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Stock Reacts After Tim Cook Email Praises China Sales", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Last week, Jim Cramer, the boisterous host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d had a company called Skyworks Solutions on his show. The company, a chip supplier for Apple, said its sales were strong in China, but its stock plummeted afterward anyway, following the global markets into the red.And that gave Mr. Cramer an idea: What would Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, say about iPhone sales in China, a crucial component to Apple\u2019s future growth?He sent the question to Mr. Cook by email Sunday evening. His letter read: \u201cDear Tim, Just trying to do my best to cover Apple, as always, and I keep running up against \u2018China fears\u2019 and \u2018China worries.\u2019 We are in a tough moment in the market, and any clarity I might be able to get before Squawk on the Street at 9 Eastern would really help.\u201dJan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, said Apple\u2019s stock had taken a beating largely because of growing concerns about China. A simple solution was to send signals of positive performance in China to Mr. Cramer, he said.\u201cI\u2019m sure Cook was well aware that Cramer would share it with his viewers and it would therefore quickly become public,\u201d Mr. Dawson said. \u201cApple stock has certainly risen sharply since the email was made public, so it\u2019s arguable that it worked.\u201dA look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.\u201cI\u2019ve been a stalwart in saying, \u2018Don\u2019t trade Apple,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to trade it. I think you should own it.\u201dChina has become an increasingly important market for Apple. The company\u2019s growth has slowed over the last few years in mature markets like the United States and parts of Europe, where the smartphone market has become saturated. China, however, remains a huge untapped market where plenty of people are still buying smartphones for the first time.Some analysts have raised questions about whether Apple, the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization, can maintain its overall torrid pace of growth. Shares in the company are up about 45 percent in the last two years. But in the last six months, the stock has fallen over 18 percent.Mr. Cook also wrote to Mr. Cramer that he continued to believe \u201cthat China represents an unprecedented opportunity over the long term.\u201dOn Monday, some regulatory experts raised concerns about whether Mr. Cook\u2019s email to Mr. Cramer had violated the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s fair disclosure regulations. The rules, commonly known as Reg F.D., require companies to share material information to all investors at the same time.Mr. Cook\u2019s reaffirmation to Mr. Cramer of Apple\u2019s performance in China was softer and more generalized than when Flowserve shared specific numbers, Mr. Sporkin said. But he added that it was unclear whether Mr. Cramer could have a different interpretation of the email based on his relationship with Mr. Cook.Apple, CNBC and the S.E.C. declined to comment. In response to questions raised about potential violations of the S.E.C.\u2019s disclosure rules, Mr. Cramer would only say: \u201cI got what I got. I got an email from Tim Cook.\u201dBill Singer, a regulatory lawyer, said he expected the S.E.C. to investigate the context of the email and provide guidelines as to whether companies can disclose financial information this way to selected news reporters.\u201cI can see here that Cook is literally dancing on the edge of a razor,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s one of the largest companies in the world telling one reporter via a private email that our ongoing quarter is actually going to surprise people, and I consider that material.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlyle Finds Hedge Funds Hazardous as Its Private Equity Business Dominates", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIts Carlyle Capital fund became a harbinger of the financial crisis after it imploded in March 2008. Months later, Blue Wave Partners, Carlyle\u2019s entrance into hedge funds, ended abruptly after it failed to raise enough money from investors.They were among the first in a series of bumps in the road for Carlyle and its hedge fund investments, the most recent of which came to the fore last week, when it announced that its credit-focused hedge fund, Claren Road Asset Management, faced nearly $2 billion in investor redemption requests. Since last September, Claren Road has faced a total of $6 billion in redemption requests.Carlyle\u2019s core buyout business, however, continues to exceed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. It has raised tens of billions of dollars of new money to spend on acquisitions. But its track record with hedge funds has been mixed at best, which has raised questions about its ability to diversify successfully the way its rivals have. In particular, it is unclear whether Carlyle can expand its global market strategies business where its hedge fund investments are housed.\u201cWhile Carlyle\u2019s dominant private equity business continues to perform particularly well, a number of its other businesses are not,\u201d Kenneth B. Worthington, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to investors last month, adding: \u201cIts hedge fund business is top of mind with performance issues in its large credit manager Claren Road \u2014 we think redemptions will persist.\u201dAnd they have persisted. When Carlyle announced a new wave of outflows from Claren Road last week, it was the third time it had to do so this year: The hedge fund had continued to lose money in its investments in natural resources, as well as in wrongheaded bets on Greece and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Carlyle\u2019s investment in Vermillion Asset Management has also struggled. When Carlyle bought its ownership stake in 2012, Vermillion\u2019s flagship fund was managing $2.2 billion of investor money. Since then it has slumped to $50 million, the result of a volatile few years in commodities.While executives have conceded that Carlyle\u2019s hedge funds have had a difficult time recently, they blame the broader investment environment for the disappointing performances. The hedge fund portfolio is a small part of its global market strategies business, which is performing well, said Christopher W. Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle.Carlyle created its global market strategies division five years ago, as banks began to pull back from certain lending practices after the financial crisis hit. Carlyle executives saw an opportunity to create and buy portfolios of structured credit products like mezzanine debt and collateralized loan obligations. It was also part of a broader push, ahead of its public offering in 2012, to diversify and branch out from the core buyout business.As Carlyle bolstered its global market division, it began to take majority stakes in hedge funds to benefit from the firms\u2019 bottom line, receiving a part of the fees that investors in hedge funds pay to managers. The unusual model has become increasingly popular with other firms like the Blackstone Group and the family office of the Google chairman Eric E. Schmidt.As Carlyle rapidly expanded its investments, it shifted away from its traditional strategy of developing its own products.In 2010, it bought a majority stake in Claren Road, which managed $4.5 billion at the time and was founded by four senior Citigroup traders \u2014 Brian Riano, John Eckerson, Sean Fahey and Albert Marino. Months later it bought a stake in Emerging Sovereign Group, an investment firm focused on macroeconomic strategies and emerging markets, which had seed investment from Julian H. Robertson, the billionaire hedge fund manager. And in 2012, Carlyle took a stake in Vermillion, the commodities investment manager based in New York.\u201cThe business of hedge funds is generally sound, so in principle such investments make sense,\u201d said Todd E. Petzel, chief investment officer at the private wealth management firm Offit Capital. But, he added, sometimes there are caveats.\u201cIf the portfolio manager receives a large payout for a majority share and doesn\u2019t put that money back into the fund, then questions arise about alignment of interests with the private equity investors and future return potential,\u201d he said.Carlyle has told investors that the managers of each hedge fund that it acquired would put a majority of the cash generated from the deal back into the hedge fund.Carlyle\u2019s investments in hedge funds is presently worth $9 billion. That is small compared with the rest of its $36 billion global market strategy business.But volatility from its hedge funds has helped to drag down the overall performance of the unit. In its most recent quarterly earnings, Carlyle reported that distributable earnings \u2014 a measure of cash generated that is eligible to be paid to investors \u2014 fell by 81 percent for its global market strategies group. Carlyle will report results for the current quarter in October.Things were different as recently as a year ago for some of the hedge funds. Claren Road had $8 billion in assets under management and turned away $1 billion from investors, William E. Conway Jr., a Carlyle co-founder, told analysts in a conference call last month. Before 2014, when it lost investors 9.7 percent, Claren Road delivered positive returns for eight consecutive years.When asked whether Carlyle faced a bigger problem with oversight, ownership and even the selection of managers, Mr. Conway instead blamed volatility and a difficult investment environment.\u201cYou perform, people are happy; they give you more money,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cYou don\u2019t perform, the opposite happens.\u201dThe latest investor retreat last week will result in a non-cash impairment charge of as much as $175 million for Carlyle in its third quarter. Carlyle has said it is assessing what to do next with Claren Road. A spokesman for Claren Road declined to comment.Carlyle\u2019s investment in Vermillion has also been rocky. Earlier this year Carlyle split with the hedge fund\u2019s co-founders, Chris Nygaard and Andrew Gilbert, choosing to redirect Vermillion\u2019s focus away from managing money and toward commodity financing in the face of losses across commodity-focused funds like Black River Asset Management, a Cargill, unit that said last month it would liquidate four hedge funds. Mr. Gilbert could not be reached for comment.\u201cThese are businesses where we felt there were \u2014 and continue to be \u2014 opportunities we could exploit,\u201d Mr. Ullman said. \u201cWe think of it as investing in a commodities business platform versus just investing in hedge funds.\u201dCarlyle executives prefer to highlight another hedge fund investment that has done better: the Emerging Sovereign Group.That hedge fund has had turbulent times, too, but it has outperformed the main index for emerging market stocks, MSCI\u2019s Emerging Markets index, over several years, according to two people briefed on the matter. But it has also suffered redemptions from investors like the Philadelphia Board of Pensions, which redeemed some of its investment in the Emerging Sovereign Group as part of a decision to cut back on hedge fund allocations.So far, Carlyle has not announced any plans to change its strategy of investing in hedge funds. Speaking at a New York Times conference in 2013, David M. Rubenstein, co-founder and a co-chief executive of Carlyle, spoke about how the private equity world has changed and the challenges that Carlyle faced as it experimented with new business models. \u201cI think increasingly firms like ours recognize that the classic buyout model isn\u2019t as easy to do as it used to be.\u201dAn article on Aug. 28 about the Carlyle Group\u2019s investments in hedge funds misstated the performance of one fund among commodity-focused hedge funds that have recently sustained losses. The fund, Black River Asset Management, which is owned by Cargill, was down 0.7 percent for the first half of the year; its losses were not \u201chuge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shake Shack Reports Higher Quarterly Sales and Profits", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company said that profits rose 2.3 percent, to $1.1 million, in the quarter that ended July 1, while same-store sales, or what it calls \u201csame-shack sales,\u201d grew 12.9 percent compared with 4.5 percent in the same quarter last year. Revenues over all, which include licensing payments, increased 74.7 percent to $48.5 million.Randy Garutti, chief executive of Shake Shack, said the company benefited from increases in customer traffic and price increases, as well as a return to crinkle-cut French fries, which, a spokesman said, arrive \u201cready to cook\u201d making them less labor-intensive than the hand-cut fries they replaced. There are more than 70 Shake Shacks in the United States and overseas.\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to see how we\u2019ve capitalized on the wind at our backs,\u201d Mr. Garutti said.The company raised its outlook for the year, predicting that same-store sales would grow in the mid- to high single digits. It also announced it would open more stores than planned.Shake Shack\u2019s stock price has risen more than 200 percent since its initial public offering in January, when its shares went on sale for $21 apiece. It closed on Monday at $70.64 and was up 7 percent in after-hours trading.While most investment analysts do not recommend buying the shares at such prices, Shake Shack\u2019s stock has become a favorite to sell short, meaning that an investor places a bet that the price will fall.In Shake Shack\u2019s case, however, individuals known for selling short are not making that bet. Rather, the traders say, computers that routinely scour the stock market for overvalued stocks to offset undervalued stocks are responsible for the run-up in price.Many of the questions in a conference call with investment analysts were about how increasing labor costs might affect business. Shake Shack has long paid its employees above minimum wage, but the improving economy as well as efforts by states and localities to mandate higher pay are affecting costs in the restaurant business at large.Mr. Garutti said that Shake Shack had given its employees a good raise about a year and a half ago and that the move to crinkle-cut fries had reduced its labor costs. Still, he said, he did not think pressure to raise wages would end anytime soon.The company raised prices 3 percent in September, and then again in January. It said it has no plans to increase them further during the rest of fiscal year, despite continued cost increases for beef and for eggs, which it uses in custards and some sauces.In addition to crinkle-cut fries, Mr. Garutti said limited-time menu promotions had helped increase sales. Sales of the ShackMeister, a cheeseburger topped with ShackSauce and crispy shallots that won the 2014 Food Network South Beach Wine and Food Festival Burger Bash, ended last month.But it was replaced by another limited-time offering, the Roadside, a cheeseburger topped with a mound of caramelized onions and bacon steeped in beer.The company is also testing a chicken sandwich in three of its stores in the New York area.Analysts on the conference call repeatedly asked about plans to roll the chicken product out across more stores, but Mr. Garutti declined to say what plans the company has for it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Show Some Spine, Federal Reserve", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE financial markets and the Federal Reserve Board have been playing out a tragicomedy in three acts. Here\u2019s how it works: Initially, a flurry of news stories appear about how, a few months hence, the Fed intends to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in years. Second, the predictable market swoon, as Wall Street traders ponder the fact that the morphine drip of free money that they have been enjoying since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis might be pulled out of their arms. Finally, the Fed backs away from its much-overdue policy change, causing traders to rejoice and the artificially stimulated bull market in both stocks and bonds to continue. The curtain comes down, and the audience roars its approval.A similar drama occurred in the spring of 2013, during what has been called the Taper Tantrum. And now it\u2019s happening again.Some background: At the end of 2008, the Fed dropped its benchmark short-term interest rate to around zero. It also began a program with the Orwellian name of quantitative easing \u2014 buying huge sums of bonds to suppress long-term interest rates and stimulate lending and spending. Thanks to Q.E., the cost of borrowing money was pushed to next to nothing. This was a bonanza for those who make money from money \u2014 hedge-fund managers, private-equity moguls, banks \u2014 and a disaster for savers, retirees and anyone on a fixed income. (Have you checked the interest your bank pays you on your savings account? Mine: .06 percent per year.)The Taper Tantrum began in May 2013, when Ben S. Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, announced in congressional testimony that later in the year the Fed would most likely start slowing \u2014 hence, \u201ctapering\u201d \u2014 its monthly bond buying. On June 19, in a news conference, Mr. Bernanke reaffirmed that decision: The Fed, he said, \u201ccurrently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year.\u201d Before the afternoon was out, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 200 points, or 1.4 percent, and the bond market tanked as the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 2.36 percent, its highest level since March 2012. The Fed quickly backed down and the rallies in the stock and bond markets resumed.The third round of quantitative easing ended last fall. And all of this year, the markets have been chattering about an expected announcement that the Fed will finally \u2014 after nine years \u2014 raise short-term interest rates in September, by a modest 0.25 percentage points.Yes, it would be a little painful to start having to pay a little more for short-term borrowing and, yes, the net worth of Wall Street billionaires might increase at a slightly lower rate, but it looks as if the moment is at hand to end the morphine drip.The case for raising rates is straightforward: Like any commodity, the price of borrowing money \u2014 interest rates \u2014 should be determined by supply and demand, not by manipulation by a market behemoth. Essentially, the clever Q.E. program caused a widespread mispricing of risk, deluding investors into underestimating the risk of various financial assets they were buying.The only way to return the assessment of risk to something resembling normalcy is to stop the manipulation. That requires nothing less than serious intestinal fortitude from the Fed and a willingness to raise interest rates in the face of determined opposition from Wall Street.Sadly, the Fed, under Mr. Bernanke\u2019s successor, Janet L. Yellen, seems to be caving. The worsening economic news from China, combined with uncertainty about the Fed\u2019s plans, contributed to the recent sharp declines in stock markets around the world.All too predictably, the powerful advocates of the Fed\u2019s zero-interest-rate policy have raced to its defense. Under the headline \u201cThe Fed looks set to make a dangerous mistake,\u201d Lawrence H. Summers, the former Harvard president and Treasury secretary, wrote in The Financial Times, \u201cAt this moment of fragility, raising rates risks tipping some part of the financial system into crisis, with unpredictable and dangerous results.\u201d He then tweeted, \u201cIt is far from clear that the next Fed move will be a tightening\u201d (a raising of rates).Around then came a leaked note to clients from Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds, agreeing with Mr. Summers\u2019s assessment. He warned that the Fed might be so wedded to its \u201chighly advertised tightening path that it will be difficult for them to change to a significantly easier path if that should be required.\u201dThis elite pas de deux reached a crescendo on Wednesday when William C. Dudley, the president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that, upon reflection, September was not the time for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates. The argument for doing so, he said, seemed \u201cless compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,\u201d noting that \u201cinternational developments have increased the downside risk to U.S. economic growth somewhat.\u201d Once the news of Mr. Dudley\u2019s words got out, the markets rocketed upward. Crisis averted?Thursday was also the first day of the annual central-banker retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The gathering\u2019s theme is the boring-sounding \u201cInflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy,\u201d but it\u2019s the perfect setting for these supposedly brilliant economists to figure a way out of this perennial Catch-22 once and for all. The right answer is self-evident: End the easy-money addiction, raise rates in September and begin the healing.William D. Cohan is the author of three books on Wall Street.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betting on a Smooth Ride, Investors Flock to Tesla ", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company did it again this week. When most companies disclose they are selling new shares to raise capital, their stock generally declines. But when Tesla announced on Thursday a $500 million stock sale, investors cheered.It went over so well that the company raised the sale on Friday to $642 million worth of shares. And if the banks underwriting the deal exercise their options, the total could approach $750 million.Tesla\u2019s stock price opened on Thursday morning at $239.86 a share. By Friday, it had closed at $243.15.Even though investors had anticipated a stock sale after Tesla\u2019s founder, Elon Musk, hinted at one in a conference call on Aug. 5, and the value had corrected by roughly 10 percent to compensate since then, Wall Street\u2019s positive reaction this week still surprised some analysts.\u201cInvestors are really pouring money into it,\u201d said Akshay Anand, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cTesla seems to have an allure all its own.\u201dBut the company\u2019s sky-high valuation is also based on everything going as planned in the coming years, Mr. Anand said. Tesla has estimated it will sell 500,000 vehicles a year by the end of the decade \u2014 a sharp increase from around 50,000 expected deliveries this year \u2014 and more than a million by 2025, depending on the success of new models like the Model X sport utility vehicle going on sale next month, and the coming mass-market-oriented Model 3.\u201cA lot of their valuation seems to be depending on all things working out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this was another company, I\u2019d say those expectations are unrealistic. But that\u2019s kind of the allure of Tesla. They shoot for the moon.\u201dWhen the first Model S sedans began hitting the streets in June 2012, Tesla\u2019s stock hovered around $30 a share. But the car, subsequently showered with awards and high-end consumer cachet, made Tesla\u2019s stock a darling of Wall Street beginning in the spring of 2013.The company\u2019s charismatic founder promised more to come: a sport utility vehicle, a mass-market sedan and a sprawling battery factory near Reno, Nev. Recently, Tesla even branched out beyond cars, into energy-storage devices.The result has been a company that seems to embody many of a typical Wall Street investor\u2019s desires: disruptive technology, larger-than-life founders and dazzling growth projections. General Motors or Ford could only dream of inspiring such devotion.But like other public companies, Tesla has a stock price that is based on the predicted value of future cash flows \u2014 and that means Tesla\u2019s grand promises have set high expectations among investors who view the company\u2019s short-term struggles as only a prelude to a big payday down the road. As long as those expectations hold, analysts say, the company could remain a Wall Street darling. But if confidence gets shaken, Tesla\u2019s lofty valuation could be shaken with it.Some Wall Street banks have already begun raising concerns. Last month, the investment bank UBS downgraded Tesla to a \u201csell\u201d recommendation, citing concerns about its overvaluation, excessively aggressive sales targets, pricing and the role the company has taken in the energy storage business.In a research note, UBS warned that \u201cany significant problems with the current or future products would likely cripple the company in the early stages of its growth.\u201dDeutsche Bank also downgraded Tesla this summer from a \u201cbuy\u201d to a \u201chold,\u201d indicating investors should not sell the stock, but should not buy any more.But the majority of Wall Street financial analysts still rate the company a good bet, fueling more investment. Ten analysts rate it as a \u201cbuy\u201d or higher, and six others recommend to hold the stock, with a median price prediction topping $300 a share. Only four advise selling or reducing Tesla shares. Catherine D. Wood, chief executive of ARK Investment Management, which is bullish on Tesla, says part of Tesla\u2019s appeal is that some investors think of it as a technology company more than an auto manufacturer.

{"Headline": "Vague Disclosures by Highflying Mutual Funds May Put Investors in Peril", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameDesperate for richer yields on their portfolios, individual investors have thronged in recent years to mutual funds promising higher-than-usual income. The question is: Do these investors understand the higher-than-usual risks involved?The answer is probably no. That\u2019s because in the riskier funds, not all the perils are disclosed. Moreover, even when risks are formally discussed, many investors may still not realize how the funds really work. Trading on nonpublic information, for example, is a common practice in some of the instruments these funds hold.Given the exotic investments that some income funds hold, understanding their risks is especially crucial. I\u2019m talking about so-called leveraged loans or bank loans found in floating-rate income funds.Leveraged loans are obligations taken on by heavily indebted companies, typically to finance a buyout or recapitalization.These loans carry a wide array of risks. They don\u2019t trade frequently and are difficult to value. They may not be backed by solid collateral and are subject to faster prepayment schedules than other obligations.Nevertheless, mutual funds are regular buyers of these loans. More than 35 fund companies offer portfolios that invest in them. Among the bigger sellers are BlackRock, Eaton Vance, Fidelity and Pimco.But outflows are ramping up. Assets under management declined $2.1 billion in the first three weeks of August.Mutual fund companies offering such funds detail many of the risks associated with these loans. But not all.One disclosure lapse involves how these funds characterize their holdings. Often they describe the loans as junk bonds or \u201cjunk securities.\u201dThat\u2019s kind of a big deal. But rare indeed is the leveraged loan fund that clearly warns its investors of this risk.Other fund companies mentioning this risk make only oblique references to the loans\u2019 falling outside securities laws. Investors must search hard for these disclosures, which are often buried in an obscure document known as the statement of additional information.Asked why these disclosures are not more detailed, a John Hancock representative declined to comment. Vincent Loporchio, a Fidelity spokesman, said the company\u2019s materials clearly disclosed all risks associated with leveraged loans.There\u2019s another downside to leveraged loan funds that investors hear little about: Mutual fund holders could be at a disadvantage compared with other investors who trade on nonpublic information about the companies issuing leveraged loans.Prohibitions against insider trading apply only to securities, such as stocks and bonds. Investors taking the view that leveraged loans are not securities have contended that their trading on such information is not bound by these rules.Indeed, receiving nonpublic information has historically been a routine part of the leveraged loan investment process. In the market\u2019s early days, banks were the dominant lenders to such issuers. Because these borrowers were considered high credit risks, the banks demanded \u2014 and received \u2014 far more extensive financial information on their operations than an outside investor could see. Some of this would undoubtedly qualify as material nonpublic information.Few mutual funds buying these loans disclose whether they receive confidential information from the companies issuing the obligations or whether they act on it. Fidelity\u2019s fund materials, for example, are silent on the issue.Funds that receive nonpublic information and do not act on it may be trying to protect themselves from insider-trading allegations. But they also may be putting their clients at a disadvantage compared with those who trade on the information.Asked about this potential downside to its investors, Meg Clough, a Loomis, Sayles spokeswoman, said in a statement on Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019ve found that the benefits to Loomis, Sayles\u2019s shareholders of maintaining access to our vast research, trading and integrated portfolio management resources outweigh the potential benefits of receiving nonpublic information.\u201dMr. Loporchio, at Fidelity, said the firm \u201cgenerally chooses not to receive material, nonpublic information from publicly traded issuers\u201d whose loans and debt it buys.Mutual fund managers may well prefer not to receive inside information regarding leveraged loan issuers because, unlike investment banks, they don\u2019t have a system for walling off units that obtain that data.Investment banks, as advisers to corporations, routinely learn details about their clients\u2019 businesses that outsiders don\u2019t know. For example, a company may approach a banker about making an acquisition or a divestiture, or raising fresh capital. While such market-moving plans are kept quiet within the bank, it will typically move to restrict other employees, such as traders and brokers, from conducting transactions in that company\u2019s securities until the information is publicly known.Mutual funds have none of these so-called Chinese walls, often for good reason.But as a result, investors in leveraged loan mutual funds may be at a disadvantage compared with other investors in the arena. And that\u2019s a risk they should be aware of.A whistle-blower complaint filed last year with the Securities and Exchange Commission detailed these disclosure flaws. It urged the agency to bring enforcement actions against the funds. Simply because many funds fail in this area doesn\u2019t mean they should get a pass, the filing noted.It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, the S.E.C. will do about these lapses. Perhaps the funds will fix them on their own. But it seems obvious that investors in leveraged loan funds deserve better disclosures about their risks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shares in Mainland China End Worst Month in 6 Years", "Date": "2015-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Stock prices in China fell modestly on Friday, but ended July with their worst monthly decline in six years, despite repeated government efforts to stabilize the market and prop up prices.Share prices were volatile for much of the past week, with wild intraday swings, as investors weighed the direction of a government intervention plan and the authorities vowed to root out short-sellers, or traders who bet a stock will fall, and to crack down on stock manipulation.The Shanghai composite index plunged 10 percent during the week, closing at 3,663.725. The Shenzhen composite dropped 9.1 percent, hitting 2,110.622. For the month, the main Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes were each down 14.3 percent.The sell-off and price swings have further unnerved a market that sprinted up early in the year, with prices peaking around mid-June. But shares plummeted sharply in late June and early July over concerns about a bubble and investors\u2019 borrowing heavily to buy shares.After prices began to plunge, the Chinese government announced a raft of measures aimed at stabilizing prices and restoring confidence in the market. Those efforts seemed to work \u2014 for a while.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.In a matter of days, there was a government-financed effort to buy up shares; a suspension of initial public offerings; and rules preventing major shareholders from selling their shares. Regulators also vowed to investigate \u201cmalicious\u201d short-sellers and any other forces that might be driving prices down.The efforts, though widely criticized by some analysts as overly aggressive interference in the market, seemed to shore up share prices, at least until last Monday. That is when a broad range of stocks fell again, sending the Shanghai composite down 8.5 percent on the day, its biggest daily drop since 2007.Almost immediately, regulators reaffirmed their commitment to stabilizing prices and said they were investigating what they called an \u201cabnormal\u201d stock dip. On Friday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said it was investigating automated trading and had suspended 24 stock trading accounts for \u201csuspected irregularities.\u201dHerald van der Linde, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia strategy at HSBC, said that China\u2019s stock market was being affected by government intervention and that uncertainty about a number of factors, including economic growth, corporate profits and expectations about government monetary policy.\u201cThis is a reflection of a very fragile trust in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a retail-driven market, and an emerging market, so you should expect some volatility.\u201dFrom their peak, on June 12, China\u2019s major stock indexes have lost about a third of their value. In Hong Kong, which is under separate governance, share prices have slipped, but not as sharply. The Hang Seng index is down 13.4 percent from its peak this year in late April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Tumult Erases This Year\u2019s Gains at William Ackman\u2019s Hedge Fund", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot even one of Wall Street\u2019s most successful investors has been spared from the recent rout in stock markets around the world.William A. Ackman\u2019s multibillion-dollar hedge fund has lost all of its gains so far this year, he told investors on Wednesday.In an interim report for shareholders, his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, said it had returned to investors 10 percent net of fees for the year through the end of July.But \u201csignificant volatility\u201d in global markets over the last few weeks, driven by huge declines in the Chinese stock market and \u201cfear that slowing growth in China will have repercussions for business around the world,\u201d had erased Pershing Square\u2019s double-digit returns, the letter said.Markets have been on a wild ride in recent days as investors reacted to news and data from China that pointed to a slowing economy there, the world\u2019s second biggest. Even as markets in the United States bounced back on Wednesday \u2014 with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closing up 3.9 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average gaining more than 600 points \u2014 many were still nursing losses.Other hedge funds have been pulled into the riptide, too, and are poised to report disappointing returns for investors this month.Leon G. Cooperman\u2019s Omega Partners was down 11 percent as of the end of last week, according to two people briefed on the matter. The world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, led by Ray Dalio, notified investors that its Pure Alpha fund was down 4.7 percent for the month. And the August performance of David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital will be closely watched. The hedge fund went into August down 9 percent for the year.In its letter on Wednesday, Pershing Square said the current depressed share prices of many of its top holdings in companies like Mondelez, Canadian Pacific and Zoetis did not reflect the real value of the businesses and that the companies had limited exposure to macroeconomic events. The firm\u2019s top five holdings were down between 5 and 15 percent for the month of August. Valeant, for example, has shed 11.6 percent, while Canadian Pacific is down 15 percent on the month.Separately, Pershing Square highlighted a potential conflict of interest between the fund and the personal investment of an employee related to the recent acquisition of Sprout Pharmaceuticals by Valeant.Pershing Square will report on Thursday the latest numbers that will include the moves in markets as of the end of Tuesday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Stock Market Rout in a Month That Hedge Funds Would Sooner Forget", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom his getaway cabin deep in the woods, an experienced adviser to wealthy hedge fund investors was hopping from one conference call to another to manage clients\u2019 mounting anxiety.Similarly, a broker described how he had interrupted his vacation to respond to the needs of his nervous clients. And a multibillion-dollar hedge fund said numerous investors had requested play-by-play commentary and performance figures.The sudden and rapid sell-off across global markets that began late last week and deepened on Monday has caught many on Wall Street off guard, interrupting the vacation plans of richly compensated money managers \u2014 especially those at some of the nation\u2019s biggest hedge funds, where losses over the last few days have been especially steep.The ferocity of Monday\u2019s selling \u2014 in particular a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average of nearly 1,000 points in the first minutes of trading \u2014 was attributed to a number of events, from the forced sales of stocks bought on credit \u2014 known as margin calls \u2014 to economic woes in China and looming rate increases in the United States.But by the end of Monday, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closing down 77.68 points, or 3.9 percent, there was still no clear reason for the plunge and not many big money managers were willing to stick their necks out and speak publicly. Even those who spoke privately to investors were few. \u201cI think they don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said one investor, who did not want to be quoted for fear of angering some managers.What is clear, however, is that the numbers rolling in for August from the hedge fund industry do not look good. Hedge funds went into the sell-off bullish, with $1.5 trillion in long positions \u2014 bets that stocks will rise in price \u2014 compared with $684 billion in short positions, bets that stocks will decline in price, according to an analysis of the industry by Goldman Sachs.The 10 stocks that Goldman said were the most widely held by hedge funds \u2014 stocks like Apple, Citigroup, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 were down from 5 to 10 percent over the last three trading days.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Leon G. Cooperman, founder of the $9 billion hedge fund Omega Advisors and a longtime market bull, is emerging as a big loser in the chaos. As of Friday, his fund was said to have lost 11 percent this month, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Cooperman did not return a call seeking comment.The firm was hit hard by big declines in the share prices of Allergan, AerCap, Citigroup and the American International Group \u2014 four of Omega\u2019s top stock holdings, according to regulatory filings.One hedge fund manager who invests mainly in United States stocks, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he would not be surprised if the average fund lost from 3 to 7 percent in August. He said the past week had been brutal and the losses had come far faster than most would have anticipated. Several managers described frenzied selling when the markets opened on Monday morning.Even the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, led by Ray Dalio, was not spared. The $162 billion firm told investors on Friday that its Pure Alpha fund was down 4.7 percent for the month. Going into August, the Pure Alpha portfolio had been up 11.8 percent for the year.Bridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.Before the full extent of the sell-off on Wall Street was known, Goldman had already predicted that the hedge fund industry would once again underperform the broader S.&P. 500, which, at Monday\u2019s close, was down 8.1 percent for the year. The Dow lost 588 points, or 3.6 percent. The average hedge fund has underperformed the broader market for six consecutive years, according to the research firm HFR.The warning signs for the latest global market rout appeared as far back as June, when China\u2019s stock market took a plunge and regulators intervened. \u201cThis is really a story about China and emerging markets. Emerging market currencies are off by between 10 and 20 percent over the past two months,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.\u201cThose who were short commodities, emerging market currencies or Chinese equities are clearly the winners here,\u201d he said, adding that after the most recent turmoil anyone who made bets against any stocks around the world would be winners, too.But after six years of a bull market run in which American stocks have hit one record after another, few hedge fund managers have been brave enough to short stocks with much conviction. To take a short position, a trader sells borrowed stock in a company that he or she thinks is overvalued in anticipation of buying it back at a cheap price.Yet, while the headlines on Monday were stark \u2014 analysts in China and the United States were calling it Black Monday \u2014 the sell-off was not as bad for some hedge funds that had short positions. The past week was a good time for money managers betting on stock declines.Express Scripts Holding, for example, which was flagged by Goldman Sachs as one of the most heavily shorted stocks, has shed 6.8 percent in the last three trading days. Exxon Mobil, another favorite short, was down 10 percent over the same period, in lock step with the price of oil dropping below $40 a barrel.Kerrisdale Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York, sent a \u201cflash estimate\u201d on Monday morning to let investors know that the fund would be down 2 percent for August, according to one investor. The hedge fund, which has a short bet against the satellite company Globalstar, was up around 10 percent for the year heading into August, the investor said.Hedge funds that scoop up distressed assets at bottomed-out prices also began to eye opportunities. \u201cWhat I have told investors is the economy is fine but now is a great time to be buying some things when they get hit,\u201d said Marc Lasry, a co-founder of the $13.9 billion hedge fund Avenue Capital Group.\u201cOther people may be having issues,\u201d Mr. Lasry said. \u201cFor us, that is an opportunity as opposed to a problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With an Eye to Impact, Investing Through a \u2018Gender Lens\u2019", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersELLEN REMMER had wanted to align her investments with her values for years, seeking to put her money into stocks and bonds that would have an impact beyond the returns. For her, this meant investing in organizations that either improved the lot of women and girls or helped the environment.Doing so took longer than she expected. Even though it was her money, it was held in trust. She said it wasn\u2019t easy to persuade the trusts\u2019 advisers to change their investment policies.\u201cI kept bringing it up, but I really got just no good response,\u201d said Ms. Remmer, a managing partner of the Philanthropic Initiative, a philanthropy advisory service. \u201cThey were doing the classic, \u2018We invest for the highest financial return.\u2019 They subscribed to what I think of as a myth, that you\u2019re going to have a lower return if you do impact investing.\u201dThree years ago, she finally took a third of her money and invested it as she wanted.After all, impact investments are complicated. They fall under the do-no-harm mantra of socially responsible investing. But they also aim to bring about positive social change as well as a financial return.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know that impact investing is even a possibility \u2014 despite the enthusiasm in our circles,\u201d said Amit Bouri, chief executive of the Global Impact Investing Network, a nonprofit advocacy group.One of the areas Ms. Remmer is interested in, so-called gender lens investing \u2014 investing that considers the benefits to women and girls \u2014 has gained considerable popularity within the impact-investing world.In its annual survey, the Global Impact Investing Network found that a third of all respondents were interested in making investments that promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through both debt and equity investments in the United States and emerging markets. Some investors seek out female entrepreneurs and give them money. Others invest in companies like those that provide clean-burning cook stoves to women in Africa and Latin America.Patricia Farrar-Rivas, a partner at Veris Wealth Partners, a wealth management firm that invests $800 million on an impact basis, said gender lens investing is now the most popular of its five impact strategies. (The others are aimed at environment and climate change, community and economic development, sustainable food systems and agriculture, and \u201csustainable mind-set and mindfulness\u201d \u2014 or companies that take their time making investments.)Despite this increased interest, gender lens investment can seem hard to do. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where it\u2019s difficult to gauge supply and demand because much of the demand doesn\u2019t know the supply exists,\u201d Mr. Bouri said.Still, Jackie VanderBrug, a pioneer in gender lens impact investing who is now a senior vice president at U.S. Trust, said gender lens investing was a strategy whose time had come.\u201cPeople said impact investing is really hard and you\u2019re making it harder by imposing a limitation,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a lens and not a limitation. A gender lens helps you see opportunity and mitigate risk.\u201dMs. VanderBrug said she had stressed that gender investing was a strategy, like putting money into hedge funds, not an investment class, like stocks and bonds, and as a strategy it can be done in different ways.According to Mr. Bouri, people have three options when making gender lens investments. They can make money available to enterprises owned by women, focus on employment for women or invest in companies that provide products and services that help women.But there are also options for impact investing that will probably have lower financial returns \u2014 like supporting companies that get water-purification systems to rural areas \u2014 but a greater connection to what the money is accomplishing.Opponents of impact investing say these investments require people to sacrifice returns. That can be the case. Najada Kumbuli, who leads a gender investing initiative at the Calvert Foundation (which is separate from the mutual fund company Calvert Investments), said the foundation had a $20 million fund that allowed the 900 investors in it to pick the length and return of their investments. A one-year investment will return one-half of 1 percent, while a 10-year investment will yield about 3 percent a year.\u201cPaying back investors full principal and interest is important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut so, too, is the data. It\u2019s not just that we lent to 10 organizations but also, how are we shaping the sector and how are we investing in women?\u201dProponents say comparable returns can be achieved, and when they are \u2014 and even when they\u2019re missed \u2014 there is the added benefit of helping an organization trying to achieve a goal beyond maximizing profit.Ms. Farrar-Rivas said she had a client who had invested nearly $20 million in impact investments.Some of the client\u2019s investments are expected to return 6 percent over seven to 10 years, while others may be closer to 1 or 2 percent \u2014 and require much more time to manage.The problem with impact investing is often that there are not enough opportunities for direct investment or the ones that are available are small and take a lot of time to assess.Its specific women\u2019s initiative has reached 172,000 women since 2012, he said. \u201cThis work is very rewarding but incredibly difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one area that is certainly going to take a village to improve the lot of women.\u201dAnd for the novice, mistakes are easy to make. They usually come from moving too quickly and not getting the right information.\u201cIt\u2019s easy for you to go online and look at any company\u2019s board and see who is on the executive team here,\u201d Ms. Farrar-Rivas said.But that can be misleading. Are those female executives really leading the company, or are they shut out? Are women earlier in their careers given a clear career path at that company? How are they paid?\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get the equal-opportunity information,\u201d Ms. Farrar-Rivas said. \u201cCompanies have to report it, but they don\u2019t have to disclose it.\u201dMs. Remmer said she has had success. The third of her money designated for impact investments is now with various wealth managers. And it has had the comparable market return she hoped for.\u201cI wanted the investments to be all market based,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to convince my family and my husband, too, even though it\u2019s my trust.\u201dShe added that one of the more obstinate investment advisers at the multifamily office her family used to use had changed his views.\u201cThe investment guy that I worked with who was our account person just moved to a new multifamily office that has a specialty in impact investing,\u201d she said. And he has been calling to urge her to make some impact investments through his new firm.Perhaps nothing more validates a new investment strategy than an adviser pushing a product he once dismissed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge Sharply for a Second Day on Wall Street", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock prices around the world continued to plunge on Friday, threatening to end one of the longest bull runs in the history of the United States stock market.A searing six-year rally in United States stocks had advanced into the summer months, shrugging off challenges like the dispute over Greece\u2019s debt that nearly led to the country crashing out of the euro. But in the last two weeks, world markets tumbled as investors grew increasingly concerned about economic conditions in China, which unexpectedly devalued its currency last week, and the outlook for the economies of other large developing countries.As the selling accelerated Friday afternoon, some benchmark indexes were at or near 10 percent below their recent peaks \u2014 a \u201ccorrection\u201d in Wall Street parlance. \u201cThis is likely going to go down as the first meaningful correction in four years,\u201d said David Rosenberg, an economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff.Sell-offs in the financial markets need not cause harm in the real economy. In many cases in the postwar period, the United States stock market has recovered after reacting negatively to problems overseas. Strong employment numbers and other economic indicators suggest that the United States economy remains resilient.Still, fear in financial markets can feed on itself. And the declines in the markets are coming not only as China struggles, but also as the Federal Reserve is winding down its huge stimulus efforts. Trillions of dollars of cheap money from the Fed has fueled economic growth and helped push markets higher around the world. Now, the question is whether the world can stay on the recovery path without the Fed\u2019s largess.Such concerns on Friday helped push stocks far below the peaks they reached just weeks ago when investors were ebullient. The Dow Jones industrial average is more than 10 percent below the high it reached in May. At Friday\u2019s close, the index was down 530.94 points, to 16,459.75, a loss of 3.1 percent on the day.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark, fell below the psychologically important 2,000 mark. It was down 3.2 percent on the day and more than 7 percent below its recent peak. It fell 64.84 points, to 1,970.89. The index lost $1.14 trillion in value this week, according to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.The Nasdaq, which contains a lot of technology stocks, fell 3.5 percent on Friday, a slide that takes the index nearly 10 percent below its latest high. It closed down 171.45 points, to 4,706.04.The price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, briefly fell below $40 a barrel. Later on Friday it was trading at $40.11, nearly 25 percent below its price at the start of the year. The decline in the price of oil and other commodities may indicate that there is less demand for such commodities because economies are slowing. The fall in oil reduces energy bills for consumers and companies, but it also hammers the profitability of the many oil and gas companies that have invested heavily during the recent shale boom.The Vix, known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, spiked higher than the level it reached last fall, when global markets last sold off on concerns about global growth.Investors rushed into the relative safety of government bonds. The yield of the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.05 percent on Friday, from 2.07 percent on Thursday.In the coming days, investors will have to decide whether the selling is part of summer squall that will soon pass \u2014 or the start of tougher times for the global economy that could weigh on stock markets for months.\u201cThere is a relatively more ominous slowdown going on in emerging markets \u2014 and that\u2019s what the trade is all about right now,\u201d said Gina C. Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.Officials at the Fed will also have to weigh the seriousness of the turbulence in the markets as they decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years. Raising rates as early as next month, as some investors have expected will happen, could further unnerve investors, damp economic activity and speed the flow of dollars out of developing countries. As a result, the Fed may decide to wait until later in the year, or longer. The central bank may try to estimate the impact of a falling stock market on the wealth and spending habits of United States households. The six-year bull run, which began as the last bear market ended in 2009, has helped drive up households\u2019 holdings of stocks and mutual funds by over $10 trillion.Much, of course, depends on the strength of the Chinese economy \u2014 and an economic release on Friday could stoke further pessimism. Output in China\u2019s manufacturing industry contracted in the first three weeks of August at the fastest pace since the depths of the financial crisis, according to a preliminary reading of the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index. It came in at 47.1 points for August, compared with 47.8 points in July. The August figure was its lowest reading since March 2009 on a scale in which any figure below 50 indicates contraction.Since the devaluation, China has moved to keep the renminbi from depreciating further by selling dollars. This effectively takes money out of the financial system, so the central bank has been busy this week trying to add liquidity. On Wednesday, it announced 110 billion renminbi ($17 billion) in new six-month loans to 14 unnamed financial institutions.These measures have not been enough, as China\u2019s overnight money market rates have continued to inch upward. Many analysts now think the central bank must respond more aggressively.The main Shanghai index fell 4.3 percent, while the Shenzhen index closed 5.4 percent lower. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index declined 1.5 percent after having given up all its gains for the year this week. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo closed down 3 percent.European shares were also trading lower on Friday. Benchmark indexes in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Milan were all down about 3 percent, capping a week of declines.Positive survey data published on Friday was not enough to overcome investor doubts about whether the Continent could break out of its pattern of perennially sluggish growth, analysts said.A monthly survey of business sentiment by Markit, a research firm, signaled a modest pickup in eurozone growth. But the survey also pointed to nearly stagnant growth in France, the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany.Another headwind for United States stocks is that their valuations \u2014 or the yardsticks that investors use to determine whether a company is cheap or expensive \u2014 recently climbed to demandingly high levels. This can make stocks more vulnerable to declines when bad news occurs or fearfulness grows among investors.Companies are struggling to bolster their revenue, for instance. In the second quarter of this year, companies in the S.&P. 500 managed to post revenue growth of only under 1 percent \u2014 even after excluding energy companies, which have been hit hard by the decline in the price of oil. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very slow,\u201d Ms. Martin Adams said.Neil Gough and Jack Ewing contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But I take little comfort in watching China burning money and Russia burning food, because in today\u2019s interdependent world we\u2019re all affected.I also find no joy in it because we Americans, too, have started burning our most important source of competitive advantage \u2014 our pluralism. One of our two political parties has gone nuts and started following a pied piper of intolerance, named Donald Trump.First, we watched China\u2019s leadership burn money \u2014 trying to prop up a ridiculously overvalued stock market by buying falling stocks with government savings, and then seeing that market continue to collapse because the very fact that the government was intervening suggested no one knew what these stocks were worth.The economic management team in Beijing has seriously lost its way. But leaders do funky things when the ruling party\u2019s bargain with its people is \u201cwe get to rule and you get to get rich.\u201d Collapsing markets can quickly lead to collapsing legitimacy.Ask the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. He burned the eastern quarter of Ukraine to distract the Russian middle class from his economic mismanagement and illegitimacy.Putin decided that building his own Silicon Valley \u2014 the Skolkovo Innovation Center outside of Moscow \u2014 was too hard. So to build his legitimacy he chose nationalism and seized Crimea instead. Putin prefers to manufacture chips on his shoulder than microchips. When the Crimea annexation nationalist sugar high wore off, Putin started burning food imported from countries sanctioning Russia for seizing Crimea from Ukraine.My fear is that once Putin\u2019s food-burning nationalist sugar high wears off, he\u2019ll burn up another neighbor. Estonia, please beware.Alas, though, America has joined this assets bonfire. We\u2019re now in a world where all top-down authority structures are being challenged. It\u2019s most obvious in the Arab world where you have pluralistic countries that lack pluralism and so could be held together from the top-down only by an iron fist \u2014 and when that iron fist got removed they spun apart. America\u2019s greatest advantage is its pluralism: It can govern itself horizontally by its people of all colors and creeds forging social contracts to live together as equal citizens.It not only makes us more stable but also more innovative, because we can collaborate internally and externally with anyone anywhere, leveraging more brainpower. Who is the new C.E.O. of Google? Sundar Pichai. Who is the new C.E.O. of Microsoft? Satya Nadella. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s family did not come over on the Mayflower.But right now we\u2019re messing around with that incredible asset. Yes, we must control our borders; it is the essence of sovereignty. It has been a failure of both our political parties that the Mexican-American border has been so porous. So I am for a high wall, but with a very big gate \u2014 one that legally lets in energetic low-skilled workers and the high-I.Q. risk-takers who have made our economy the envy of the world \u2014 and for legislation that provides a pathway for the millions of illegal immigrants already here to gain legal status and eventually citizenship.In June 2013, the Senate, including 14 Republicans, passed a bill that would do all that. But the extremists in the G.O.P. House refused to follow, so the bill stalled.And now we have Trump shamelessly exploiting this issue even more. He\u2019s calling for an end to the 14th Amendment\u2019s birthright principle, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born here, and also for a government program to round up all 11 million illegal immigrants and send them home \u2014 an utterly lunatic idea that Trump dismisses as a mere \u201cmanagement\u201d problem. Like lemmings, many of the other G.O.P. presidential hopefuls just followed Trump over that cliff.This is not funny anymore. This is not entertaining. Donald Trump is not cute. His ugly nativism shamefully plays on people\u2019s fears and ignorance. It ignores bipartisan solutions already on the table, undermines the civic ideals that make our melting pot work in ways no European or Asian country can match (try to become a Japanese) and tampers with the very secret of our sauce \u2014 pluralism, that out of many we make one.Every era spews up a Joe McCarthy type who tries to thrive by dividing and frightening us, and today his name is Donald Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Again Cuts Interest Rates as Concerns Mount Over Economy", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s central bank on Tuesday cut its benchmark interest rate and freed banks to lend more, the latest signs of the government\u2019s growing distress over slumping stocks and slowing economic growth.On Tuesday, China\u2019s prime minister, Li Keqiang, acknowledged that the country was feeling the effects of market turbulence, but insisted that the economy remained sound.\u201cCurrently, global economic trends are opaque and confusing, and market volatility is quite large, and this has had some impact on the Chinese economy,\u201d Mr. Li said, according to a report on Chinese television news. \u201cBut fundamentally the overall stability of the Chinese economy has not changed, and positive factors sustaining a turn for the better in the real economy are accumulating.\u201dChina, he added, would be able to fulfill its economic goals for the year. Mr. Li also noted that there would be no continued depreciation of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, after a sharp devaluation earlier this month. The currency \u201ccan maintain fundamental stability at a reasonable and balanced level,\u201d he said.Even so, the tumult has prompted further action by the leadership.In an aggressive two-part move on Tuesday, the central bank lowered the benchmark lending and deposit rates by 0.25 of a percentage point. It also cut the so-called reserve requirement ratio \u2014 the amount of cash that banks are required to hold in reserve \u2014 by 0.5 of a percentage point. It was China\u2019s fifth interest rate cut since November, and the fourth reduction of the reserve ratio since February. The central bank made a similar tandem cut to both rates in June, when the stock market first began to fall from its peak, but that reduction of the reserve ratio did not apply to the biggest banks.\u201cCurrently, there are persisting downward pressures on the country\u2019s economic growth,\u201d the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said in an explanation that accompanied the announcement Tuesday evening. \u201cThere has also been quite large volatility in global capital markets recently, and monetary policy tools need to be applied more flexibly.\u201dThe central bank also made a step toward interest rate liberalization by removing the upper limit on interest rates for fixed-term deposits of more than one year. With inflation in China generally low, the bank said the time was ripe for such steps. \u201cThis marks another important step forward in interest rate marketization reforms for our country,\u201d it said.At the same time, China has been struggling with deflation, or falling prices, in its industrial sector for more than three years. Injecting more funds by freeing banks to lend more should help soften the blow of deflation and stem capital outflows.Li-Gang Liu, the chief China economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, estimated that the reserve ratio cut would immediately insert about 650 billion renminbi, or about $100 billion, into the banking system.The cut \u201cwill spur bank lending and lower firms\u2019 funding costs,\u201d he wrote in a research note on Tuesday after the central bank\u2019s announcement. But Mr. Liu doubted these latest measures alone would be enough to meet the government\u2019s economic growth target of about 7 percent this year. He continued, \u201cFurther monetary policy easing by the People\u2019s Bank of China is still in the cards.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Tires From a Desert Shrub Found in the U.S.", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, tire industry executives, as well as government officials and scientists, have sought a domestic source for natural rubber to escape the price fluctuations of imports and, more recently, to avoid petroleum, which is used to make synthetic rubber.Now, Cooper Tire and Rubber Company has reached an important milestone in that effort, and is expected to demonstrate tires this week with components made of rubber from the guayule plant, a desert shrub cultivated in the Southwest.Cooper Tire executives, who are leading a consortium to develop and market the substance, say they expect to make a complete tire from guayule-derived parts by early 2017. The group includes PanAridus, which is growing the plants and manufacturing the rubber, as well as Cornell and Clemson Universities.\u201cIn two years,\u201d said Mike Fraley, chief executive of PanAridus, \u201cwe\u2019ve traveled from test tubes to tires.\u201dThe effort is one of several underway as companies work to develop a domestic guayule industry.Bridgestone opened a bio-rubber research and manufacturing center last year and Ford has a partnership with Ohio State University to help use the substance in automotive applications.In addition to producing a latex that can be processed into rubber, the guayule plant produces resin that can become adhesives, flavors, fragrances, and biofuel, and fibrous matter that can become biofuel or construction materials.Though the biomass research project began relatively recently, the nation\u2019s interest in guayule reaches back to the beginning of the last century. In the early 1900s, historians say, American industrialists began producing rubber from guayule in Mexico, but the Mexican Revolution put an end to commercial production there and the Depression later halted the efforts that had moved to the United States.Interest in guayule as an alternative returned during World War II, when the Japanese cut off access to hevea-based rubber, spurring the Emergency Rubber Project, which involved thousands of scientists, technicians and laborers, some of them Japanese internees. Interest fell off again with the end of the war and the development of synthetic rubber, but was rekindled after the oil crisis of the 1970s, which led to a new round of government-supported research.Tire executives say that global demand for tires, which use as much as 70 percent of the world\u2019s rubber supply, will expand as less developed nations industrialize, requiring roughly 21 million additional acres of hevea, the source of natural rubber, by 2024.Although guayule grows much faster than hevea, hevea\u2019s rubber has certain attributes that have proved tricky to replicate, including resistance to cracking and the ability to prevent high heat buildup. Cooper has so far managed to make a number of tire components with 100 percent guayule, and said work for all of the components that would be replaced is either complete or in the advanced stages.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to replace a little bit of the rubber in a component,\u201d said Howard Colvin, a senior scientist at Cooper. \u201cWhen you replace all of it, everything shows up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bets That the Fed Will Delay Interest Rate Rise Could Be Premature", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheir conclusion is a striking rejection of the Fed\u2019s stated plans \u2014 and it appears premature.The Fed watches financial markets closely, of course. Investors are losing money they might have spent, and falling prices can be an indicator of broader economic problems.But the losses so far probably aren\u2019t big enough to crimp growth, and officials have plenty of time to see what happens next. The Fed\u2019s policy making committee doesn\u2019t meet until mid-September, and it has two more meetings scheduled later this year, in October and December.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.\u201cThe current bout of market turmoil, if it continues, might persuade the Fed to hold off on raising interest rates in September,\u201d Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Monday. \u201cSince that volatility doesn\u2019t reflect any genuine economic slump, however, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it proved short-lived, leaving the way open for the Fed to begin raising rates at some point this year.\u201dJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said that the Fed wants to raise its benchmark rate slowly over the next several years, gradually reducing its long-running stimulus campaign to bring the economy back to good health. The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008.The Fed has repeatedly delayed the beginning of that process, as economic growth has fallen short of its expectations. But as recently as June, most members of the Fed\u2019s leadership \u2014 15 of the 17 senior officials \u2014 indicated they planned to start raising rates this year.That plan faced considerable skepticism even before the recent market downturn. Inflation has remained persistently sluggish since the Great Recession, even as job growth has strengthened. Some Fed officials cautioned that the central bank had not done enough to raise inflation toward its targeted 2 percent annual pace.Recent events have heightened those misgivings. The decline of oil prices and China\u2019s latest economic stimulus may further damp inflation. The fall of stock prices also reflects concern among some investors about the health of the domestic economy. The share of Americans without jobs remains unusually high and wage growth remains weak, problems that a premature rate increase could worsen.In addition, the International Monetary Fund has expressed concern that the Fed, by raising rates, could increase pressure on developing economies.And the market\u2019s decline helps mitigate worries that low interest rates encourage excessive speculation.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Against that backdrop, more investors are now concluding that the Fed will decide to wait a little longer before raising rates.Measures of expectations derived from asset prices have shifted sharply in recent days. The odds of a September rate increase, by one measure, fell by half, from about 48 percent last week to just 22 percent on Monday. Even more striking, the odds of a rate increase this year fell below 50 percent for the first time.Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, who had predicted a September lift until the recent stock market sell-off, said he now expected the Fed to wait until March.\u201cAlthough we continue to see economic activity in the U.S. as solid and justifying modest rate hikes, we believe the Federal Reserve is unlikely to begin a hiking cycle in this environment for fear that such a move may further destabilize markets,\u201d Mr. Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Fed officials may reach a different conclusion, but the shift in expectations still poses a challenge because officials have said they want markets to be ready for an increase. By minimizing the element of surprise, they hope to minimize volatility.If the Fed wants to convince investors that September is still on the table, time is running short. The most obvious opportunity comes this weekend, when central bankers will gather in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming for an annual policy conference. The Fed\u2019s vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, is scheduled to speak.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Exchange in Australia Woos Listings From China", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Just two companies are listed on the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange in Sydney, and it has to rely on its biggest Australian rival to clear and settle trades.But that has not diminished the ambitions of George Wang, the chairman of the AIMS Financial Group, which acquired the exchange in October 2008. Mr. Wang, who arrived here from China in November 1988 as a 26-year-old English language student, hopes to capitalize on the voracious appetite for stock market listings by Chinese companies despite the recent downturn.Before this year\u2019s plunge in Chinese shares, which at one stage wiped out more than $3 trillion in market value, 500 mainland Chinese companies were lined up to list on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A stock markets, according to investment bankers and fund managers in Hong Kong.Now the plans of these Chinese companies are in limbo after Beijing froze initial public offerings, which were blamed for contributing to a stock market bubble. In the 12 months through May, Chinese stocks available to mainland investors soared 119 percent in Shanghai and 121 percent in Shenzhen.The stock turmoil has not curbed Mr. Wang\u2019s optimism that his stock exchange can act as a bridge between capital-hungry Chinese companies and the $1.53 trillion in Australia\u2019s pension funds.Mr. Wang also thinks his stock market can be a tonic for the Chinese market volatility that can scare off everyday investors. In 2015, Chinese initial public offerings on average rose about 44 percent on their first day of trading, according to a banker based in Hong Kong, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Such offerings sometimes rose by their 10 percent daily limit for a few days after that.\u201cChina\u2019s market is up and down, but Asia Pacific exchange is market for long term,\u201d said Mr. Wang, whose gregarious personality features plenty of smiles and a touch on the arm or leg of the person he speaks with.\u201cAustralia has unique position, can be important financial hub Asia Pacific,\u201d Mr. Wang said.There is still a lot of work to do, though. Regulators in Australia and China have not yet approved Mr. Wang\u2019s vision for trading renminbi-denominated stocks on the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange. And the exchange\u2019s existing trading system, criticized as being outdated, is being replaced with the Nasdaq OMX platform.Still, Mr. Wang expects the business to break even next year. By the end of 2017, he predicts that more than 30 companies will be trading on the exchange. Two years ago, he predicted that 200 companies would be trading on the exchange. Still, Mr. Wang has spent considerable time wooing Chinese officials and chief executives, judging by the photographs in his office at the AIMS Financial Group, which also has offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.Mr. Wang, who is 53, has always seen the potential in Australia.Born in Qionghai on the island of Hainan to a local government official and a stay-at-home mother, Mr. Wang studied environmental engineering at Donghua University in Shanghai, graduating in 1984. He got a job with the government in Guangdong, the Chinese province that borders Hong Kong.But Mr. Wang grew dissatisfied and restless and he looked for a new start. He decided to go to Australia where he felt there were more opportunities for him to make a mark because its smaller population meant less competition.After 12 months of English and computer courses, Mr. Wang got a job as a salesman for AMP, Australia\u2019s biggest insurer, paid only if he persuaded people to buy an insurance or investment product. After three months without earning money, Mr. Wang put an advertisement in The Australian Chinese Daily asking Chinese immigrants if they would like to \u201csave thousands of dollars\u201d in taxes by investing in the country\u2019s new pension plan. The next day he made about $15,000.But by 1991, Mr. Wang had tired of AMP and the spotty record of its fund managers, which made him uncomfortable when he spoke to his clients. He started AIMS.Mr. Wang\u2019s ready smile vanishes and his features harden when asked about AIMS\u2019s shareholders, its annual sales and profits and his personal stake in the company. \u201cConfidential,\u201d is his reply.He is similarly tight-lipped about his personal life.In the few snippets that he will let slip, Mr. Wang, who became an Australian citizen in 1994, said he had been married for more than 15 years to a \u201cwife from China.\u201d The Wangs live with their daughter in Sydney\u2019s exclusive eastern seaside suburb Rose Bay where Mr Wang tries as often as he can to go for ocean swims.Mr. Wang says he needs just four hours of sleep, and he rises at 5 a.m. to meditate for as much as an hour. He carries and often fiddles with Buddhist prayer beads in meetings.AIMS has arranged about $6.2 billion worth of home loans and about $2.3 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities, according to its website. The company has also raised about $770 million from foreign investors to invest in Australian real estate.Australia grants permanent residency to people who have at least 5 million Australian dollars, about $3.6 million, to make \u201ccomplying investments in Australia.\u201d Under Australia\u2019s business migration program, China\u2019s affluent immigrants have bought prime real estate, opened bank accounts and sent their children to live in their new homes in the face of an anti-corruption drive by President Xi Jinping.In 2007, Mr. Wang was having dinner with John Howard, the prime minister of Australia, who warned the group of about a dozen businessmen that Deutsche Bank, among others, was predicting a crash in the United States housing market. Mr. Wang decided to stop issuing mortgage-backed securities, thus avoiding losses that crippled other financial firms.\u201cImportant to listen to people who know more,\u201d he simply said of his business decision.The next year, Mr. Wang was among the top sponsors of Australia\u2019s Olympic team at the Beijing Olympics, rubbing shoulders with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who speaks Mandarin Chinese. Weeks later, he was asked if he wanted to buy the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange from the Australian stockbroker Austock just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\u201cI wanted to be bridge of Australia, Asia,\u201d Mr. Wang said.In May, AIMS acquired the failed stockbroker BBY, which Mr. Wang envisions as part of his growing empire.Mr. Wang wants to open BBY offices throughout Asia and transform BBY into an important broker of capital flows in the region as he lobbies regulators to approve his plans for the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange.It is in discussing his vision of the future that his optimism turns steely serious.\u201cI know I can\u2019t make a mistake,\u201d Mr. Wang said.An article on Wednesday about George Wang, owner of the Asia Pacific Stock Exchange in Sydney,Australia, misidentified the university where he studied engineering. It was East China Textile Institute of Science and Technology in Shanghai, now known as Donghua University; it was not Chinese Eastern University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge in Greece as Athens Exchange Reopens", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Investors issued a vote of no confidence in Greece\u2019s economy on Monday, dumping stocks as trading on the Athens exchange resumed for the first time in five weeks.A plunge of more than 16 percent for the main Greek index and a 30 percent sell-off for bank stocks were the latest signs of Greece\u2019s shattered economy. But the resumption of trading was a necessary step as Greece tries to emerge from controls on financial activity that the government, confronted with a bank run, imposed at the end of June.Analysts said stock prices could begin to recover in the weeks to come, bringing much-needed capital into the country, as investors with an appetite for risk look for bargains.In yet another sign of trouble, though, new survey data on Monday showed a fall in Greek manufacturing activity since the government imposed controls in late June on the flow of money out of Greece.Much depends on the outcome of negotiations between government officials and representatives of the country\u2019s international creditors on a multibillion-euro bailout, Greece\u2019s third in five years. The talks entered a second week on Monday.\u201cIf the new deal with creditors is struck and ratified, Greek stocks could rebound nicely,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in an email. \u201cAnd if the deal then actually holds, with Greece implementing the structural reforms demanded by creditors, Greece could recover strongly.\u201dHe added: \u201cThat is a big if.\u201dAfter initial talks with foreign envoys on Friday that focused on Greece\u2019s finances, privatization of public assets and bank recapitalization, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said that \u201cthere was convergence on some points, less on others.\u201dThe resumption of trading in Athens was intended to be another step toward normalcy, but instead, investors used the opportunity to flee exposure to the Greek economy.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Shares on the exchange initially dropped nearly 23 percent as trading began on Monday, with bank stocks leading the rout. While the main index recovered somewhat by the end of trading, bank shares did not. They might have fallen even more on Monday, but selling was halted after the declines reached 30 percent, in accordance with Athens stock exchange rules.Banking has been among the hardest-hit sectors of the Greek economy, and lenders are dependent on emergency cash from the European Central Bank to stay afloat.Greek shares recovered slightly by closing and were down 16 percent, but the initial price declines showed that most investors were not yet willing to bet on the country again.Bank stocks \u201cwill fall quite a bit more and will take a while to rebound,\u201d said Nikos Pantelakis, chief executive of Pantelakis Securities, an Athens brokerage firm.Mr. Pantelakis said that shares of companies outside the financial industry, like the telecom company OTE, Aegean Airlines or the betting firm OPAP \u201cwill recover faster.\u201dNiki Kitsantonis reported from Athens and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stock Buybacks Draw Scrutiny From Politicians", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookShould corporate stock buybacks be regulated? Or made illegal?Those are the questions not-so-quietly being floated in Washington by a group of elected officials and others trying to get elected, including most recently, Hillary Rodham Clinton.Is the government really going to outlaw buybacks, which over the past decade have become one of the business world\u2019s favorite corporate finance tools?On its face, the issue may seem like a nonstarter. But a growing debate has emerged around the topic of buybacks that increasingly has Wall Street and corporate America worried.The buyback craze, in which virtually every big company from Apple to General Electric to Walmart has participated, has led to a backlash from some investors and government officials, who have questioned whether such use of profits is a productive way to deploy capital rather than reinvesting in businesses and jobs.A renewed focus on the issue has taken place recently as a result of one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches, in which she discussed all the money that companies are pouring into buybacks. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t leave much money to build a new factory or a research lab, or to train workers, or to give them a raise,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.She then offered what some think is her first salvo in the regulation of buybacks: \u201cOther advanced economies \u2014 like the United Kingdom and Hong Kong \u2014 require companies to disclose stock buybacks within one day. But here in the United States, you can go an entire quarter without disclosing. So let\u2019s change that.\u201dMrs. Clinton raises an interesting point about the disclosure rule, one that, if changed, would most likely make it much tougher \u2014 or at least more expensive \u2014 for American companies to buy back shares. Indeed, international companies have done a lot less of it.Her point tiptoes around a more explosive claim from Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Tammy Baldwin that buybacks might be a form of market manipulation. Both senators have urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the practice.\u201cThese buybacks were treated as stock manipulation for decades because that is exactly what they are,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThe S.E.C. needs to recognize that.\u201dIndeed, it was that rule change that led to the surge in buybacks, which were considered shareholder friendly. And it\u2019s considered tax efficient: Unlike a dividend, there is no tax to be immediately paid.But companies were also driven to pursue buybacks by executives seeking to lift their pay. Buybacks enable companies to issue more stock to executives without diluting other shareholders because they can buy shares to offset the dilution that occurs when executives exercise their stock options.Buybacks are enticing for corporate executives, but they can create other problems, including the risk that they repurchase their companies\u2019 shares at the exact wrong time, when their stock prices are too high. Worse, some companies take on debt to buy their own shares.Still, Warren E. Buffett, the investor, has repeatedly said he is a big fan of buybacks \u2014 but only when used prudently: \u201cI favor repurchases when two conditions are met: First, a company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to the company\u2019s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated. We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test.\u201dSo what could the S.E.C. actually do about buybacks?Goldman\u2019s research note said that the two most obvious policy changes would be \u201csecurities rules related to the transactions themselves, or tax changes that increase the relative cost to corporations of buying back their own stock instead of paying dividends or making investments in productive capital.\u201dThose may be worthy goals. But it is hard to tell a company how it can or cannot spend its money. Ultimately, the pressure for companies to invest in their operations and new jobs is only going to come when managements see a real business opportunity \u2014 and shareholders demand it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Moveable Glut", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat caused Friday\u2019s stock plunge? What does it mean for the future? Nobody knows, and not much.Still, investors are clearly jittery \u2014 with good reason. U.S. economic news has been good though not great lately, but the world as a whole still seems remarkably accident-prone. For seven years and counting we\u2019ve lived in a global economy that lurches from crisis to crisis: Every time one part of the world finally seems to get back on its feet, another part stumbles. And America can\u2019t insulate itself completely from these global woes.But why does the world economy keep stumbling?On the surface, we seem to have had a remarkable run of bad luck. First there was the housing bust, and the banking crisis it triggered. Then, just as the worst seemed to be over, Europe went into debt crisis and double-dip recession. Europe eventually achieved a precarious stability and began growing again \u2014 but now we\u2019re seeing big problems in China and other emerging markets, which were previously pillars of strength.But these aren\u2019t just a series of unrelated accidents. Instead, what we\u2019re seeing is what happens when too much money is chasing too few investment opportunities.Of course, the boom became a bubble, which inflicted immense damage when it burst. Furthermore, that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. There was also a flood of capital from Germany and other northern European countries to Spain, Portugal, and Greece. This too turned out to be a bubble, and the bursting of that bubble in 2009-2010 precipitated the euro crisis.So where does the moving finger of glut go now? Why, back to America, where a fresh inflow of foreign funds has driven the dollar way up, threatening to make our industry uncompetitive again.Whatever the precise mix of causes, what\u2019s important now is that policy makers take seriously the possibility, I\u2019d say probability, that excess savings and persistent global weakness is the new normal.My sense is that there\u2019s a deep-seated unwillingness, even among sophisticated officials, to accept this reality. Partly this is about special interests: Wall Street doesn\u2019t want to hear that an unstable world requires strong financial regulation, and politicians who want to kill the welfare state don\u2019t want to hear that government spending and debt aren\u2019t problems in the current environment.But there\u2019s also, I believe, a sort of emotional prejudice against the very notion of global glut. Politicians and technocrats alike want to view themselves as serious people making hard choices \u2014 choices like cutting popular programs and raising interest rates. They don\u2019t like being told that we\u2019re in a world where seemingly tough-minded policies will actually make things worse. But we are, and they will.Charles M. Blow is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Cheer and a Half for Cheap Commodities", "Date": "2015-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesCommodities markets have taken a beating this summer. Oil, coal, coffee, soybeans, copper, iron and nearly every other commodity has fallen sharply in price, upending currency markets and inflicting pain in large parts of the world economy.But few Americans are complaining. Unless you are trading soybeans or have been focused on the battered shares of companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, or on sinking currencies like the Brazilian real or South African rand, you may not have noticed the commodities debacle.For many of us, in fact, the commodities rout hasn\u2019t been perceived as a crisis at all: It has seemed to be welcome news. That is understandable, though that view may be shortsighted.Consider gasoline, probably the most closely monitored commodity in America, one whose price is posted prominently at filling stations all over the country. Compared with the recent past, gas is still very cheap.Declines in the commodities markets have already had a damping effect on inflation in the United States and are likely to restrain it in future data releases, said Azhar Iqbal, an econometrician with Wells Fargo Securities.How much of an effect has the decline in the commodities market had on inflation? As a rough guideline, note that the widely followed CRB Commodities index has declined more than 18 percent since May 2014. Every 10 percentage point drop in that index shaves 0.4 percentage point from the annual headline C.P.I. number in America, and a lesser amount, less than 0.1 percentage point, from the core inflation index, Mr. Iqbal\u2019s economic model shows. \u201cThe fall in commodity prices has had a measurable effect in the United States,\u201d he said.The price declines have complicated matters for the Federal Reserve, which has said that after nearly seven years it will begin to raise short-term interest rates from their near-zero level, if data on inflation and unemployment justify the move.The unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent in July, its lowest level in years, the Labor Department said on Friday. \u201cThe low inflation rate, which is connected to commodities, may have induced the Fed to have waited this long to raise interest rates,\u201d said Jay Bryson, a global economist with Wells Fargo Securities. Low interest rates are generally thought to be bullish for the stock market, and while the shares of commodities producers have been hammered, the overall American stock market has undoubtedly been helped by that commodities market effect, he said.But even if Americans outside the oil patch haven\u2019t been hurt directly, there are important reasons for them to be concerned about the damage in the commodities markets.\u201cHistorically, commodities have been very sensitive indicators of global economic activity,\u201d said Edward Yardeni, an independent economist and strategist. Big declines in the CRB index have typically presaged recessions and bear markets in stocks, he said.He is not expecting that to happen now partly because the imbalances in commodities markets seem largely to have resulted from miscalculations that led to excess supply. \u201cIt\u2019s not that demand is that weak,\u201d he said, which would be more serious. \u201cThe problem is mainly with global supplies.\u201dChina is the world\u2019s biggest commodity consumer, HSBC figures show. It accounts for 12.8 percent of all global commodity imports. (The comparable figure for the United States, the second-biggest global consumer, is 10.3 percent.) And these days, when China sneezes, the commodity markets run for cover.Currency markets have responded to the changes in the terms of trade, weakening the currencies of commodity producers and strengthening the American dollar. (The Chinese renminbi, which the government keeps in a narrow band linked to the dollar, has strengthened against other currencies, too.) That will make imports to the United States cheaper, and it will make exports more expensive, helping rebalance global supply and demand, Mr. Yardeni said. It can be expected to slow American economic growth and speed up growth in commodity-producing countries that are in dire need of stimulus, he said. \u201cWe need to keep our fingers crossed and hope that all works out.\u201dHe added that there was a good chance that it would work out for the United States. Enjoy the quiet and the low prices, by all means, he said. But be aware that unstable and declining global markets can be quite dangerous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Universal Conquers the Box Office, Without a Superhero", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon Sense\u201cNo capes.\u201dThat, in the words of Edna, the costume designer in Pixar\u2019s \u201cThe Incredibles,\u201d pretty much sums up the strategy that has catapulted the once-struggling Universal to the top of the box-office charts this year and a remarkable string of nine hits out of its last 10 releases.The studio has accomplished the feat without a single superhero franchise film, which stands on its head the conventional wisdom that action heroes in big-budget spectacles are the only predictable road to success in Hollywood these days.Last weekend, Universal\u2019s hard-to-categorize hip-hop saga \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d had an opening weekend box office of more than $60 million, surpassing the opening weekends for what were expected to be two of this summer\u2019s biggest franchise hits, Disney\u2019s latest Marvel superhero film, \u201cAnt-Man,\u201d and Paramount\u2019s latest \u201cMission Impossible\u201d installment.\u201cUniversal struck gold this summer,\u201d said Doug Creutz, an analyst who covers the media for the Cowen Group. \u201cThey had the right mix of movies. Some of this was skill. Some of it was luck. Some of it is just the randomness of the movie business. I don\u2019t think even the people at Universal can really explain it.\u201dJeff Shell, chairman of Universal\u2019s Filmed Entertainment Group, said he didn\u2019t believe that he and his colleagues had somehow unlocked the secret to the movie business. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough cyclical business,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is try to increase the chances of success.\u201dUniversal\u2019s string of hits this year has included big-budget action spectacles like \u201cJurassic World\u201d (already the third-highest grossing film of all time) and \u201cFurious 7\u201d (which set records in China), the animated \u201cMinions\u201d and lower-budget female-oriented films like \u201cPitch Perfect 2\u201d and \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d(\u201cFurious\u201d and \u201cMinions\u201d were originally scheduled for last year, but delays pushed their revenue into 2015.)The R-rated comedy sequel \u201cTed 2\u201d has been Universal\u2019s only misfire among its last 10 films, and even that has grossed $174 million worldwide. Universal leads this year\u2019s box-office sweepstakes with more than $2 billion in revenue, a remarkable 28 percent market share.While Universal has a comfortable lead over the second-place Disney, it\u2019s too soon to know the outcome for the year, because Disney has a \u201cStar Wars\u201d installment coming in December, its first \u201cStar Wars\u201d film since it bought Lucasfilm in 2012. Disney is the embodiment of the current big-budget, event-film strategy that Wall Street likes for its perceived predictable revenue stream. Under its chief executive, Bob Iger, Disney spent $7.4 billion for Pixar, $4 billion for Marvel and $4 billion for Lucasfilm \u2014 all big bets that seem to be paying off.But Universal has taken a radically different approach, in part through necessity. Disney already owns Marvel, and Warner owns DC Comics, which means there aren\u2019t many superhero franchises left. And Universal\u2019s tight-fisted parent, the cable and broadband giant Comcast, is loath to spend billions buying other people\u2019s franchises.\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of making money for shareholders,\u201d said Mr. Shell, a Comcast executive installed as head of Universal about two years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on the bottom line. We\u2019re proud of the small movies that generate significant profitability. And sometimes small movies become big movies.\u201dDonna Langley, chairwoman of Universal Pictures and a 15-year veteran at Universal, added, \u201cHaving the right ownership and a strong management team,\u201d which includes Ron Meyer, vice chairman of NBCUniversal, \u201chas enabled us to step back, do what we do well and focus on what we need to improve on. We\u2019re not trying to emulate what other studios are doing.\u201dUniversal has spent relatively modest amounts to help build Illumination Entertainment, an animation studio co-owned by Universal and Chris Meledandri, chief executive of Illumination, who has already created a lucrative franchise with \u201cDespicable Me\u201d and this summer\u2019s hit prequel, \u201cMinions.\u201d Universal\u2019s biggest franchise, the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d action series, with its bankable star, Vin Diesel, was developed internally, with the original opening in 2001.Even \u201cJurassic World\u201d was hardly a sure hit. Universal and Steven Spielberg acquired the rights to Michael Crichton\u2019s best-selling dinosaur epic \u201cJurassic Park\u201d even before the book was published in 1990, for a modest $2 million. It had been 12 years since the last installment, as Mr. Spielberg rejected scripts he deemed inadequate. Even with Mr. Spielberg\u2019s blessing, the latest version got mixed reviews and some out-and-out pans from critics. But thanks in part to a huge and well-executed digital marketing campaign, it became the must-see movie of the summer, eclipsing even the Disney/Marvel blockbuster \u201cAvengers\u201d sequel.\u201cThere was a social media aspect to it that kind of created a network effect,\u201d Mr. Creutz said of \u201cJurassic World.\u201d \u201cEveryone was talking about it so everyone had to see it. The marketing was very effective. But beyond that I can\u2019t really explain it. \u2018Mad Max: Fury Road\u2019 was four times as good a movie, but it didn\u2019t do nearly as well.\u201dWhile \u201cJurassic World\u201d and \u201cFurious\u201d could be considered classic big-budget \u201ctent pole\u201d movies, the kind of films that can prop up an entire slate, they were the only two in Universal\u2019s summer lineup. The studio has also targeted the kind of smaller-budget comedies, dramas and musicals that, while hardly independent art-house fare, have rekindled hopes in Hollywood that something other than action blockbusters can still be made successfully.\u201cCompton,\u201d the studio\u2019s latest big hit, a musical biopic of the hip-hop group N.W.A., is hardly mainstream blockbuster fare. But it opened to glowing reviews during a national conversation about race and police tactics aimed at young black men like the early hip-hop stars portrayed in the movie. It, too, has generated buzz on social media far beyond the urban black communities like the one in which it\u2019s set. Universal said the film was well on its way to $150 million in domestic box-office sales and cost just $29 million to make.A low-budget musical about a women\u2019s a cappella singing group with an ensemble cast lacking major stars would hardly seem like a big-grossing film, let alone franchise material, but the success of \u201cPitch Perfect 2\u201d suggests that Universal may have generated another franchise hit.Ms. Langley said the studio had noticed that the original \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d had \u201ca strong afterlife. The song was a hit. It did well on home video. We knew it was tapping into something.\u201d It could easily have been marketed as a small, off-season movie, but \u201cwe gave it an early summer date and treated it like a big summer film,\u201d she said. It has grossed $184 million in domestic sales and cost just $29 million.Some supposedly \u201csafe\u201d blockbuster films from other studios were flops, like Paramount\u2019s latest \u201cTerminator\u201d installment and Warner\u2019s \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d And with Fox\u2019s \u201cFantastic Four\u201d bombing at the box office this month, there are increasing signs of possible boredom with superheroes.Whether Universal\u2019s success this season with more offbeat fare encourages other studios to take more creative risks remains unclear.\u201cWhat\u2019s coming are a lot of superhero, franchise and would-be franchise movies,\u201d Mr. Creutz said. \u201cEverybody is imitating Disney, though maybe not quite as extreme.\u201dHe said that Universal\u2019s lack of superhero fare might actually help it, because there are going to be so many superhero movies battling for market share.\u201cI\u2019m really concerned,\u201d Mr. Creutz said. \u201cThe number of these big-budget action and animation films is increasing, and the number that can succeed is decreasing. Those lines aren\u2019t going to cross in a good place for many studios.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Tumble 6.2% Amid Government Intervention Efforts", "Date": "2015-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Mainland Chinese stock markets unexpectedly slumped again on Tuesday, with the Shanghai market plunging by 6.2 percent.Following a yearlong boom, stocks have been volatile of late, prompting aggressive action by the government to help stabilize the market. There was no obvious catalyst for the drop in stocks on Tuesday.The sudden drop on Tuesday came just one week after China sent a jolt through global financial markets with a surprise devaluation of its currency, the renminbi, in an attempt to reinvigorate the country\u2019s exports. The state intervention in mainland stocks and currency markets has raised concerns that China\u2019s economy could be in worse shape than official data suggests.Trading volumes in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been relatively light since early July, when the government introduced several remarkable measures in an attempt to support plunging share prices. Those included ordering government agencies to buy stocks with funding from state banks and preventing shareholders who own more than 5 percent of a company\u2019s stock from selling.The Shanghai index closed Tuesday at 3,748.16 points \u2014 7 percent above the low it reached on July 8, before the state\u2019s market rescue efforts began to kick in. The market is down more than a quarter from its peak in mid-June.Xinhua, the Chinese state-owned news agency, wrote on Twitter that investors were \u201cin stampede again!\u201d The agency noted that shares in about 1,000 companies fell by the 10 percent daily limit, and the post was accompanied by an illustration of a giant hand dangling the grim reaper over a group of people heading for an exit.The stock market sell-off came as new signs showed that volatility was creeping back into China\u2019s currency markets. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, pushed its official setting for the renminbi\u2019s exchange rate 4.4 percent lower last week \u2014 the currency\u2019s biggest drop since 1994.The renminbi stabilized on Friday and Monday, when its value barely budged in flat trading. On Tuesday, the currency seesawed between gains and losses before closing up 0.01 percent, nearly unchanged from Monday, at 6.394 per dollar.There are, however, also signs that several government stimulus efforts \u2014 including interest rate cuts and targeted loans for infrastructure and other favored projects \u2014 are starting to take effect.Figures released on Tuesday showed more tentative signs of a rebound in the property market. New home prices in 70 major cities fell 5.4 percent in July compared with a year earlier, according to calculations from Bloomberg based on official data. But they increased by 0.2 percent from June, the third month in a row of consecutive improvement.An earlier version of a capsule summary for this article misstated the day of the market\u2019s fall. It was Tuesday, not Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Luxury Shoppers in London Seem Unfazed by Market Free Fall", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLondon \u2014 Twenty-four hours after the world\u2019s financial markets sustained a temporary free fall, wiping out almost $3 trillion in value from global stocks over three days, the dark clouds had yet to dampen the spirits of luxury shoppers on the streets of London.On a typical wet and windy British midsummer day on Bond Street, home to some of the most expensive retail square footage in the world, groups of Chinese tourists armed with Nike sneakers, Burberry umbrellas and Gucci bowling bags braved the downpours.Few appeared spooked by the dramatic market activity of recent months.\u201cWe have been looking forward to this trip for so long, we would never have changed our plans because of what the headlines in the newspapers say,\u201d said one visitor from Beijing laden with bags from Tod\u2019s, Tory Burch and Smythson, who declined to give her name.Down the road in another store, an immaculately dressed Mandarin-speaking sales assistant quietly agreed that the global market seemed to be far from shoppers\u2019 top concern.\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of American families over for the summer holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from the Middle East, too. The demand from Asia is still there, as far as I can see, maybe slightly slower this season but stronger than ever from other markets. Things didn\u2019t slow down in the wake of 2008,\u201d he added, before leaping to attention to assist a hijab-clad mother and daughter wearing matching Fendi sunglasses.On the other side of Hyde Park Corner in Knightsbridge, the gilded halls of Harrods, one of Britain\u2019s most opulent department stores, continued to surge with shoppers. From the crowds snaking up the exotic escalators, weighed down by new purchases, to the throngs gathered in the cool and cloistered accessories rooms, visitors remained plentiful.\u201cI come every summer with my family from Kuwait from May to October and have done so for years,\u201d said Faisal Said, 36, who was sporting a Panerai watch and Supreme baseball cap while walking briskly through the food court. \u201cWe base ourselves here in London but travel around the continent also.\u201dMr. Said, who has a portfolio of investments, said he had seen mobile alerts about the domino effect of the felling of global markets in recent days, but noted that what goes down also comes up, and that consumer shopping habits don\u2019t always sync with the peaks and troughs of equities in foreign countries.\u201cWhen the oil price fell, that was a disaster for many people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not lots of shoppers in America. Didn\u2019t they spend less on gas for their cars but more in their stores? To me, these things don\u2019t always have immediate or obvious effects.\u201dHe\u2019s not the only one to think so.Most industry observers suggest that, while worrisome, currency devaluations and recent market declines will not be enough to offset the long-term compounding of global economic growth and consumers\u2019 appetite for luxury goods.In the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, the financial sector boomed. And while the slump in Hong Kong spending has exacted a level of damage for some brands over the last 12 months, the malls of mainland China have never been engines of growth, given the hefty import taxes and the savings to shoppers going abroad \u2014 to South Korea, Singapore or even Europe.\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d said Michael Ward, the managing director for Harrods. \u201cThe bulk of luxury consumption by value is made by high-net-worth individuals who can afford to lose some money on the stock market without changing their lifestyles too much or thinking twice about purchases.\u201dHe said a slowdown by Chinese shoppers to Britain over the last year had more to do with international travel hassles than the shuddering Chinese economy. \u201cThe Chinese have been spending less here because of the difficulty of applying for a U.K. tourist visa,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cMany just head over to Paris, instead, to make their purchases.\u201dThere will have to be quite a balancing act in the coming months given the macro uncertainty on the horizon, said Luca Solca, an analyst at the investment firm Exane BNP Paribas. \u201cThis business is based on alchemy, not science,\u201d Mr. Solca said. \u201cThings could be better, but they could also be far, far worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Slump May Test Investors\u2019 Good Will", "Date": "2015-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe golden-child status of the Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba hangs by a thread.The company announced disappointing quarterly revenue growth on Wednesday, pushing its shares as close as they have ever been to last year\u2019s initial public stock offering price. Investors haven\u2019t much challenged its founder\u2019s free rein so far. A weakening business and over $100 billion of lost market capitalization since the shares hit a high in November may change that.Revenue in the three months to June grew 28 percent year-on-year \u2014 the slowest in three years \u2014 to $3.27 billion, missing the expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Gross merchandise value, the sticker price of goods transacted on Alibaba\u2019s shopping platforms, increased 34 percent \u2014 just over half the rate of two years ago. In comparison, transactions on the much smaller rival JD.com soared 82 percent in the same quarter. Fears of a sputtering Chinese economy, driven by a surprise slide in the renminbi, helped send Alibaba\u2019s shares down to $71 intraday on Wednesday.Since the company went public in New York last year in a $25 billion blockbuster share offering, investors have been tolerant as its founder, Jack Ma, unveiled his sweeping but confusing vision. Alibaba once simply matched buyers and sellers; now it is part of an \u201conline-to-offline\u201d empire that extends to movies, health care, cloud computing and even a bank. Just two days ago, a $4.6 billion investment in the retailer Suning took Alibaba into the struggling electronics superstore sector. It\u2019s not clear Suning\u2019s low-margin business will do anything but harm Alibaba\u2019s bottom line. Still, the shares ticked up.It\u2019s conceivable, though, that as Alibaba shares edge toward last year\u2019s $68 initial public offering price, and roaring growth is no longer a given, investors\u2019 good will may become strained. There will be many more unexpected tests, if recent months\u2019 controversies over counterfeit products, pricing violations and intensifying competition are a guide. Investors can\u2019t change the control Mr. Ma wields over Alibaba\u2019s strategy, or his reluctance to explain it properly. But that doesn\u2019t mean they will always like it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tough Love of \u2018Austerity\u2019", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsAusterity, diet of our lives, girder of our loins. At the moment, the word brings to mind the continuing crisis in Greece and, by extension, the power of the Germans holding the purse strings. \u2018\u2018Austerity\u2019\u2019 has become the catchall word for the cost-cutting a government enacts in order to balance its books: Cut pensions, cut the public payroll, cut social services \u2014 cut whatever and wherever. Shrink spending, shrink debt, shrink deficits. The idea is to inspire confidence and make the place more attractive to investors, who prefer a government that\u2019s tough and lean to one that\u2019s marbled and tender.This shrewd (and, it must be said, mythical) household would become a favorite muse for austerity\u2019s proponents, even when they began talking about the economies of entire countries: the thrifty state as a bigger version of the thrifty household, taking care never to spend more than it takes in, scrimping and saving and carrying little to no debt. Unlike the household, though, which has been venerated ad nauseam, the state has historically been an object of suspicion, especially in classical economics. Mark Blyth, a political economist at Brown University and the author of \u2018\u2018Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea,\u2019\u2019 traces the concept of fiscal austerity back to the 17th-century British philosopher John Locke and an ambivalence toward state power. Locke and his fellow liberals recognized the need for government to overthrow the divine right of kings, but they also feared government, worrying it could give with one hand and take away with the other. Instead, Blyth writes, the market was to be the \u2018\u2018antidote to the confiscatory politics of the king,\u2019\u2019 and the bond market of creditors would keep the state in check. The smaller the government, the better; it should protect property rights and otherwise get out of the way.In other words, the market was to be left alone \u2014 \u2018\u2018laissez faire\u2019\u2019 \u2014 so that it was free to operate according to its natural laws. Recessions and downturns were the market\u2019s way of correcting itself. When government intervenes, it invariably distorts. During World War I, deficits in the United States ballooned, and a succession of American presidents in the 1920s were committed to slashing government spending. Warren G. Harding created a Federal Liquidation Board, whose purpose was the shuttering of government offices. \u2018\u2018We are going to cut the garment to fit the cloth,\u2019\u2019 he explained. His successor, Calvin Coolidge, once received a gift of two lion cubs and named them Tax Reduction and Budget Bureau. But it was the Treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who would perhaps become best known for an almost fanatical adherence to austerity. After the crash of 1929, President Herbert Hoover recalled in his memoirs, Mellon insisted that he knew what the country needed: \u2018\u2018Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.\u2019\u2019 The market had overindulged in speculation and borrowing, and it was issuing its own emetic. \u2018\u2018It will purge the rottenness out of the system,\u2019\u2019 Hoover remembered Mellon saying. \u2018\u2018People will work harder, live a more moral life.\u2019\u2019 Austerity was the natural consequence of the market returning to its purer, laissez-faire state. The ensuing Depression therefore gave laissez-faire a terrible name. In 1931, Business Week asked, \u2018\u2018Do You Still Believe in Lazy-Fairies?\u2019\u2019Austerity, however, could still bring to mind stiff upper lips and moral rectitude. In 1942, when wartime Britain was rationing items like cigarettes, soap flakes, eggs and tea, The Times ran an article called \u2018\u2018We, Too, Need Austerities\u2019\u2019 that praised what might be described as austerity chic: \u2018\u2018It is an \u2018austerity\u2019 that pots and pans and crockery and cutlery are of standard material and pattern.\u2019\u2019 The sacrifice may feel unpleasant, but the results induce envy. \u2018\u2018More cold and exercise have made the British tougher,\u2019\u2019 the writer marveled. \u2018\u2018The rationing diet is not only adequate for maintaining life and strength but it does not foster gluttony or put weight in the wrong places.\u2019\u2019A Marshall Plan and seven decades later, austerity is associated more with faceless technocrats imposing economic reform than families in threadbare sweaters making their meat ration last the week. The quaint image of household belt-tightening, however, continues to inspire some of the counterparties to Greece\u2019s $360 billion (and counting) debt. After Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, Merkel tut-tutted about the spendthrift banks and governments that had gorged on borrowed money. The \u2018\u2018Swabian housewife,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u2018\u2018would have told us her worldly wisdom: In the long run, you can\u2019t live beyond your means.\u2019\u2019Even those who are sympathetic to austerity may have a harder time with the word now. John Cochrane, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, told me that it \u2018\u2018started as bad marketing for some sensible policy\u2019\u2019 and has since become a \u2018\u2018general-purpose insult.\u2019\u2019 He tries to avoid it: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m in favor of \u2018growth-oriented policies\u2019 \u2014 isn\u2019t that a much prettier term?\u2019\u2019 Yes, though what it loses in insult, it perhaps makes up for in euphemism. \u2018\u2018Growth-oriented\u2019\u2019 is as irresistible to an American sensibility as sparen, \u2018\u2018to save,\u2019\u2019 is to a German one: It sounds like a no-brainer.It also masks something that the word \u2018\u2018austerity\u2019\u2019 does not. Austerity is often promoted as not only economically but morally necessary too \u2014 Greece, according to this argument, needs to be taught a very painful lesson, or else it\u2019s going to continue to do silly things with other people\u2019s money. Blyth told me that austerity policies, whatever we want to call them, turn an economic situation into \u2018\u2018a morality tale of saints and sinners,\u2019\u2019 leading to punishment rather than problem-solving. Besides, he says, this morality tale gets it backward. Austerity programs have historically been enacted in reaction to a banking crisis: A government goes into debt in order to rescue the banks, and so private debt is transferred onto the public balance sheet. Public spending is slashed as a result.Given that the poor benefit more from the kind of government spending that is cut, Blyth writes in his book, austerity \u2018\u2018relies on the poor paying for the mistakes of the rich.\u2019\u2019 Greece\u2019s people are becoming poorer: Last year, Unicef calculated that more than 40 percent of Greek children were living in poverty, a doubling from four years earlier. The conversations about Greece sound depressingly familiar, mimicking the ones we have here about the poor, the rich and who \u2018\u2018deserves\u2019\u2019 what. The setting might change, but the moral stays the same: Those with less are expected to be the ones to do without.Jennifer Szalai is an editor at The New York Times Book Review. She last wrote for the magazine about the complicated origins of the phrase \u2018\u2018having it all.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steady Financial Advice, With Friendship as a Bonus", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyCHICAGO \u2014 Anxiety-prone investors looking for safety in the stock market have sometimes found it in so-called widows-and-orphans stocks. At their best, they pay dividends for decades and bounce around a bit less when the markets convulse, as they have over the last week. For years, AT&T was the textbook example. Procter & Gamble was another.But it is rare to meet actual orphans with stock portfolios, let alone ones who have hung on to their investments for nearly half a century.After Barnaby Dinges lost his father at age 7 and his mother at 9, a stranger, Sanford Kovitz, volunteered to keep an eye on his money. A young father himself, Mr. Kovitz had heard about the situation and thought he could help.Nearly 50 years later, the two are still at it, having shepherded Mr. Dinges\u2019s portfolio through private school, college, parenthood, divorce and assorted hiccups and triumphs along the way. They bought here and sold there, but mostly they held, not just onto certain stocks but to an old-fashioned idea \u2014 that a very long-term relationship with an adviser looking out for your best interests can pay returns for both parties.Their buddy act began in 1968. Mr. Dinges\u2019s father, an ad man, had died two years earlier from leukemia; his mother, a fact-checker for Playboy magazine, died that year from cardiac arrest during surgery for an ulcer. Mr. Dinges and his older brother, Casey, had no living grandparents and no immediate family who could take them in.For the first few weeks after their mother\u2019s death, a different adult came to their apartment on Wrightwood Street here to spend the night and keep an eye on the boys. Often, the brothers had never met them. \u201cAll these young women,\u201d Barnaby recalled. \u201cThey could have been Playboy bunnies. I have no idea who they were.\u201dFortunately, life insurance proceeds formed the bulk of an inheritance. Some of it (plus the boys\u2019 Social Security checks) went to pay for living expenses and cover home renovations for the family that eventually took them in. But roughly $100,000 was left over, and someone needed to step in to try to make it last long enough to keep the boys at their private school and perhaps pay for college.Mr. Kovitz was a lawyer and trust officer on LaSalle Street, the Wall Street of Chicago. He received a call from a fellow lawyer about the boys, and a meeting ensued.\u201cIt\u2019s funny seeing your gray suit, because what I remember is a guy in a gray suit,\u201d recalled Mr. Dinges, who is now 56 years old, in a joint interview last month with Mr. Kovitz, whose office is still on LaSalle Street.\u201cIt\u2019s not that gray suit!\u201d Mr. Kovitz, 86, interrupted.\u201cI thought Sandy was a cool name and that he was a cool guy,\u201d Mr. Dinges continued. \u201cHe was going to look after my brother and me and was going to give us advice about financial stuff. I remember being very soothed by your presence and it calming me at a time when I was not calm.\u201dThis was the first time that Mr. Kovitz had pre-teenagers for clients, and he set about explaining things to them in plain English. \u201cWe set out to nurse these funds,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew we had to be careful, because there was a long way to go to get them to some kind of adulthood where they could fend for themselves.\u201dSoon, the boys were learning about buying investments in blue-chip companies and holding them for a long time. \u201cI was for some reason fixated on this Philadelphia Electric corporate bond,\u201d Casey Dinges said. \u201cIt blew my mind that you could have something with a 30-year maturity date.\u201d He sold it before then to make a down payment on a townhouse outside of Washington. Mr. Kovitz eventually encouraged him to find an adviser closer to his new home.His brother, Barnaby, however, mostly stuck around Illinois and learned what he came to refer to as the Sandy Kovitz test. An associate of Mr. Kovitz liked to be able to look out the 14th-floor window on LaSalle and see the headquarters of the companies whose shares he was buying, or come close at least. Back in the day, that meant McDonald\u2019s, Sears, Caterpillar and Abbott Laboratories.\u201cLet quality management of companies in different industries do the job for you,\u201d Mr. Kovitz said, outlining the rest of the bullet points that he still puts to use. \u201cIf you don\u2019t try to make your fortune overnight and are patient, my experience has been that you will do O.K.\u201dCasey Dinges remembers Mr. Kovitz\u2019s prediction that all of the baby boomers were eventually going to get sick. And his brother watched the stock of Abbott, a pharmaceutical company, rise and split and rise and split with regularity. \u201cI don\u2019t think the numbers are that important,\u201d Mr. Kovitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if we made him a fortune. We couldn\u2019t take that risk.\u201dThere were bailouts too, like when Mr. Dinges showed up for his freshman year of college only to find that the school would not let him matriculate. There had been a tuition bill, but being 18 and all, he didn\u2019t quite grasp its importance. \u201cI remember I started crying, calling you like you were my dad, saying \u2018Sandy, they\u2019re not letting me in the dorm,\u2019 \u201d he recalled, while Mr. Kovitz chuckled across the conference room table. \u201cSomehow, within an hour, you were able to wire money.\u2019\u201dStill, Mr. Dinges has needed to stretch more than once, and he knew that he had achieved true financial adulthood when Mr. Kovitz allowed him to borrow money on margin against his stock portfolio for brief periods of time. \u201cNot to buy more stock,\u201d Mr. Kovitz is quick to emphasize. \u201cAnd I had to know what we were doing it for or for whom. Some people, I wouldn\u2019t let borrow a dime.\u201dMr. Dinges was an unlucky child, but he caught a break with his money. Mr. Kovitz might have put him in Polaroid or some other faded star of the 1970s. That\u2019s a real risk with old-fashioned stockpickers, but there were never any margin calls or forced stock sales to make good on the debt. In fact, some of the Abbott shares have been in Mr. Dinges account for more than three decades. (Over the last 30 years, Abbott\u2019s stock has increased about 2,663 percent. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index grew roughly 966 percent during that period.)As the pair near the 50th anniversary of their working relationship, Mr. Kovitz is slowing down a bit. He does not take on new clients and is making tentative plans to hand over his current ones to his son and his firm within a year or two. \u201cBut if I\u2019m healthy,\u201d he said, \u201cI may go a lot more years now.\u201dWhich would be fine by Mr. Dinges, who feels grateful for having such steady financial counsel. \u201cWhen I talk to friends, it\u2019s always a one-off, where they found this specialist and did this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always felt like I got exactly what I ever needed out of a Sandy Kovitz conversation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nine Charged in Insider Trading Case Tied to Hackers", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a symbiotic relationship that brought together the underbelly of Wall Street and the dark reaches of the online world.From their suburban homes in the United States, dozens of rogue stock traders would send overseas hackers a shopping list of corporate news releases they wanted to get a sneak peek at before they were made public. The hackers, working from Ukraine, would then deliver how-to videos by email with instructions for gaining access to the pilfered earnings releases.In all, 32 traders and hackers reaped more than $100 million in illegal proceeds in a sophisticated and brazen scheme that is the biggest to marry the wizardry of computer hacking to old-fashioned insider trading, according to court filings made public on Tuesday. One of the men, Vitaly Korchevsky, a hedge fund manager and former Morgan Stanley employee living in a Philadelphia suburb, made $17 million in illegal profits, the indictment said.But the five-year scheme came undone Tuesday when federal prosecutors from Brooklyn and New Jersey, joined by regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission and other law enforcement agencies, announced a series of arrests, the filing of indictments and a lawsuit against what the indictments described as a loose network of business confederates.Early Tuesday, the authorities arrested Mr. Korchevsky, 50, at his home in Glen Mills, Pa., and four other men, in Georgia and in Brooklyn. Arrest warrants were issued for four other men. Three of them were related and had ties to Ukraine.\u201cThis is the intersection of hacking and securities fraud,\u201d Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for the district of New Jersey, said at a news conference in Newark. \u201cThe hackers were relentless and patient.\u201dThe Securities and Exchange Commission said that defendants made trades based on illegally obtained information and reaped over $100 million in unlawful profits.In one indictment, federal prosecutors in New Jersey said five of the men broke into companies like Business Wire and PR Newswire over five years to steal more than 150,000 news releases being prepared by publicly traded corporations before the information was released to the public. Another company whose releases were stolen before they were made public was Marketwired.Mr. Fishman did not fault the wire services and said they had cooperated with the investigation.The stolen news releases gave the rogue traders \u2014 four of whom were charged in a separate indictment unsealed on Tuesday by prosecutors in Brooklyn \u2014 a big advantage over others in the stock market by allowing them to trade on news before it hit the wires, the authorities said. The men who used the stolen information to trade the stocks paid the hackers a flat fee or a percentage of the profits gained from the illegal trading, the S.E.C. said in a separate complaint.The authorities said the traders seeking an illegal edge provided \u201cshopping lists\u201d to hackers for the kinds of news releases they wanted and the companies they wanted to trade on. The men obtained information from more than 30 companies, including Bank of America, Clorox, Caterpillar and Honeywell, the authorities said.But the traders were also deliberate. The authorities said they traded ahead of the information contained in only about 800 of the hundreds of thousands of releases they got a sneak peek at \u2014 indicating a methodical and well-timed approach to concealing their activities.In multiple instances, the men communicated via email and online chat messages, boldly stating what they were doing, the authorities said. At one point in 2012, for example, one of the defendants wrote in Russian in an online chat message, \u201cI\u2019m hacking prnewswire.com.\u201d In another instance, a defendant sent 96 stolen news releases to someone with a subject, in Russian, that read \u201cfresh stuff.\u201d The email said, \u201cIf he says he does not know what this is about, tell him \u2018quarterly report,\u2019 \u201d according to the indictment.The authorities monitored some of the defendants for years, the indictment said. In November 2012, it said, they seized the laptop of one of the hackers and found about 200 nonpublic news releases from PR Newswire.The people charged in the New Jersey indictment with breaking into the newswire networks were Ivan Turchynov, 27; Oleksandr Ieremenko, 24; Arkadiy Dubovoy, 51; Igor Dubovoy, 28; and Pavel Dubovoy, 28.Indictment unsealed Tuesday by federal prosecutors in New Jersey.Brooklyn prosecutors, in addition to Mr. Korchevsky, also charged Vladislav Khalupsky, 45; Leonid Momotok, 47; and Alexander Garkusha 47, all United States residents, who had personal brokerage accounts at some of the biggest investment banks in the United States, including JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Jefferies. Two of the four men were once registered with the S.E.C., including Mr. Korchevsky. Authorities said in court papers the independent traders and overseas hackers \u201cshared login and password information for brokerage accounts they controlled\u201d making it easier for them to trade and transfer payments.Kelly Currie, the United States attorney for Brooklyn, called the network of hackers and traders an \u201cunholy alliance.\u201dThe authorities said tens of millions of dollars in illegal trading profits had been recovered from bank accounts maintained by the traders and hackers. The authorities also seized some homes, a boat and even an apartment complex that was bought with some of the proceeds.The charges against the men demonstrate the various ways in which computer hackers can profit richly from illegally obtained information.\u201cWhen we think of hackers who try to profit from their crimes, we usually think about people who steal bank account information or sell sensitive personally identifying information,\u201d said Matthew L. Schwartz, a lawyer at Boies, Schiller & Flexner and a former prosecutor in Manhattan who worked on cases involving digital crime.\u201cThe reality, as exemplified by today\u2019s charges, is that hackers can obtain access to all sorts of valuable information and can and will profit off of it in every way imaginable,\u201d he added.Last month, prosecutors in Manhattan filed charges against five people, some of whom are suspected of having played a role in a breach at JPMorgan Chase that resulted in the theft of customer data for 83 million accounts. The authorities said they suspect that group wanted to use the tens of millions of email addresses stolen in the hacking to further stock manipulation schemes involving spam emails to pump up the price of otherwise worthless penny stocks.A federal grand jury in Brooklyn charged four people with using stolen news releases to profit on information before it was made public.In fact, the scheme announced on Tuesday was similar to one in 2005, when the S.E.C. charged a group of traders in Estonia with hacking into Business Wire to obtain news releases to inform their trades. Hacking or stealing corporate news releases is a strategy traders looking for an illegal edge have used over the years.But the group uncovered on Tuesday went further than the Estonian hackers, and its scheme was much broader than anything previously uncovered by the authorities. It may be the first of many cases in which hackers use purloined corporate data to commit securities fraud.Last year the computer consulting firm FireEye said that it had uncovered a sophisticated group of hackers, called Fin4, that was aiming at the email networks of large pharmaceutical and financial companies to gain market-sensitive information about deals. The revelation was outlined in a report that FireEye, based in California, shared with the S.E.C. and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.A few months ago, the S.E.C. asked a handful of companies to provide information about data taken in breaches of their computer networks. The authorities took similar steps recently with several large public relations firms, said another person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Jen Weedon, a threat intelligence manager with FireEye who worked on the Fin4 report, said she saw some similarities and differences between the way the group she observed operated and the one busted up by federal authorities.\u201cThere\u2019s targeting overlap in that these actors seemed to deliberately pursue market-moving information, like FIN4, to benefit financially on the stock trade. Unlike FIN4 it seems this group had a narrower scope in choosing to get their data from a consolidated place,\u201d Ms. Weedon said by email.But the end goal is the same, she added, noting the hackers were infiltrating networks to gain private information to gain an edge in the markets.Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pension Advisers Learn the Folly of Trying to Beat the Market", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyThose items offer hints of the surprising professional journey that Mr. Edmundson and his predecessor, Ken Lambert, who still serves as a consultant to the state, have recently completed. Since the beginning of 2014, they have moved the last of the state pension funds\u2019 stock and bond investments entirely into securities that track market indexes exactly. So here, in the state that brought us gambling as an everyday activity, the two professionals who gauge investment odds have taken their money off one particularly large table, deciding that it no longer makes sense to bet on Wall Street wizards to beat the market. Few if any managers of large pension funds have ever done such a thing.Mr. Lambert grew up thinking he might be savvy enough to beat the market for a living. As a boy, he used the proceeds from the sale of a calf to buy shares in Macy\u2019s, where his father worked as a manager at various stores in the West. The stock ended up increasing more than twentyfold before he sold, and he was hooked on the markets. He was chief investment officer of Nevada\u2019s pension funds for seven years before turning the job over to Mr. Edmundson.Mr. Edmundson worked at Oracle earlier in his career, in the group handling the employee stock option and purchase plans. He had a front-row seat for the tech bubble in 2000 \u2014 and the popping, too. By the time he went to work for the state, the pension funds were already moving bit by bit away from trying to beat the market and more toward indexing, where the funds would own every security in a particular market segment.According to Mr. Lambert, the more voluble of the pair, a pension fund manager (and an individual investor) has to begin any strategic analysis with the acknowledgment that most investors who try to pick stocks or bonds that will outperform their market segment will fail to do so over long periods. \u201cSo you have to trade active managers,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only do you have to believe that they can beat the market, but you must spend time hiring and firing them.\u201dBy ceasing to place outsize bets on companies, industries or countries, the men also eliminate the temptation to focus too much on the short term. This is especially crucial for government pension fund managers, because new people in their 20s are constantly entering the plan and may be drawing on it 75 years later. \u201cIf we are freaking out about what is happening tomorrow or what happened last quarter, then we\u2019re not doing our jobs,\u201d Mr. Edmundson said.Then there are the fees that outside money managers charge pension funds. While pension fund managers pay much less than the 1 percent or so of assets that an individual might pay for an actively managed mutual fund, every basis point (which is the term Wall Streeters use for one one-hundredth of a percent) matters.Mr. Edmundson and Mr. Lambert, who are both 43 and consider themselves equal partners, manage about $35 billion. One basis point for them is $3.5 million, which covers a lot of monthly pension checks. Their most recent investment moves, they said, will save $4 million in fees each year, which compounds over time. No one at the three firms they cut loose would talk to me about whether they thought the pair had made a mistake.The men say they believe that their overall annual costs to run the funds (which also include a smattering of more expensive real estate and private equity investments) are about half a percentage point less than their peers, on average. Over the last decade, as the funds have made the transition toward indexed investments in stocks and bonds, the total return for the biggest fund has bested 73 percent of its peers, according to data from their consultants at Callan Associates.On days like Thursday and Friday, when the stock market is declining, it\u2019s hard to sit calmly and do nothing, especially when commentators are yelling on television. So when the two men are feeling itchy, they make for the hills, literally, running on trails near Reno for 10 or 15 miles at a time.They can\u2019t trade while they are in motion, but that\u2019s probably a good thing. \u201cWe spend a lot of time up there talking each other out of stuff,\u201d Mr. Lambert said. \u201cIn investing, the answer 90 percent of the time is to do nothing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the source of a New York report on the fees earned by investment fund managers. It was the comptroller\u2019s office of New York City, not New York state. Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The \u2018Unicorn\u2019 Club, Now Admitting New Members", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One hallmark of the current technology boom is a generation of start-ups valued at $1 billion or more by investors. Now meet the start-ups-in-waiting that may be next to reach that mark, if the white-hot market continues.To find out which companies might be next to ascend, CB Insights, which tracks venture capital and start-ups, conducted an analysis for The New York Times. CB Insights used a proprietary software tool called Mosaic, which analyzes dozens of factors about a start-up, including the amount of money raised by a company, employee turnover, news and social media mentions, awards, customer growth and partnerships. It also examines the overall health of the industry in which the start-up competes, as well as what can be known about the quality of a company\u2019s investors.CB Insights won a grant from the National Science Foundation to build Mosaic, using machine learning and data science to turn unstructured text into a quantitative tool to measure company health.Those countries are experiencing start-up booms of their own, with private companies such as the handset maker Xiaomi of China and the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart having already risen to unicorn levels. Now more American investors are pushing into those markets and into start-ups such as Uxin Pai, a Beijing-based used-car auction site, as they go further afield for investments while more money chases the same targets at home.Many of the companies that CB Insights identified are also part of the hot tech sectors of the moment. In particular, investors are pouring money into service-oriented start-ups that let consumers get food, razors, handymen or piano teachers at the touch of an app. Those companies include the British food delivery start-up Deliveroo and Postmates, which delivers goods from any store or restaurant.The satellite company Planet Labs and the drone companies 3D Robotics and Airware also appear on the list, showing how investors are betting on the skies as a source of future profit.Still, many entrepreneurs said they were happy to be on the list. The founder of the Beijing-based online learning company 17zuoye, Chang Liu, for one, said he had been striving for his start-up to become a unicorn.Others, such as Kirt McMaster of the software maker Cyanogen, were more skeptical about the merits of inclusion. \u201cThe community gets carried away with the unicorn thing,\u201d said Mr. McMaster, whose company is building a mobile operating system to rival Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android. \u201cThere are a lot of $1 billion companies that will never turn revenue positive and will cease to exist in the next couple of years.\u201dMr. McMaster said he recognized there were benefits to gaining a big valuation. \u201cIncreasing my company\u2019s valuation is a way to get money cheaper. Period,\u201d he said.Tom Lee, the founder of the primary care group One Medical, which is on the list, said the unicorn designation came with baggage and created pressure for entrepreneurs to perform. \u201cPeople can assume a kind of high growth and potential for scale across different types of companies, or they can assume that you\u2019re overvalued,\u201d he said.Mr. Gurley, who is at Benchmark, a venture capital firm that has invested in Uber and Snapchat, has long warned about drawing too much meaning from the unicorn milestone. In trying to achieve a $1 billion valuation, some entrepreneurs cut deals with investors \u2014 such as financial terms that promise investors a certain return on their money \u2014 that \u201cin reality make the valuation lower,\u201d Mr. Gurley said in an interview.\u201cThe basic principles of probability say that a smaller percentage of them will hit the higher hurdles they need to make it to an initial public offering,\u201d he said.Ms. Lee, who coined the term unicorn, said there were more $1 billion private companies these days partly because big industries like hotels and taxis were now considered fair game for start-ups. The thing to watch, she said, is whether companies meet the expectations and goals they set when they became unicorns before they burn through the money they raised. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do that, they\u2019re in a dangerous position,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Stock Market Is So Turbulent", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsLast week, global financial markets were churning, but it really only mattered if you were an oil trader, a Chinese bureaucrat or a hedge fund manager.Now it\u2019s starting to get scary for everyone.What\u2019s fascinating is that there is no clear, simple story about what is different about the outlook now for interest rates, for United States and European corporate profits or for economic growth compared with one week ago, when the S.&P. 500 index was 10 percent higher.Here\u2019s how to make sense of what is a truly global story, stretching from the streets of Shanghai, where stock investing has become a middle-class sport in recent years, to the oil fields of both the Middle East and Middle America, to the hallways of power in the Federal Reserve in Washington.The immediate cause of the outburst of global volatility was China, where the sharp drop in stocks on Monday continued a rout that has been underway \u2014 with periodic pauses because of government interventions \u2014 all summer.The Chinese economy is slowing, and the 38 percent drop in the Shanghai composite index since June 12 is indeed a huge number. There is no question that this giant economy is struggling with a transition from the investment-and-export-led boom of the last generation toward something more sustainable.But a few facts make China\u2019s problems a less than completely satisfying explanation for the turmoil across world markets. The Chinese stock market has risen sharply over the past year as millions of middle-class Chinese citizens took to making investments. Even after its steep drop this summer, the Shanghai index is down less than 1 percent for the year and still up 43 percent from one year ago.In other words, the sell-off in Chinese stocks may not matter much in isolation. But it tells us much about the inability of Chinese leaders to bring the country\u2019s economy in for a soft landing. And that is something scarier.Some of the key evidence for the \u201cthis is about more than China\u201d story comes from other emerging markets, stretching from Malaysia to Mexico, that are also taking it on the chin. Their currencies and stock and bond prices have fallen sharply over the last week. Some of that drop most likely reflects exposure to the Chinese economy. But some of it reflects something bigger.Call this the Taper Tantrum 3.0.The original taper tantrum happened in June 2013. It is a cute name for what occurred when global financial markets collectively went berserk over the realization that the Fed was serious about tapering its program of quantitative easing \u2014 or put more plainly, that the Fed would wind down its injections of money into the financial system over time. There was a second, similar explosion of volatility in October 2014, as the Fed\u2019s intentions to raise interest rates in 2015 became clearer.In effect, the Fed\u2019s easy money policies had led global investors to search for higher-yielding securities, which they found in many faster-growing emerging markets. Money gushed into these countries in search of better returns from 2010 until 2013, driving up asset prices.The turmoil in financial markets has had a particularly big impact of the price of commodities, including oil, the most economically significant commodity of them all.The price of a barrel of oil fell from around $60 in late June to under $40 on Monday. Over time, that will be good news for American and European energy consumers, but there are complex feedback loops that probably make the commodity sell-off both a cause and a result of the broader emerging markets panic.When oil prices first plummeted in the second half of last year, there were widespread forecasts that the price drop would cause oil exploration to shutter around the world, helping keep the market in balance. Instead, American producers have kept up production, keeping supplies high despite lower prices.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Here\u2019s the feedback loop: The slowdown in China and other emerging markets lowers demand. High supplies and weak demand equals lower prices \u2014 which feeds back into weaker economic conditions for energy-producing countries like those in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia.In the background of all of this is a crucial decision looming for the United States Federal Reserve. Fed officials have expressed confidence that the domestic economy is on track and that the time is right to raise interest rates after nearly seven years of keeping them near zero. It could make that move at its policy meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.Fed officials have indicated a determination to base interest rates on what is most appropriate given the state of the American economy and not to overreact to fluctuations in markets. The latest volatility will test that resolve.Futures markets are increasingly betting that the Fed will indeed hold off to assess the damage to the economy, if any, from the latest global financial strains. On Monday, the market priced in a 24 percent chance of a rate increase in September, compared with a 48 percent chance just a week ago.And the value of the dollar on currency markets fell 1.6 percent on Monday (as measured by the dollar index) as investors priced in greater likelihood of the Fed\u2019s keeping rates lower for longer.Commentators have long accused the Fed of overreacting to the latest financial market moves, a complaint that makes Fed officials bristle; they argue they are making their decisions based on measures of the real economy like inflation and employment data. If markets remain volatile heading into the next meeting but economic data remains consistent with recent solid readings, that will make for a tough decision.Of course, it is the Fed\u2019s job to set policy based on where the economy is going, not where it has been. If markets keep falling, that could endanger American growth prospects. On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s job isn\u2019t to try to protect investors from the risks of a downturn.And if the last few days have taught anything, it is that global markets will be poised for a big reaction, no matter what the central bank does.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "False Alarm on a Crisis in China", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorServices, not industry, are driving China\u2019s growth, as has been the case for three full years. This is likely to continue since per capita incomes in China are reaching a level where a growing share of spending is on entertainment, travel and other services rather than on goods.Naysayers question government economic data, continuing to focus on weakness in China\u2019s industrial sector and the extremely slow growth of electric power output. But steel production, for example, is significantly more energy intensive than entertainment, so the demand for electricity has fallen sharply as the structure of the economy has evolved.Assuming that electric power growth is a good proxy for China\u2019s overall economic expansion is like trying to drive a car by looking in the rearview mirror.Some economists watching from abroad believe that the country is in the midst of a financial crisis because of the excessive debt burden it incurred in recent years. But that view is even less well supported. After a very modest two-day depreciation earlier this month, the exchange rate of the renminbi has changed little against the dollar for eight consecutive trading days; capital outflows continue at a moderate, very sustainable pace; bank liquidity remains strong. This does not yet look remotely like a financial crisis.Rather than a financial and economic meltdown, China is experiencing an overdue correction in its equity market. And the connection between China\u2019s equity market and China\u2019s real economy has always been tenuous.By my tallies, from June 2014 to June 2015, prices increased more than 150 percent on the Shanghai exchange, and even more on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen ChiNext board, a Nasdaq-style marketplace. An unusually large part of this run-up was fueled by retail investors who borrowed to buy equities. The market was priced way beyond perfection. Once prices fell even slightly, many of these investors found themselves needing to sell, leading to a sharp market correction.At first, the government unwisely intervened to stem the rout for a time, but the sharp sell-off continued earlier this week. There is likely to be more of the same to come. Even at Tuesday\u2019s much lower prices, the Shenzhen market was trading at a still-lofty 39 times earnings.Despite what many think, not all debt is the same, nor are all equity market slides. There have been many more corrections in both the United States and China than there have been financial crises. Allowing those corrections to take place is part of letting markets determine outcomes, which is a good thing.And that is what the government of China is now doing, both with respect to the exchange rate and belatedly in more recent days, to a surprising extent, with the equity markets. There remain concerns over Chinese real estate and state-owned enterprises. But recent events should be seen as part of the conscious liberalization and rebalancing of the Chinese economy. Even if that means a sell-off in stocks, it is not a sell-off in the fundamentals of the Chinese economy. In fact, this may strengthen those fundamentals by going further down the path to reform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Man Charged in Bitcoin Scheme Appears in New York Court", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnthony Murgio, a Florida man who was charged last month by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with running an illegal bitcoin money exchange firm and is thought to have information about last summer\u2019s hacking attack against JPMorgan Chase, seemed to be taking the unfolding criminal case against him in stride during a court appearance on Monday morning.Mr. Murgio, 31, made small talk with the two federal agents in the hallway of the federal court in Lower Manhattan, while waiting to appear on those charges before the United States magistrate judge, James C. Francis IV. At one point, he even rushed to see if a woman who had fallen in the hallway was hurt and needed help getting up.But when he appeared in court, Mr. Murgio said nothing, letting his lawyer, Gregory W. Kehoe of the big law firm Greenberg Traurig, do the talking. The hearing was brief and the judge allowed Mr. Murgio, who has run a number of less-than-successful businesses since graduating from Florida State University, to remain free on $100,000 bail.Mr. Murgio posted the bail a week ago after his arrest on July 21 in Tampa after spending a few nights in the Pinellas County jail while he and his family secured the money.Both Mr. Murgio and his lawyer declined to comment after the proceeding in federal court.The judge, at the request of Eun Young Choi, a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, ordered Mr. Murgio not to talk to anyone associated with his company and not to work for any other money-transfer firm.Mr. Murgio\u2019s partner in running the small bitcoin firm, Yuri Lebedev, who also lives in Florida and was similarly charged by prosecutors, is out on $25,000 bail.Neither man has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the hacking at JPMorgan that compromised the personal contact information of 83 million customer accounts at the bank.Mr. Aaron was one of three men charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with operating a series of schemes to pump up the prices of otherwise worthless stocks who also is said to have some link to the JPMorgan attack. Two of those men were arrested in Israel on the day that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev were arrested in Florida.Mr. Aaron, who moved to Israel several years ago, could not be arrested at his home in Tel Aviv because he was out of the country. Mr. Aaron, 31, is thought to be staying in Russia with his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, an Israeli citizen, based on social media posts from several weeks ago. The authorities have not formally declared him a fugitive, but people briefed on the matter said it was being considered.On Monday, the two men arrested in Israel, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, appeared in a Jerusalem court and were ordered by a judge to remain in custody until at least Sept. 1. Both men have been detained by Israeli authorities at the request of federal prosecutors since their arrest on July 21.Lawyers for Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein had asked for the men to be released from prison and confined to home arrest. Israeli prosecutors had wanted both men held for an additional 40 days.Federal prosecutors are beginning to seek to extradite Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein to New York. But the process could take months.As with Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev, neither Mr. Aaron nor his associates in Israel are facing any charges arising out of apparent theft of information from JPMorgan.People familiar with stock manipulation schemes said a high-quality list of email addresses \u2014 like the customer contact information taken from JPMorgan \u2014 could sell for several million dollars on the black market.Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron were known to have visited Russia in the last few years. The authorities suspect the actual hackers may be in Russia or another European country.Federal authorities are under some pressure to develop information that could lead to the filing of charges related to the breach, especially against Mr. Aaron, Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein, now that charges have been filed against them with regards to the stock manipulation. Legal experts said once a defendant was extradited from a foreign country it was difficult to file new charges against that person, especially if the charges arose from a different offense.The time constraint facing authorities then would seem to give leverage to anyone charged in either case but willing to take a plea and provide evidence linking the crimes to the attack.Jonathan Rosen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Race to Escape Risk in Once-Booming Emerging-Market Bonds", "Date": "2015-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe large mutual funds that helped fuel rapid growth in developing countries have begun hastily retreating from those investments, contributing to the recent sharp decline in global markets.In the last week alone, investors pulled $2.5 billion from emerging-market bond funds, the largest withdrawal since January 2014.The world\u2019s fastest-growing economies \u2014 led by China \u2014 have been propelled by soaring commodity prices, robust currencies and access to cheap loans, primarily through the sale of high-yield, high-risk bonds. But China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency has set off a chain reaction of panicked selling around the world that contributed to the biggest one-week loss on Wall Street since 2011, sending the Dow Jones industrial average into correction territory (10 percent below its recent peak). The index was down 531 points on Friday and nearly 6 percent for the week.The currency devaluation increased concerns that growth in China was slowing and that other countries might follow with their own devaluations. The notion unnerved bond investors, who began to retreat out of fear they would not be repaid. General uneasiness about a global economic slowdown spread to stocks, which many have believed to be overvalued and due for a decline.\u201cThe growth rates for many of these countries were vastly overstated,\u201d said Dani Rodrik, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who has studied the impact of foreign capital flows in developing economies. \u201cIt was all very unsustainable.\u201dThe selling spree has raised concerns among regulators and economists about a broader contagion that could make it difficult for individual investors to withdraw money from their mutual funds.While these funds do not use borrowed money, as did the banks that failed during the mortgage crisis, they have invested large sums in a wide variety of high-yielding bonds and bank loans that are not easy to sell \u2014 especially in a bear market.If investors ask to be repaid all at once \u2014 as happened in 2008 \u2014 a run-on-the-bank scenario could unfold because funds would have difficulty meeting the demands of people wanting their cash back.During previous global investment booms and busts, large commercial banks were the dominant overseas lenders. These institutions were just as prone to making bad lending decisions as bond investors, but they also tended to have longer-term relationships with their borrowers and were less likely to cut and run.Because large global banks suffered significant losses during the financial crisis and were forced to rein in their lending, more nimble \u2014 and fickle \u2014 bond investors stepped in.What struck the authors most was that this growth was coming not from global banks but from American mutual funds buying the bonds of emerging-market issuers.Large fund companies like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Pimco and have been inundated with money from investors eager to invest in the high-yielding bonds of emerging-market corporations and countries.One of the more extreme cases of this bond market frenzy was Mongolia. In 2012, with expectations high that the relatively tiny economy would reap the benefits from China\u2019s ceaseless appetite for raw materials, the government sold $1.5 billion worth of bonds, with demand from investors reaching $10 billion.That meant, in effect, that the country was in a position to borrow an amount twice the size of its $4 billion gross domestic product.Three years later, the International Monetary Fund is warning that Mongolia may not be able to make good on these loans \u2014 14 percent of which are owned by Franklin Templeton, according to Bloomberg data \u2014 and the yields have shot up to about 9 percent from 4 percent.Of course, a Mongolian bond deal gone bust does not spell disaster. But it illustrates the risks global mutual fund investors were willing to take on in their desire to load up on high-yielding securities.Now the reverse is occurring, led by a slowing Chinese economy, and as that money heads for safety, local currencies are plunging.For example, there has been explosive growth in so-called unconstrained bond funds, which operate somewhat like a hedge fund, with a mandate to buy any security in any part of the world.According to Morningstar, these funds have increased to $154 billion from $9 billion in 2009, with many of them invested in emerging-market bonds. Because these funds tend to take on more risk and buy securities that are harder to sell \u2014 such as emerging-market bonds \u2014 the fear is that the managers of these funds will not be able to provide cash to investors when they demand it.Exchange-traded funds, a type of mutual fund that trades like a stock and promises instant liquidity, have also been large investors in emerging markets.What worries many regulators and economists is how much mutual fund money is now tied up in these hard-to-sell bonds \u2014 an amount that far exceeds the exposure investors had to these markets in earlier emerging-market crises.EPFR Global, a fund-tracking company, calculates that global bond funds have allocated 16 percent of their holdings to emerging-market bonds. Relative to the 2.5 percent recommended benchmark for these securities suggested by the Barclays aggregate bond index, that is a very aggressive bet.Ricardo Adrogue, an emerging-markets-debt investor at Babson Capital in Boston, says it is the extreme declines in the currencies of Malaysia, Mexico, Russia and Turkey that worry him \u2014 not so much the Chinese devaluation.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I want out,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIt is difficult to see the bottom with all these depreciating currencies.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Deepen Their Slide After Early Gains Evaporate", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sudden reversal in United States stock prices late in trading on Tuesday produced a sixth consecutive session of losses and heightened uncertainty about the challenges facing global markets. The wild swings in prices over the last two days have been the most extreme since the financial crisis. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index surged as much as 2.9 percent on Tuesday, but ended down 1.4 percent.The resurgence of volatility has overturned a sense of comfort among many investors who had grown accustomed to calm markets and steadily rising stock prices in recent years.\u201cThe last two days have been a wake-up call for a lot of portfolio managers,\u201d said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist at Convergex, an institutional brokerage firm. \u201cIt forces everyone to reconsider their base assumption for things like earnings growth and revenue growth.\u201dThe opening of trading in Asia on Wednesday brought little clarity. Shanghai stocks, which have led the declines over the past few days, swung between gains and losses, and the volatile trading spread across the rest of Asia. Japanese stocks rebounded from Tuesday\u2019s 4 percent drop, but shares in Australia were down. Some investors have taken a dark outlook, questioning whether the markets \u2014 and the broader economy \u2014 will be able to abide a coming rise in interest rates that the Federal Reserve has been moving toward for months.For the time being, there are few doubts that the American economy has been growing, and the economy is unlikely to be significantly hampered by recent turmoil in China. New data reported on Tuesday morning pointed to a healthy increase in consumer confidence in August and a rise in new home sales in July.But voices like Lawrence H. Summers, the former chief economic adviser to President Obama, have recently joined a chorus of skeptics arguing that the growth may not be able to continue if the Fed steps back from the market, as it had looked set to do in September. Investors have ramped up bets this week that the Fed will have to delay any planned changes in interest rates. Tuesday provided another reminder of the wide range of outcomes that investors are debating. Early on Tuesday, investors in markets around the world appeared to take comfort as China, the epicenter of the recent sell-off in global stock markets, took steps to tackle slowing growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The Chinese central bank announced measures intended to lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. European markets rose sharply, and when New York trading opened, stocks surged. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had plunged 1,000 points early on Monday, rose 441 points early on Tuesday in another day of heavy trading. That optimism, however, slowly faded. And in the last half-hour of trading, the tentative rally fell apart completely. The Dow closed down 204.91 points, or 1.3 percent, at 15,666.44. The S.&P. 500 ended 25.60 points lower at 1867.61, while the Nasdaq composite index closed down 0.4 percent, or 19.76 points, to 4,506.49. There were no obvious explanations for the sudden decline in prices in the waning minutes of trading, though many investors said it suggested the lack of conviction behind recent market moves. \u201cIt is going to take a week, or a couple of weeks, to have this market stabilize,\u201d said Timothy M. Ghriskey, the chief investment officer at the Solaris Group. The major stock indexes have all entered into what is known as a correction \u2014 a 10 percent decline from the recent high, reached in May. The new declines brought the indexes closer to a so-called bear market, which is a 20 percent slump from recent highs. The Dow is now down 15.5 percent since May. The pullback has erased all of the gains that American stocks had made since early 2014.Treasury prices, which have benefited from the instability in stock markets, were weaker on Tuesday. The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell, driving its yield \u2014 which moves in the opposite direction of its price \u2014 to 2.08 percent from 2.01 percent on Monday.The big moves this week have struck many strategists as an overreaction, particularly given that there are no new major signs of any turn in the economy. But many investors who focus on the value of stocks, as measured by the price paid for each dollar of profit from a company, say that stocks have further to fall still if valuations are to come in line with historical norms.Investors were paying $16.80 for every dollar of earnings over the last year \u2014 the so-called price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 even after Monday\u2019s losses, according to FactSet Research. Over the last 10 years, the ratio has been, on average, $15.70.\u201cWhen we are this high, even with this pullback, the track record of future returns isn\u2019t all that good,\u201d Mr. Colas of Convergex said.Over the last two years investors have bid up the price of stocks in the hope that the companies would experience significant future growth. In recent quarters, though, American corporate profits have been falling on a year-to-year basis. Looking forward, many investors are anticipating slower growth from American companies unless the economy significantly picks up.Still, all of the negative sentiment could dissolve on Wednesday morning, as it appeared to do for a time on Tuesday morning.When American stocks opened on Tuesday, European markets were up sharply, recouping most of the losses they had experienced on Monday. The benchmark German index ended the day up almost 5 percent, while France\u2019s benchmark index was up 4.1 percent \u2014 all before the markets in the United States began to experience trouble.The moves suggested that Chinese authorities are now looking to stabilize the economy, rather than focusing on the problems in the financial markets. But similar past efforts have failed to reverse the country\u2019s problems, and many investors are skeptical that the latest measures will be more effective.In the United States and Europe, too, there are growing fears that the central bankers have done everything in their power and now need to rely on some outside assistance.Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, wrote on Facebook that Tuesday\u2019s reversal will \u201cerode the faith that market participants have in the power of central banks to repress volatility.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount by which the Chinese government lowered interest rates. It was 0.25 of a percentage point, not 0.25 percent. The article also misstated the amount by which the reserve rate requirement was decreased. It was 0.5 of a percentage point, not 0.5 percent.Neil Gough and Chris Buckley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blind Faith in China\u2019s Stock Market", "Date": "2015-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In late June, as the Chinese stock market was in a tailspin, a joke began making the rounds.\u201cWe played the market when we thought stocks had hit rock bottom,\u201d one investor says to another, \u201conly to find there was a basement below. We played the market when prices were in the basement, only to find there was a cellar underneath that, and when we kept playing in the cellar, we found that below that there was hell. Then we took our lives in our hands and kept playing when stocks were in hell \u2014 only to discover it\u2019s true what they say: There are 18 levels of hell!\u201dFor the officials of China\u2019s Securities Regulatory Commission, July 4 must have seemed like hell on earth: They were as frantic as ants on a hot wok. That morning, the heads of 21 top brokerages met with the regulatory commission, and, according to media reports, agreed to supply some 120 billion renminbi, or $19.4 billion, to a market rescue fund.The plan was in clear violation of the Securities Law. Brokers need approval from their shareholders to give up so much money. But with the regulatory agency desperate for a cash infusion, the brokers were in no mood to follow the law. We Chinese are used to this kind of thing: In China, law and the rule of law are a world apart.Many people think the stock market plunge, which continued this week, had its origin in the government clampdown on margin trading, the use of borrowed money to buy stocks, which had led to a feverish expansion of broker financing and to the stock market bubble. Brokers are required to back trades with the equivalent amount of cash from a client, but competition and a thriving stock market had led too many to flout the rules. Every day investors complained to brokers that the financial threshold for trading was too high. The brokerages felt they had no choice but to ease the cash requirements for making trades.As the market boomed, more and more ordinary people invested their savings and funneled borrowed money into stocks. The virtual economy of the markets detached itself from economic fundamentals, and stock prices of listed companies became disconnected from their real value. It was as though investors were spending 100 yuan to buy a 1 yuan pair of chopsticks.When you realize that there are some 100 million investors in China\u2019s stock market, and when you think, too, of the throngs of gambling-loving Chinese packing the world\u2019s casinos, along with the clatter of mahjong tiles inside practically every Chinese home (they say that when you\u2019re on a plane and hear people shuffling mahjong tiles below, you know you\u2019re over China), then it is clear that for many Chinese the stock market simply whets a thirst for a quick profit.This is in part why so many new fund-providing companies have sprouted up in recent years. Most have no intention of establishing a permanent business: The idea is to make a killing, then get out while the going is good. These new enterprises don\u2019t register with the government; they simply rent an apartment in a housing block, lug in a few desks, chairs and computers, access the brokers\u2019 trading platform, raise or borrow tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of renminbi, and they\u2019re in business.The government was keen to see people move money from savings \u2014 some Chinese put away as much as half of their income \u2014 into capital markets and thus stimulate an increasingly sluggish economy. Brokers could charge high interest rates for financing the trading. And many retail investors dreamed of becoming rich overnight. Everyone seemed to have a stake in seeing the stock market climb, and desire-fueled fantasies ensued.The Chinese stock market has long been a policy-driven market, its ups and downs largely prompted by new government policies. Thus, the country finds itself in the bizarre situation of having a bear market when the economy is humming and a bull market when the economy is in the doldrums. A decade ago, a single People\u2019s Daily editorial was enough to change the market\u2019s direction.But habitual reliance on a policy-driven market has hurt China\u2019s small investors. When stocks began to nosedive in June, many people hung on, trusting that the government would come to the rescue. When the government began to intervene, many shareholders sat tight, and many who had bailed out began to get back in. Prices continued to fall, but because every day the government was announcing new rescue measures, investors were sure that prices had bottomed out. Then the market just kept sliding. After suffering huge losses, one investor announced that he was now sleeping like a baby \u2014 because he kept crying himself to sleep.Blind emotion often continues to rule. On July 9, as rescue efforts took effect and the market began to rebound, the phones of brokerage and margin trading managers were constantly ringing once more, as investors who had suffered losses mortgaged their assets or borrowed funds to generate new capital.It is said that the memory span of a Chinese investor is as short as that of fish \u2014 no more than seven seconds. Clearly, the slump has still not taught a respect for market principles. Many people go on believing the official claim that it is malicious short-sellers who have caused the sell-off.Perhaps investors will eventually stop placing blind faith in government policy, and the Chinese stock market will evolve from being a top-down system overly influenced by the government. When in the space of a few days you lose the savings built up over a lifetime, this should make an indelible impression. But it\u2019s quite possible that the appeal of taking one more gamble and winning all your money back will lead people into the same old trap. Any change in the mind-set of the Chinese is likely to be a long drawn out process.Government agencies and the official media have continued eagerly talking up the stock market, encouraging investors to buy stocks and buy big.On social media, however, one young woman who lost all her assets when the market swooned took a different line. \u201cI just wish I could find a man who doesn\u2019t own a single stock!\u201d she cracked.Yu Hua is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Seventh Day.\u201d This essay was translated by Allan H.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Stock Exchanges Crack Down on Short-Selling", "Date": "2015-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese stocks rebounded sharply on Tuesday after the government took further steps to rein in short-sellers.The main Shanghai share index closed 3.7 percent higher, reversing three days of losses, after the country\u2019s two main stock exchanges said they would make it more difficult for investors to bet on falling share prices.In announcements late Monday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said that effective Tuesday, they would discontinue so-called same-day transaction settlements, in which trades are completed the day they are made, for short-sellers. They blamed the practice for causing \u201cabnormal fluctuations in share prices and impacting the stable operation of the market.\u201dInstead, such investors \u2014 who borrow shares and sell them in a bet they can be repurchased at a lower price before they must be returned \u2014 will be required to keep their trading positions open overnight and can settle the trade only the following day.The sharp rise and fall of China\u2019s markets in recent months has clearly been shaped by record levels of margin financing, in which investors borrow money to buy shares. But the impact of short-selling has been less clear.Outstanding margin financing peaked in mid-June at 2.3 trillion renminbi, or about $370 billion, according to figures from Wind Info, a financial data supplier. Short-selling volumes peaked in April at a much lower level, about 10.3 billion renminbi, and have declined in a choppy fashion since then. As of Friday, outstanding margin financing totaled 440 billion renminbi. Short-selling volumes, measured by the value of shares on loan, were 4.9 billion renminbi.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.Responding to the announcement on Tuesday, several of China\u2019s major brokerages, including Citic Securities, the largest, said they would suspend their short-selling services.In a statement Tuesday evening, the People\u2019s Bank of China reiterated recent pledges to continue supporting the markets, having committed last month to underwriting a government-backed program of stock purchases worth at least $20 billion.\u201cWe will pay heed to the stability of financial markets, and stand ready to dissolve risks,\u201d the bank said.China\u2019s leaders are now one month into an all-out campaign to halt losses on the country\u2019s share markets, which have plunged sharply despite efforts that have included direct and indirect state purchases of shares, and bans on major shareholders\u2019 selling their stakes in companies. Market regulators and the police have also pledged to curb what they said was \u201cmalicious\u201d short-selling, without elaborating on what that might mean.From their peak in mid-June, Chinese stocks have declined by about a third, shedding more than $3 trillion in market value.On Tuesday, the broker handling the suspended Citadel account, Guosen Securities, issued a statement saying it would \u201cstrengthen the management\u201d of its trading business and work together with Chinese regulators in order \u201cto firmly support the stability of the capital market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tesla Cheerleader", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDo you remember when Henry Blodget first became famous?No, it wasn\u2019t when the then-New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, unearthed those notorious emails Blodget wrote as Merrill Lynch\u2019s Internet analyst, the ones in which he privately disparaged companies he was publicly touting. That came later.It was 1998, the height of the Internet bubble. Blodget was then an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, and the \u201cit\u201d stock of the moment was Amazon, which had as many detractors as it had boosters.One day that December, with the stock at about $240 a share \u2014 and with no change in Amazon\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 Blodget, an Amazon bull, raised his price target to $400. That day it popped more than $45; within three weeks it hit Blodget\u2019s target. Some months later, I wrote an article about his coverage of Internet companies. It was titled \u201cThe Cheerleader.\u201dThat\u2019s not to mention other factors impinging on Tesla: the falling price of oil, for instance, which diminishes demand for electric cars, or the fact that a number of traditional luxury auto brands are poised to get into the electric vehicle game. It\u2019s not hard to make a case that, at around $250 a share, Tesla is as insanely overvalued as any Internet stock in the late 1990s.And guess what? Just like the Internet stocks of yore, Tesla has its own Wall Street cheerleader: Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analyst. Jonas could not be less interested in mundane factors like earnings per share; indeed, he has had to lower his 2015 earnings estimates several times; he now predicts the company will lose $2.70 a share. But never mind: In the future that he envisions, Tesla will be the most important car company on earth.Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Jonas raised his share price target for Tesla from $280 to $465, which would make Tesla more valuable than General Motors or Ford. Had anything fundamental changed for Tesla? Of course not!Jonas based his new target on something he labeled Tesla Mobility, which he describes as \u201can app based, on-demand mobility service.\u201d Where did he learn about Tesla Mobility? Who knows? Tesla, a company hardly averse to hype, has never acknowledged its existence.And that\u2019s not the worst of it. No, the worst is the timing of his call. It came days after Tesla announced that it would be issuing stock to raise yet more money \u2014 and that Morgan Stanley was among the underwriters. (The company raised close to $800 million.)Although Morgan Stanley insists that Jonas was in the process of changing his price target well before the equity offering \u2014 and that the Chinese wall between the firm\u2019s analysts and its investment bankers is unbreachable \u2014 his call had to be pleasing to the underwriters. Doug Kass, the well-known market commentator, told me that Jonas\u2019s call was \u201csomewhere between tone deaf and borderline illegal.\u201d In a note to his readers, he added that it was \u201ca further reason why Wall Street is not trusted.\u201dOne reason people like Kass have taken special notice of the timing of Jonas\u2019s new price target is that this isn\u2019t even the first time Jonas has changed his target at, shall we say, a fortuitous moment.Back in February 2014, right around the time that Morgan Stanley was involved in a big convertible bond offering for Tesla, Jonas raised his price target from $153 a share to $320 a share. Again, his convenient \u201cepiphany\u201d \u2014 as Kass puts it \u2014 had nothing to do with Tesla\u2019s fundamentals. That time he claimed Tesla could disrupt the auto industry by manufacturing its own batteries and making advances in autonomous driving. Well, maybe.Jonas has hardly been the only reason Tesla\u2019s stock remains in the stratosphere, but he is unquestionably helping to drive the stock up. And to be fair, however convenient his calls have been for Morgan Stanley\u2019s investment bankers and customers, he believes what he is writing. Although the firm would not allow me to interview him on the record, it is clear from reading his reports that he believes in his heart that as driving becomes more autonomous and more about batteries than about gasoline, Tesla will be the big winner.Still, belief is not the same as analysis. Just ask Henry Blodget.Gail Collins is on book leave.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bungling Beijing\u2019s Stock Markets", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChina is ruled by a party that calls itself Communist, but its economic reality is one of rapacious crony capitalism. And everyone has been assuming that the nation\u2019s leaders are in on the joke, that they know better than to take their occasional socialist rhetoric seriously.Yet their zigzagging policies over the past few months have been worrying. Is it possible that after all these years Beijing still doesn\u2019t get how this \u201cmarkets\u201d thing works?The solution is to invest less and consume more. But getting there will take reforms that distribute the fruits of growth more widely and provide families with greater security. And while China has taken some steps in that direction, there\u2019s still a long way to go.Meanwhile, the problem is how to sustain spending during the transition. And that\u2019s where things have gotten weird.The response of the Chinese authorities was remarkable: They pulled out all the stops to support the market \u2014 suspending trading in many stocks, banning short-selling, pushing large investors to buy, and instructing graduating economics students to chant \u201cRevive A-shares, benefit the people.\u201dAll of this has stabilized the market for the time being. But it is at the cost of tying China\u2019s credibility to its ability to keep stock prices from ever falling. And the Chinese economy still needs more support.So this week China decided to let the value of its currency decline, which made some sense: While the renminbi was clearly undervalued five years ago, it\u2019s significantly overvalued now. But Chinese authorities seem to have imagined that they could control the renminbi\u2019s descent, taking it a couple of percent at a time.They appear to have been taken completely by surprise by the market\u2019s predictable reaction; namely, the initial devaluation of the renminbi was \u201cthe first bite of the cherry,\u201d a sign of much bigger declines to come. Investors began fleeing China, and policy makers abruptly pivoted from promoting currency devaluation to an all-out effort to support the renminbi\u2019s value.The common theme in these wild policy swings is that China\u2019s leadership keeps imagining that it can order markets around, telling them what prices to reach. And that\u2019s not how things work.I\u2019m not saying governments should never interfere with markets, or even set limits on prices. There is, as I\u2019ve written in the past, a strong case for raising the minimum wage and in general for promoting higher wages for American workers; there\u2019s an even stronger case for effective financial regulation.But these were short-lived actions, taken at times when markets seemed to have lost their bearings. Staffers at the Federal Reserve used to call these moves \u201cslap in the face\u201d interventions. That\u2019s very different from the kind of sustained intervention and political dictation of prices China seems to imagine it can pull off. Do the country\u2019s leaders really not understand why that won\u2019t work?If they really don\u2019t, that\u2019s a big concern. China is an economic superpower \u2014 not quite as super as the United States or the European Union, yet, but big enough to matter a lot. And it\u2019s facing tough times. So if its leadership is really as clueless as it has been looking lately, that bodes ill, not just for China, but for the world as a whole.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Signs, Long Unheeded, Now Point to Risks in U.S. Economy", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs investors scramble to make sense of the wild market swings in recent days, a number of financial experts argue that, for more than a year now, signs pointing to an equity crisis were there for all to see.The data points range from the obvious to the obscure, encompassing stock market and credit bubbles in China, the strength of the dollar relative to emerging market currencies, a commodity rout and a sudden halt to global earnings growth.While it would have been impossible to predict the precise timing of the last week\u2019s downturn, this array of economic and financial indicators led to an inescapable conclusion, these analysts say: The United States economy would only be able to avoid for so long the deflationary forces that have taken root in China.And if the bull market had made it to April, it would have become the second-longest equity rally in United States history.The one common theme binding all these measures together is the risk that they pose to the economic recovery in the United States. The Federal Reserve has said that it expects to raise interest rates sometime soon, given evidence over the last year that economic growth is picking up.But more and more analysts are now pointing to problems in China and other markets as posing a real threat to the American economy.\u201cThe global G.D.P. pie is shrinking,\u201d said Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachs executive, now based in the Cayman Islands, who produces the Global Macro Investor, a monthly financial report that caters to hedge funds and other sophisticated investors.Of the hundreds of indicators that Mr. Pal follows, the most crucial over the last year, in his view, has been the relentless upward move of the dollar against just about all emerging-market currencies. The dollar rally began in January 2014, when the Fed signaled that it would raise interest rates.But the greenback\u2019s strength against currencies like the Russian ruble, the Turkish lira and the Brazilian real began to gather steam a year ago. Veterans of past emerging-market booms and busts will tell you that the party always ends \u2014 as it did in Latin America in the 1980s and Southeast Asia in the 1990s \u2014 when the dollar takes off against these monetary units.Suddenly, loans in relatively cheap dollars that financed real estate and consumption booms were no longer available and the ultimate result was always a growth slowdown.Any discerning investor could have taken note of this trend.For example, through the year ending on Aug. 19, the worst-performing investments in dollar terms were the following, according to Merrill Lynch: Brazilian equities, down 45 percent; Russian bonds, down 43 percent; Indonesian equities, down 26 percent; Turkish and Korean equities, down 25 percent; and Mexican equities, down 22 percent.During this same period, United States equities returned 8.7 percent \u2014 the fourth-best return delivered by any major class of assets.In effect, investors in the United States were saying that what happened in Russia, Turkey and Indonesia need not have any effect on stocks of companies based in the United States.This would turn out to be a major miscalculation.What was driving weakness in all these countries was the gradual slowdown in the Chinese economy. As China bought less steel from Brazil, iron ore from Australia (its stock market was down by 22 percent during this time frame) and less mineral fuel and oil from Indonesia, the effect on these economies was immediate.When it comes to warning indicators from China, there are many from which to choose. One is that, according to their 2014 balance sheets, four out of five of the world\u2019s largest banks are Chinese. Or one could choose the Chinese debt ratio, which McKinsey & Company has estimated to be over 280 percent of the country\u2019s total economic output.But for Albert Edwards, a strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London, what really confirmed in his mind that the Chinese growth engine was sputtering to a halt was the government\u2019s naked support of the country\u2019s stock market bubble. Among the government interventions were lending state entities money to buy stocks and restricting shareholders from selling large positions. Before the market collapsed, Chinese stocks reached a market capitalization of close to $10 trillion \u2014 making it the second-most valuable exchange in the world.\u201cOnce you encourage an equity bubble, it will collapse \u2014 and then you are really in trouble,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cThis was utter madness.\u201dLong before China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency this month, Mr. Edwards said that it was the sharp reduction in value of the Japanese yen against the dollar in autumn 2014 that also set off alarm bells.Because Japanese exports compete aggressively with currencies in Thailand and Korea, this was, in effect, a precursor to the Chinese currency move. He also noted that one of the causes of the Asian emerging market crisis in 1997 was that countries in the region broke their peg with the yen.\u201cIt just rippled across the whole region,\u201d he recalled.The bottom line though, is that investors in American stocks recognized too late in the game that a global contraction was sneaking up on them.For Jeffrey Sherman, a portfolio manager at the bond investment firm DoubleLine, the big cautionary sign was the correction in the high-yield corporate bond market. In summer 2014, as stocks of United States companies continued to push upward, the yields on risky corporations started to spike.As many of these companies were in the energy sector, mostly digging for shale oil, they were hard-hit by the sharp drop in oil prices. Still, the fact that these bonds were entering their own bear market should have been seen by equity investors as a warning sign, Mr. Sherman said.\u201cThese bonds have been very weak,\u201d Mr. Sherman said. \u201cThere has been a huge divergence between high yield bonds and the stock market.\u201dTaken together with slow growth in China, the result, as he sees it, is that the outlook for growth in the United States is extremely fragile and not in a good position to survive an increase in interest rates from the Fed.He points out, for example, that in the late 1990s, China had the capacity to manufacture 100 million tons of steel. That figure today is 1.1 billion tons \u2014 almost twice the amount of annual demand for steel in China.The China steelmaking boom also sent the price for iron ore up to nearly $200 a ton in 2011, from around $30 in 2008. Like all commodity prices, it has fallen sharply, to just under $100, a correction that creates problems for big iron ore-producing countries like Australia, which made huge investments to keep supplying these raw materials to China.\u201cIron ore is the canary in the steel shaft if you will,\u201d Mr. Stockman said. \u201cIt is a real measure of the violence of global deflation that is currently underway.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The American economy continues to chug along, while the onetime hares in Asia, South America and elsewhere are flagging.The latest evidence of this shift came on Thursday, as the Commerce Department revised sharply upward its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to a healthy annual pace of 3.7 percent, from an initial estimate of 2.3 percent. At the same time, the Labor Department, in reporting another drop in weekly unemployment claims, provided further evidence that the job market was on the mend.Stocks on Wall Street jumped by nearly 2.5 percent on Thursday, following a broader 4 percent rebound on Wednesday. Oil prices also rallied by almost 10 percent to settle above $40 a barrel after sinking to postrecession lows earlier in the week. \u201cThe United States relies more than any other developed economy on demand within our own borders,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. \u201cWhile the focus in the past three weeks has been on international instability, this should position us to withstand the consequences of recent market volatility.\u201dWith markets remaining on edge, investors are already turning their attention to coming data about the economy\u2019s course, which will help determine whether the Federal Reserve will make its long-awaited move to raise interest rates in September or wait until later meetings.Moreover, the impact of the recent plunge in stock prices on the broader economy will not be known for some time. Growth data for the current quarter will be released in late October. And the cutoff date for data for the Labor Department\u2019s report on hiring and unemployment in August, due next Friday, was earlier this month, before the stock market correction took hold.Still, far from the anxious trading desks in New York, many American executives in the business trenches report that growth has not wavered in recent months, and has even picked up in some cases.\u201cWe have returned to prerecession levels, and we expect volume for the entire year to be above where it was back then,\u201d said Jon Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach in California, the country\u2019s second-largest port. \u201cThere is tremendous consumer demand here, and we\u2019re seeing a real surge in volumes.\u201dMuch of what stevedores in Long Beach and other ports are hauling are consumer goods like electronics and apparel being imported into the United States, but the economic situation in the countries that produce those products is not nearly as cheerful.Chinese output certainly is not shrinking, but the pace of expansion in what is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy is clearly cooling down. And that is sending shivers through emerging markets in South America and Asia as well as in more developed economies like Australia, as China\u2019s seemingly limitless appetite for iron ore, bauxite for aluminum and other commodities slows down.Japan has faltered once again, and European economies have been in and out of recession in recent years.While the German economy remains healthy and unemployment is relatively low there, Germany\u2019s dependence on exports makes it more vulnerable in the face of weakening demand from China and its neighbors on the Continent.As a result, companies from other countries are showing greater interest in acquisitions in the United States to increase their exposure to the faster-growing North American market.Last month, for example, the W\u00fcrth Group of Germany acquired Northern Safety & Industrial, based in Utica, N.Y., a maker of protective equipment like safety glasses, gloves and hard hats for industrial customers.\u201cWe are their entree into the safety market in the U.S.,\u201d said Neil Sexton, president of Northern Safety & Industrial. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call the overall business climate here high-flying, but it is very solid.\u201d Most of the company\u2019s $200 million in sales last year came from North America, and nearly all of its 500 employees are based in the United States.\u201cW\u00fcrth has a big target on the U.S. for growth,\u201d Mr. Sexton added. \u201cThere are headwinds here from the energy sector, but there has been great strength in the chemical industry, and construction has also been a real bright spot.\u201dMuch of the jump in overall economic activity during the second quarter, from an initial estimate of a 2.3 percent growth rate, came from strong spending by businesses looking to expand factories, buildings and other physical structures.Other tailwinds included a better trade picture, as net exports improved, and increased government spending, especially at the state and local levels.Companies also added to their stockpiles of goods, which could weigh on growth in the months ahead. Real private inventories increased at a $121.1 billion pace in the second quarter, adding a little more than 0.2 percentage points to overall economic activity.In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 last week, to 271,000 \u2014 a level that suggests the labor market remains on a solid footing.When the Labor Department reports the latest figures for hiring and the unemployment next Friday, Wall Street is looking for a gain of about 200,000 jobs and expects the unemployment rate to remain flat at 5.3 percent. Normally, that might be enough to nudge the Fed into action, but the plunge in overseas markets and the correction on Wall Street has blurred that timeline. Many experts now expect policy makers to wait until December.The uncertainty over the central bank\u2019s course has prompted investors and economists to put each new data point under a microscope.Yet for all the zigs and zags of economic data over the last couple of years, the underlying growth rate has not deviated much from about 2.5 to 3 percent annually, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a private research and forecasting firm.\u201cHistorically, this is a modest growth rate,\u201d he said, explaining that the American economy now faces what he termed \u201cspeed limits,\u201d including the retirement of the baby boomers, slower population growth and weak productivity gains recently.\u201cWould we like to see faster growth? Of course,\u201d said Mr. Behravesh. \u201cBut we\u2019re growing twice as fast as Europe and three to four times as fast as Japan. For a mature economy, this is about as fast as we can grow, and it\u2019s something we can feel good about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Emotion Hurts Stock Returns", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLoss AversionWise words, even if they remain widely ignored.The problem is that if you look at the stock market each day, you\u2019ll experience a whole lot of losses and feel a lot of pain. The heartburn that many investors are feeling this morning is an example of this loss aversion. The genius of Mr. Thaler\u2019s advice is that if you tune into sports instead, you\u2019ll avoid that pain. And it may lead you to make better financial decisions, too.The numbers make the point. Over time, the stock market has risen enormously, but if you zoom in to the daily ups and downs, it\u2019s easy to lose sight of these long-run gains. Since the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index\u2019s creation in March 1957, it has fallen on 46.7 percent of all trading days. At the daily level, the stock market can seem like a roller coaster. Even though a purely financial calculation reveals that the gains more than make up for these losses, if you feel the losses twice as keenly as the gains, it\u2019s the sort of ride you might decide to avoid.The perception that stocks offer too wild of a ride is one of the reasons that too few people invest in the market. In turn, stocks have to yield a higher rate of return than less volatile bonds in order to induce people to endure this heartburn.But there\u2019s a way to avoid so much pain: Check your portfolio less often. When viewed over a longer horizon, the day-to-day fluctuations pale into the background, and the long-run upward trend in stocks comes into sharper focus.If history is any guide, checking your portfolio weekly reduces the number of times you confront a loss, from 46.7 percent to 43.7 percent. Be more disciplined and check at the end of each month, and you realize losses only 40.4 percent of the time. And if you check your portfolio at the end of each year instead, you would have to deal with losses only 27.6 percent of the time.Stocks offer a good bet over the long run. They have risen over every decade since 1900, with only two exceptions: the Depression-ravaged 1930s and the financial crisis-wracked first decade of this century. In both cases, those losses were relatively small, and were more than fully recovered before the next decade was out.The point is that stocks aren\u2019t really that risky, at least if you\u2019re willing to ignore the noise and if you don\u2019t need to pull out the money in the short term. Inhale, exhale, repeat and watch ESPN. And next time someone asks you how your portfolio is doing, impress them with your knowledge of sports instead.Advertisement"}

Until the government devalued the currency, prompting its steepest fall in decades.\u201cChina really has always been an enigma,\u201d said Troy Gayeski, a senior portfolio manager at SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm that has $9.4 billion invested in hedge funds. \u201cYou could be dead right in the thesis and you won\u2019t make money.\u201dHe proclaimed he had seen this movie before. \u201cLike day follows night, six to 12 months down the road you\u2019re out of recession, and you\u2019re into a full-blown recovery,\u201d Mr. Druckenmiller said.These charts show the relative currency strength of East Asia\u2019s three largest economies over the last 15 years.Still, he pared his growth expectations slightly, \u201cbecause it\u2019s China, and we don\u2019t know the nature of what we\u2019re dealing with here relative to normal, mature developed markets.\u201dMr. Druckenmiller declined to comment for this article.The Chinese stock market\u2019s rise into the stratosphere, fueled in part by the government\u2019s encouragement, had attracted droves of hedge funds.\u201cIn the short term, we are buying the dip,\u201d Mr. Yusko said. \u201cOne of the crazy things is that \u2014 in investing \u2014 when things go on sale, people run out the door.\u201dBetting on China is anything but straightforward. Many like Morgan Creek opted to invest in Chinese hedge funds.Investors seeking to buy local equities directly have to get approval from Chinese regulators, by obtaining a qualified foreign institutional investor license. Big players like Goldman Sachs and Stanford University have taken this route. Several years ago, the government began to expand the program, as part of an effort to overhaul its financial system.As the market soared, many hedge funds rode the bull run, raking in profits and posting double-digit returns. At the end of the second quarter, Asia-focused hedge funds had $126.3 billion in capital invested, a record amount of money according to the research firm HFR.Chinese markets began to tumble, with stocks 30 percent off their highs at one point. By the end of July, the capital devoted to Asia-focused hedge funds had dropped by $10 billion as investors ran for the exits and losses mounted, according to HFR. Since then, it has continued to be shaky, with stocks in Shanghai down more than 6 percent on Tuesday.Casting doubt on the market reform efforts, Chinese authorities have aggressively intervened to help stop the slide. Investors got blindsided by some of the measures, including a ban on \u201cmalicious short-selling\u201d and forcing big investors to hold their shares for six months.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a little bit of smoke from the devaluation,\u201d Mr. Gayeski said. \u201cAnd where there is smoke, there is fire,\u201d he added.Despite the recent tumult, the China story continues to enchant Wall Street.\u201cAsia, in general, and China, in particular, offer great opportunities for hedge funds, both on the long and short sides,\u201d Mr. Robertson said in an emailed statement.CDIB Capital International Corporation, the private equity arm of China Development Financial, raised $405 million last month for a fund focused on private equity opportunities in China and other Asian markets. It is the fourth Asia-focused fund that the firm has started this year.The fund will focus on Chinese consumption, as well as companies with innovative models and advanced manufacturing operations, said Chris Lerner, a Shanghai partner at Eaton Partners, the firm that helped CDIB Capital raise money for the fund. For example, the fund could focus on Taiwan, where the economy is intertwined with China; seven of the top 10 exporters in China are run by Taiwanese entrepreneurs, Mr. Lerner said.Wall Street investors are also finding new ways to play the turmoil in China. Penso Advisors, a hedge fund adviser that manages money for investors like pension funds, scoped out currencies that were affected by the renminbi devaluation in an attempt to profit from the shock waves. The firm bet on the Taiwan dollar, which dropped more than the renminbi, said Ari Bergmann, founder of Penso Advisors.\u201cPeople want to play China, but it\u2019s much harder to play China because you don\u2019t know the rules and they change all the time,\u201d Mr. Bergmann said, referring to capital controls there.\u201cDo you realize how volatile these things are?\u201d he added. \u201cYou could lose your shirt.\u201dInvestors ultimately know they cannot ignore China, given its size and influence.Ray Dalio, the founder of the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, the $160 billion Bridgewater Associates, recently tempered his enthusiasm for China, saying the firm did not properly anticipate how quickly the stock bubble would deflate.\u201cEven those who haven\u2019t lost money in stocks will be affected psychologically by events, and those effects will have a depressive effect on economic activity,\u201d Bridgewater said in its July note to investors.Bridgewater remains cautious about the domestic equity markets because the terms and regulatory framework continue to be uncertain, according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm.Yet Mr. Dalio, who has traveled to China for business since 1984, maintains a positive outlook over the longer term. Bridgewater has applied for a foreign investment license from Chinese regulators, so that it can invest directly in the country\u2019s stocks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Thing You Can Do With Your Portfolio Right Now", "Date": "2015-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyKnowing how strong that feeling is, I want to give you something to do during any scary market.Pull out a piece of paper. You\u2019re going to remind yourself why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re invested the way you are. I\u2019m not talking about why you own specific investments, but why you are investing in the first place.The foundation of this whole process is the question, \u201cWhy is money important to you?\u201d I hope you already have this answer written down on a piece of paper called a financial plan. But if you don\u2019t, now is the perfect time to figure out your answer.For me, that answer is: time spent with my family, mainly outside, and serving my community. When I first answered this question, I probably started with a word like \u201cflexibility\u201d or \u201cfreedom.\u201d I kept pushing to figure out what those words meant. It turned out that I cared a lot about time, and then \u201ctime\u201d became \u201cWhat would I do with that time?\u201d That\u2019s how I got to my big \u201cwhy.\u201dYour answer will probably be a bit different, but once you know it, you can answer the next question, \u201cWhat do I want?\u201d Think of this question as a way of stating your goals.For instance, let\u2019s say you want $5,000 to hit your bank account every month after you\u2019ve retired so that you have enough money to live on. The money may come from a collection of things like investments, Social Security or even a pension. You probably also want to give yourself a little raise every year to keep up with the cost of living. Be specific, and whatever your goal, write it down. With your \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d in mind, it\u2019s time to look at \u201chow\u201d you\u2019ll do it.So, does how you are investing create the greatest chance of meeting the goals that express your values? Obviously, you don\u2019t want your investments to be based on advice you heard watching the financial pornography network. That\u2019s a perfect recipe for building a smorgasbord of investments, making you a collector and not an investor.Still, if you can\u2019t connect how you\u2019re investing to your values and goals, it\u2019s time to hit the pause button and review your answers to these questions. Do you need to realign your \u201chow\u201d to better match your values and goals?If you decide changes are needed, sit down in front of a video camera (there\u2019s probably one on your phone) and capture your commitment to make these adjustments when the markets are more stable. The video is important because I want you to see the fear in your eyes so you remember how you felt at the moment you realized that there was a disconnect. It will increase the odds you\u2019ll follow through when things settle down and it\u2019s time to make changes to your investments to match what you\u2019ve learned.Many of you may have already sailed through this exercise, and your \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d align perfectly. If so, you\u2019ve done everything you need to do. You don\u2019t need to do anything else, even (and especially) when markets bounce around. When you revisit these questions in the future, you may find that your values or goals have changed. But only then will you need to worry about updating your investments.So turn the noise off and walk through these questions, preferably during a conversation with someone else so you have to talk it through out loud. It\u2019s the perfect antidote for what supposedly passes as financial advice in a scary market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Selling Shows Concerns About China\u2019s Weakness", "Date": "2015-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter China shocked investors on Tuesday by devaluing the country\u2019s currency, a wave of selling swept the globe. The price of oil plunged, the currencies of other countries tumbled and stock markets skidded on every continent.For once, the markets may not have overreacted.Investors have been able to live with the problems brewing in China\u2019s economy for years. The country\u2019s authorities always seemed to have the financial firepower and the will to rev up China\u2019s $10 trillion economy when it sputtered.But the devaluation, along with the authorities\u2019 aggressive efforts earlier in the summer to shore up the country\u2019s stock market, has rekindled long-running concerns that China\u2019s economy is substantially weaker than official figures suggest \u2014 and that its leadership is running out of ways to bolster growth.James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors\u2019 perceptions of China dimmed after the authorities intervened to stem the selling of Chinese stocks. \u201cNow, this devaluation has just made it worse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an admission that they\u2019ve been unable to arrest the slowdown.\u201dThe devaluation of the renminbi, nearly 2 percent against the dollar, may help revive the economy. When a country devalues, its goods cost less in other currencies, like the dollar, which can lead to an increase in demand for those goods around the world.Still, investors can view devaluations warily.Some analysts had recently speculated that China would adjust its exchange rate. But the change, when it came, was far greater than expected, prompting analysts to ask whether the Chinese authorities were acting from a position of weakness.\u201cThis is the second time in two or three months that they surprised us with what seemed like abrupt policy changes,\u201d said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS. \u201cThey were almost panicky measures \u2014 that is the concern.\u201d China\u2019s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.Mr. Mariscal added that investors might have expected the adjustment to be a 2 percent decline in a year, not 2 percent in a day.The move rippled through the markets on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 212.33 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 17,402.84. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, a broader index favored by investors, declined by 0.96 percent to close at 2,084.07. Oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, declined by 3.75 percent to $43.35 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury note, a safe haven on troubled days in the market, rose in price, pushing its yield down to 2.137 percent. The currencies of Asian countries, including South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, declined on Tuesday.As investors grope for explanations for the devaluation, they point to the need for stemming capital outflows from the country, which have picked up in recent months. It is an indication, at least somewhat, that Chinese investors \u2014 fearing their currency was overvalued and a devaluation was coming \u2014 are looking for better opportunities elsewhere.\u201cAll this hot money outflow was people in China realizing they had an overvalued currency \u2014 and spending when they could,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. But there is a danger that the capital outflows may now speed up, if the Chinese investors believe the renminbi could be devalued again.The sharp reaction among investors also reflects the mistrust toward economic data coming out of China. While the country\u2019s goal is to grow 7 percent this year, a report last week from Bank of America Merrill Lynch caused a particular stir in the markets. It cited data that suggested China\u2019s economy may already be in a ditch, including figures showing that power generation was flattening, cement production contracting and steel output slowing.The murkiness of China\u2019s numbers means that global investors could remain jittery in coming weeks as they pore over every report about the country\u2019s economy. If more signs of slowing emerge, investors might expect a further devaluation.That, in turn, could prompt other countries to devalue, to prevent Chinese exporters from gaining an outsize advantage in world markets. If that happens, fears of a full-on currency war would soon grip the markets.\u201cEveryone has to back up and at least put their projects on pause when China has to tweak more than the stock market to get its economy growing as quickly as it did in the past,\u201d said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial. Russia, too, is watching closely. Any further slowdown in China \u2014 its largest trading partner \u2014 could weigh on Russia, at a time when it is already dealing with the dual headwinds of Western sanctions and low oil prices. On Tuesday, the Russian ruble was off roughly 2 percent.The United States economy would most likely get hit if China and many other countries continued to devalue. American companies would find it harder to export, depressing their earnings. \u201cWe thought we were at the end of the stronger dollar cycle \u2014 and clearly this could extend it,\u201d Mr. Mariscal said.Still, some analysts say the fretting has gone too far. In devaluing, China\u2019s authorities, they assert, acted mostly out of a long-term desire to allow the market to have a greater role in setting the level of its currency.\u201cWe take China policy makers at their word that this is meant to introduce greater market forces into determining the exchange rate,\u201d Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note on Tuesday, adding that any further declines are likely to be restrained. The country also has billions of dollars in reserves that it can use to influence the exchange rate and put out financial fires.Others said that the devaluation was sensible because the currency was becoming quite overvalued, and was merely a catch-up move that would have benefits for the economy. \u201cChina\u2019s wages haven\u2019t increased and their cost base hasn\u2019t gone up,\u201d Mr. Lele said, \u201cbut they have been slowly becoming less competitive.\u201d And by loosening the way it manages its currency, China in effect will gain more flexibility in conducting its domestic monetary policy, leeway it will need as it tries to stimulate the economy, Mr. Lele contended.Even so, China will most likely remain a big worry among investors until it posts strong and convincing growth figures. Some investors are wondering whether China is just another emerging market, vulnerable to global money flows.As the Federal Reserve now prepares to raise interest rates, the supply of dollars around the world has slowed, causing financial havoc in many developing countries. That tightening could make life harder for China \u2014 and the authorities there may already have seen that.\u201cThe growth scare is what is affecting the markets right now,\u201d Mr. Mariscal said. \u201cThey are worried that Chinese growth is much, much weaker than people expected.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Advice After Stock Market Drop: Take Some Deep Breaths, and Don\u2019t Do a Thing", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe impulse when the stock market falls hard for a few days in a row is to do something. Anything. Our life savings are often on the line, after all.But that\u2019s just the thing: Stocks are most useful for long-term goals. So unless those goals have changed in the last few days, it probably doesn\u2019t make much sense to overhaul an investment strategy based on a blip of market activity.So pour yourself a drink, or sit down with a pint of ice cream, and consider the following six things.Second, if you have been investing in stocks in the last six years, you most likely are a big winner. It\u2019s generally a bad idea to look at your investment statements too often, but take a quick peek.Still uneasy? Consider a third point: At some time in the past, when you were not scared, you made a decision to construct your portfolio a certain way. You knew that stocks involved risk and that the returns they have traditionally delivered, above and beyond what cash and bonds do, was the reward for your persistence.Nothing about the events of recent days suggests that the fundamentals of capitalism have changed. So neither should your confidence in very long-term ownership of the pieces of the for-profit enterprises that benefit from your fortitude.Nobody knows for sure whether we\u2019re in for a decline in the stock market of 25 percent or more. But if such a decline does happen and you are a regular investor, you\u2019ll be buying more when prices are lower.Which brings us to point No. 4: Long-term investors have time to recover. I know too many 70-year-olds who sold all of their stocks in 2009 and are healthy enough to live to 100. They\u2019d be going on a lot more vacations now and be worrying less about long-term care if they had held firm.Worried about a 529 college savings plan for a 12-year-old? Hopefully, you weren\u2019t 100 percent in stocks with six years to go before needing money for tuition. Still, you have at least nine years for a portion of that portfolio to recover from any sustained downturn. If that 12-year-old is the oldest of at least two children, you could use cash to pay some tuition bills for the eldest and let some of the account ride even longer for the next child.Let\u2019s say you still have trouble sleeping. Then you may be the sort of person who needs to consider a fifth point: Some people cannot handle the stress of investing in stocks. But try to give this more time, and consider the alternatives. There are few investments that can deliver the kinds of returns that stocks can without their own accompanying anxiety.Another alternative is to save a lot more in safer investments like cash or certain bonds. Most people don\u2019t have enough income to do that easily, so settling for lower returns will mean a combination of working longer and living modestly, forever. For some people, that is a fine trade-off.Most of us have to save somewhere, and history suggests that stocks are the most accessible route to get the returns you\u2019ll need to retire someday. It would take decades of systemic economic erosion to prove otherwise, and a few days of market declines do not suggest that anything like that is upon us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Plunge in China Rattles Markets Across the Globe", "Date": "2015-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks around the world tumbled in volatile trading on Monday, leaving investors to wonder how much government officials can and will do to insulate the global economy from the turmoil.The upheaval in the markets began with another rout in China that drew comparisons to the 1987 crash in the United States known as \u201cBlack Monday.\u201dConcerns about China\u2019s ability to be a powerful engine of global economic growth have added to worries about the potential impact of higher interest rates in the United States, driving stocks sharply lower in Asia and Europe.But early Tuesday, after a three-day rout that erased nearly $3 trillion in value from stocks globally, markets showed signs that selling pressures were easing.Volatility continued to dominate early trading in Asia, but many regional markets swung from losses to gains on Tuesday for the first time in days. Stocks in Japan opened sharply lower but had recovered by late morning, while shares in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea were staging a modest rally.Across Asia, the free-fall of the past few days appeared to have ended \u2014 except in China, where Shanghai stocks opened 6.4 percent lower after Monday\u2019s 8.5 percent plunge.The tumult has had many analysts grasping for explanations, given the lack of any significant new data that would explain the big market moves.On Monday, the steepest losses in the New York markets ended within minutes after opening, with share prices spending the rest of the day sharply rising and reversing course multiple times. When the day\u2019s roller-coaster ride ended, the benchmark for stocks, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, was down 3.9 percent. That left the index off 11 percent from its May high, in what in market parlance is called a \u201ccorrection,\u201d its first since 2011.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Beyond the questions about what exactly caused Monday\u2019s moves, the recent market turmoil has now led many investors to turn their focus to the government officials who have become the most important players in the market since the financial crisis.In particular, there is a growing debate among market participants about whether the Federal Reserve will still follow through with plans to push interest rates higher, an action that was expected to begin in September. The market turmoil has led some, including Lawrence H. Summers, a former chief economic adviser to President Obama, to call for the central bank to reconsider those plans.\u201cEverything is going to be dictated by government policy,\u201d said Kevin Kelly, the chief investment officer of Recon Capital Partners. \u201cWhatever noise is coming from policy makers is going to determine the next couple weeks.\u201dFed officials could give some indication of their thinking later this week when they gather for an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.7 PhotosAt an event on Monday, the president of the Atlanta Fed, Dennis Lockhart, said that recent developments \u201care complicating factors in predicting the pace of growth,\u201d though he said he still expected rates to rise this year.Investors have also been looking to Beijing. Over the weekend, there were expectations that the Chinese government would take more aggressive steps to stem the recent declines in the Chinese stock market and the renminbi, the country\u2019s currency.Previous moves, though, did little to beat back concern about a weakening Chinese economy, and Chinese officials declined to do anything significant on Monday.The debates in both China and the United States have often turned to more worrying questions about whether the levers that central bankers use to influence the markets are losing their power after years of extensive intervention.With all the hand-wringing, however, many investment advisers have been urging clients to ignore the recent swings.And although a number of American companies stand to be hurt by any weakness in China, recent data has suggested that the economy in the United States is continuing to gain strength.Even apart from the problems in China, many analysts have said that high-flying American stocks were due for a pause after the steady upward climb that has characterized the American stock market over the last four years.Still, the violent swings in stocks have left many investors unnerved.\u201cWe take the sell-off very seriously as this unfamiliar mix of emerging market uncertainty, deflationary pressure, central bank interference and extreme volatility is hard for global markets to digest,\u201d Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer for the UBS wealth management arm, wrote in a note to clients.Wall Street\u2019s so-called fear gauge, the Vix, rose Monday morning to its highest level since 2009.On Monday, the Shanghai composite index closed down 8.5 percent. In Europe, benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France fell nearly 5 percent or more. A number of emerging markets were also lower, with leading indexes in Brazil and Indonesia both down around 4 percent.In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 1,000 points before regaining ground. It ended the day down 3.6 percent, or 588.40 points, to 15,871.35. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 3.9 percent, or 77.68 points, to 1,893.21. The Nasdaq composite index closed down 3.8 percent, 179.79 points, to 4,526.25.The Treasury market was a beneficiary of the fear in stocks. The demand for bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to as low as 1.90 percent before it settled at 2.01 percent.The recent market tumult began two weeks ago when the Chinese government unexpectedly allowed the value of its currency to drop, partly in response to indications that the country\u2019s economy is weakening.The Chinese moves played into the continuing drop in the price of oil, which has taken the price of a barrel of crude oil down 65 percent over the last year. On Monday, the price of oil, as measured by a benchmark New York contract, dropped below $40.The selling in China has accelerated despite extraordinary government intervention in the last two months aimed at propping up share prices. On Sunday, the Chinese government said that the country\u2019s pension funds would be allowed to invest in stocks for the first time. But the slide on Monday highlighted that the new policy, and several similar recent moves, have not been successful.Many investors are now hoping that the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, will cut the ratio of deposits that banks are required to keep on reserve in a bid to encourage lending and spur economic growth.In the meantime, there are big questions about whether China\u2019s stock market plunge will make the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second-largest after that of the United States, even weaker.In the United States, too, economists were hopeful that the activity in the markets would not spread to the broader economy.\u201cFor now we believe the positive factors will win out,\u201d Mr. Haefele of UBS wrote in his note to clients. \u201cBut market shocks of this magnitude have the potential to overpower fundamentals so we need to remain vigilant.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a global stock market slide misstated, in one reference, Monday\u2019s change in the Shanghai composite index. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, it declined 8.5 percent, not 8.7 percent.David Jolly and Keith Bradsher contributed reporting. Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The hedge fund, led by O. Andreas Halvorsen, who once worked for Mr. Robertson, sold 1.1 million shares in Baidu and also 902,981 shares of Alibaba.The hedge funds disclosed that they sold their shares in Baidu and Alibaba in regulatory filings that are submitted four times a year to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The quarterly reports, known as 13F filings, offer investors a chance to see which stocks and sectors traders were betting on when the quarter ended, roughly 45 days ago.But the filings offer an imperfect window into the holdings of money managers because they are inherently backward-looking. They include only stocks traded in the United States and do not include short positions, or bets a manager might have made that a stock will fall in price.The family office for George Soros, the billionaire investor, sold 4.38 million shares of Alibaba, at the same time his firm was buying 2.47 millions shares of Facebook.But not all Chinese companies were shunned in the quarter. Some of the biggest shareholders in JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s rival in China, are hedge funds that added to their positions in the quarter. Tiger Global added 49 million shares, bringing its stake to 6.4 percent, while Lone Pine Capital increased its stake to 3.8 percent. Coatue bought 3.3 million shares in JD.com, bringing its stake to 1.4 percent.Jana Partners, a fund led by Barry Rosenstein, disclosed in a filing that it bought 2.5 million shares of Precision Castparts in the second quarter, and Farallon Capital Management reported adding 232,000 shares to its pre-existing stake in the manufacturing company.If Jana and Farallon are still holding their positions, the funds will have done well with finely timed trades. Shares of Precision Castparts are up almost 10 percent since the beginning of the second quarter.Another stock that experienced a lot of activity this quarter was Mondelez International, after William A. Ackman announced he had built up a 7.5 percent stake in the food company in a bet on consolidation in the food industry. Viking Global sold out of its 1.5 percent stake in Mondelez over the same quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citadel, a U.S. Hedge Fund, Has Account Suspended in China", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Chinese stock market regulators have suspended more than 30 trading accounts, including one owned by the brokerage unit of the big American hedge fund Citadel, as they continue trying to stabilize the country\u2019s volatile markets.\u201cWe can confirm that while one account managed by Guosen Futures Ltd. \u2014 Citadel (Shanghai) Trading Ltd. \u2014 has had its trading on the Shenzhen exchange suspended, we continue to otherwise operate normally from our offices, and we continue to comply with all local laws and regulations,\u201d Citadel wrote on Monday in an email.The suspension came amid continued volatility in the markets, with Shanghai\u2019s main share index closing an additional 1.1 percent lower on Monday. A week earlier, the index had plunged 8.5 percent in its biggest single-day loss in eight years.Chinese regulators have been taking exceptional measures to help halt the recent slide in the country\u2019s markets, including buying shares directly and barring major shareholders of companies from selling their stakes. Despite these efforts, shares have continued to tumble. From their peak in mid-June, the total value of all domestically listed stocks has declined by about a third, shedding more than $3 trillion in market value.The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which has in recent weeks pledged to crack down on \u201cmalicious\u201d short-sellers and market manipulators, appears to be expanding its scrutiny to other types of trading.On Friday, the commission said it would strengthen its supervision of so-called program trading, which can include high speed, algorithmic or other computer-driven trading strategies. It said 24 such trading accounts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had been suspended on suspicion of harming the market with rapid-fire share purchase or sale orders that were canceled before they could be fulfilled, a strategy known as spoofing.By the time markets closed on Monday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had announced suspensions for more than 10 additional accounts, bringing the total number of targeted accounts to more than 30.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.Spoofing \u201chas the effect of boosting or pushing down the market, and during the recent period of market volatility the impact of this has been amplified,\u201d Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesman for the regulator, said Friday in a statement on the agency\u2019s website. Mr. Zhang was speaking generally about program trading and did not identify the accounts that had been suspended.Citadel, which is based in Chicago, has several other accounts in China apart from the suspended Guosen account, and those continue to operate normally. The company has not been accused of wrongdoing.\u201cCitadel has been actively investing in the region for 15 years, and has always maintained a constructive dialogue with regulators, including during the recent market volatility,\u201d Citadel said on Monday.The entity that owns the suspended account, Citadel (Shanghai) Trading, is a locally registered firm wholly owned by Citadel and incorporated in 2010. Citic Securities, one of China\u2019s biggest state-owned brokerages, once had a small stake in the unit, according to filings with the local government agency that regulates industry and commerce.China\u2019s capital markets are still largely closed to foreigners.Although overseas investment firms face restrictions on buying stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as strict limits on moving funds to and from mainland China, a small but increasing number of them, mainly hedge funds, have followed Citadel in recent years. Their strategy: incorporating local units in China so they can trade more freely as domestic entities, according to Chris Powers, a senior consultant at Z-Ben Advisors, a financial consulting firm based in Shanghai.It was unclear whether any of the remaining suspended trading accounts were tied to foreign investors. But the authorities\u2019 action appears in line with a general campaign in recent weeks to give stock markets a lift \u2014 either by state-directed buying or by discouraging would-be sellers.\u201cIn the last six weeks obviously you\u2019ve had a lot of direct intervention into the market in terms of actually buying shares,\u201d Mr. Powers said.\u201cBut a lot of the other measures are more about trying to instill confidence and encourage people to behave a certain way,\u201d he added, \u201cand preventing them from doing what Beijing considers are activities detrimental to the stock market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some said the government should do more.

{"Headline": "Viacom\u2019s Weak Results Pile On More Bad News for TV Industry", "Date": "2015-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is no more than a coincidence that Viacom announced weak earnings and suffered a sharp plunge in its stock on the same day that one of its biggest stars, Jon Stewart, exited the stage.Still, Mr. Stewart\u2019s departure from \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d on Comedy Central on Thursday could be a metaphor for the broader woes facing Viacom\u2019s constellation of cable television networks, which also includes MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1 and Spike.Once known for its cachet with younger viewers, Viacom now is struggling to shift its business as a generation of iPhone-wielding, social-network-using, online-streaming viewers abandons traditional television.Ratings across Viacom\u2019s bundle of networks tumbled an estimated 18 percent during the quarter that ended in June, according to one analyst\u2019s estimates. Programs it deemed hits \u2014 \u201cScream\u201d on MTV and \u201cLip Sync Battle\u201d on Spike \u2014 failed to reverse the persistent ratings declines plaguing the company. Advertisers still trade on those figures, and those eroding ratings led to a 9 percent drop in domestic advertising revenues during the latest quarter, Viacom reported on Thursday, a figure much higher than analysts had expected. Viacom\u2019s efforts to introduce new audience metrics that capture viewing on digital outlets, as well as data-driven, digital advertising technologies, have mitigated those declines but have yet to return the advertising business to growth.Viacom\u2019s results, which caused shares to fall more than 14 percent, to $44.10, only deepened the anxiety about the health of the media business on a day when questions about the future of traditional TV dominated Wall Street.Eight major media stocks suffered an abrupt and startling crash on Wednesday, eliminating a combined $37 billion in market value. Fears about cord cutting combined with worries about sharp ratings declines and weak advertising sales prompted the mass sell-off. The collapse largely continued on Thursday, led by Viacom\u2019s steep decline.\u201cInvestors are moving en masse out of media,\u201d said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, who said he was \u201ccalling from the vortex of media hell.\u201dOf all the media companies, Viacom was particularly hard hit, with its core demographic of children and teenagers \u2014 the group moving fastest away from traditional television. Marketing executives said that Viacom, which used to dominate the youth advertising market, now faces intense competition for their ad dollars from Facebook, YouTube and other digital outlets. \u201cThe younger and more valuable demographics are seeking their entertainment elsewhere, and watching less TV than ever before\u201d said Ian Schafer, chairman of Deep Focus, a New York-based ad agency. \u201cOther brands are taking the mantle from Viacom \u2014 everything from Vice to the universe of YouTube stars.\u201dIn another blow to the company, Viacom reported a slowdown in its domestic affiliate fees \u2014 the money it receives from cable and satellite distributors \u2014 to mid-single-digit growth during the quarter that ended on June 30. Some smaller cable companies have dropped Viacom networks from their lineup, leading to fears that larger cable and satellite companies will eventually follow their lead.\u201cWe believe Viacom\u2019s brands are the worst positioned in the future environment,\u201d Todd Juenger, a media analyst with Bernstein, said in a research note.Another uncertainty facing the company are questions over who will succeed Sumner Redstone, 91, Viacom\u2019s chairman and controlling shareholder. Mr. Redstone, who controls about 80 percent of the company, said in a statement in May that decisions over succession would be made by the board, not an individual, and that such decisions had not yet been made.In its earnings report, Viacom said that its profits fell to $591 million during the quarter, down from $610 million during the same period last year. That was primarily because its film division, Paramount, had no theatrical releases in the quarter, compared with last year, when it released \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction.\u201dTotal revenues missed expectations, falling 11 percent to $3.1 billion during the quarter, dragged down by a 44 percent decline in its filmed group. Sales in its media networks group were flat, with higher affiliate fee revenues offsetting ad declines.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom\u2019s chief executive, tried to convince investors during an earnings call that the company was moving swiftly to position itself for a digital future. In addition to a broad reorganization this year that resulted in companywide layoffs, he said Viacom was spending more money than ever on original content.He cited Trevor Noah, the new host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d calling him late-night television\u2019s first millennial host and saying he had the potential to bring in many younger viewers. Mr. Dauman also added that the company was investing in data-driven advertising technologies, new forms of measurement that capture digital viewers and a stronger film slate, stepping up its output to 15 movies in 2016.Viacom also is exploiting new forms of distribution, such as selling programming to mobile players, and continuing to build out its international business, which Mr. Dauman called one of Viacom\u2019s \u201cmost important and underappreciated assets.\u201dHe promised a return to advertising growth in the next fiscal year as well as \u201ccontinued strong growth\u201d in affiliate revenues. He tried to cool concerns on Thursday, by saying that well over 70 percent of its subscriber base is covered by deals through 2018. \u201cThe market action on the stock has been way overdone considering the inherent value of what we have,\u201d Mr. Dauman said. \u201cWe have in the past gone through these market dislocations, and we obviously, as you know, believe in our stock.\u201dMr. Dauman pointed to a Nickelodeon show called \u201cBella and The Bulldogs,\u201d which he characterized as performing at the same levels as the channel\u2019s hit \u201ciCarly\u201d when it started in 2007 when delayed and digital viewing is counted.\u201cSo this is a process that\u2019s not overnight, day by day, but it\u2019s a continual adjustment, which we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.Still, some analysts said they were skeptical about Viacom\u2019s ability to deliver on its promises, given its recent track record. \u201cHow do you suddenly turn this around next year?\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays Research. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a good answer for that.

{"Headline": "China Falters, and the Global Economy Is Forced to Adapt", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe China Factor | Part 2HONG KONG \u2014 The commodities giant BHP Billiton spent heavily for years, mining iron ore across Australia, digging for copper in Chile, and pumping oil off the coast of Trinidad. The company could be confident in its direction as commodities orders surged from its biggest and best customer, China.Now, BHP is pulling back, faced with a slowing Chinese economy that will no longer be the same dominant force in commodities. Profit is falling and the company is cutting its investment spending budget by more than two-thirds.China\u2019s rapid growth over the last decade reshaped the world economy, creating a powerful driver of corporate strategies, financial markets and geopolitical decisions. China seemed to have a one-way trajectory, momentum that would provide a steady source of profit and capital.But deepening economic fears about China, which culminated this week in a global market rout, are now forcing a broad rethinking of the conventional wisdom. Even as markets show signs of stabilizing, the resulting shock waves could be lasting, by exposing a new reality that China is no longer a sure bet.China, while still a large and pervasive presence in the global economy, is now exporting uncertainty around the world with the potential for choppier growth and volatile swings. The tectonic shift is forcing a gut check in industries that have built their strategies and plotted their profits around China\u2019s rise.Industrial and commodity multinationals face the most pressing concerns, as they scramble to stem the profit slide from weaker consumption. Caterpillar cut back factory production, with industry sales of construction equipment in China dropping by half in the first six months of the year.Smartphone makers, automobile manufacturers and retailers wonder about the staying power of Chinese buyers, even if it is not shaking their bottom line at this point. General Motors and Ford factories have been shipping fewer cars to Chinese dealerships this summer.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.It is not just companies reassessing their assumptions. Russia had been turning to China to fill the financial gap left by low oil prices and Western sanctions. Venezuela, Nigeria and Ukraine have been heavily dependent on investments and low-cost loans from China.The pain has been particularly acute for Brazil. The country is already faltering, as weaker Chinese imports of minerals and soybeans have jolted all of Latin America. The uncertainty over China could limit the maneuvering room for officials to address the sluggish Brazilian economy at a time when resentment is festering over proposed austerity measures.The weakness in China is even compelling officials at the United States Federal Reserve to think more globally, as they consider raising interest rates. William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said on Wednesday that a September rate increase looked less likely than it did a few weeks ago.\u201cThe entire world is focusing now on China, watching this crisis unfold,\u201d Armando Monteiro Neto, Brazil\u2019s minister of development and foreign trade, told reporters on Tuesday in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cBrazil is already feeling the effects of China\u2019s deceleration. If the situation gets worse, the impact will get bigger.\u201dThe trouble is, the true strength of the Chinese economy \u2014 and the policies the leadership will adopt to address any weaknesses \u2014 is becoming more difficult to discern.China\u2019s growth, which the government puts at 7 percent a year, is widely questioned. Large parts of the Chinese service sector, like restaurants and health care, continue to grow, supporting the broader economy. But the signs in industrial sectors, in which other countries and foreign companies have the greatest stake through trade, paint a bleaker picture.Adding to the worries are recent events like the deadly explosion of a hazardous chemicals warehouse in Tianjin, which has delayed shipments through one of China\u2019s biggest ports. Labor protests, already rising, jumped sharply across coastal China last week over unpaid wages at struggling export factories.The leadership, concerned with maintaining social stability, has been quick to act, making aggressive moves to prop up the stock market, inject money into the financial system, and generally stimulate the economy. But President Xi Jinping doesn\u2019t have much experience managing a downturn, and some economists worry that the government is making knee-jerk decisions that will do more harm than good.Many company executives and global economists say that forecasting China\u2019s growth has become so hard that they are hedging their bets for the time being. \u201cThis is a complete black art right now,\u201d said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings, a large Hong Kong shipping company. \u201cI can\u2019t make any long-term decisions based on what is happening today, and so I just keep our fleet running until we get a bit of direction.\u201dThe problems have been building for months in areas like commodities and industrials where just modestly slowing growth in China has been having outsize effects.For more than a decade, prices surged for iron ore, a main ingredient in making steel, as new skyscrapers, rail lines and other infrastructure were built across China. Last year, BHP Billiton shipped enough iron ore each day to China to fill the Empire State Building.Now, the industry is retrenching in the face of China\u2019s weaker prospects and diving commodity prices.Vale, the Brazilian mining giant, is racing to unload assets. In Australia, Vale and its Japanese partner, the Sumitomo Corporation, sold a coal mine in July for just $1, after it had been valued at more than $600 million three years ago. In Argentina, Vale is trying to sell a potash mine in which it invested more than $2 billion.The fallout in commodities has been especially painful for emerging markets that depend on sales of those resources.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.With Brazil\u2019s revenues declining sharply this year, President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s government is coming under criticism over the country\u2019s dependence on China, which surpassed the United States as the top trading partner in 2009. Brazil\u2019s exports to China fell 23.6 percent, to $24.7 billion, in the first seven months of the year from the same period in 2014.In an editorial on Tuesday, the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo described Brazil\u2019s relationship with China as \u201csemi-colonial,\u201d claiming that the country\u2019s economy \u201cdepends in excess on Chinese prosperity.\u201dIlan Goldfajn, chief economist at Ita\u00fa Unibanco, one of Brazil\u2019s largest banks, said he was already forecasting the economy to contract about 2.3 percent this year, without factoring in the possibility of a hard landing in China. \u201cChina is the most important risk factor for Brazil,\u201d Mr. Goldfajn said.China was supposed to be the financial savior for Russia.Last year, Russia signed a $400 billion natural gas deal with China. China would help finance a nearly 2,500-mile pipeline to ship fuel from Siberia. Russia trumpeted that it would eventually sell more natural gas to China than Germany, now its biggest customer.But the prices that China is willing to pay for the gas are dropping so low that it may no longer be worthwhile to build a pipeline. The Russian energy giant Gazprom has cut its planned capital outlays this year for the first leg of the pipeline by half, Dozhd television reported.\u201cChina is an unclear country for us, opaque,\u201d said Aleksandr Abramov, a professor of finance at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cClearly, the situation will worsen in Russia.\u201dSome of the latest pressures reflect a belated recognition by businesses and politicians that China had been slowing down.Automobile manufacturers cut their shipments of new cars to dealers by 7 percent in July, compared with a year earlier. Retail sales had not suddenly tanked, said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of China\u2019s Passenger Car Association, which represents manufacturers.Rather, too many cars had been sent to dealers\u2019 lots in previous months, he said. In other words, manufacturers were slow to see the economy\u2019s deceleration and waited too long to throttle back their factories.\u201cWhat manufacturers are doing is adjusting inventory levels to the \u2018new normal,\u2019 \u201d said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China, using a favorite phrase of President Xi Jinping of China in recent months to describe an economy that is expanding at a slower pace.Similar adjustments are taking place around the globe.For years, Germany has been well positioned to profit from Chinese growth because it specializes in machine tools and other factory equipment. Most important, China acted as a counterweight to the chronically slow-growing markets in Europe.Now, major German exporters are seeing signs of pressure.Trumpf says that sales of its signature product, machines that automakers use to cut sheet metal that sell for about 500,000 euros ($566,000) each, have continued to grow in China. But in May and June, sales of less-expensive cutting machines flattened and began to decline. At the bottom of Trumpf\u2019s product line, sales have fallen sharply since November for machines often purchased by start-up companies.How industries and economies ultimately fare will depend on how long the slowdown and how deep the economic woes.Demand remains strong at Boeing for its 777-300ER and 787 jets, models that are capable of flights lasting 10 hours or longer, to Europe or North America. Long-haul international travel from mainland China soared nearly 30 percent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, Randy Tinseth, the vice president for marketing at Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft division, said during a visit to Beijing on Tuesday.So far, it has been mixed for technology players. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, said on Monday that business had stayed strong in China in July and August. But Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, said in an earnings call last week that China\u2019s consumer market for printers and computers was \u201cpretty soft,\u201d although demand from businesses was holding up better.In the end, much of the China story will come down to whether the expectations meet the reality. Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of BHP, captured a broader corporate view on Tuesday when he spoke glowingly about China\u2019s potential in the decade to come and predicted continued profitability. But he conceded that the country\u2019s steel production would most likely \u201cgrow a little more slowly,\u201d citing a forecast that works out to just 1.4 percent annually \u2014 a figure that sounds more like Europe than the formerly go-go economy of China.A similar realization is taking place in various corners. \u201cWe had five fabulous years in China, of course, where we grew strong double-digit, and it has been gradually slowing down,\u201d Frans van Houten, chief executive of Royal Philips, the Dutch conglomerate, said on July 27. \u201cI think, going forward, we need to be much more modest on expectations with regard to China growth: That\u2019s just being realistic.\u201dReporting was contributed by Simon Romero from Bras\u00edlia, Brazil; Jack Ewing from Athens; Andrew E.

But, these sorts of moves are not quite what the I.M.F. means when it calls on China to transition from a single-minded export machine into a more complex market economy powered by consumers.\u201cOn average, autocratic nations grow faster than democratic ones up to around where China is now,\u201d said David Dollar, a former China hand at the World Bank and emissary to China at the Treasury Department who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut successful cases democratize at around this level of income per capita.\u201dHere\u2019s how that sounds in Beijing: Further economic change will inevitably lead to political instability \u2014 not exactly the strongest incentive for government reform.A totalitarian regime may be good at deploying capital and labor to deliver raw economic growth. Yet autocracies are not good at fostering innovation and creativity, which rarely flourish where there is no freedom of thought or speech. While \u201cmake the economy grow and don\u2019t have demonstrations\u201d might have worked in the past, a bureaucratic command and control structure will have a hard time handling the more complex demands of citizens in countries that reach middle-income status.\u201cIt must rely more on innovation and provide more services to urban migrants,\u201d said Kenneth Lieberthal, an expert on China at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt also has environmental constraints and a demographic profile that is shifting dramatically, with a rising proportion of dependents and a shrinking proportion of workers.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to get things wrong. Spending in rural areas on health and education has been dismal. For all the progress of urban schools, the low quality of rural education suggests China may face an acute shortage of skilled labor as it moves up the development ladder.China\u2019s succession of five-year plans has given local government officials a single goal: Grow. This set them off on a binge of borrowing to build everything from roads to industrial parks, often generating lucrative kickbacks for local officials and their families.\u201cLocal governments have been very successful at generating investment and growth, contributing to China\u2019s extraordinary growth performance,\u201d Mr. Dollar wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, they have not put as much effort into public goods such as environmental protection or social services.\u201dWhat is most striking is not how all three countries followed quite similar paths, but how China\u2019s trajectory has diverged from the others\u2019.Household spending was always the main source of demand in all three, declining gradually to about 50 percent of gross domestic product when they were about as rich as China is today. Investment rates, which rose sharply in the early stages of their development, peaked at that time at around 35 percent of G.D.P.By these metrics, China\u2019s economy is upside down: Consumer spending by households is only 35 percent of the nation\u2019s G.D.P. \u2014 one of the lowest levels in the world. Its investment rate \u2014 nearly 50 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 is extraordinarily high. And the productivity of this investment is dismal.To a large extent, its authoritarian command and control economic governance is to blame. Limits on legal migration to cities promoted an underclass of illegal urban workers toiling for meager wages, slowing consumer spending and hindering urban development. State-owned monopolies plowed profits back into investment rather than into government spending on social welfare. Near-zero interest rates on deposit accounts provided cheap loans to business but penalized savers.And this means the Chinese transition will be much more complicated. Unlike Japan, Taiwan and Korea \u2014 which went into their transitions with substantial trade deficits, which swung into surplus to pick up the slack when investment rates declined \u2014 China has been running a hefty surplus for years. A still-fragile world economy is in no position to absorb even more Chinese imports.And then there is the democratic deficit. The changes China needs today will require enriching \u2014 and empowering \u2014 its own citizens. Perhaps that\u2019s why despite repeated pledges from top Chinese authorities to reform and \u201crebalance\u201d its lopsided economy, not much has happened. As the I.M.F. report noted, in most areas China\u2019s progress \u201chas just succeeded in slowing the pace at which vulnerabilities rise.\u201dPerhaps that\u2019s why financial markets are spooked. \u201cThe Chinese, too, think it is unclear where their economy and society will be 10 years from now,\u201d Mr. Lieberthal said.If China doesn\u2019t know, how can we?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney, Time Warner and Other Media Shares Fall as Investors Worry About TV\u2019s Future", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNever mind that Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, aggressively defended ESPN\u2019s overall health. By the end of trading on Wednesday, Disney shares had tumbled 9 percent, alarming investors across the entire entertainment industry.Some analysts cautioned that investors had mistakenly entered panic mode and that the companies largely delivered solid business results. Others said that the industrywide sell-off illuminated long-term fears about the fate of traditional media companies in a new digital world, where viewers are canceling their cable and satellite subscriptions as they spend more time watching on-demand streaming television that doesn\u2019t include advertising.\u201cThere is almost an eeriness to this; it doesn\u2019t seem fundamentally driven,\u201d said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThe concern is when you look at five to 10 years out, you become less certain about the ecosystem.\u201dNot only has subscriber and distribution revenue come under pressure as viewers choose not to pay for traditional cable and satellite service, but so, too, has ad revenue in the face of huge declines in TV ratings.\u201cYou have both legs of the media stool being kicked,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG Research. \u201cThe consumer is shifting, and these media companies are not built to take advantage of technological disruption.\u201dFueling investor anxiety, some analysts said, is the fast rise of digital rivals like Netflix, which some analysts said was cutting into the time people spend watching traditional television, and Facebook, which is capturing a larger share of advertising dollars.In the second quarter this year, Netflix surpassed expectations, adding a record 3.3 million global streaming members, bringing its total memberships to 65.6 million. Its stock registered another record high on Wednesday. And at Facebook, whose shares are also near a benchmark high, advertising revenue surged 43 percent to $3.8 billion during the second quarter.Netflix and Facebook \u201care at a scale that we really haven\u2019t seen historically in media in terms of the number of subscribers and the number of users,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, a media and web analyst at Nomura Securities.Charles W. Ergen, chairman of the Dish Network, acknowledged Netflix\u2019s ascendance. \u201cIt\u2019s totally, totally shifted to Netflix,\u201d he said. \u201cNetflix is the most powerful content aggregator in the world today, and there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s even close.\u201dMr. Ergen also outlined the challenges traditional television companies are facing. \u201cViewership is going down, advertising rates are going down, and everybody wants to go to the Street and say they\u2019re still making the same amount of money,\u201d he said.But as the large media conglomerates reported earnings on Wednesday, their executives insisted they were not worried.\u201cWe recognize the pace of change in our industry is accelerating, and that means we\u2019re going to have to move even faster,\u201d Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, said in a conference call.Time Warner has tried to position itself to take advantage of the fast rise in streaming by licensing programming to digital outlets and starting its own streaming offering for HBO, which does not require a traditional cable subscription.At 21st Century Fox, the company reported a 9.3 percent decline to $6.2 billion in adjusted revenue during the quarter that ended June 30 because of declining advertising sales in its TV business and because of smaller movies. Executives said that while the company had no plans to create an independent streaming service, it was benefiting from making its programming available to streaming services. Shares in Fox closed down 7 percent on Wednesday, and declined an additional 4 percent in after-hours trading.\u201cOur industry has always been evolving and innovating,\u201d Lachlan Murdoch, an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, said in a conference call. \u201cThe scale and speed of this change will, to some, be overwhelming.\u201dThe market woes also affected CBS Corporation, whose shares dropped more than 4 percent. On Wednesday, the company reported that net earnings from continuing operations declined 20 percent during the second quarter to $332 million, in part because of a $55 million restructuring charge related to its radio and TV station operations.Leslie Moonves, chief executive at CBS, promised that his company was well positioned for a digital future, highlighting the introduction of stand-alone streaming services for its CBS and Showtime networks. \u201cThe future is now, and we are part of it across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could be on every S.V.O.D. platform if we wanted to,\u201d he said, referring to the streaming video on demand services. \u201cBut since we own all of our content, we could also go directly to consumer, which is very possible.\u201dHere are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Of all the media companies, Disney was perhaps the loudest in insisting that there was no cause for concern.In a lengthy interview on CNBC, Mr. Iger said, \u201cWe are very bullish about our cable business, and we are very bullish about ESPN.\u201d He added, \u201cThe bundle is not going away. Not only is it not going away, it is going to continue to grow.\u201dDisney unnerved the market for reasons beyond ESPN, starting with expectations. Analysts, investors and the news media have become used to quarter after quarter (after quarter) of blockbuster Disney results \u2014 what Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, has termed \u201cthe earnings beating machine.\u201d So Disney \u201chitting a pothole,\u201d as Mr. Nathanson put it, was startling.While still beating quarterly profit expectations, Disney on Tuesday reported lower revenue than analysts had predicted, largely because of unfavorable exchange rates. Disney also cautioned that a stronger dollar would lower 2016 operating income by about $500 million.Additionally, analysts saw weakness in Disney\u2019s overseas theme parks. Results were soft at Hong Kong Disneyland, and the long-expected costs for a $5.5 billion resort Disney is building in Shanghai are starting to affect the bottom line. As the world\u2019s largest entertainment company, Disney is perhaps better positioned than competitors to handle the bumps ahead. Unlike competitors like Viacom and, to a degree, Time Warner, Disney has an array of other businesses that can pick up cable\u2019s slack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jack Dorsey and Other Twitter Insiders Make Show of Support", "Date": "2015-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow executives at the highest levels of Twitter are trying to show that despite it all, they still believe in the company.Jack Dorsey, co-founder and interim chief executive, bought more than 31,000 shares of Twitter stock on Monday, amounting to roughly $875,000.For Mr. Dorsey, who owns nearly 22 million shares of Twitter stock, it was a small addition to his holdings. And it came at a relatively low price; shares of Twitter have fallen by nearly a third over the last year.The price of a Twitter share jumped 9 percent on the news Monday, to $29.50. The purchase is also a statement by Mr. Dorsey who, along with stepping in as the interim chief, has privately expressed considerable interest in becoming Twitter\u2019s permanent leader, according to people familiar with his thinking who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private.The company has yet to name a permanent chief executive, and Mr. Dorsey has not said whether he would take the position were it offered to him. But any decision would come at a tricky time for Mr. Dorsey, whose other company, Square, is preparing an initial public offering.Twitter\u2019s board has indicated that it wants its next chief executive to be at the company full time, putting pressure on Mr. Dorsey to decide between the tech companies he co-founded. That is, assuming he would be the board\u2019s choice to run Twitter.\u201cI think for another company, spending months on end to find the right C.E.O. is appropriate,\u201d said Brian Blau, an Internet analyst with Gartner. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Twitter has that luxury, or that they should have even gone forward without a permanent C.E.O. already on board.\u201dThere also could be a shuffling of Twitter\u2019s top ranks, according to people close to the company who requested anonymity because the board conversations were confidential. The shift would distribute power among Mr. Dorsey, Adam Bain, the company\u2019s top advertising executive, and Evan Williams, a founder and board member of Twitter.\u201cWe see that as a triumvirate of power,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cIt brings a greater emphasis on the product, which is Twitter\u2019s main problem, while also giving more power to the revenue side of the house.\u201dThe purchases by insiders are a showing of public support during one of the most difficult times in Twitter\u2019s nine years. The embattled company faces intense criticism and weakening faith from investors, analysts and many employees.But some Twitter loyalists have lost faith in the company\u2019s ability to grow into a large enough presence to fight off competitors like Instagram, Snapchat and, of course, Facebook, the still-growing, 1.5 billion-user behemoth that Twitter is constantly compared to. Mr. Costolo has told some people that he will step down from Twitter\u2019s board when a new chief executive is appointed, according to people familiar with his plans who asked that their names not be used because they were not authorized to speak to the press.Also on Monday, Twitter announced a multiyear partnership with the National Football League, in which Twitter will feature and sell advertising against in-game video clips on Twitter.The most conspicuous seller is Mr. Williams. Since May, he has sold more than one million Twitter shares, according to filings with the S.E.C., though this represents only a small amount of the over 50 million shares he owns.That has caused some concern among analysts, but Mr. Williams said in an email that they were automatic sales planned some time ago. \u201cThe vast majority of all my net worth is still in Twitter stock, and I expect that to be true for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThese stock sales in no way reflect my confidence in the future of the company, which is high.\u201dMr. Peck, the financial analyst, said: \u201cWe would like to see the founder of the company stop selling shares.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As the Stock Market Swings", "Date": "2015-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBy the close of the stock market on Friday, the recent ups and downs in share prices had worked out to a mild correction. In all, the market was down 6.6 percent from its all-time high in May.Yet it\u2019s hard to escape a vague sense of unease. The swoon that began a week before last was quickly attributed, at least in part, to China\u2019s economic problems. Just as quickly, many investors and policy makers concluded that China\u2019s leaders would manage those problems in ways that would allow the global economy to chug along. But what if they don\u2019t? A prolonged slowdown is more likely to provoke social unrest in China than in other developed economies, because stability there has been based on high growth rather than political and other institutional arrangements. The prospect of social unrest, in turn, raises economic and national-security concerns not raised by economic crises elsewhere.Closer to home, market volatility has significantly reduced the odds that the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates at its next meeting in mid-September. A delay is nothing to lament, because the still significant slack in the labor market would make an increase this year premature. The Fed has generally played down the potential impact of China and other international headwinds, while asserting that the negative effects of low oil prices and a strong dollar were likely to be temporary. But these forces are proving potent and long lasting \u2014 further reason to give the Fed pause.Renewed stock market downdrafts could disrupt the economy, and the Fed\u2019s plans, in other ways. The recovery in housing is an important gauge of economic health. But this year, the big increases in sales and prices have come at the high end of the market, where investment wealth is assumed to be more of a factor in the decision to buy than wages and salary. The very real possibility is that if the stock market falters again, so too will the housing market.It all works out to an economy growing at 2.5 percent. At that modest pace, the United States cannot be of much help if other economies falter. But it can rebound from a market swoon, at least for now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Man Who Got China Right", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the fall of 2009, Jim Chanos began to ask questions about the Chinese economy. What sparked his curiosity was the realization that commodity producers had been largely unaffected by the financial crisis; indeed, they had recorded big profits even as other sectors found themselves reeling in the aftermath of the crisis.When he looked into why, he discovered that the critical factor was China\u2019s voracious appetite for commodities: The Chinese, who had largely sidestepped the financial crisis themselves, were buying 40 percent of all copper exports; 50 percent of the available iron ore; and eye-popping quantities of just about everything else. That insight soon led Chanos to make an audacious call: China was in the midst of an unsustainable credit bubble.Perhaps you remember Jim Chanos. The founder of Kynikos Associates, a $3 billion hedge fund that specializes in short-selling, Chanos was the first person to figure out, some 15 years ago, that Enron was a house of cards.Chanos and his crew at Kynikos don\u2019t make big \u201cmacro\u201d bets on economies; their style is more \u201cmicro\u201d: looking at the fundamentals of individual companies or sectors. And so it was with China. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day in 2009 when my real estate guy was giving me a presentation and he said that China had 5.6 billion square meters of real estate under development, half residential and half commercial,\u201d Chanos told me the other day.\u201cI said, \u2018You must mean 5.6 billion square feet.\u2019 \u201dThe man replied that he hadn\u2019t misspoken; it really was 5.6 billion square meters, which amounted to over 60 billion square feet.He also pointed out that much of the construction was for high-end condos that cost over $100,000, yet the average Chinese household made less than $10,000 a year.Can you guess how the financial establishment, convinced that the Chinese juggernaut was unstoppable, reacted to Chanos\u2019s contrarian thesis? It scoffed.The conventional view was that the Chinese economy would continue to grow at a rapid pace, and that Chinese officials, unencumbered by the messiness of democracy, could make quick adjustments if the economy started to slip.Chanos was undeterred. \u201cIt reminded me of 1989, when everybody said that we should emulate the Japanese model,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey used to say, \u2018They can get stuff done and we can\u2019t\u2019 \u201d \u2014 just as the supposed experts were now saying about China.As it turns out, China\u2019s economy began to slow right around the time Chanos first made his call. No matter: Most China experts remained bullish. Chanos, meanwhile, was shorting the stocks of a number of companies that depended on the Chinese market. And he was regularly sending out emails when he came upon articles that seemed to confirm his thesis: stories about newly constructed ghost cities and troubled banks and debt-laden state-owned enterprises.The moral of today\u2019s story is a simple one. Listen to the skeptics and the contrarians. You dismiss them at your peril.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Woes Send Stocks Into Tailspin", "Date": "2015-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStock markets around the world plummeted on Thursday, signaling that investors have not gotten over the shock of China\u2019s devaluation last week and remain nervous about the health of the global economy.The selling began in Asia, punishing Chinese stocks once again. It then moved to Europe, walloping markets in Germany and Italy, and ended with a rush for the exits in the United States.\u201cIt was a bad day \u2014 everything came together,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. Mr. Silverblatt noted that the stocks of 76 companies in the S.&P. 500 were down at least 20 percent so far this year, a decline that officially puts them in a bear market. He added that 45 companies were up at least 20 percent.After several years of strong gains, the United States stock markets have struggled to move up this year. And in recent weeks, the worries have piled up.The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 358.04 points, or 2.1 percent, on Thursday to close at 16,990.69. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark favored by investors, declined 43.88 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,035.73, its lowest level in six months. The S.&P. 500 is down just over 1 percent for the year.Investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.07 percent, from 2.13 percent on Wednesday.The biggest source of uneasiness right now appears to be China\u2019s economy. The country surprised the world last week by announcing changes in the way it manages its currency, the renminbi, which led to the currency falling in value against the dollar.Many analysts assumed that the devaluation was in part motivated by a desire to stimulate China\u2019s economy, the second largest in the world. A cheaper renminbi would make Chinese goods cheaper in other currencies, increasing demand for them.But the devaluation stoked suspicions in the markets that the country\u2019s economy might be weaker than its official figures suggested.\u201cThe shock of China\u2019s move to devalue \u2014 you can\u2019t understate that,\u201d said Sharon Stark, chief fixed income strategist at D.A. Davidson. \u201cWhat that has done is put the world on notice that the economic conditions in China may be worse than they are reporting.\u201dInvestors are also fretting over what the Federal Reserve will do next with interest rates. Its loose monetary policy since the financial crisis helped push up stock markets around the world. Now, though, the Fed is contemplating raising interest rates, a move that could happen as early as next month.Minutes from the Fed\u2019s last monetary policy meeting, released this week, showed that central bank officials were wary about global growth. The meeting was held before China\u2019s devaluation. That event and the recent turmoil in the markets could persuade the Fed to delay a rate increase.Still, the mere specter of rising rates has prompted investors to pull money out of many markets around the world. This has particularly weighed on the economies of developing countries. If they weaken further, there would most likely be less demand around the world for the goods and services of United States companies.Caterpillar, whose stock has been hit by such fears, is down nearly 17 percent so far this year, and fell 1.29 percent on Thursday.The price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, took a hit early on Thursday, nearly falling to $40 per barrel but recovering as the day went on. The decline could keep gasoline prices lower, benefiting consumers but also weighing on energy companies in the United States, which have created thousands of jobs in the last few years.Fears unrelated to the global economy also buffeted the market on Thursday. Stocks in large media companies dropped steeply after an analyst at Bernstein released a research note that highlighted, in particular, the challenges to advertising revenue at television companies. Shares in Disney, one of the companies that Bernstein downgraded, skidded 6 percent.Elsewhere, Twitter dropped nearly 6 percent, to close at $26, the price at which it went public in 2013. Financial stocks have fared relatively well so far this year, but they weren\u2019t shielded from Thursday\u2019s sell-off. JPMorgan Chase slid 2.5 percent and Morgan Stanley was down 3.39 percent.Still, some analysts said they did not expect extreme declines in global markets. A Greek default appeared to have been averted for now, and Europe\u2019s central bank is pumping stimulus into the Continent\u2019s economy. China has the financial firepower to avoid an uncontrolled devaluation. Last fall, nervousness about the strength of the global economy roiled markets, but when investors calmed down, markets soared again.And if the United States economy continues to grow at recent rates, the whole world should continue to benefit, some analysts asserted.\u201cIt could all come out in the wash,\u201d said Raymond Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm focused on hedge funds. \u201cThe wheels aren\u2019t coming off the U.S. economy and we\u2019re not going into a recession.\u201d He added that valuations of stocks in the United States were not especially cheap right now, which makes them more likely to drop when investors get jittery.Or as Ms. Stark put it: \u201cWhat we are learning is that the market has a very low tolerance for uncertainty and instability.\u201dAdvertisement"}

El precio del petr\u00f3leo y otras mercanc\u00edas cay\u00f3, y el dinero se refugi\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente en la seguridad de los bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos.Lo fascinante es que no existe una historia clara y sencilla sobre el nuevo pron\u00f3stico para las tasas de inter\u00e9s, las ganancias de empresas en Estados Unidos y Europa, o para el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico en comparaci\u00f3n con la semana pasada, cuando el \u00edndice S&P 500 estaba 10 por ciento arriba.Aqu\u00ed tratamos de explicar esta historia, una que es verdaderamente global pues se extiende desde las calles de Shanghai, donde la inversi\u00f3n burs\u00e1til se ha convertido en el deporte de la clase media en a\u00f1os recientes, pasa por los campos petroleros de Medio Oriente y el centro de Estados Unidos, y llega hasta los pasillos del poder de la Reserva Federal en Washington.La causa inmediata de la volatilidad a nivel mundial fue China, donde la ca\u00edda brusca en las bolsas de valores el lunes continu\u00f3 una retirada que ha estado en marcha durante todo el verano, con pausas peri\u00f3dicas debido a las intervenciones gubernamentales.La econom\u00eda china est\u00e1 desaceler\u00e1ndose y la ca\u00edda de 38 por ciento en el \u00edndice compuesto de Shanghai desde el 12 de junio es, sin duda, una cifra enorme. No cabe duda de que este gigante est\u00e1 batallando con una transici\u00f3n del auge de inversiones y exportaciones hacia algo m\u00e1s sostenible.Sin embargo, algunos hechos hacen que los problemas de China no sean una explicaci\u00f3n totalmente satisfactoria sobre la turbulencia actual de los mercados mundiales. La bolsa de valores en China ha crecido r\u00e1pidamente en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o por las inversiones de millones de ciudadanos chinos de la clase media. Incluso despu\u00e9s de su pronunciada ca\u00edda este verano, la baja del \u00edndice de Shanghai es menor a uno por ciento para este a\u00f1o e incluso est\u00e1 por arriba del 43 por ciento del a\u00f1o pasado.Puede haber una historia m\u00e1s compleja sobre c\u00f3mo la aguda ca\u00edda en el mercado chino pudo haber ocasionado efectos mayores en la econom\u00eda mundial que la subida fuerte en los seis meses que la precedieron. El hecho de que el gobierno chino haya tomado pasos sin precedentes para intentar contener la liquidaci\u00f3n del mercado burs\u00e1til, lo que result\u00f3 poco \u00fatil, puede sugerir limitaciones en el poder del imponente estado chino.En otras palabras, la liquidaci\u00f3n de las acciones chinas puede ser muy importante en forma aislada. No obstante, nos dice mucho de la incapacidad de los l\u00edderes chinos de conducir la econom\u00eda de su pa\u00eds a un aterrizaje m\u00e1s suave. Y eso es aterrador.Los mercados emergentes, que se extienden desde Malasia hasta M\u00e9xico, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n pagando las consecuencias. Los precios de sus monedas, valores y bonos se han desplomado en la \u00faltima semana. Es muy probable que parte de esa ca\u00edda refleje su exposici\u00f3n a la econom\u00eda china. Sin embargo, otra parte refleja algo mayor.Llam\u00e9mosle el \u201cTaper Tantrum 3.0.\u201d (Rabieta por el ajuste)El \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d original ocurri\u00f3 en junio de 2013, cuando los mercados financieros del mundo enloquecieron al darse cuenta de que en el banco central de Estados Unidos, la Reserva Federal, se hablaba en serio sobre la reducci\u00f3n de su programa de expansi\u00f3n cuantitativa (o de manera m\u00e1s sencilla, que, con el tiempo la Reserva Federal, relajar\u00eda sus inyecciones de dinero en el sistema financiero). Luego, hubo una segunda explosi\u00f3n de volatilidad en octubre de 2014 cuando se volvi\u00f3 m\u00e1s claro que la Reserva Federal ten\u00eda la intenci\u00f3n de elevar las tasas de inter\u00e9s en el 2015.De hecho, las pol\u00edticas federales de dinero f\u00e1cil hab\u00edan llevado a los inversionistas del mundo a buscar valores de mayores rendimientos, y los encontraron en muchos mercados emergentes de crecimiento r\u00e1pido. El dinero se precipit\u00f3 hacia esos pa\u00edses en busca de mejores rendimientos desde 2010 hasta 2013, lo que elev\u00f3 el precio de los activos.Pero, como se acab\u00f3 la era de los d\u00f3lares baratos, retiraron ese dinero y crearon picos vol\u00e1tiles en las tasas de inter\u00e9s y afectaron a las econom\u00edas emergentes.La tormenta en los mercados financieros ha tenido un impacto particularmente grande en el precio de commodities, incluyendo el petr\u00f3leo, la mas importante de todas en materia econ\u00f3mica.El precio de un barril de petr\u00f3leo cay\u00f3 de $60 d\u00f3lares a finales de junio a menos de $40 d\u00f3lares este lunes. Con el tiempo, ser\u00e1n buenas noticias para los consumidores en Estados Unidos y Europa, pero existen curvas complejas de retroalimentaci\u00f3n que probablemente har\u00e1n que la liquidaci\u00f3n de las commodities sea una causa y un efecto del gran p\u00e1nico en los mercados emergentes.Cuando los precios del petr\u00f3leo se desplomaron por primera vez en el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o pasado, hubo predicciones extendidas de que la ca\u00edda del precio har\u00eda que la exploraci\u00f3n petrolera se cerrara en todo el mundo, lo que ayudar\u00eda a mantener el equilibrio del mercado. En vez de ello, los productores estadounidenses mantuvieron la producci\u00f3n y la oferta en niveles altos, a pesar de los precios m\u00e1s bajos.Aqu\u00ed tenemos una curva de retroalimentaci\u00f3n: La desaceleraci\u00f3n en China y otros mercados emergentes disminuye la demanda. Las grandes cantidades de petr\u00f3leo disponible y la poca demanda dan como resultado m\u00e1s precios bajos y repercuten en condiciones econ\u00f3micas m\u00e1s d\u00e9biles para los pa\u00edses productores de petr\u00f3leo como aquellos en Medio Oriente, Am\u00e9rica Latina y Rusia.En el trasfondo de todo est\u00e1 una decisi\u00f3n crucial que la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos tiene pendiente. Los funcionarios de la reserva han expresado confianza en que la econom\u00eda nacional va por buen camino y que es momento de elevar las tasas de inter\u00e9s despu\u00e9s de casi siete a\u00f1os de mantenerlas cerca de cero. Podr\u00eda hacerlo en su reuni\u00f3n del 16 y 17 de septiembre.Los funcionarios de la reserva han indicado su determinaci\u00f3n de basar las tasas de inter\u00e9s en lo que sea m\u00e1s adecuado seg\u00fan el estado de la econom\u00eda estadounidense y no exagerar ante las fluctuaciones en los mercados. La volatilidad reciente pondr\u00e1 a prueba esa determinaci\u00f3n.Los mercados de futuros financieros est\u00e1n apostando cada vez m\u00e1s a que la reserva federal se abstendr\u00e1 de subir las tasas de inter\u00e9s luego de evaluar el da\u00f1o a la econom\u00eda ocasionado por las m\u00e1s recientes presiones financieras. El lunes, el mercado consider\u00f3 una oportunidad de 24 por ciento en el incremento de las tasas en septiembre, en comparaci\u00f3n con el 48 por ciento de una semana atr\u00e1s.Y el valor del d\u00f3lar en los mercados de divisas cay\u00f3 1,6 por ciento el lunes (medido por el \u00edndice del d\u00f3lar) cuando los inversionistas consideraron una mayor probabilidad de que la Reserva Federal mantuviera las tasas bajas por m\u00e1s tiempo.Por supuesto, la misi\u00f3n de la Reserva es establecer la pol\u00edtica adecuada seg\u00fan la proyecci\u00f3n de a d\u00f3nde se dirige la econom\u00eda y no de d\u00f3nde viene. Si los mercados siguen cayendo, los prospectos de crecimiento de Estados Unidos podr\u00edan estar en peligro. Por otro lado, la reserva no tiene por qu\u00e9 proteger a los inversionistas de los riesgos de una recesi\u00f3n.Y si los \u00faltimos d\u00edas nos han ense\u00f1ado algo es que los mercados globales estar\u00e1n a la espera de una reacci\u00f3n grande, sin importar lo que haga el banco central.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are You Smarter Than Other New York Times Readers?", "Date": "2015-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxYour mission is to read the minds of your fellow Times readers.This game is a classic one for many psychologists, game theorists and behavioral economists because it highlights the trouble that most people have in thinking more than one or two steps ahead.Many people may start by realizing that 50 would be roughly the average answer if everyone picked a random number \u2014 and then calculating that 33 is two-thirds of 50. But if everyone picked 33, then 22 would be the winning answer. So many people go one step beyond the obvious and give answers around 20 \u2014 or they somehow land there intuitively.The question is why more people don\u2019t keep going and say: Well, 15 is about two-thirds of 22, and 10 is two-thirds of 15 \u2026 and on and on. Eventually, we\u2019ll get to zero, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.Iocaine comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.For most people, k is a small number: one, two, three or four. It\u2019s just not natural for most of us to think multiple steps ahead.Examples abound in everyday life. Many people believe that it\u2019s better to sell a house in the spring, for example, because more buyers are looking then. But what really matters is the ratio between buyers and sellers. You\u2019d rather sell your house when your town has 20 buyers and only 2 sellers than when it has 100 buyers and 500 sellers.In a highly networked world, these calculations become all the more important. If Uber fares are surging downtown, Uber drivers who happen to be uptown need to think about whether prices will still be surging by the time they can get downtown. People using an online dating site need to think about the desires of their potential mates \u2014 and the strategies that the competition is using.But the best example is probably the stock market. As John Maynard Keynes noted, the goal in the stock market is not necessarily to pick the best company. It is to pick the company that others think will be the best company. In fact, it is to pick the company that others think that others think that others think \u2014 and so on \u2014 is the best company. He used a \u201cbeauty contest\u201d to describe this idea, after a fictional newspaper contest in which readers had to guess the most beautiful face from a gallery of faces.In the stock market \u2014 or the housing market, for that matter \u2014 people often struggle to think more than one or two steps ahead. That\u2019s a big reason that bubbles can form. It was true that a lot of dot-com companies from the 1990s were on to something new and important, just as it was true that housing prices rarely fall. But if everybody else decides that dot-com stocks and houses are a great investment, a problem can easily develop. The prices of those assets can rise so high that they\u2019re no longer a good value.The initial instinct wasn\u2019t wrong. The failure to think ahead was the error.It\u2019s a weakness we all have. The best way to combat it is to be aware of it \u2014 and push back against it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Week\u2019s Market Sell-Off May Not Be Such a Bad Thing", "Date": "2015-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsThe 3.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index on Friday culminated the worst week for United States stocks since 2011, and put the index 7.5 percent below its recent peak on May 21. Many global markets have performed even worse, with stocks down across Asia and Europe. And the price of oil and emerging market currencies around the world continued a decline that dates to last year.It\u2019s about time.That\u2019s not to minimize the losses investors have incurred, or to say that each of these moves can be completely justified by data, and certainly not to predict what will happen next week or next month. But if you step back just a bit, what has happened in financial markets this week looks less like a catastrophe in the making and more like a much-needed breather when various markets had been starting to look a little bubbly.Market commentators offer a range of specific explanations for the sell-off, including a drop in oil prices thanks to a global supply glut (which will affect the profits of energy companies and oil-dependent emerging markets alike), a slowdown in the Chinese economy that is becoming more apparent by the day, and a credit squeeze in other emerging markets. But those explanations, while accurate, are part of a bigger story.Markets have been priced for perfection, and we\u2019re getting some reminders that the world economy is far from perfect.The United States stock market, as measured by the S.&P. 500, is the clearest example. It fell 5.8 percent this week and is now down 4 percent for the year. But that only pulls the index down to October 2014 levels. Against a longer time horizon, the recent drop looks more like a trivial downward bounce within a consistent range rather than something more dire.Flat stock prices in 2015 mask what came before: a remarkable run-up in stock prices in the preceding half-decade. From mid-2009 to mid-2014, stock prices rose much faster than corporate earnings, or gross domestic product, or pretty much anything else you might think of as fundamentals.In effect, investors became more and more willing to take the risk inherent in owning stocks, so much so that they were willing to pay very high prices for shares relative to the profits of the companies they were buying a piece of. Thus, by definition, they were accepting low returns (low by absolute standards and relative to the very low interest rates offered on safer investments like government bonds).Just over three years ago, in July 2012, investing $100 in the S.&P. 500 captured more than $7 in annual earnings; putting the same money in a 10 year United States Treasury bond paid out only $1.55.In other words, stocks might have been risky, but investors were being compensated nicely for that risk.A mix of interventionist policies from the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and a global glut of investment capital have created a mismatch between the global economy, which has grown glacially, and markets, which have been on fire.The big question now is whether the fundamentals driving the recent sell-off \u2014 the oil glut, the emerging market strains \u2014 get worse or better. That matters a lot for businesses and individuals in China and other countries under stress, and for oil producers globally. But for the United States economy and even for most companies traded on American exchanges, it\u2019s much less clear that it should create a major hit.Consider that in 1997 and 1998, an emerging markets crisis rippled across East Asia and Russia. It turned out that 1999 was a blockbuster year for United States economic growth and corporate earnings anyway.In the meantime, the best response for most investors trying to grapple with the latest bout of volatility is to take a deep breath, appreciate the remarkable run-up of the last five years, and remember that if you panic at the thought of losing 6 percent of your money in a week, that money really shouldn\u2019t be invested in the stock market to begin with.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Josh Brown\u2019s company.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Defaults on Bond Payment", "Date": "2015-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuerto Rico defaulted on a $58 million bond payment on Monday, a risky move that seemed to intensify the pressure on creditors for broader debt renegotiation, but might also make future borrowing far more difficult.Whether Puerto Rico would make the payments was a subject of intense speculation among legal and financial experts for days as Monday\u2019s deadline approached. Although the island made a payment on the interest of about $628,000, it said it lacked the funds to pay the full amount.In a statement, Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, which owes the money, said: \u201cThis was a decision that reflects the serious concerns about the commonwealth\u2019s liquidity.\u201dPuerto Rico is carrying immense debt, in excess of $72 billion, that has raised serious questions about its financial future. Although it has come close to default before, the step on Monday was the first since it came under jurisdiction of the United States 117 years ago. The bank attributed the decision not to make the payment to a failure by the legislature to appropriate the money.But some big institutional bondholders are disputing the idea that a global restructuring is necessary and are warning that unilateral actions by Puerto Rico will cause disruption and pain on the island, similar to the dislocations in Greece.Now, though, the ratings are deep in junk territory, and many of those ordinary investors are facing a rough ride.\u201cThis is a first in what we believe will be broad defaults on commonwealth debt,\u201d said Emily Raimes, a vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Standard & Poor\u2019s took a similar stance, saying in a statement: \u201cWe believe the default signals severe liquidity distress, whereby Puerto Rico must now choose among which financial obligations it can honor.\u201d It also predicted other defaults were possible over the next few months.While Puerto Rico made some other bond payments that were due on Monday, attention in the financial markets was focused on the decision to skip the $58 million in payments due on about 20 so-called moral obligation bonds. Those bonds were issued by a subsidiary of the Government Development Bank for a variety of projects \u2014 including school construction and the creation of landfills.Although this particular type of bond does not carry with it a legal requirement for repayment in the absence of a budget appropriation, market experts said Puerto Rico\u2019s decision not to pay amounted to a default and left them perplexed about the strategy of paying some bonds while letting others lapse.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a kamikaze strategy,\u201d said Sergio M. Marxuach, public policy director at the Center for a New Economy, a research institute in San Juan.Mr. Marxuach said the government seemed to be hoping to attract attention in Congress, where a bill that would give certain public enterprises on the island access to bankruptcy court has been languishing. He predicted that Congress would do nothing for Puerto Rico before the August recess, and in the meantime the default would bring market turmoil and opposition.As of Friday, Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds over all had already lost more than 10 percent of their value from the start of the year, closing at their lowest point since July 2009 as it became clear that the government was unlikely to make the $58 million payment. J. R. Rieger, who tracks a broad sample of Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, said that he was concerned not just about the portfolio losses but also that the market for Puerto Rico bonds might now dry up completely.\u201cOnce a bond defaults, the number of buyers who are able to buy truly distressed debt is smaller,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWill there be enough buyers to sustain an orderly market in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds?\u201dIf demand for Puerto Rico\u2019s debt dwindles, the financial institutions that now hold its bonds will be unable to unwind their positions without realizing losses. The scale of the losses could vary widely, though, because Puerto Rico\u2019s total $72 billion of bonded debt has been issued by multiple entities, using a bewildering array of terms, repayment mechanisms, governmental guarantees and other features.Confusing the situation further, the bonds that defaulted on Monday were sold with a guarantee, in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit issued by the Government Development Bank.The letter of credit made the bonds look safer. It said that in the event the Public Finance Corporation failed to make a payment, a trustee for the bondholders would be able to draw the money owed them from the Government Development Bank.But as investors have prepared for the default, they learned that the bonds\u2019 prospectus does not describe this safety feature the same way the bonds\u2019 indenture does, leaving confusion about what it takes to activate the letter of credit, or whether the guarantee is meaningful at all.Officials in Puerto Rico have said that the bonds were backed by yearly budget appropriations, and that if an appropriation did not happen, the bonds would not be paid that year and the holders would have no legal recourse \u2014 in effect, there would not be any default to cure.Ms. Acosta said that $628,000 was available for a partial payment because that much money was left over from appropriations in previous years. \u201cThe terms of these bonds,\u201d she said, \u201cstipulate that these obligations are payable solely from funds specifically appropriated by the legislature.\u201d Market participants dispute that assertion. But they said on Monday that investors might have to file suit in a Puerto Rico court to get a declaration of default, and there was no guarantee that the court would issue one. Then Puerto Rico might be able to turn around and sue the investors, saying their accusations of default had caused it irreparable legal and financial harm. That could cast the overall debt in an unflattering light of Wall Street versus the people, possibly hardening the positions taken on other debts as the situation evolves. Investors in the bonds of Puerto Rico\u2019s big electrical authority have been negotiating for months on a consensual restructuring of its $9 billion in bonds, for example. It was not clear on Monday whether those talks could continue, given that lack of payment on the moral obligation bonds. Dwindling demand for Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds could intensify the island\u2019s mounting liquidity problems. Puerto Rico stands to lose whatever ability it still has to borrow at an acceptable price, and it needs more cash to continue normal government operations. As recently as last week, its officials were talking about possibly borrowing as much as $500 million.\u201cSince Puerto Rico is not a sovereign country, and we\u2019re not a state of the union, we\u2019re really in limbo,\u201d Mr. Marxuach said.If Puerto Rico were a state, he said, it would have the power to send its cities, school districts and other units of government into Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy. But as it is not a state, Puerto Rico has no such standing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Costs of Malay Supremacy", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Malaysia is in crisis. The economy is faltering and the government is floundering, struggling to explain away unprecedented financial scandals. Critics ascribe these problems to a lack of transparency and good governance, but these are merely symptoms. The root cause of Malaysia\u2019s current troubles is ketuanan Melayu: the ideology of Malay supremacy espoused by the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the party that has dominated the country\u2019s politics for more than six decades.Malaysia has a vast system of institutionalized preferences for Malays, the majority of the population, which grants them economic and other privileges over ethnic Chinese, Indians and other minorities. Although in place for more than four decades, these policies have failed to significantly help poor Malays. At the same time, they have created a grand quid pro quo between other segments of the Malay population and the UMNO government: For fear of losing their advantages, beneficiaries of the preferences don\u2019t hold UMNO to account when it falls short. Malaysia\u2019s affirmative action program was supposed to right a historical wrong. In 1969, deadly racial riots broke out between Malays and Chinese in several cities, and the country was placed under emergency rule. UMNO blamed British colonists for the unrest, claiming that until Malaya\u2019s independence in 1957 they had sidelined Malays and favored the Chinese in the economy. In 1970, the population of Malaysia was about 53 percent Malay, 36 percent Chinese and 11 percent Indian, yet Malays held only 2.4 percent of all shares in the stock market, whereas the Chinese controlled 27 percent (Indians had about 1 percent, with the bulk, more than 63 percent, in foreign hands).When the state of emergency was lifted in 1971, the government promulgated the New Economic Policy (NEP), giving Malays (officially called bumiputera) preferential treatment in all spheres of public life. Senior positions in the civil service were reserved for Malays. Special schools were established for them exclusively. It was decided bumiputera should control 30 percent of all corporate equity by 1990. Malay home buyers were entitled to a discount of 5 to 15 percent on new developments. The NEP was ostensibly designed to uplift Malays, but it soon became a means for UMNO to cement political support, creating a rentier system with dubious economic results. During the 1980s and 1990s, when Mahathir Mohamad was prime minister, major infrastructure projects \u2014 the North-South Expressway, the Petronas Towers, the planned city of Putrajaya \u2014 were awarded to Malay companies with ties to UMNO. A vast privatization program also multiplied connections between the party and Malay big business, as many public utilities became so-called government-linked companies, or G.L.C.s, tasked with representing and promoting bumiputera interests. Today, G.L.C.s are said to control about one-third of the capitalization of the stock exchange. They vastly dominate banking and finance, transportation, utilities, the oil and gas sector and retail trade. According to a 2013 report by the Asian Development Bank, G.L.C.s were stifling competition in many areas of the economy and deterring private investment. Yet even periods of financial turmoil have not convinced the government to rethink the NEP or dismantle the preferential economy. UMNO elites could not suffer reforms for fear of losing their own privileges or the support of other beneficiaries. When Prime Minister Najib Razak came to power in 2009, he convened a group of economists to devise a new economic plan. The panel recommended replacing the existing racial preferences with need-based policies that would help any Malaysian, regardless of ethnicity, at the bottom 40 percent of the population in terms of household income. After encountering strong opposition from within UMNO, Mr. Najib dropped the idea and instead established yet another agency, Teraju, to encourage bumiputera participation in the economy. Promoting Malay supremacy not only undermines government accountability; it makes for unsound economics. Take Proton, the national car project that was started in 1983. For years, a slew of tariff and nontariff barriers have been applied to foreign cars in order to keep the made-in-Malaysia Proton comparatively cheap. But Proton, the car, is of poor quality and its production has yet to reach an economy of scale. And Proton, the company, has asked the Malaysian government for some $700 million in subsidies. Yet Mr. Mahathir, now the chairman of Proton, argues that the state must continue to protect it because it buys parts mostly from Malay vendors and employs almost only Malays.Or consider companies undertaking I.P.O.s, which are required to reserve a set percentage of their shares for Malay interests. (The requirement used to be 30 percent; now, it is 12.5 percent.) These \u201cbumi\u201d shares have sometimes been sold at below market price in order to meet the quotas. According to a list of recipients published a few years ago, the stocks have gone mostly to people connected to senior government officials and politicians from UMNO. And in 2009 Mr. Najib revealed that only 2 billion ringgit of the 54 billion ringgit (about $12.8 billion at today\u2019s rates) in bumi shares allocated since 1971 remained in Malay hands. Market discipline, transparency and good governance are falling by the wayside in the name of Malay supremacy. And for what? After more than four decades of preferential treatment, many bumiputera businesses remain uncompetitive and rely on the government for their survival. Non-Malays are leaving the country in droves, undermining the economy\u2019s long-term prospects. Although the educational levels of Malays have improved tremendously, their median household income still lags behind those of all other ethnic groups. The pro-Malay affirmative action policies must be abandoned. The Malay Agenda is hurting Malaysia. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fox, Topping Projections, Reports a Tough Quarter", "Date": "2015-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Reporting its first quarterly results since Rupert Murdoch stepped aside as chief executive, 21st Century Fox revealed a mixed picture on Wednesday: Profits beat expectations, but were down nonetheless, as broadcasting trouble, lower movie revenue and higher sports costs cut into cable-affiliate growth.But Fox executives \u2014 including James Murdoch, the company\u2019s new chief, and Lachlan Murdoch, its executive co-chairman \u2014 did their best to strike a confident tone on a conference call with analysts.Addressing industrywide concerns about cable subscriber losses, James Murdoch said that, while certain 21st Century Fox channels are expected to experience slight declines, the total number of paid subscribers for the company\u2019s channels will experience \u201cgood growth\u201d both in the United States and overseas. In other words, new networks like Fox Sports 1 and FXX will grow fast enough to offset any erosion from more fully distributed channels like Fox News.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Still, John Nallen, chief financial officer, said the company\u2019s overall outlook for the coming year had darkened slightly, citing an updated view of the advertising market, sports costs and the stronger dollar.The cable division, the company\u2019s primary profit engine, reported operating income of $1.22 billion, a 1 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. Revenue increased 7 percent, in part because of higher affiliate payments for networks like Fox Sports 1, Fox News and FX. Advertising was particularly strong at the company\u2019s international channels, including the Star India networks.But higher sports programming costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates dragged down the cable division\u2019s results.Operating income at a different unit that includes the ratings-challenged Fox broadcasting network decreased 22 percent in the quarter, to $113 million, because of lower advertising revenue \u2014 ad sales declined 14 percent \u2014 and higher sports programming costs, including rights to Women\u2019s World Cup soccer matches.Fox\u2019s movie and television studio had operating income of $269 million, a 21 percent decline. The company said that more than half of the decrease was because of the absence of contributions from Shine, a reality television company that was rolled into a separate entity. The timing of movie releases also played a role; Fox did not have releases in the quarter that matched the 2014 debut of \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Thursday with an article about quarterly earnings at 21st Century Fox misstated the relationship of one of the people shown, Sarah Murdoch, to Rupert Murdoch, Fox\u2019s executive co-chairman. She is his daughter-in-law, not his daughter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bitcoin Technology Piques Interest on Wall St.", "Date": "2015-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost people still think of Bitcoin as the virtual currency used by drug dealers and shadowy hackers looking to evade the authorities.But the innovations that helped turn Bitcoin into the most popular virtual currency are now being viewed as a potentially enormous disruptive force for several industries, including accounting, music and law. Nowhere, though, are more money and resources being spent on the technology than on Wall Street \u2014 the very industry that Bitcoin was created to circumvent.\u201cThere is so much pull and interest on this right now,\u201d said Derek White, the chief digital officer at Barclays, the British global bank, which has a team of employees working on about 20 experiments that explore how the technology underlying Bitcoin might change finance. \u201cThat comes from a recognition that, \u2018Wow, we can use this to change the fundamental model of how we operate to create our future.\u2019\u201dFor people like Mr. White, Bitcoin isn\u2019t just a digital token to use for online purchases. Instead, many of the top minds in finance have come to believe that the software that brought the virtual currency into existence also enables a fundamentally new way of transacting and maintaining records online \u2014 allowing people and banks to directly exchange money and assets like stocks and bonds without having to rely on a long chain of expensive middlemen.A few banks have gone public with their work, but most of the activity has been happening behind the scenes. At one private meeting, held in April at one of the Manhattan offices of Bank of America, executives from more than a dozen large banks gathered to confidentially discuss how the technology underlying Bitcoin could be used to change foreign currency trading, the largest financial market in the world, according to people who attended the meeting.Central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have their own teams looking at the technology.\u201cA year ago, it was more of an idea,\u201d said Max Neukirchen, the head of corporate strategy at JPMorgan Chase. \u201cNow, it is a real opportunity. You test it and realize that this can play a big role in our thinking about how our own infrastructure will evolve.\u201dThis is a long way from the derision that many bankers \u2014 including JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon \u2014 expressed when Bitcoin burst into the public consciousness in 2013, when the price of a Bitcoin was bouncing around wildly in a speculative frenzy that was often compared to the Dutch tulip bulb mania.At the time, some large companies like Dell and Overstock announced that they would start taking Bitcoins for online purchases, but few consumers showed much interest in using the digital money to pay their bills, and the furor around Bitcoin largely died down.The institutions that are now becoming involved are generally not interested in selling goods for Bitcoins or owning the virtual currency. They are, instead, looking at the network and software that make it possible for Bitcoin to move around the world instantly, and almost free.Until now, digital transactions have always gone through some sort of central authority that can move the money and update the records on both sides \u2014 as PayPal and Visa do for many online purchases.The Bitcoin network, on the other hand, is run by a decentralized network of users who jointly keep track of transactions and update the records in real time, with no single user or company in charge. The records of all transactions are kept on a public ledger \u2014 essentially just a big, publicly available spreadsheet \u2014 known as the blockchain that is visible to anyone and has, at least so far, proven impossible to tamper with.Much of the work being done inside banks, and in other industries, is looking at whether the blockchain technology can be used independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which was the first thing to be recorded on the blockchain ledger.But the most intense work is being done by financial companies like the Nasdaq OMX Group, which has several programmers in Manhattan preparing software that the company plans to roll out this year.The Nasdaq software will allow the trading of stocks in private companies, like tech start-ups, on a new kind of blockchain. This will replace the existing system in which private companies issue and trade shares using paper certificates \u2014 a process that means that even basic trades can take weeks to complete.Beyond the immediate trial, Nasdaq is experimenting with several other markets in which blockchain-like ledgers could be used to make trading faster and cheaper. The work is being overseen by Fredrik Voss, who recently shifted from his work in the company\u2019s commodity division to become its top blockchain executive.\u201cWe believe that blockchain technology holds great promise in allowing capital markets to operate more efficiently while simultaneously providing greater transparency and security, all of which are fundamental to the public interest,\u201d Nasdaq\u2019s chief executive, Robert Greifeld, said in a July call with investors.Financial firms first began talking publicly about Bitcoin in late 2013. Back then, though, most of the attention was negative, focused on the speculative aspect of the virtual currency.But the banks have generally been less public about the work they have been doing internally with their own employees. At Citigroup, for instance, there are six different in-house experiments, building software that harnesses the blockchain technology, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s work. In one test, the bank has created its own virtual currency, Citicoin, that employees can experiment with.Aside from Nasdaq\u2019s project, there is much debate about where the technology is likely to gain its first real world use. At Barclays, some of the 20 internal experiments \u2014 most of them conducted at two Barclays offices in London dedicated to the technology \u2014 are looking at ways to use the blockchain to speed up and lower the cost of consumer payments, to compete with credit cards and direct money transfers.But bankers generally say that most of the work is aimed at changing the systems that big Wall Street traders and investors use to buy and sell sophisticated assets like syndicated loans and corporate bonds.Because any innovation in this area would require the cooperation of multiple banks, the banks have had joint meetings to discuss how they could work together, often led by outside start-ups looking to provide the software.One of the most advanced of those conversations has been coordinated by a start-up known as R3Cev that is led by a former Wall Street executive, David E. Rutter. R3Cev has put together models for how banks could trade foreign currencies on a communally maintained spreadsheet like the blockchain, according to people briefed on the project. It was R3Cev that convened the April meeting at Bank of America, which was attended by more than 75 people from 15 financial institutions, these people said.This can seem like rather esoteric business, but these are the markets where huge amounts of money turn over each day, and these markets influence the profits of the largest financial institutions. For instance, more than $3 trillion changes hands each day on the foreign currency market.For many bankers, the question is not if the technology is put to use but when. Mr. Neukirchen, at JPMorgan, is one of many bankers who expect that it will take a few years for the first significant use of blockchain technology to gain traction. Mr. White at Barclays expects it even sooner, in the next year.The prospect of banks capitalizing on the technology can be disappointing to early Bitcoin adherents, many of whom were drawn to the technology because it provided a way to move and store money that did not rely on banks.Many in the financial industry hope they can find a way to use the blockchain concept \u2014 what is often referred to as a distributed ledger \u2014 without using the blockchain associated with Bitcoin.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a world where that blockchain technology doesn\u2019t end up changing the way we think about asset ownership,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a top Nasdaq executive. He is Fredrik Voss, not Frederik.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Stock Still Looks Expensive", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAlibaba\u2019s stock price still looks expensive despite the recent sell-off. Less than a year after the Chinese web giant\u2019s record $25 billion initial public offering of stock, its shares are near their $68 initial price. Though macroeconomic worries have afflicted all Chinese companies, the company, founded by Jack Ma, is still highly valued when compared with rivals.Slumping Chinese stocks and worries about an economic slowdown are partly to blame. Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s index of Chinese stocks listed in the United States is down 16 percent since the beginning of the month.Disappointing results have helped to wipe $100 billion from Alibaba\u2019s market capitalization since its peak. Revenue for the quarter ending June grew at its slowest rate in three years. Investors and employees whose share holdings were locked up after the public offering will be free to sell next month, further weighing on the stock.Even so, the company, now valued at $165 billion, hardly looks cheap. Start by stripping out investments such as its potential 33 percent stake in the financial services affiliate Ant Financial. Based on Ant\u2019s latest valuation reported by Reuters, that stake is worth $14.9 billion. Equity investments in companies like the online video group Youku Tudou, the social network Weibo and the electronics retailer Suning add up to a further $12.9 billion. That implies investors value Alibaba\u2019s core e-commerce business at about $138 billion.Transactions on the company\u2019s shopping platforms will reach $502 billion in the year to next March, Barclays estimates. Assume Alibaba\u2019s \u201ctake rate\u201d \u2014 the proportion of revenue it captures from advertising or commissions \u2013 remains stable at 2.5 percent. Applying last year\u2019s operating margins and tax rate, Alibaba\u2019s shopping sites would generate earnings of $4.5 billion, implying a valuation of more than 30 times earnings.That is significantly higher than Alibaba\u2019s Chinese web rivals. Tencent, which leads in gaming and social media, trades at 24 times forward earnings, while the top search engine Baidu is at 20 times. Alibaba\u2019s dominance of Chinese e-commerce means it deserves some kind of premium rating. But a return to its post-public-offering euphoria looks unlikely.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Big Spenders Pull Back, as Stock Market Shudders", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of Hong Kong\u2019s busiest shopping streets winds past the Times Square center, under slick signs for brands like Mont Blanc, Cartier, Gucci and Burberry.But inside the towering luxury mall, the hum of the crowds below fades into the quiet of rows of mostly empty boutiques.A sales attendant greeted a few people outside a Chanel shop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you have to queue,\u201d she said, waving her hand toward a seemingly imaginary line of shoppers. But few people entered the store on what would usually be a bustling weekend shopping day.The quieter scenes at Times Square and other luxury department stores in Hong Kong paint a stark contrast to the fevered spending of recent years, when young, upwardly mobile Chinese seemed to have insatiable appetites for Chanel handbags and Herm\u00e8s scarves.After growing by double digits in the last decade, spending on luxury goods in China contracted for the first time last year to about $18 billion, shrinking 1 percent, according to the consultancy Bain & Company.On top of the market turmoil, moves by the Chinese government to devalue the renminbi and concerns over further rounds of devaluation cast a new pall on the luxury marketplace.\u201cThis is going to hit hard,\u201d said David Friedman, the president of Wealth-X, a luxury intelligence firm. Mr. Friedman, who is based in New York, added, \u201cIt\u2019s the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back for luxury brands that looked at the Chinese consumer as a driver of their revenue growth.\u201d\u201cIs the Chinese consumer still incredibly important to luxury brands? The answer is absolutely yes. But is the Chinese consumer over the next several years going to be the same economic juggernaut of consumption for these brands? The answer is no.\u201dThese jitters stem from how disproportionately global luxury brands have leaned on China for growth. Greater China drives as much as 25 percent of sales at Burberry, and 20 percent of sales at Prada, according to estimates by Exane BNP Paribas. The Swatch Group, whose brands include Omega, Harry Winston and Balmain, derives as much as 35 percent of its sales in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.Those percentages would be even higher if they took account of all the luxury goods that Chinese tourists snap up overseas, where items are often cheaper than in Beijing or Shanghai, where shoppers must pay import duties. According to Bain, nearly half of Chinese luxury spending occurs outside China.A weaker renminbi would make it more expensive for Chinese consumers not just to buy foreign luxury products in China, but also to travel overseas to cities like New York or Milan to buy luxury goods. A shakier economy and market turmoil back home would damp travel, as well as demand.\u201cThings are becoming more expensive, people are traveling less, and market turmoil is causing people to retrench and think about their luxury spending,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, a senior equity analyst in specialty retailing and luxury for Nomura Securities. \u201cSo you walk down Fifth Avenue, and you see emptier stores.\u201dStill, it is important to keep the effects of the market rout and devaluation in perspective, said Luca Solca, head of global luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. According to simulations run by Mr. Solca, a 5 percent devaluation of the renminbi would push sales down less than 1 percent at most global luxury brands he tracks, including Burberry, Herm\u00e8s, Prada, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and the Swatch Group.Even a 20 percent devaluation of the renminbi would hardly make a dent of 5 percent in those companies\u2019 sales, according to Mr. Solca\u2019s calculations.\u201cIt is often the case that markets react harshly to major surprises, a sort of \u2018Shoot first, ask questions later\u2019 approach,\u201d Mr. Solca said. \u201cThis looks like financial turmoil, not turmoil in the real economy. If it continues to grow, though, it will at one point have an impact on the real world, too.\u201dChinese travelers are drawn overseas partly by a hunt for value, she explained. Because of high tariffs, a Furla luxury handbag her firm examined recently cost $310, or 1,980 renminbi, with the steepest discounts available in China, but it sells for just a third of that price at the Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome.\u201cThe new yuan depreciation is not nearly enough to deter the very strong urge of Chinese shoppers to buy luxury goods overseas,\u201d she said.At the Tai Koo Li mall in central Beijing, a gleaming expanse of luxury retailers including Lanvin, Versace and Vera Wang, several shoppers shrugged off the recent currency moves.Xu Zijin, 19, a sophomore at a university in California, said she normally bought luxury goods in the United States because \u201cthe price is always very high in China,\u201d and she would continue to do so.For some brands, like Coach, which manufactures a majority of its handbags in China, a weaker renminbi could even be a positive, Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at the Cowen Group, said in a recent report. Gross margins at Coach, for instance, would benefit from lower input costs \u2014 especially lower wages for Chinese workers \u2014 if currency rates remained at their current level, Mr. Chen said.Andrea Shaw Resnick, head of investor relations and corporate communications at Coach, said it was still too early to project the impact of the weaker renminbi on sales trends.Still, \u201cwe\u2019ve been managing through exchange rate fluctuations for many years,\u201d Ms. Resnick said. \u201cImportantly, our sourcing of both finished goods and raw materials in the region provides some degree of natural hedge,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201dUltimately, the future of Chinese luxury spending \u2014 and who is able to attract more of it \u2014 hinges on longer-term shifts in global currencies, as well as economic growth back home.The eurozone and Japan have been bolstered by an influx of Chinese tourists, thanks to the weakness of their currencies, which have each fallen almost 10 percent against the renminbi over the last 12 months \u2014 even after the recent devaluation.The dollar, on the other hand, has strengthened against major currencies over the last year, and it is up about 4 percent against the renminbi from 12 months ago, despite the recent devaluation. The strong dollar is weighing on tourist spending in the United States; Macy\u2019s recently blamed dwindling tourism dollars for lackluster earnings in the second quarter.Mika Tsuruta, 25, an employee at the Japanese handbag brand Samantha Vega, sat smoking by an enormous robot outside the Times Square mall. She usually works in Tokyo but was sent to the retailer\u2019s Hong Kong store to train the staff in customer service.During her time in Hong Kong, she has noticed Chinese customers looking for a less expensive alternative to the big-name luxury brands, she said. Samantha Vega fits the bill \u2014 a handbag from the Japanese retailer sells for about 2,200 Hong Kong dollars (around $280), a fraction of the 25,000 Hong Kong dollars (nearly $3,225) a Chanel flap bag can fetch.\u201cThey say they are looking for something good, something cheaper,\u201d she said.Leo, an 18-year-old student from Jiangsu, in eastern China, about to start university in Hong Kong, walked around another lavish shopping center, the Landmark. He took photos through the store window of S.T. Dupont, gawking at the gold-embellished pens and lighters on display, and at ads featuring members of the British royal family.Leo, who wished to be identified only by his English name, insisted that the point of his trip to the mall was not to shop. The state of the economy and the currency devaluation worried his family, he said.\u201cIt means I need to spend more money on my studies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to buy too much.\u201dAn article on Thursday about slowing sales of luxury goods to Chinese customers referred incorrectly to the head of investor relations and corporate communications at Coach, who commented on the situation. That executive, Andrea Shaw Resnick, is a woman.Dan Levin contributed reporting and Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Starbucks Prices Went Up as Coffee Beans Got Cheaper", "Date": "2015-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesStarbucks isn\u2019t the place to go for cheap coffee. It is selling an experience, not a commodity.That approach has been immensely successful, drawing in millions of customers and propelling Starbucks stock to stellar returns. But the company\u2019s strategy has created an odd situation this summer: It has raised retail prices for much of the coffee brewed in its stores just as coffee prices on world commodities markets have fallen.The opposite is true, however. Coffee has been caught in a commodities downdraft that intensified briefly last week as China, a big commodities consumer, devalued its currency. The currencies of commodity producers like Malaysia, Indonesia, Russia, Colombia and Brazil have fallen for months now, along with oil, iron and steel. Coffee has taken one of the deepest dives.At the Midtown Manhattan store I frequent, a \u201cventi\u201d cup \u2014 20 ounces of joe \u2014 rose 10 cents to $2.55 before tax, while a \u201ctall\u201d 12-ounce cup stayed at $1.95. Tall cups rose in price in many other places, said Jim Olson, a spokesman. Prices for food remain unchanged. Over all, Starbucks said customer bills would increase 1 percent.In a statement, Lisa Passe, a spokeswoman, said Starbucks tried to \u201cbalance the need to run our business profitably while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers.\u201dIt may be succeeding, though as a customer who happens to follow financial markets closely, I was startled by an apparent disconnect between world events and Starbucks decision-making. Why should I be paying more at Starbucks when coffee has been getting cheaper?The company\u2019s ability to raise prices has delighted the stock market. Starbucks shares have returned 5.4 percent since July 6, compared with a 1.3 percent return for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. The company has outperformed over longer periods, too. Its shares returned 51 percent, including dividends, over the last year, compared with 9 percent for the index; over five years, the return was 412 percent for Starbucks versus 115 percent for the index.Starbucks has been growing rapidly and profitably, expanding while calibrating revenues and expenses. In a conference call with investors on July 23, Starbucks executives disclosed that they had already locked in the price for more than 80 percent of coffee supplies for 2016.Hamish Smith, a commodities economist with Capital Economics in London, said in an interview that a company like Starbucks \u201ccan\u2019t afford to be in a position where it will run out of coffee or will suddenly have to pay an unexpectedly high price for it.\u201dBut when coffee prices drop unexpectedly, as they did this year, these advance strategies can have some negative short-term consequences: It\u2019s likely that Starbucks paid more than the current spot market price for coffee stocks, which would be reflected in future financial statements.That\u2019s one reason Starbucks is on a different timetable than the broad market.Another is that coffee accounts for less than 10 percent of Starbucks\u2019s overall costs, Mr. Olson said. The premium Starbucks experience requires considerable spending on real estate and wages, and on extensive employee benefits, equipment, distribution and marketing, he said.And there may be another factor. Howard Schultz, Starbucks\u2019s chief executive, told investors during the conference call last month that \u201cmobile payments now represent 20 percent of all in-store transactions in our U.S. stores, more than double the figure from only two years ago.\u201d I use an iPhone app to pay these days: It\u2019s easy to transfer money without noticing the cost.Starbucks assumes that customers will consider the new prices to be reasonable, and maybe they are, if you considered past prices reasonable. In 1994, when Starbucks opened its Manhattan stores, it charged $1.25 for a small cup \u2014 then only eight ounces, known as a \u201cshort.\u201d In inflation-adjusted dollars, that would be $2.01 today, yet a short cup in Manhattan costs only $1.85. You have to ask for one specifically, though; a short is no longer listed on store menus. Still, if you are careful, you can spend less in real money than you did in 1994, even after the latest price adjustments.Meanwhile, Starbucks is churning out profits. Even if its prices aren\u2019t in sync with commodities markets, the stock market appreciates its timing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rising Anxiety That Stocks Are Overpriced", "Date": "2015-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewOver the five trading days between Aug. 17 and Aug. 24, the United States stock market dropped 10 percent \u2014 the official definition of a correction, with similar or greater drops in other countries.But there are reasons to question whether this was a quick, effective slap on the wrist, or if the market is still too overactive, and thus asking for a more extended punishment.The average CAPE ratio between 1881 and 2015 in the United States is 17; in July, it reached 27. Levels higher than that have occurred very few times, including the years surrounding the stock market peaks of 1929, 2000 and 2007. In all three of these instances, the stock market eventually collapsed.Ten percent drops in the S.&P. 500 in just five trading days \u2014 such as what we just experienced \u2014 have not been common. Out of the 29 corrections since 1950, only nine happened in five days or less. Most of those happened since 2000, possibly because of the Internet and faster communications. Such rare sharp drops are psychologically significant; an extreme one-day collapse seems to create anxiety that imprints on people\u2019s memories and could contribute to a downward momentum.Unfortunately, all this literature on momentum is not definitive for the present situation, since it is not so focused on the rare huge drops from very high levels that have characterized recent days. To get some hints about the outlook today, maybe we have to use a different method.There is a social phenomenon loosely called a speculative bubble that can drive prices, even occasionally for the world\u2019s stock markets, to high levels.The notion of a speculative bubble was seen for a long time as disreputable in finance circles, but it is gradually gaining acceptance. It takes a different view of the world, more akin to that of psychologists or sociologists.As time goes on, the stories justifying investor optimism become increasingly shopworn and criticized, and people find themselves doubting them more and more. Even though people are asking themselves if prices are too high, they are slow to take action to sell. When prices make a sudden drop, as they did in recent days, people tend to become fearful, even if there is a subsequent rebound. With the drop they suddenly realize that their views might be shared by other people, and start looking for information that might confirm their belief. Some are driven to sell immediately. Others are slower, but they are all similarly motivated. The result is an irregular but large stock market decline over a year or more.It is entirely plausible that the shaking of investor complacency in recent days will, despite intermittent rebounds, take the market down significantly and within a year or two restore CAPE ratios to historical averages. This would put the S.&P. closer to 1,300 from around 1,900 on Wednesday, and the Dow at 11,000 from around 16,000. They could also fall further; the historical average is not a floor.Or maybe this could be another 1998. We have no statistical proof. We are in a rare and anxious \u201cjust don\u2019t know\u201d situation, where the stock market is inherently risky because of unstable investor psychology.Advertisement"}

But by the end of the day, Apple and the rest of the market had yielded to the gravitational pull of investor fear.Investors are now trying to separate the fact from the fear, as they digest how China\u2019s problems will affect the rest of the world. And the process could make for some messiness in the markets, particularly in the United States, where investors have been lulled into a sense of security by a long bull run in stocks.By 2 p.m. Monday, Gregory J. Blank, an independent financial adviser based in New York, had already fielded nearly 20 phone calls from anxious investors. He handles assets for about 200 clients, a mixture of younger adults and retirees.\u201cThey see it in the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get worried. They call.\u201d Mr. Blank said that the older investors were more concerned, since it was harder for them to replenish whatever they had saved up for retirement. But the worst thing to do right now is to panic, he advises them.One retiree, a former secretary at a global investment bank, was among the concerned callers. \u201cShe started the phone call with \u2018Should we sell?\u2019\u201d Mr. Blank said. \u201cBy the end of the phone call, she said, \u2018Well, maybe we should buy.\u2019\u201dBut staying put is not always the best option for everyone \u2014 creating the sort of selling pressure that could add to the tumult.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.David Enrico, a 31-year-old model from Los Angeles, eyed the market with growing anxiety on Monday. Mr. Enrico and his wife are preparing to buy a home and are concerned about the short-term effects on their savings.\u201cI just saw this, and I got a little nervous because I don\u2019t want my nest egg, my down payment for the house, to be subject to the market volatility,\u201d he said.Mr. Enrico emailed Mr. Blank to make sure that he could liquidate his positions immediately if need be, but so far hasn\u2019t pulled the trigger.\u201cIn the short run, market sell-offs are limited by psychology,\u201d said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. The biggest risk here is that we all collectively lose our nerves at the same time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that enough of a frenzy will be whipped up that people could hunker down,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will happen, but that\u2019s the biggest risk.\u201dAdvisers and corporate executives are now trying to assure investors that a slowing Chinese economy isn\u2019t necessarily a big problem for most American companies.And Mr. Cook\u2019s comments, which were sent to Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money,\u201d did help Apple weather the worst of Monday\u2019s trading. After opening down more than 10 percent from Friday\u2019s close, Apple\u2019s shares quickly rebounded, helping the Dow Jones industrial average recover somewhat from an early plunge of more than 1,000 points.Like Mr. Cook, many Wall Street seers insist the overall data doesn\u2019t foreshadow an economic slump \u2014 or worse.\u201cValuations aren\u2019t stretched, and there isn\u2019t a general economic downturn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very tough to trade these markets, but that view applies to a much smaller slice of the population.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, China, while an important source of earnings gains for large American companies, isn\u2019t expected to tumble into the kind of outright recession the United States went through from 2008 to 2009. It just may not grow at the 7 percent that Chinese leadership is targeting.\u201cEven the most pessimistic observers think China will still grow by 4 or 5 percent,\u201d said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, a brokerage firm based in St. Louis. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have 4 or 5 percent growth in this country.\u201dShe said that the long, steady rise of the stock market this decade, with relatively few downdrafts, is only adding to the sense of panic now.\u201cIt\u2019s been four years since we\u2019ve had a correction like this, and that\u2019s a long time to go without one,\u201d Ms. Warne said. \u201cWhen stocks drop, it\u2019s always scary, but it seems more scary this time because we haven\u2019t had this recently.\u201dOf course, these explanations are cold comfort as ordinary investors watch their savings shrink. Still, some individuals, having survived the trauma of the recession, are showing a bit of sang-froid because of the fear that has overtaken trading floors from Shanghai to New York to Frankfurt.Margaret Matteson of Folsom, Pa., said she heard about the market sell-off on NPR as she was driving to work. She said she would only become worried if there were broader economic implications \u2014 she lost her last job in 2009 during the recession. The latest bout of volatility didn\u2019t make her nervous, but she said she was a bit puzzled about what was behind it.Ms. Matteson, 33, who manages a software database for an art museum, says she only cares if it affects her job. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it does to my portfolio,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to sit there for 20 or 30 years.

{"Headline": "Part of the Problem: Stocks Are Expensive", "Date": "2015-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarket TurmoilBut here is some different advice that\u2019s worth hearing during a week like the current one: Don\u2019t expect the next few decades of stock returns to be as good as the last few. Be prepared for a period in which market dips are not inevitably followed by bull markets that make the dips look like footnotes. Be prepared for something like mediocrity or even disappointment.Why do I say this? Because stocks can\u2019t boom forever. And the last 30 years, for all of their ups and downs, have mostly resembled one long boom. Stocks began rising in the early 1980s, and every market correction since then, including the financial crisis of 2007-8, has been quickly erased.As a result, stock prices today remain historically expensive, even after the declines of recent weeks. Stocks are more highly valued than at any point from the 1940s through the mid-1990s, relative to long-term corporate earnings.Why does this comparison matter? Stocks are effectively a claim on the future earnings of companies. When stocks are expensive relative to past earnings, it\u2019s harder for future earnings to live up to investors\u2019 hopes.\u201cYou can always think of reasons of why now is different,\u201d Mr. Shiller told me, when I called him recently to ask his view of today\u2019s stock prices. \u201cBut maybe the mind is too creative in thinking of how it\u2019s different.\u201dThat data series cannot predict the future of the stock market. Nothing can. But it has as good a record as any metric in pointing out when stocks seem broadly undervalued or overvalued. It soared above 30 in 1929 and above 40 in 1999. It fell below 10 in the late 1970s and early 1980s, before the long three-decade stock boom began.None of this means you should start selling your stocks. They\u2019re probably still the best long-term investment that exists. Just don\u2019t get fooled into thinking that they\u2019re always as good as they\u2019ve been over the last generation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hot Tech Start-Ups May Face a Long and Bumpy Fall", "Date": "2015-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisYet those anticipating a collapse in start-up land will probably have to wait. Any adverse effect on venture-backed companies is likely to be uneven and more complicated than a straight bust. Instead, the effect of a stock market rout is set to move slowly across the start-up landscape, creating a gulf between well-run companies with achievable business plans and those that were funded as part of the back-everything frenzy that began earlier in the decade. But once negative sentiment takes hold, a more widespread downward spiral could quickly unfold.The reason that there will most likely be no uniform start-up deflation is rooted in the pricing of private company stocks. The prices for start-up shares, which are closely held by small groups of investors, generally reset only when the founders go into the market to raise money. (In contrast, public stock prices rise and fall every day in response to a company\u2019s performance and market sentiment.)Over the last few years, start-up share prices have gone up nearly every time a private company has raised money. Investors were largely optimistic and generous because they assumed that a variety of factors \u2014 including low interest rates, a strengthening American economy and the growing Chinese middle class \u2014 would keep the markets positive. Spending more to help a start-up grow into a huge company seemed like a reasonable bet.It is only when companies absolutely need to collect new financing that the rubber may hit the road \u2014 that\u2019s when investors may want more reassurances that the start-ups can survive without the crutch of venture money to subsidize growth. If a start-up cannot provide those reassurances, or if a company has burned through all of its money from previous funding rounds without reaching agreed-upon goals, that could spell trouble.So in the immediate future, a downturn that spreads to Silicon Valley start-ups \u201cwill affect those companies that need to raise capital,\u201d said Matthew Rubin, the director of investment strategy at the asset management firm Neuberger Berman. He said it could take several months for a market collapse to affect the valuations of high-flying private tech names.Start-ups that cannot adapt to a world that prizes profit over growth may ultimately be forced to raise money at the same or lower valuation than in the past, something referred to as a \u201cdown round.\u201d Those can be debilitating: Employee stock options usually become less valuable when a company\u2019s valuation falls, making it harder to retain people. If a company has raised many rounds of capital, later investors often have protections that guarantee a specific cash payout or return on investment. In a down round, those protections are paid for out of the returns that would have gone to earlier investors and employees.A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.Venky Ganesan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures, said the phenomenon of high-valuation tech start-ups and a market awash in easy money encouraged companies to spend at breakneck speeds.Kevin Mak, the director of Stanford\u2019s Real-Time Analysis and Investment Lab, said financing was still readily available for young companies. He is also an adviser to a three-year-old commerce start-up called Massdrop that closed a $40 million investment two weeks ago.\u201cWe started the fund-raising process two and a half months ago when the market was falling, and it didn\u2019t have a major effect,\u201d Mr. Mak said. \u201cWhen and if we see the market fall 20 percent or more, it will filter through more. But it will primarily be the frothiness of the market coming down.\u201dIt is probably not a bad thing if some private companies stumble, since the start-up market lately has been like Lake Wobegon, a place where all businesses have been above average. Any venture capitalist will also say that the majority of start-up investments lose money and the few bets that pay off offset the losses. So it may be better to identify ailing companies, especially among the enormous $1 billion valuation club, earlier rather than later.\u201cLots of founders today weren\u2019t around in 1999, and they don\u2019t know a thing about financial markets beyond what\u2019s happened in the last 24 months,\u201d Mr. Gurley said in an interview. \u201cTo them that\u2019s how this game is played, money is cheap and everything goes up.

{"Headline": "Doubt Starts Chipping Away at the Market\u2019s Mind-Set", "Date": "2015-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameIn the stock market, until recently, just about any news was good news.Company earnings stumbled? Investors shrugged them off, sending shares higher. Economic growth was disappointing? So what.But now that is changing.But investors seized on the fact that demand for the iPhone and the company\u2019s new smartwatch didn\u2019t meet expectations. Apple\u2019s shares have lost 11.3 percent since then.The reaction to China\u2019s devaluation was even more telling. Instead of viewing it as a competitive tool to lift exports and stimulate growth \u2014 as was the case when Japan took steps to devalue the yen \u2014 global investors were rattled, fearing that it meant the Chinese government was convinced that its economy was in much worse shape than conveyed by official statistics.As investors absorb the meaning of these moves, they also seem to be opening their eyes to other market wonders that may prove ephemeral. The question is, Are we seeing signs of a sea change in investors\u2019 attitudes?Another example is the recent rout in shares of Keurig Green Mountain, the maker of specialty coffee and single-cup brewing systems. A former highflier that traded as high as $137 in January, the stock collapsed after the company warned on Aug. 5 that sales and earnings would decline this year. The shares lost 30 percent the following day and are down 62 percent year-to-date.Trying to plumb the mind-set of investors is always a tricky exercise, of course. But when one investment assumption is questioned \u2014 a perpetually strong Chinese economy, say \u2014 other bits of conventional wisdom go under the microscope too.Doubts may be creeping into the notion that companies with no earnings should trade at sky-high valuations. Some are starting to wonder whether corporate profits are being artificially elevated by share buybacks or other tactics.Then there\u2019s the biggest assumption of them all \u2014 that the Federal Reserve will always be there to save the day.An aging bull market often coincides with investors\u2019 starting to question these kinds of assumptions, strategists say.\u201cThis is the third-longest bull market in 80 years, and we are starting to see some deterioration develop,\u201d Mr. Stack said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cIf you look at market breadth, the number of stocks participating has been narrowing.\u201dEven as the Nasdaq was reaching new highs this year, for example, other indexes, including those made up of transportation stocks or utilities, were trading well off their highs. This divergence is not the sign of a healthy market, Mr. Stack said.Mr. Gannon noted that fully one-third of the companies in the Russell 2000 stock index do not earn any profits, the highest percentage in a nonrecessionary period. And through the second quarter, a majority of the performance in the Russell 2000 index came from companies that lost money before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, he said.\u201cThe laws of finance have been suspended for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Gannon told me last week. \u201cNow this is starting to crack. I think we are on a road to normalization.\u201dIf market sentiment is indeed changing, Mr. Stack is concerned that many investors may be quick to sell their shares in a swoon, amplifying a downturn. He\u2019s especially worried about two groups: investors who have bought shares on margin, using borrowed money, and those who have been pushed into the market in search of returns because of low interest rates.\u201cMoney borrowed to buy stocks tends to be nervous money,\u201d Mr. Stack said.Equally nervous may be the legions of traditional savers who felt compelled to buy equities to generate a viable yield on their investments. \u201cThe multigenerational low in interest rates has driven a lot of people into stocks who would not normally be there,\u201d Mr. Stack said. \u201cThat money could exit the markets quickly once rates start to normalize.\u201dAs an active fund manager who buys shares of companies with established operations and genuine earnings, Mr. Gannon says he is eager for a market in which investors behave more rationally.\u201cThis particular cycle has been affected by the actions of the Fed and the many unintended consequences of what the Fed has done,\u201d Mr. Gannon said. \u201cWe think we are at a point where that is beginning to change.\u201dDistinct market shifts are visible only in hindsight, of course. Still, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea to be watchful for them and for the profits \u2014 and losses \u2014 they may bring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "World Markets Jump as Investors Seek Signals in the Noise", "Date": "2015-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery major stock market in the world soared higher on Thursday, rebounding from the lows they had hit earlier in the week.Just days ago, when fear was palpable, stocks seemed to be signaling that the world economy might come to a halt. Yet by the end of the upswing on Thursday, investors\u2019 gloom had eased.In the United States, stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, have climbed more than 6 percent from the low at Tuesday\u2019s close. And after days of dizzying declines, Chinese stocks ended their day Thursday over 5 percent higher, after a last-minute rally. On Friday, the main index in Shanghai was up more than 1 percent in early trading.Bystanders were left struggling to understand the market gyrations. Do the pessimists have a stronger case than optimists right now? Or perhaps they are both right in certain ways, which is why even Wall Street pundits struggle at times to make sense of all the swings and apparent crosscurrents.At the end of the day, discerning the messages coming from the financial markets can be a fruitless task. \u201cThe market tends to whisper,\u201d said Kenneth J. Monaghan, a portfolio manager who focuses on high-yield bonds at Amundi Smith Breeden, an asset management firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of background noise that makes it harder to hear that whisper.\u201dAt the best of times, investors\u2019 mood swings can make stock markets hard-to-follow indicators that reflect as much ignorance as knowledge. But the action in the markets this week has been particularly confusing.The S.&P. 500 closed up 47.15 points, or 2.4 percent, on Thursday. It is now down 6.7 percent from its record high, reached in May. But on Tuesday, when the index closed at its lowest level this week, it was 12.4 percent off that high.At those lows, a bear market \u2014 when stocks decline 20 percent or more \u2014 did not seem out of the question. But after two strong up days, it seemed plausible that the six-year bull market that started in 2009 might now resume. \u201cWhat has happened the last couple of days gives you some confidence,\u201d said Philip J. Orlando, a senior portfolio manager at Federated, a mutual fund firm. \u201cIt was a little bit of a panic and an irrational move,\u201d he added, referring to troughs earlier in the week.The Dow Jones industrials average leapt 369.26 points, or 2.3 percent, to 16,654.77 on Thursday. It is now down 9.05 percent from its all-time high, which means it is no longer in a correction, the Wall Street term for a market decline of 10 percent or more. The Nasdaq, which contains a lot of technology stocks, was up 2.5 percent on Thursday. It was even a good day for the price of oil, which has borne the brunt of the bearishness over China and the global economy. The benchmark New York crude contract jumped $4.18, or nearly 11 percent, to $42.78 a barrel.Stock and bond prices are driven by things that happen in the real word, like corporate earnings and economic releases. During the selling, then, it was important to ask whether major economies and profits were really going to weaken considerably. After all, a scare about global growth last fall forced stocks sharply lower, only to rebound strongly in the following months.Plenty of problems exist in the world that could flare up and drag down global growth. China\u2019s economy, for instance, appears to be in a bind, underscored by what appears to be erratic policy making by its leaders. Those leaders have intervened to shore up the stock market, promote bank lending and loosen monetary policy. But such moves could stifle the role of market forces as the country aims to reorient its economy so that consumer spending plays more of role in driving growth.\u201cThe pace of monetary easing seen in recent months, and the relative lack of communication to explain it, has created the impression, rightly or wrongly, of an increasingly panic-stricken Chinese central bank,\u201d Christopher Wood, an analyst at CLSA Limited, a leading brokerage firm in Asia, wrote on Thursday in a research note.The pressure on developing countries is likely to remain. In particular, companies from emerging markets that have borrowed heavily in dollars may now find it harder to pay back such debts as the dollar increases in value against emerging market currencies. If economies in developing countries then slow, they might buy less from the United States and Europe, damping growth in both places.And if global market mayhem does weigh on growth, central banks like the Federal Reserve can step in to stimulate economies. Central bank interventions can provide some support and certainty to financial markets. After all, Mr. Dudley\u2019s remarks \u2014 in which he expressed less enthusiasm for a possible increase in interest rates by the Fed next month \u2014 helped set off the latest rallies in stocks.\u201cQ.E. has become the go-to policy response for central banks, but low productivity and heavy debt overhangs will continue to weigh on growth,\u201d analysts at RBS wrote in a research note on Thursday. But for all the skepticism about quantitative easing, it appears to have helped stoke stronger growth in the United States than in other developed countries. Or perhaps the bulls are right for now about the stimulus, and the bears will be vindicated when it finally ends.No one really knows when the stimulus will end, of course. Over the coming months, that means markets will most likely move unpredictably as investors interpret pronouncements from central bankers. Still, people who are not investing actively can be reassured by one thing: Recent history shows that short-lived stock market corrections that do not turn into bear markets typically do not cause businesses to stop investing and people to stop spending. Or as Mr. Dudley put it on Wednesday: \u201cThe stock market has to move a lot \u2014 and stay there \u2014 to have implications for the U.S. economy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the percentage increase in the Shanghai Composite Index on Thursday. It was 5.3 percent, not 5.4 percent. The error was repeated in a capsule summary.Advertisement"}

While a precipitous fall of share prices is worrisome, even after the recent market routs the Shanghai index is still some 65 percent higher than it was a year earlier, while the shares of China\u2019s small- and medium-cap companies remain among the most expensive in the world. Still, Chinese leaders appear determined to reverse the market declines. Some of their measures have been extreme and sweeping: a massive share-purchase program by the government, prohibiting sell-offs by major shareholders, banning new I.P.O.s, suspending trading of many shares, investigations into short-selling \u201cwith a malicious intent,\u201d and dispatching a public security official to examine trading records.The bull run started a year before the tumble in June. The Shanghai index was at 2,051.71 points on June 12, 2014, and it peaked at 5,166.35 on June 12, 2015. Before this surge, the most significant contribution of China\u2019s stock markets had been their irrelevance to the real economy. The Shanghai index hardly increased between 2000 and 2013 \u2014 except for 2007, the year of euphoria before the Beijing Olympics \u2014 while the Chinese economy grew rapidly, overtaking Japan as the second largest economy in the world. By comparison, the Sensex index in Mumbai quintupled in the same period, in a country that many consider an economic laggard compared with China.But during the bull run preceding the June crash, the financial sector became linked to the rest of the economy through the extensive use of margin trading \u2014 the practice of using borrowed funds to purchase shares. Margin debt increased fivefold during this period, and it was the singular force that fueled the market rise. Chinese financial regulators justified their recent market interventions on the grounds that defaults on the margin trades can pose systemic risks to Chinese banks. There is some merit to this argument, but the logic is similar to the one used by the boy who pleaded for leniency because he was an orphan \u2014 after he had killed his parents. The current mess is entirely due to the active encouragement by the authorities to invest in the markets and to lax regulations. Editorials in People\u2019s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, talked up the market, and regulatory authorities tacitly permitted the dangerous practice of margin trading. The fundamentals for the market surge were noticeable only in their absence. G.D.P. slowed substantially during this time, and many companies reported deteriorating earnings. The economy\u2019s overcapacity worsened, and Europe, an important trading partner with China, was mired in a recession. Yet the stock markets surged. This was not irrational exuberance; it was exuberant irrationality. People outside the small band of policy elite do not know why these leaders chose this course, but there is a long obsession among Chinese officials for impressive G.D.P. numbers. Maybe the statistical hawks gained the upper hand in arguing that anything short of miracle growth would be a disaster for the leadership. After President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang ascended to power in 2013, they wisely began to tone down the G.D.P. expectations by talking about \u201ca new normal\u201d \u2014 the notion that growth would be around 7 percent a year rather than 9-to-10 percent a year. This was sensible. After 30 years of supercharged expansion, the Chinese economy is much bigger today \u2014 and it is simply much harder to grow fast from a higher base than from a lower base. By 2014, China had picked much of the low-hanging fruit for economic growth, such as simple labor-intensive manufacturing and export processing. To transition to the next phase of growth \u2014 powered by technology and innovations \u2014 requires time, patience and, above all, economic and political reforms. Despite the new normal formula, the growth imperative returned. Between November 2014 and May 2015, the central bank cut interest rates three times and then another time in June to support the stock market. This liquidity injection, finding nowhere to go in an economy saddled with overcapacity, helped fund speculation in the stock market. In the short term, the market run provided superficial solutions to a range of problems brought about by G.D.P. slowdowns. Higher valuations make companies look less debt-ridden than they are in reality and, for consumers, rising share prices can make up for the losses of labor income and induce much-needed consumption.Rather than accepting a moderation of growth rates and deepening reforms, the Chinese leaders pressed on with a risky strategy of inflating and preserving asset bubbles as a way to show they still had the magic touch. The irony is supreme. One of the singular achievements of the Chinese leaders since 1978 is that they have moved the country away from the Mao era of government omnipotence by opening the country to trade, foreign investment, private entrepreneurship and to a capital market not fully controlled by the state. The Chinese economy boomed not because the state has become more powerful but because the state has become less powerful. Chinese leaders are often their own worst enemies. They suppress press freedom despite the fact that a free press is the best deterrent to corruption, an endemic problem that Mr. Xi has spent major political capital to combat. They arrest lawyers who check and balance the power of local officials, whose abusive behavior taints the reputation and the legitimacy of the central government. And they picked a mercurial and unpredictable institution \u2014 Chinese stock markets \u2014 to showcase their skills and know-how to deliver growth. By unleashing margin trading, the government has inadvertently imported the volatility of the stock markets into what many Chinese believe to be the pillar of stability and safety: the country\u2019s banking system. The amount of wealth lost \u2014 estimated between $3 trillion and $4 trillion \u2014 is simply too big for any intervention program to make whole. The biggest loss, however, is the credibility of a government that insists on being judged on the basis of omnipotent power it no longer has. Advertisement"}
