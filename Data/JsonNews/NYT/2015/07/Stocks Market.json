{"Headline": "How Iceland Emerged From Its Deep Freeze", "Date": "2015-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the financial crisis hit Iceland seven years ago, Gudmundur Kristjansson, a 55-year-old fisherman with a wide smile, weathered face and mischievous eyes, almost lost his business. Interest payments on his loans soared 300 percent. He had to sell his two fish factories and two of his five fishing boats. \u201cWe didn\u2019t invest for many years,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we were only paying interest.\u201dHis tribulations were shared by the whole country. After Iceland\u2019s three largest banks fell in the space of three days, the currency collapsed, the stock market fell 95 percent and nearly every business on the island was bankrupt.Short-term suffering followed, but today, Iceland is buzzing: Unemployment is 4 percent, the International Monetary Fund is predicting 4.1 percent G.D.P. growth for 2015, and tourism is booming. Mr. Kristjansson has just bought Nanoq, a used boat from Russia that recently was being prepared for a fishing trip to Greenland. But just as Iceland returns to the fold, Europe is again bracing for a financial catastrophe in a renegade nation. Greece, having missed crucial debt payments, has in recent days moved closer than ever to an exit from the euro. Leaving the common currency \u2014 and having to suddenly create its own new money \u2014 could plunge Greece into an even deeper economic downturn. The Greek people may vote for a deal with the creditors in a referendum that is scheduled for Sunday, and Greece and Europe may have announced the contours of a settlement before then. But even if that happens, uncertainty will hang over Greece for a long time, raising important questions about whether it makes sense for a country to go it alone, as Iceland did. Iceland is not Greece. As a tiny island with a population of 320,000, it was able to muster political will more easily than most countries. (Meeting the prime minister is no big deal to locals.) Greece has a population of 11 million, a gross domestic product that is $242 billion, or 16 times Iceland\u2019s, and a history of political antagonism and government corruption. The two countries blew themselves up, though in different ways. Greece, as a nation, spent too much; in Iceland, the private banks went on a bender that ended badly. But Iceland came out the other side of disaster in part because it had its own currency, which devalued, and it imposed draconian capital controls. If Greece ends up with its own currency, it would most likely descend into an economic Hades in the months after dumping the euro before even having a chance to emerge on the other side. Yet, even as Iceland is in the bloom of health, its comeback is about to be tested again. The government recently announced it would start to lift capital controls imposed at the peak of the crisis. Meant to last a few months, the controls have been in place for seven years, creating a shelter under which Iceland has mostly thrived. Their success, paradoxically, has made their removal all the more precarious.\u201cThey worked better than anyone expected them to work,\u201d said Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, the prime minister. \u201cBut they of course are not a sustainable situation for an economy.\u201dThe Aftermath of the CollapseTo say the case for capital controls was strong in 2008 would be a huge understatement. If the United States and Europe got drunk on easy money, Iceland was the guy at the party who was unconscious in the corner. When the Icelandic krona crashed in 2008, the country\u2019s three largest banks had assets worth 10 times the country\u2019s G.D.P. Eighty-five percent of the financial system collapsed. Iceland\u2019s banks got into the international banking business in a big way, despite having very little international banking \u2014 or regulatory \u2014 experience.At the same time, Iceland became a target for hot money. Because Iceland had high interest rates, international traders \u2014 and plenty of ordinary people \u2014 would borrow dollars at, say, 5 percent, convert them to Icelandic krona and buy Icelandic bonds paying 9 percent. They would profit from the difference between the 5 and the 9 percent. At the time of the collapse, the carry traders\u2019 positions were estimated to be 41 percent of G.D.P. Without capital controls, that money would flee, further depressing the krona. There was no chance Iceland could bail out its banks, so it let them fail. But first it saved local depositors by moving them to new \u201cgood\u201d banks. The Icelandic government, with the support of the International Monetary Fund, imposed strict capital controls, barring capital from leaving the country and prohibiting individuals from buying foreign currency or foreign stocks. As real wages fell 11 percent from 2007 to 2010, the government did not take a hacksaw to social services, but instead raised taxes and also offered debt relief to the country\u2019s mortgage holders. And Iceland did what no other developed country has seemed particularly eager to do: It jailed a bunch of bankers. When the banks collapsed \u2014 combined, the third largest corporate bankruptcy in world history in one of the smallest countries \u2014 shareholders were wiped out. Foreign creditors lost billions, but hoped to recover some assets. International hedge funds spotted opportunity and bought some of those claims, reportedly for cents on the dollar. As the economy improved, the claims \u2014 including positions in two of the country\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d banks \u2014 increased in value. That meant that the hedge funds effectively owned a significant part of Iceland\u2019s financial system.\u201cWe are the only country to let crazy hedge funds own our banks for seven years,\u201d Mr. Kristjansson, the fisherman, said.The capital controls caused a lot of other weird things to happen. Overnight, the central bank gained enormous powers over how money could be spent. Mr. Siguroddsson, the chairman of the electrical wholesaler, was in Japan with his family when his credit card was rejected because he hit his foreign currency limit. He had to call a special number in the middle of the night.\u201cYou have the feeling that there\u2019s a system watching you and telling you what you can do with your money,\u201d he said.Iceland\u2019s pension funds, which are nearly fully funded, were suddenly prevented from investing in new foreign assets; today a whopping 75 percent of pension fund assets are in krona-based investments. Overnight, homegrown private equity and real estate funds were born as a place to invest the rapidly expanding pot of local money. Individuals faced foreign currency limits. When Magnus Arni Skulason\u2019s son had a confirmation celebration five years ago, his son asked to invest his savings of $2,000 in Apple stock (the price was $32.50). \u201cIt\u2019s illegal, Jonatan, we have capital controls,\u201d his father recalled telling him. (The stock is now at $127.) There were, however, salutary effects to capital controls and currency devaluation. Devaluation made exports cheaper and imports more expensive. It became cheaper to travel to Iceland. And, if wages fell, Iceland did not face the crippling unemployment of many European countries. \u201cIn my opinion the last six to seven years have been an open class on the discussion of whether or not to have your own currency and what it means to be a member of a common currency that is not taking your economic situation under consideration,\u201d said Bjarni Benediktsson, Iceland\u2019s finance minister. But the capital controls also caused pain for businesses. Investors, worried about how the controls would affect them, stayed away. Foreign investment fell and is still only about 16 percent of G.D.P., far below precrisis levels. Mr. Kristjansson, the fisherman, wants to buy a new, more energy-efficient fishing boat. But he can borrow only in local currency at high rates, and most banks have not been keen on lending, hence the purchase of the secondhand boat. \u201cWe are losing competition with companies coming from the outside,\u201d he said. Mr. Benediktsson, the finance minister, sees that problem. \u201cWe are enjoying the longest sustainable growth period in recent history,\u201d he said. But the capital controls \u201care very damning for investment interest in Iceland but also very damaging to the real economy where we are losing opportunities.\u201d Paving the Way to Lift ControlsIceland is a place of stunning natural beauty. Visitors can hike down a volcano and across glaciers, and see Niagara-Falls-like cataracts. Since the financial crisis \u2014 and, weirdly, since the 2010 eruption of a smallish volcano that darkened the skies on airline pathways to Europe \u2014 tourism has flourished.\u201cWhen you enjoy the right conditions \u2014 lower exchange rates, more attention because of eruptions in Iceland \u2014 the stars align and things start happening,\u201d said Mr. Benediktsson. In 2014, tourism was up 100 percent from 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a much healthier place than it used to be,\u201d Gylfi Magnusson, a professor of finance at the University of Iceland, said, sitting in a cafe in downtown Reykjavik. The city center used to be peppered with banks and finance companies; now there are cafes and shops catering to tourists. Among Iceland\u2019s current concerns: Wage increases are expected to lead to higher inflation.Tourism has helped the recovery, but Iceland was built on fishing and power industries. Iceland\u2019s capital controls worked because there was a real economy underlying its temporary bout of insanity as a global banking giant. And Iceland was willing to prescribe itself tough medicine to repair its tattered reputation. \u201cThere was a consensus that they did not want to be seen as the village idiot,\u201d said Jon Danielsson, co-head of the Systemic Risk Center at the London School of Economics, and an Icelander. As the economy recovered, however, Iceland\u2019s capital controls became more and more of an albatross. Recently, after years of acrimonious facing off, the hedge funds and the estates came to an agreement that prepares for lifting capital controls. The government offered creditors the choice of taking a loss on their claims of about 3 billion euros, or 22 percent of G.D.P., by the end of the year. If they do not accept those conditions, they would face a one-time \u201cstability\u201d tax that is estimated to reach \u20ac4.6 billion, or 34 percent of G.D.P. It also put forward a plan to resolve the leftover carry trades. While everyone agrees lifting the controls is necessary, the settlement has also stoked fear about what life will be like on the other side and whether Iceland can survive with its own currency.The prime minister and finance minister \u2014 who are from different parties \u2014 say having its own currency allowed Iceland to save itself and stage a remarkable comeback. Greece, Spain and Italy, which use the euro, have not been so lucky, they note. Their adjustment has not been only through wage deflation, but also through job losses, which have proved more intractable. But others think the world is too global for an island nation of 320,000 with a free-floating currency. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy for us to keep our own currency,\u201d said Mr. Siguroddsson, the chairman of the electrical wholesaler. He advocates joining another currency, though he sees the struggles of Greece. \u201cWe need options.\u201d While the government hopes to lift the controls next year, individuals, businesses and pension funds will still face limits. Mr. Kristjansson, the fishing executive, is looking forward to borrowing money in international markets at lower rates, as in Norway where his competitors borrow at 1 percent. \u201cWe are fishing for the same mackerel,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slow-Motion Events in Greece and Washington Sway Markets", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks traded in an extremely tight range for nearly all of the second quarter as the world awaited two drawn-out events that seemed increasingly likely to occur: the first Federal Reserve interest rate increase in nearly a decade and a full-fledged Greek debt default.From the verge of historical highs, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index plunged in the last few days of June, erasing all gains for the second quarter and leaving it barely ahead for the year. The index ended down 0.23 percent, at 2,063.11.Like the S.&P. 500, the trajectory of stock funds changed abruptly toward the end of the second quarter. The average domestic equity fund tracked by Morningstar was down 0.13 percent. International stock funds did marginally better, rising 0.78 percent, in the face of lingering discord and uncertainty surrounding Greece. Owners of stock funds that specialize in Europe may have lost sleep, but they generally didn\u2019t lose money; the average one rose 1.97 percent in the quarter, helped substantially by weakness in the dollar, which increases returns on assets denominated in foreign currencies. The euro was especially strong, rebounding from a steep drop in the previous year or so. The rise in yields for bonds with long maturities sent the average long-term bond fund down 6.41 percent, with long-term government funds off 8.22 percent. The average taxable bond fund of any type fell 0.66 percent, and municipal bond funds lost 0.95 percent. Events in Greece took an unusual turn in the early hours of June 27 when the people who invented democracy decided to practice it in a way that unsettled investors. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum on whether to accept a proposal from creditors \u2014 one that was due to lapse by the time the vote was held last Sunday and that the creditors immediately took off the table \u2014 to provide further aid in exchange for further austerity by Greece.Greece emphatically voted \u201cno\u201d in the referendum, producing declines in stocks and fresh uncertainty about what would come next there and how far the repercussions might spread.A few days earlier, Greece had failed to make a payment to the International Monetary Fund, but as the third quarter began, it was hard to tell if the country had actually defaulted. That is because negotiations were continuing and default in modern finance has become more of a protracted process. The eventual Fed rate increase has become a process, too \u2014 or at least the preparation for it has. The central bank has been trying to make its intentions clear while Wall Street still devotes enormous effort trying to determine what those intentions are.One source of uncertainty is that economic activity has been so tepid that raising rates may seem unreasonable. But factors such as feeble productivity and an older population may mean that the difference between a moderately accelerating economy and sluggishness are not all that great. Against such a backdrop, bottlenecks in the work force and inflation flare-ups are possible with even modest pickups in growth, a prospect that may be spooking the Fed.\u201cWe\u2019re at the point in the recovery where overheat risk becomes an issue,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, part of Wells Fargo.In Mr. Paulsen\u2019s view, the labor market is already very tight. \u201cWe\u2019re at full employment,\u201d he said, \u201cand because the supply of labor is growing so slowly, even slowly growing demand puts pressure on prices and interest rates.\u201d The serenity and resilience of stocks for most of the quarter contrasted with weakness and volatility in bonds, even among putatively safe instruments like Treasuries and their German equivalents, known as bunds. The 10-year Treasury bond yield ended June at 2.35 percent, up from 1.92 percent three months earlier, and 10-year bunds went from 0.18 percent to 0.76 percent. Bond prices move in the opposite direction as yields.Mr. Paulsen, like many investment advisers, expects the Fed to make its first increase in September. There is also a broad consensus that when it comes to economic growth, slow is the new fast. But there are differences of opinion regarding inflation risk and how aggressively the Fed is likely to respond to it.Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, foresees a quarter-percentage-point rate increase in September and at every second monetary policy meeting after that through 2016, for a total of six moves.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the economy has less ability to grow than in the past,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cThe peak of the productivity boom is behind us.\u201dAs for what is in front of us, Fed officials are mindful of heightened inflation pressures, he said, but factors such as a strong dollar, which depresses the prices of imported goods, are keeping them subdued. He sees little reason for the Fed to start a full-scale attack on an enemy that remains out of sight. He conceded, however, that \u201cas the Fed goes further down the road and these tougher questions come up \u2014 that maybe the economy can\u2019t sustain solid growth very long without creating an inflation problem \u2014 they may have to switch gears\u201d and tighten policy rapidly.A worrisome inflation catalyst for some is accelerating wage growth. The unemployment rate, 5.3 percent in June, is at a seven-year low, and new claims for jobless benefits are hovering near a 15-year low.\u201cAssuming the data continues to be solid, particularly wage inflation, the Fed has plenty of foundation to move in September,\u201d said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock. He expects nevertheless that the Fed will take a wait-and-see attitude after that and that it has \u201cno preordained trajectory toward rates.\u201dWith both yields and pickings slim, Mr. Rieder recommends bonds issued in some of the less indebted emerging economies, such as India and Mexico, and intermediate-term municipal bonds. But he finds stocks better bets than bonds.\u201cEquities have been beneficiaries of the low-rate environment and will continue to be,\u201d he predicted.Mr. Harris of Bank of America agrees, advising a strategy heavy on cash and stocks, for which he envisions \u201ca couple of years of decent profit growth,\u201d and light on bonds. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to be in the bond market,\u201d he said. \u201cWait for yields to rise, then go back in. Risk is high now.\u201dIn foreign stocks, he likes Japan and Europe, prefacing his second choice with an immense caveat: \u201cif we get beyond Greece.\u201dTim Guinness, chief investment officer of Guinness Atkinson Funds, declared himself \u201cquite bullish about Europe\u201d as it emerges from a multiyear recession, and he finds Asia a better value than other regions, with one glaring exception.The Shanghai composite index of Chinese stocks rose 14.12 percent in the second quarter, although it had been up about 34 percent before a plunge that lasted through much of June. The market had more than doubled since the middle of 2014, supported by heavy central-bank stimulus as China makes the transition from an export-dominated economy to one led by consumer demand.As that continues, the pace of economic growth will diminish, much as it did in Japan in the 1970s, when the same evolution occurred, Mr. Guinness said. Japanese stocks soared through the 1980s, even as growth slowed, he noted, and he expects further gains for China, too, after it corrects a bit more to ease speculative froth.It is speculation in American stocks that concerns Brian D. Singer, manager of the William Blair Macro Allocation fund. He calls the diminished price swings this year, combined with heavy borrowing and ultraloose monetary policy, \u201ca recipe for disaster.\u201d If interest rates were not being depressed by the Fed, fair values for stocks would be nearly 15 percent lower than they are, he estimated.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inappropriate risk-taking,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cAs we look out, our uncertainty is growing. We have less risk in our portfolios than at any time in the last four years.\u201dHe prefers stocks in Europe and emerging markets, and, like many of his peers, he is avoiding bonds. Some of his biggest bets, he added, are in currencies. He is short the euro, Swiss franc and Australian dollar and long the yen and Southeast Asian currencies.Mr. Paulsen of Wells Fargo likewise foresees a 15 percent decline in American stocks as the adjustment is made to a climate of rising rates and mediocre economic growth. He suggested that investors who wanted to endure the decline own a mix of economically sensitive sectors, including energy, materials and heavy industrials, and defensive ones like consumer staples and utilities.\u201cI think we will have a correction before we regroup and have another buy-and-hold run,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Stock Market Plunge in China Dents Communist Party\u2019s Stature", "Date": "2015-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Yu Xilin was obsessing on China\u2019s plummeting stock market when he tumbled off his bicycle. But the accident did not sway his focus. While recovering in the hospital on Thursday from surgery for a broken ankle and shoulder, he was using his smartphone to track his shares.\u201cThe government departments that are supposed to be monitoring the stock market aren\u2019t doing their job properly,\u201d Mr. Yu, 55, the director of a provincial cultural exchange office, said by phone from his hospital bed in the northwestern city of Xi\u2019an. \u201cThis will affect the image of our leaders. Investors are very upset.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the falling stock,\u201d said Kerry Brown, director of the China Studies Center at the University of Sydney in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s about the falling political credibility.\u201dBut since the market began to slide, with the main Shanghai index losing 32 percent of its value over three and a half weeks, the two leaders have been silent on the subject.Even if regulators reverse the fall, an effort that could in turn distort market forces, the government\u2019s muddled response has raised questions about Mr. Xi\u2019s authority and judgment.The giddiest investors, including those who took on debt to buy stock, are wondering if they can recover their fortunes. Some have posted notices on property rental and sales websites saying they need to sell their homes quickly to raise cash.Even bystanders who stayed out of the market are asking, if a mere market correction could rattle the government, what might happen during a serious downturn? At stake is not only the stability of China\u2019s economy, but also faith in Mr. Xi and his colleagues.\u201cThis undercuts the confidence of the rising Chinese bourgeoisie,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cFor this leadership, they\u2019ve got to keep the emerging aspiring urban Chinese middle class on side.\u201dThough the craze for stock speculation spread far across China in the last year, sweeping up retirees and even villagers, much of the investment came from urban professionals and white-collar workers looking for more productive ways to increase their savings.Under Mr. Xi, the government has urged households to invest in the stock market to meet several economic imperatives: to generate more capital for state-run companies being weaned off bank loans, to strengthen the private companies that create many of the country\u2019s jobs, and to lift the confidence of consumers so that they will play a bigger role in driving economic growth.Moreover, editorials in China\u2019s state-run news media celebrated the rising indexes as affirmation of Mr. Xi\u2019s recipe for national strength: a measured easing of state controls on the economy while keeping political power firmly in the hands of the party elite.\u201cWhat\u2019s a bubble? Tulips and Bitcoins are bubbles,\u201d the author, Wang Ruoyu, wrote, scoffing at warnings that the Chinese stock markets were bound to burst. He expressed confidence in the long-term prospects of the common stocks known as A Shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.\u201cIf A Shares are seen as the bearers of the Chinese Dream, then they contain massive investment opportunities,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Yu, the investor in Xi\u2019an, said he had begun buying stocks last year on the advice of friends and colleagues and because he \u201chad been hearing good news, positive news about the big state-owned enterprises.\u201dThe Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.\u201cI was surprised that despite the positive news, the market went down,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not just a little bit surprised. I was shocked.\u201dSince last year, Mr. Yu had poured nearly $90,000 into Chinese stocks, about one-third of his savings, and as of Thursday, his investments were worth about half that amount.A friend of his, Si Kaibao, 45, a construction entrepreneur, said his stock investments had lost 75 percent of their value since the peak last month. He said he wanted to quit investing until the rules and the system were more stable.\u201cI feel that our stock market is not up to standard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really investing. It\u2019s more like risk taking.\u201dGao Yike, 25, an investor and an employee at a real estate company in Harbin, blamed the market fall on \u201cthe state\u2019s inadequate regulation.\u201dHe said investors were like \u201ctrapped prisoners,\u201d and government policies had been useless. \u201cThe bull market was itself a policy-driven one, so only major policies can save it,\u201d he said.People inside and outside China are awaiting the next steps taken by Mr. Xi and Mr. Li, the prime minister.\u201cI am sure there must be arguments within the leadership as to how far to allow the stock market bubble to deflate before pulling out the stops to prevent a major meltdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a governing system that has well-developed regulatory capabilities, and there are a lot of areas in which information available to the leaders is very incomplete or distorted.\u201dEven if the market were to stabilize, many casual investors would be too shaken to invest again soon in stocks, said Xu Yang, a Shanghai resident who lives off his investments in stocks and securities. \u201cThe loss might be a paper loss, but that still hurts,\u201d he said.Yet there are those who still see the stock market as the best investment, given low interest rates at banks and the huge amount of capital needed to buy property in many cities.Song Tairan, 25, an employee at an Internet company in Beijing who lost 20 percent of a first-time $16,000 investment he made in March, said he was still in.\u201cI\u2019m not anxious anymore because I\u2019m used to the tumbling now,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to invest again. The whole situation seems to be improving. I\u2019m bullish on the stock market.\u201dEdward Wong reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe latest pharmaceutical industry acquisition attempt leaves lots of room to grow. Horizon Pharma\u2019s $1.75 billion unsolicited offer for its American rival Depomed continues the sector\u2019s deal-making trend, fed by tax savings and cost cuts. Horizon is a relatively recent arrival on the scene, though, and its low debt load and small size mean it could easily expand.The market capitalization of Horizon is only $5 billion, so a Depomed acquisition would make a huge difference to its business. Larger rivals like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which is worth $76 billion, and Allergan, worth $120 billion, would need many more deals or much bigger ones to match that level of growth.Horizon\u2019s balance sheet is also fairly clean. The company has about $900 million in debt, excluding a bond that will probably be converted into equity. That makes growing by acquiring companies even more attractive. There\u2019s a limit to leverage, though. Valeant is nearing it, with about $30 billion in debt, or about six times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as the management defines the term. Horizon\u2019s corresponding multiple is about half that.No wonder Horizon is outperforming its bigger brethren. Its shares have increased in value about sevenfold since it began its deal binge in late 2013. The shares of Valeant and Allergan have roughly doubled in price during that period.This deal is far from done, though. There\u2019s plenty of potential for cost cuts, a lower tax rate and the refinancing of Depomed\u2019s $575 million in debt paying a huge 10.75 percent interest rate, but the target is resisting. Depomed argues that its high growth rate means the acquisition price\u2019s 42 percent premium is too low. And the company may see excessive risk in the bid, which is all in stock.The merger party may also be flagging. Horizon shares fell 4 percent on news of the offer before recovering somewhat, perhaps reflecting fears that the company would be overpaying. Last year, the majority of deal announcements lifted acquirers\u2019 stocks.A cooling of investor enthusiasm could, of course, spell trouble for even small acquisition machines like Horizon. So far, though, it seems well positioned for even more transactions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small, but Still Strong", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an aging bull market, when investors worry that a downturn may be near, safety often trumps speculation.At that stage, \u201cthe playbook says you want stable companies with reliable earnings,\u201d said Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer for Westwood Holdings Group. Those companies tend to be multinationals, not small companies, which tend to dominate early in a bull market.Six years after this bull market\u2019s start, it might seem that we are already at that advanced stage.Yet as talk of a Federal Reserve rate increase began heating up this spring, shares of small companies somehow found a second wind. The average fund that specializes in small, growth-oriented stocks gained 1.9 percent in the quarter that ended June 30. By contrast, the typical growth fund that focuses on blue-chip shares gained just 0.7 percent. Over the last 12 months, the average small-cap growth fund has returned nearly 10 percent. Many small stocks are up much more, including the biotech firm Immunogen; Sequential Brands Group, which recently announced the acquisition of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia; and the shoe company Skechers.It\u2019s not just in the United States; funds that focus on small and midsize companies abroad gained nearly 4 percent in the second quarter, more than twice the gains for international blue-chip stock funds.Is this a sign of renewed greed and euphoria among investors who believe the bull market is still in its infancy? Not exactly, market strategists say.Overseas, the catalyst for small stocks seems obvious. Unlike the Fed, many central banks overseas are still cutting rates and the foreign small-cap rally is a response, Mr. Freeman says. He added that this was similar to what drove small stocks higher domestically in 2009 and 2010, after the Fed began its first round of so-called quantitative easing to jump-start growth.In the United States, the reasons behind the small-stock resurgence are a bit more complicated. Part of it is psychological.\u201cThe rotation back into small caps reflects, among other things, a sense that while the Fed may start to tighten monetary policy a bit, it\u2019s not in any rush,\u201d said John Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer at Osterweis Capital Management. This explains why the fear of last year \u2014 when small stocks gained 5 percent, less than half what the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index of blue-chip stocks returned \u2014 was dissipating, he said.But emotions aren\u2019t the only drivers. \u201cIn this slow-growth economic environment, investors seem to be gravitating toward those areas that have been showing stronger earnings,\u201d said Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. And small stocks have been the winners when it comes to profit growth.The consensus forecast is that profits among blue-chip companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index will grow less than 1 percent in 2015, down from 8 percent in 2014. Yet corporate earnings for companies in the S.&P. 600 index of small companies are expected to climb 13 percent this year and 32 percent in 2016.\u201cLarge stocks collectively have a greater exposure to energy and less in financials\u201d compared with small-cap shares, Mr. Freeman said.And this year, energy stocks are expected to endure a 55 percent decline in profits versus 2014, while financial shares are forecast to increase 11 percent.Another reason small companies have been doing well is that they generate a disproportionate amount of their business in the United States, while larger companies tend to be multinationals.Over the last year, the dollar has appreciated more than 20 percent against a basket of foreign currencies, which has crimped profits for multinationals. This is a headwind that small companies \u2014 such as Investors Bancorp, a regional bank, or HealthSouth, a health services provider \u2014 aren\u2019t facing to the same degree.But even if the fundamentals are sound, aren\u2019t these shares expensive?Some strategists think so. Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, looks at valuations based on the last five years of averaged, or \u201cnormalized,\u201d profits. By that measure, he says, small stocks are trading at a 24 percent premium to large stocks even though they\u2019ve historically traded at roughly the same five-year normalized P/E ratios.To be sure, just a year ago the P/E of small stocks was a record 41 percent higher than for blue chips, Mr. Ramsey said. So compared with then, small stocks look more attractive today.\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a speculative, frothy thing going on,\u201d said James R. Margard, co-manager of the Rainier Small/Mid Cap Equity Fund. He added that small and large stocks have posted near identical gains over the past two years.Also, Mr. Margard noted that small stocks tended to outperform blue chips when interest rates rose. Since 1979, small caps beat the S.&P. 500 in seven of 10 periods in which yields on 10-year Treasuries have risen consistently for six months.So far this year, 10-year Treasury yields have been climbing for about five months.Mr. Margard\u2019s confidence is rooted in his belief that the economic recovery still has legs. He added: \u201cThis has been a slower economic recovery, which points to a longer bull market.\u201d The performance of small stocks for the next several months may tell us whether Mr. Margard is right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Shares Tumble Again", "Date": "2015-07-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 After several weeks of relative calm, tumult returned to China\u2019s stock markets on Monday, casting doubt on the government\u2019s measures to support share prices.While the volatility follows a spate of weak economic data, it also reflects a broader uncertainty in the market. Investors, who borrowed heavily to buy shares during the boom, are now increasingly unsettled.The situation is creating wild swings in both directions.The main Shanghai share index plunged 8.5 percent on Monday, its steepest one-day drop in eight years. Shenzhen\u2019s main index fell 7 percent. The volatility continued on Tuesday morning, with Shanghai stocks opening down 4.4 percent before recovering somewhat. Even stocks that had been strong performers in the recent, government-backed rebound were hit hard.State-owned PetroChina, the country\u2019s biggest oil producer, fell 9.6 percent on Monday. Government-backed brokerage houses, which had in recent months raised billions of dollars by selling new shares, also suffered. Citic Securities and Haitong Securities fell by the limit of 10 percent.It is a turbulent time for the Chinese markets.For more than a year, the country\u2019s stock market soared as investors aggressively borrowed money to buy shares. The government helped fuel the boom, promoting the potential for the bull market and new companies in official news outlets, including The People\u2019s Daily.At their peak in June, the total market value of China\u2019s publicly traded stocks briefly surpassed $10 trillion, second only to the United States. Tens of millions of ordinary Chinese opened new accounts to try to cash in.The markets started to turn in late June as investors grew concerned about a potential bubble. Shares lost more than $3 trillion in a matter of weeks.Worried about the fallout, the government moved aggressively to prop up stocks. Authorities suspended initial public offerings, introduced a $120 billion market stabilization fund backed by the central bank, and encouraged executives to buy company shares.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.The moves helped restore confidence in the market. Shares, particularly in big state-backed companies, rebounded modestly.But investors are increasingly sensitive. Monday\u2019s drop came after the Chinese economy showed increased signs of weakness; industrial profits fell and the factory sector slipped.Any sustained volatility in the market could create additional pressures to sell.Investors in China borrowed heavily from brokerage firms in recent months to invest in stocks. With share prices now falling again, investors may be forced to unwind some of these so-called margin trades to repay what they borrowed, prompting further pain in the markets.Analysts at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group suggested that might be happening now, writing in a Monday evening research note that sales of shares to pay off such loans had led to the day\u2019s heavy sell-off. \u201cSince the securities regulator is still tightening up such activities, the stock market will continue to be very volatile despite the high-profile rescue package launched by the government in the past few weeks,\u201d they added.Should the decline persist, the government may be forced to act further to support prices. For example, Beijing could pump more money into the market, either directly or indirectly.Officials have signaled their willingness to continue stabilization measures. On Monday, the China Securities Finance Corporation, a government agency that lends money to brokerage houses, said it would continue buying stocks to help prop up the market, according to the state news agency Xinhua. The China Securities Regulatory Commission is also investigating whether several listed companies sold shares counter to the government\u2019s edict, Xinhua said.Last week, the China Securities Regulatory Commission denied a report in Caijing, a respected Chinese financial news outlet, which had said the regulator was considering how to begin removing its supports for share prices.In a July 20 statement, Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesman for the regulator, said: \u201cThe commission will continue to stabilize the market and provide reassurance, and will use all its resources working toward the goal of preventing systemic risk.\u201dCaijing promptly removed the article from its website.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford\u2019s Profits Jump 44%, Soaring Past Forecasts", "Date": "2015-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe automaker, based in Dearborn, Mich., said that strong sales of sport utility vehicles and trucks helped power the earnings \u2014 a feat accomplished even as sales of Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup, one of the most popular vehicles in America, have taken a hit as the company struggles to meet demand.Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, in a conference call on Tuesday, called it \u201cone of the strongest quarters in our recent history.\u201d In the first quarter, earnings had declined over the previous year.\u201cWe\u2019re now more confident than ever that we\u2019ll deliver a breakthrough year,\u201d said Mr. Fields, who took over the top job last year.Shares of Ford closed up nearly 2 percent.Mr. Fields and Bob Shanks, Ford\u2019s chief financial officer, were peppered with questions about the new mostly aluminum-bodied F-150, which required extensive retooling at two factories that resulted in production delays this year. Sales of the F-series fell 9 percent last month in the United States, and market share for the trucks also fell by five percentage points.The executives said the F-150 was now being assembled at \u201cfull production\u201d speed, and they promised that the company would achieve \u201cnormal\u201d levels of inventory on dealers\u2019 lots by the end of the third quarter.Mr. Fields also responded to reports this month that some Ford dealers were offering discounts of more than $10,000 on high-end versions of the aluminum F-150 in an attempt to lift sales volume.\u201cIncentives and rebates are a normal part of the competitive environment,\u201d Mr. Fields said, adding that some dealers associations had decided to add their own discounts on top of Ford\u2019s own offerings. He said that supply, not demand, was the more pressing issue in ramping up the F-150\u2019s sales \u2014 a problem that would be fixed in the third quarter.\u201cWith Ford it always comes down to the F-150, which remains the automaker\u2019s lifeblood,\u201d said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.Mr. Brauer said that until the F-150\u2019s challenges were resolved, Ford\u2019s revenue, profits and market share \u201cwill be handicapped,\u201d holding back the truck\u2019s potential to be a huge moneymaker for the company.Ford said on Tuesday that it predicted higher profits in the second half of the year compared with the first, partly because the new F-150s were more accessible for consumers. It reaffirmed its estimate that its pretax profit for 2015 as a whole would end up between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2014.The company, which reported a quarterly pretax profit of $2.4 billion, significantly improved its ability to turn each dollar of sales into profit. That measure, known as operating margin, rose to 7.2 percent, compared with 6.6 percent in the quarter a year earlier. That helped Ford generate greater earnings even though its overall revenue was essentially flat compared with a year ago.Ford\u2019s North American revenue increased to $23.3 billion, from $21.2 billion in the quarter last year.While the North American and Asian divisions performed well for the company, Ford continued to have trouble in South America. Profits for the Middle East and Africa also fell, and Europe was essentially flat for the quarter.Ford\u2019s strong performance was all the more striking because it about doubled the second-quarter profits announced by General Motors last week.Brian A. Johnson, an industry analyst with Barclays, said in a research note on Tuesday that despite Ford and G.M. delivering strong quarters, investors\u2019 current view of automakers is \u201cquite soft, ranging from somewhere between apathy and skepticism.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately in this market, as we\u2019ve seen with other stocks in our space, perception is reality,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote, adding that the second-quarter results simply might not be \u201cenough to overcome investor concern of a U.S. peak and headwinds in China.\u201dBoth companies, along with Fiat Chrysler, recently began negotiations with union officials at the United Automobile Workers on a new contract to succeed the current agreement that expires in September.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Town That Chased Away Starbucks Sees Its Identity Being Endangered Again", "Date": "2015-07-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKATONAH, N.Y \u2014 A hamlet that looks as though it would fit neatly into a model-train layout at Christmastime is battling once again to sustain its small-town character against the relentless march of the large chain stores.CVS has had a small outpost here for months, but the company wants to close it and open one nearly twice the size \u2014 6,928 square feet \u2014 in the same shopping center.Opponents have collected 1,400 petition signatures online and have carried picket signs along the main street, unusual for the low-key community. Kate Galligan, an organizer of the petition drive, said that while she did \u201cnot want to be Mayberry about it,\u201d she cherished the independently owned, quirky stores that give Katonah its distinct personality.\u201cIt\u2019s like the death of so many small towns,\u201d said Ms. Galligan, 46, an SAT tutor and mother of four who moved here from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, 12 years ago in search of a place that was not classically suburban. \u201cOne comes in and then another and the town become generic. You go to East Hampton now and you might as well be in a high-end mall.\u201dBedford\u2019s reaction may have come too late to derail CVS\u2019s plans. The company applied for a building permit on June 18, and Joel H. Sachs, a lawyer for the town, said the permit might be issued if a vote on the zoning proposal were postponed beyond Tuesday. The town typically takes about 30 days to rule on a such permits.Not everyone fears the arrival of a larger CVS. Some residents appreciate the chain, which has two other locations within a few miles, because its stores are open late, and shoppers can slip in after coming home from work. They also appreciate the range of nonpharmaceutical offerings, which allows them to run errands in a single stop.Bart Tyler, who owns Kelloggs & Lawrence with his wife, Diana, suggested the hamlet should be open to competition. The personal, friendly service his store provides, he said, would keep customers from going to places like Home Depot.\u201cEach of us has to justify ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us make our stores a place where people want to shop.\u201dMike DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, said the zoning proposal \u201cunfairly targets our business.\u201d David Firestein, who owns the shopping strip where the new CVS would go, said in an interview that the hamlet already had large stores and chains. He cited the now-closed A.&P., a Mrs. Green\u2019s Natural Market and an outlet of Edward Jones Investments, which has 12,000 locations in the United States and Canada.\u201cPeople have their own definitions of chains,\u201d he said.\u201cI work for IBM, so I have no problem with big companies,\u201d Mr. Hagen said. \u201cBut the wonderful thing about Katonah is the small businesses where the kid down the street works for them and when you come in the person knows your name.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Moves to Stabilize Stock Markets; Initial Offerings Halted", "Date": "2015-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Struggling to respond to precipitous declines on China\u2019s stock markets over the last three weeks, the country\u2019s biggest brokerage firms unveiled a government-endorsed plan on Saturday to buy shares starting on Monday, while both of the country\u2019s stock exchanges suspended all further initial public offerings of stock.The government-controlled Securities Association of China said that 21 big brokerage firms had agreed to set up a fund worth at least 120 billion renminbi, or $19.4 billion, to buy shares in the largest, most stable companies, and to stop selling shares from their own portfolios. But some experts said the moves might not be enough to stop the hemorrhaging of money from the stock market, particularly given that $105 billion in shares changed hands in Shanghai on Friday.The association did not specify whether the fund would be allowed to use its initial purchases of shares as collateral to borrow money, probably from the government, and buy more shares. That could give it the leverage to have a bigger effect on the market.\u201cIf it\u2019s only 120 billion renminbi, to be honest, it\u2019s too small,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist of the Bank of Communications International, the global finance unit of China\u2019s fifth-largest bank. \u201cBut if you can add leverage on top of it, that could support the large-cap, blue-chip stocks.\u201dOn Saturday evening, China\u2019s two stock exchanges \u2014 in Shanghai and in the far southern city, Shenzhen \u2014 issued notices suspending initial public offerings until further notice even for companies that already had provisional approval to list their shares.Halting initial public offerings encourages investors to keep their cash in existing stock listings instead. The Shenzhen exchange issued suspension notices on Saturday for 18 planned initial public offerings, citing \u201cthe recent significant market turbulence\u201d in each case, and Shanghai issued notices for 10 offerings for the same reason.The announcements came as the government has been scrambling to halt the steepest plunge in the Shanghai stock market in nearly a quarter-century. Share prices have fallen nearly a third since June 12, erasing more than $2 trillion of value and inflicting immediate hardship on millions of families who not only invested their savings but also borrowed heavily at steep interest rates to buy more shares.The design of the brokerage industry\u2019s fund bore some similarities to the Hong Kong Exchange Fund, a government-run fund that played a crucial role in reversing the fall of the Hong Kong stock market in 1998, during the Asian financial crisis. The fund previously invested the Hong Kong government\u2019s fiscal reserves cautiously in deposits at low interest rates. But when it began buying stocks heavily, it set off a stock market turnaround and produced a large profit for the government.A statement by the Securities Association of China on Saturday to its members was an odd mix of capitalist and Maoist rhetoric urging them to take collective action to help the stock market.\u201cExcessively rapid rises and falls in the stock market are not conducive to the stable and healthy development of the market,\u201d the statement said, \u201cand as major players in this market, securities companies must take the initiative to shoulder responsibility, to unify as one, merge our wills and safeguard market stability with all our strength.\u201dThe Securities Association also called on its members to buy back some of their own shares, supporting prices. China\u2019s largest oil companies and big banks, in which the government holds controlling stakes, are widely believed to have used some of their money in the last week to buy back shares, and their shares have fared much better than those of smaller companies.But the design of the securities industry\u2019s fund, with an emphasis on blue chip stocks, could end up protecting wealthy Chinese and foreign investors much more than the young workers and families all over China who have borrowed heavily in recent months to buy stocks that seemed to be soaring skyward, Hong Kong financiers said. Shares in large companies represent only about 30 percent of the overall value of the Shanghai stock market.As Chinese stocks soared in the 12 months until their peak on June 12, the small- and medium-size companies with weak financial fundamentals fared the best. Many of them quadrupled, or rose even more, in value, while the overall index doubled because large-cap stocks lagged far behind.The small-cap and medium-cap stocks overwhelmingly tended to draw middle-class and working-class investors who were buying whatever stocks were rising fastest. The Shanghai market rose 149 percent in the year until June 12. By comparison, a stock price index of 100 large mainland Chinese companies that are traded in Hong Kong \u2014 and many of them in Shanghai, too \u2014 rose 24 percent over the same period.Hong Kong sets tougher listing rules than Shanghai to reduce fraud, and also keeps closer controls on trading with borrowed money. Official statistics suggest that loans to investors for stock purchases climbed ninefold in mainland China over the last two years and were supplemented by widespread lending by informal financial companies at annual interest rates exceeding 20 percent.Other officials have even hinted at selling more shares in state-controlled enterprises on stock markets \u2014 the reverse of what now seems to be happening, as state-controlled companies use part of their cash reserves to buy back shares from the public.Hours after the securities industry\u2019s statement, the government-backed Asset Management Association of China gathered representatives from 25 mutual fund companies, who announced plans to help shore up the stock market by speeding the issuance of funds investing in equities. But the association did not introduce its own market stabilization fund like the brokerage industry, contrary to initial reports on Chinese social media that it would do so. Another worry lies in whether many Chinese mutual funds and other investment funds may be required to liquidate suddenly. Many of these funds have rules on losses in the underlying contracts that formed them: If the value of the fund falls 30 percent, it must return the remaining money to shareholders, typically by cashing in all of its shares.With the Shanghai stock market down 28.6 percent since June 12, that rule is starting to appear to be a possible risk to the broader market, Mr. Hong said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs to Pay $7 Million Penalty Over Options Glitch", "Date": "2015-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a Wall Street bank that prides itself on not making mistakes, an incident when Goldman Sachs erroneously sent thousands of stock options trades into the market two summers ago was embarrassing and costly.Now Goldman is paying a $7 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil administrative charges that it did not maintain adequate safeguards to prevent the trading mistake from occurring.The agency, in announcing the settlement on Tuesday, said the erroneous trading that took place in early morning hours of Aug. 20, 2013 highlighted the need for Wall Street firms to maintain better systems to prevent technological glitches that can roil markets.The trading glitch, during which Goldman sent out 16,000 mispriced options orders to various exchanges before the official start of the trading day, ultimately cost the firm $38 million in losses, according the settlement order.The problem was caused by an error in the Goldman\u2019s trading software that turned \u201ccontingent orders\u201d for option trades into live orders and assigned them all a price of $1. The erroneous orders led others to submit orders to Goldman for stock option trades representing 150 million of underlying shares.The S.E.C. said Goldman could have lost up to $500 million if the orders and trades were not later canceled by the exchanges, which treated most of them as erroneous orders.Soon after the incident, Goldman put several employee associated with the trading on leave. A person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said those employees have either left the firm or remain on leave.The S.E.C. order notes that a circuit breaker system Goldman had in place to stop the bank from sending out erroneous trades initially limited the potential damage. But employees of Goldman made things worse by \u201crepeatedly\u201d lifting the circuit breakers and allowing more erroneous orders to flood the market. The S.E.C. said Goldman had done a poor job educating its employees about when and how to remove the circuit breakers.\u201cGoldman\u2019s control environment was deficient in several way,\u201d said Andrew Ceresney, the S.E.C.\u2019s director of enforcement, in a prepared statement.In settling with the S.E.C., Goldman neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing. The bank issued a statement, noting that since the incident, \u201cwe have reviewed and further strengthened our controls and procedures.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Market Rout Is a Double Threat", "Date": "2015-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe losses \u2014 Chinese shares have shed more than a quarter of their value in three weeks \u2014 pose an added risk, and possibly greater danger, to a global economy grappling with Greece\u2019s difficulties in repaying foreign loans and its possible exit from the euro. About $2.7 trillion in value has evaporated since the Chinese stock market peaked on June 12. That is six times Greece\u2019s entire foreign debt, or 11 years of Greece\u2019s economic output.Skeptical investors have so far shrugged off each step the government has taken to keep share prices aloft: an interest-rate cut, threats to punish rumormongers, allowing the national pension fund to buy stocks and even plans to investigate short-sellers who have placed bets that the market will fall.The faltering of these measures has put an embarrassing dent in the halo of unruffled supremacy built up around Mr. Xi\u2019s administration, and this past weekend his government doubled down again, betting that it could beat bearish market sentiment into submission.The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which governs the stock markets, said that the central bank would give financial support to the state-controlled China Securities Finance Corporation to \u201cenhance its capacity to safeguard market stability.\u201d The finance corporation lends to brokerage firms, which then lend the money to customers wanting to buy shares.In addition, Central Huijin Investment, a company owned by the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund that usually invests in banks and other financial institutions, said on its website that it had recently bought into investment funds traded on the stock exchanges, and would continue to play a role in \u201cmarket operations.\u201dChina\u2019s willingness to throw government money into the market showed early results, with the Shanghai stock market up 7.8 percent at the start of trading Monday, but it shed nearly half of those gains in the first 10 minutes.The Chinese stock market\u2019s plunge \u201cis probably the most public and obvious instance where the government\u2019s omnipotence has been challenged,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the politics of financial policy-making in China. \u201cI think the last couple of weeks really showed that, no, they do not have the ability to make anything happen.\u201dThe recent stock market losses are equal to three months of China\u2019s economic output, which reached $10.3 trillion last year. Economists increasingly worry that the losses may lead to a sharp drop in spending by Chinese consumers who have lost much of their savings.A plunge in consumer confidence could deliver a shock to a Chinese economy that is already slowing, as the real estate market has struggled to cope with millions of new but empty apartments and as hundreds of thousands of export-oriented factories face tepid overseas demand. And with China now the world\u2019s dominant market for commodities and the fastest-growing buyer of exports from manufacturing giants like Germany, the nose dive in China\u2019s stock markets could hurt economic growth around the world.\u201cWhile turmoil in Greece has added to investor jitters of late, China\u2019s stock market slide could prove ultimately more damaging for the global economy,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.It could also have political ramifications. Harry Harding, a specialist in Chinese politics who is a visiting professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the plunge in the Chinese stock market could produce three successive ripples. The first would consist of investment losses for households, the second would lie in slower economic growth and the last would be a political backlash against Mr. Xi and his team.Unlike his predecessor, Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi has taken direct control of economic policy-making. He and the premier, Li Keqiang, the country\u2019s second-ranking official, have been mute on the stock market\u2019s difficulties. Mr. Xi has also been unafraid of making enemies with an unrelenting anti-corruption campaign.The effects are already being felt in homes across China. Individual investors own four-fifths of China\u2019s stocks, a far higher proportion than in Western markets, where institutional investors predominate. Chinese investors have 112 million accounts on the Shanghai stock market and 142 million accounts on the Shenzhen stock market; about 20 million accounts have opened this spring on each exchange, as novices have rushed to join a national fever of speculation.Investors with heavy losses include He Wuhong, a Beijing middle school teacher and mother of a toddler. She and her husband invested nearly all of their $65,000 in savings in China\u2019s stock market in late April and early May, only to see their account\u2019s value fall by almost half in recent days. She cannot even sell her shares, because their prices fall 10 percent each morning, resulting in an automatic suspension of trading for the rest of the day.\u201cMy heart can\u2019t take it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would probably sell off our holdings as soon as the market rebounds enough to make us even.\u201dMs. He is lucky in one way: Unlike many other investors, she did not borrow money to buy stocks. A ninefold increase in so-called margin lending by brokerage firms over the past two years helped fuel the rally.Many families borrowed money from banks, finance companies, neighbors and others to play the market. Loans were made at annual interest rates of as much as 20 percent, with borrowers allowed to put little of their own money into stock market investments.That raises the question of how well China\u2019s financial system can absorb another round of bad loans when it is already burdened with a huge amount of lending to state-owned enterprises and local governments that can barely meet monthly interest payments. Professor Shih, of the University of California, estimated that total margin debt in China, including informal loans made by the off-balance-sheet operations of banks, could approach $1 trillion.Making matters worse is that many owners of companies have financed expansion by borrowing from banks against the value of their shares. The terms of these loans typically demand that the owners post additional collateral if the shares come close to falling below the outstanding balance on the loan. That point is arriving for many companies, with the Shanghai stock market down 29 percent in three weeks, its sharpest drop since 1992.The problem for millions of investors is that share prices may not recover for years, if ever, for the more speculative stocks. Only a third of the Shanghai stock market, and even less of the Shenzhen market, consists of shares in large businesses.The rest of the shares are mostly in small and midsize businesses, often with weak balance sheets and endemic corporate governance problems. Such companies are vulnerable to looting by their controlling shareholders at the expense of minority shareholders.Shares in the big companies rose 20 to 30 percent in the 12 months leading up to the Chinese stock market\u2019s peak on June 12. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market, increasingly dominated by big mainland Chinese companies, rose only 17 percent in the period and has slipped 4.5 percent as mainland markets have nose-dived.But in those 12 months, shares in many small mainland companies quadrupled, quintupled or more, pulling the overall Shanghai market up 149 percent.Huge increases in percentage terms were possible because shares in hundreds of these companies were cheap a year ago. As their share prices began climbing, they drew in millions of first-time investors who bought shares simply because they were rising fast and seemed likely to continue doing so.By contrast, foreign buyers and many domestic institutions cautiously gravitated toward larger companies\u2019 shares. Foreigners account for only about 4 percent of the Chinese stock market and face severe restrictions on their ability to bet on price declines in China. Having missed the rise in shares over the past year, some now appear to be swooping in: On Friday, purchases in Shanghai by international investors in Hong Kong reached their third-highest daily volume since a new, government-backed market connection service between Hong Kong and Shanghai started last year.Shirley Lin, a political economy professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who is a former Goldman Sachs partner, said the stock market\u2019s fall could have a profound effect on China\u2019s economic policies and its pattern of growth in the months and years ahead.The government\u2019s difficulties in controlling the fall are likely to make policy makers more hesitant about further financial liberalization, she said, and the stock market rout is likely to further stunt the expansion of small and midsize companies.These nimble companies have been among the biggest contributors to economic growth in China. They have long struggled, with little success, to obtain loans from state-controlled banks and had hoped to raise more money by selling shares instead. Now, those hopes seem to have been dashed.\u201cThe first ones to go out of business will be the small and medium-sized businesses, and not the state-owned enterprises, which have not been contributing to China\u2019s economic growth,\u201d Ms. Lin said.Mr. Xi\u2019s policy advisers are not ignorant of the risks facing China. Liu He, an economic policy maker close to Mr. Xi, wrote an essay in 2012 on lessons from previous international financial crises:\u201cAfter a crisis erupts, policy makers always confront the three big challenges of populism, nationalism and bringing politics and ideology into economic problems,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMarket forces constantly challenge government policies that lack conviction, and this makes the crisis even worse.\u201dPatrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Clearing Hurdles to Iran Nuclear Deal With Standoffs, Shouts and Compromise", "Date": "2015-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVIENNA \u2014 One by one, the roadblocks to a nuclear accord between Iran and the United States had been painstakingly cleared. But as the negotiations went into their third week in the neoclassical Coburg Palace hotel this month, a major dispute lingered over whether a ban on Iran\u2019s ability to purchase conventional weapons and missile technology would remain in place.A compromise was struck that fully satisfied neither side: a five-year ban on the sale of conventional weapons and an eight-year ban on ballistic missiles.Privately, Mr. Kerry told his team that any lifting of the ban was bound to inflame many in Congress, where fears of empowering Iran would mix with presidential politics. But shortly before midnight on Monday he called President Obama, and together they agreed that it was not worth losing what they saw as the best chance to roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear program simply because there was a risk that sometime in the future Iran would be able to acquire far less dangerous weapons.Over the 17 long days here in Vienna, the standoffs, trade-offs, shouts and confrontations \u2014 some real, some staged for negotiating advantage \u2014 sometimes obscured the fact that the two countries were negotiating with entirely different agendas.For the president, everything else \u2014 Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, its imprisonment of dissidents and even some Americans, its meddling in Iraq and Syria, its arms trade \u2014 was secondary.And conservatives around the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, were looking for any signs that their Americanized chief negotiator, who studied at the University of Denver, was ready to give away too much nuclear infrastructure without getting Iran the sanctions lifted in return, as the ayatollah had decreed.There was no single event, no heart-to-heart conversation between adversaries or game-changing insight that made the Iran deal happen. Instead, over a period of years, each side came to gradually understand what mattered most to the other.For the Americans, that meant designing offers that kept the shell of Iran\u2019s nuclear program in place while seeking to gut its interior. For the Iranians, it meant ridding themselves of sanctions in ways they could describe to their own people as forcing the United States to deal with Iran as an equal, respected sovereign power. And in the end they reached agreement because a brief constellation of personalities and events came into alignment:The sultan of Oman, who convinced the White House that he could establish a back channel to the Iranians. The election of Mr. Rouhani, who Mr. Obama thought would be more receptive to his overtures than Iran\u2019s aging supreme leader. A series of insights from the Energy Department\u2019s nuclear laboratories that allowed the physics of enrichment to create new space for compromise among the political leaders. And the presence of two top diplomats, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Zarif, driven by the conviction that they could break an ugly 35-year history.\u201cWe are not going to have another time in history when there is an Obama and a Biden and a Kerry and a Moniz again,\u201d he said, according to notes of the conversation. \u201cAnd there may be no Rouhani, Zarif and Salehi.\u201d A Shift to Sanctions Barack Obama came to office hoping for a dialogue with Tehran but focused on the problem of nuclear proliferation. After Ayatollah Khamenei responded to Mr. Obama\u2019s private letters with long diatribes about America\u2019s efforts, the president turned to squeezing the country economically.\u201cObama seemed very comfortable with the shift to sanctions after the Iranians failed to reciprocate to his overtures,\u201d said Gary Samore, then a senior White House aide. He pressed the Russians to delay selling the S-300, a sophisticated air defense system, to Iran, and sent a delegation to persuade Beijing to reduce China\u2019s purchases of oil.But when an offer to help get secret talks started with the Iranians came from Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman, the president was intrigued. Eventually the White House turned to a trusted ally to tease out the possibilities: Mr. Kerry, then a senator from Massachusetts. Meeting in Oman in December 2011, the sultan said an accord could be reached.There was a high likelihood it could happen, the sultan said, if the Obama administration showed its seriousness about a diplomatic solution. But making a point that would recur time and again \u2014 down to the last days of the Vienna talks \u2014 he said that a way would need to be found to allow the Iranians to \u201ckeep their honor.\u201dIt took seven months \u2014 until July 2012 \u2014 before secret envoys sent by Mr. Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Iranians, and that meeting went poorly. Then, in June 2013, came the election of Mr. Rouhani, whom the supreme leader had allowed to run, largely on a platform of ridding Iran of the sanctions that were squeezing the elite and middle class.\u201cThe president said we had to work up a letter to him right away,\u201d one of Mr. Obama\u2019s senior aides said. \u201cHe sensed it was a moment we had to seize.\u201dAs Mr. Obama\u2019s aides sketched out how the negotiations might play out, they faced a threshold decision: Would they abandon the Bush administration\u2019s mantra that \u201cnot one centrifuge spins,\u201d a position they knew the Iranians would never accept? Or were they willing to allow a token Iranian program \u2014 a face-saving one \u2014 if the trade-off was two decades or so of restrictions?A consensus quickly emerged that a contained program was far better than a smoldering confrontation that seemed headed toward a military strike. \u201cThe idea was that if we accepted enrichment it would be at a very small level,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, who served on the National Security Council during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cBy being very limited, it would be a manifestation that they really had a peaceful nuclear program.\u201dBut it became clear that Iran envisioned something different: a sizable nuclear infrastructure that would take a pause of a few years, the price of ending sanctions, but then resume its march to \u201cindustrial scale\u201d uranium enrichment. The gap between the American numbers of acceptable centrifuges and the Iranian numbers seemed unbridgeable.Looking for a way to break the deadlock without forcing the Iranians into a corner, the nuclear experts at the Energy Department began to present other, more complex options. The focus, they suggested, should not be simply on the number and type of centrifuges, but the \u201cbreakout time,\u201d the amount of time it would take for Iran, under a \u201cbest reasonable\u201d estimate, to produce a single weapon\u2019s worth of material. Put simply, Iran could have centrifuges running if it agreed to a far smaller stockpile of fuel.\u201cThere were many intense meetings on this,\u201d recalled Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser at the time, and now the deputy secretary of state. \u201cWe had to present a lot of permutations to the president to meet his bottom lines.\u201dThe military said it could live with a \u201cbreakout time\u201d of a year; that was plenty of time to launch a strike to destroy Iran\u2019s production facilities. But the optics of allowing thousands of centrifuges to remain was not good.\u201cThroughout this process,\u201d Mr. Blinken said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been faced with a choice between what is politically feasible and what is practically necessary.\u201dIt would be the first of many such choices. Progress Is Halting A series of secret negotiations with the Rouhani team, led by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aide, Jake Sullivan, and one of America\u2019s most experienced diplomats, William J. Burns, explored the possibilities.\u201cI have about six months to get this through,\u201d Mr. Zarif said in New York in September 2013, on his first trip to the United Nations as foreign minister after many years of academic exile. After that, he feared, the opponents of dealing with the United States would rise again. He was wrong: It turned out the process went on for another 22 months.A first agreement, just to get Iran to freeze its current nuclear activity and blend down some stockpiles of fuel that the West feared was approaching weapons-grade, took months to negotiate. Then came halting progress, as the Americans began to realize that at every stage the Iranians were fighting to preserve every major nuclear facility. \u201cIt was all about perception,\u201d one negotiator said. \u201cThey fought to keep the buildings and tangible equipment. It was easier for them to give up fuel or parts of the equipment people didn\u2019t see.\u201d That preserved a narrative that nothing had been surrendered.Here is a look at what Iran and the United States wanted, and what they got.Last summer, Iran\u2019s supreme leader made the problem even harder, pronouncing in a speech (which took Mr. Zarif by surprise) that Iran should eventually have an industrial-scale enrichment program \u2014 with 190,000 centrifuges \u2014 to provide fuel for power reactors. The logjam was not broken until several extensions of the talks, and a marathon set of meetings in Lausanne, where a critical treaty had been negotiated at the end of World War I. By this time, Mr. Moniz and Mr. Salehi, a former foreign minister and now head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, joined the talks to work out the nuclear details \u2014 in a less political, more scientific environment.The officials working under Mr. Salehi \u201cwere mostly hard-liners, and they would give on nothing,\u201d one American official said. But when Mr. Salehi, who got his nuclear training at M.I.T. before the Iranian revolution, showed up and developed a rapport with Mr. Moniz, the secretary of energy and a former chairman of the M.I.T. physics department, the Iranian bureaucrats were often sidelined, or overruled. (Mr. Moniz played the connection to the hilt, showing up one day with M.I.T.-logo baby gifts for Mr. Salehi\u2019s first grandchild.)Over intense days, in which proposals were sketched out on rolling white boards so that nothing was on paper, where it might have to go back to Tehran for approval, they worked out a framework.The two scientists found ways to achieve the one-year breakout time, at least for the first 10 years, by reducing low enriched uranium stocks to a mere 660 pounds, down from about nine tons that Iran has now produced. In return, Iran would be allowed over 6,000 centrifuges, and an agreement to keep 1,000 of them in Fordo, the deep underground enrichment site that worried Israeli officials because it was impermeable to Israeli bombing. But no fissile material \u2014 the stuff of enriched uranium \u2014 would be allowed at Fordo, and last week the Iranians agreed to pull most of the piping out of the facility, making it even harder to restart operations.Still, Mr. Obama had talked about the need to close the facility when he revealed its existence in 2009. There were other compromises. One Western diplomat said an initial hope among some of the nations involved in the talks was that the central provisions of an agreement would last 20 years. They got 10, with restrictions on how much of a stockpile Iran could maintain that last for 15 years.\u201cBy the time we left Lausanne, most of the nuclear issues were solved, we just had to work out the specific wording,\u201d one of the negotiators said.But tellingly, in the ensuing two and a half months, the two sides described their agreements in very different terms. Mr. Kerry described an Iranian capability that had been neutralized; the Iranians a capability that had been preserved. That set up a collision course for the last negotiations, in Vienna. Political Requirements Differ Mr. Kerry arrived in Vienna on June 28, hobbling on crutches after breaking his femur in a bicycle accident in France. His chief negotiator, Wendy Sherman, a tenacious, detail-oriented diplomat who had broken two or three bones of her own during the talks, had already been in Vienna for a week.The Iranians, she reported, were intent on getting bigger, faster relief from sanctions, claiming Mr. Rouhani\u2019s political survival depended on it.The United States also had its requirements. On the nuclear side, it needed to cut off all three of Iran\u2019s pathways to a bomb: enriching uranium, producing plutonium or covertly manufacturing or purchasing a weapon. Each of those carried enormous complexities. Politically, it needed to show that Iran met all its major obligations before sanctions were lifted, and that there was a mechanism to reimpose them quickly if Tehran stopped cooperating.A guide to international reaction to the historic accord.Mr. Obama had already given ammunition to critics of a deal when he said in an April interview that after year 13 of the accord Iran\u2019s breakout time could be down to nearly zero. That seemed to acknowledge the main critique of the emerging agreement \u2014 that it constituted the medium-term management of the Iranian program, not its elimination.American negotiators believed the deal was better than that, but to constrain Iran\u2019s ability to emerge from the accord as a nuclear threshold state they had to pin the Iranians down on some of the technical details, including the development of more efficient centrifuges.The problem was that the principal Iranian interlocutor for settling precisely that issue, Mr. Salehi, was missing: He had undergone three abdominal operations in the previous two months, and on a conference call a few weeks before Mr. Moniz thought he sounded weak. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if Salehi was reluctant to come, or too weak,\u201d said one senior American official. But without him, \u201cwe were getting nowhere.\u201dTwo days after Mr. Kerry arrived, Mr. Zarif took a quick trip to Tehran, ostensibly for consultations. Most important, he returned with Mr. Salehi on his plane. The atmosphere at the Coburg Palace was tense. But on July 4, the Iranians broke the ice by inviting the Americans for lunch, at which Mr. Zarif complained about ads in Tehran that were inveighing against the deal. Mr. Kerry talked about complaints he was getting from critics at home, who he said were attacking an agreement without even bothering to learn the details.But the talks dragged on. The Iranians appeared to think they could exploit a deadline for submitting a finished accord to Congress for a 30-day review. The deadline was July 9. \u201cIt was working against us,\u201d one diplomat said. \u201cThe Iranians saw that deadline and they were convinced we would give in on key details to avoid the longer review.\u201dAt the White House, Mr. Obama, monitoring the talks every few hours, was getting concerned about a narrative that he and Mr. Kerry wanted a deal too much \u2014 three mornings in a row Mr. Obama reminded his aides, \u201cI don\u2019t need this.\u201d They were not certain what he meant, but they had a theory: After big victories in the Supreme Court on health care and the gay rights, he could afford to be patient.The days ticked by, with halting progress. Mr. Moniz finished the nuclear details, often in meetings in the impressive stone basement of the Coburg, built from the ramparts of old Vienna. The negotiators called it Fordo because, if you ignored the 60,000 wine bottles, it looked a little like Iran\u2019s underground enrichment center.The last stretch was taken up largely with the wording of a United Nations Security Council resolution that would lay out the terms of the arms embargo. Finally, on Tuesday, the agreement was announced.When the photo ops were over, the seven foreign ministers who had negotiated it met for the last time. Each spoke briefly about the importance of the moment. Mr. Kerry spoke last, but then added a personal coda. Choking up, he recalled going off to Vietnam as a young naval officer and said he never wanted to go through that again. He emerged committed, he said, to using diplomacy to avoid the horrors of war.Because of an editing error, earlier versions of picture captions with this article reversed the identities of Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Iranian supreme leader.

{"Headline": "Carl Icahn Calls BlackRock a \u2018Very Dangerous Company\u2019", "Date": "2015-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was billed as a debate over the merits of shareholder activism, with two lions of Wall Street facing off: Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, and Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, one of the world\u2019s largest money management firms.But then Mr. Icahn got on his soapbox and the gloves came off. The 45-minute debate quickly devolved into an often heated discussion over one of the most lucrative parts of BlackRock\u2019s business.\u201cI think BlackRock is a very dangerous company,\u201d said Mr. Icahn, who has made a history of taking jabs at corporate chief executives when he does not like they way they are running their companies.Mr. Icahn went into a long and sometimes rambling rant about why he sees some exchange-traded funds, a popular vehicle for trading baskets of stocks and bonds, as potentially dangerous to the market. Specifically, he singled out higher-yielding bond exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which he said did not create sufficient liquidity in the markets.Mr. Icahn conjured up an image of Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and Mr. Fink pushing a pile of high-yield bonds toward a cliff.\u201cThey are going to hit a black rock,\u201d Mr. Icahn said, with a look of mischief on his face.Criticism about E.T.F.s is not new. Several studies have examined the impact of these securities, which trade just like stocks. But Mr. Icahn\u2019s critique seemed more of a stream-of-consciousness attack than a well-thought-out thesis.After Mr. Icahn\u2019s long monologue, an exasperated Mr. Fink interjected, \u201cCarl, you\u2019re a good investor, but you\u2019re wrong again.\u201dHe disputed Mr. Icahn\u2019s assertion that E.T.F.s were dangerous and countered that they \u201ccreate more transparency in the market,\u201d by helping them function better.The two had an audience of hedge fund managers and investors laughing out loud after a long day of panels at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference. Managers pitched stock ideas and there was a conversation with Ted Cruz, the Texas senator and Republican presidential candidate, who at one point asked, \u201cThe question is, How do we deliver alpha in government?\u201dIt was a takeoff from the conference title, which referred to the kind of market-beating performance money managers promise their investors.It was not so much what Mr. Icahn said that entertained the audience, but the growing and visible frustration on Mr. Fink\u2019s face as Mr. Icahn refused to let him get a word in edgewise.At the beginning of the debate, both men exchanged pleasantries and said how much they liked and respected each other. But the atmosphere turned notably testy once Mr. Icahn began speaking about the dangers of E.T.F.s, which represent a major portion of BlackRock\u2019s revenue.Mr. Fink looked as if he wanted to be anywhere but on the stage. He sometimes held his hands in front of his face as Mr. Icahn continued his attack on a core part of BlackRock\u2019s business. At other times, Mr. Fink looked away from Mr. Icahn.At one point, Mr. Fink, trying to end the rant, offered to take Mr. Icahn to lunch where they could continue their conversation and he could explain to Mr. Icahn why his views on the dangers of E.T.F.s were wrong.Mr. Fink even said he would pay for lunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Markets Dip After Greek Referendum", "Date": "2015-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street shares fell less than a percent, a smaller drop than some had feared. European shares fell around 2 percent. Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said the relatively subdued reaction showed \u201cthe market has gotten used to the strange things that have been going on with Greece.\u201d He said it also reflected investors\u2019 confidence that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, would take whatever action was necessary to soothe tensions at a moment of crisis.\u201cThat\u2019s preventing markets from going down too much,\u201d Mr. Gijsels said.By the end of the day, nine of the 10 industry groups in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were down. But the index itself had fallen a modest 0.4 percent.Still, many investors were clearly nervous, putting money into assets considered safe bets in turbulent times like United States government bonds. A rout in the stocks of oil drillers and other energy companies fed the selling as the price of oil plunged nearly 8 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to end at 17,683.58. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 8.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,068.76, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 17.27 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,991.94. In Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX fell 1.5 percent while the CAC-40 in France fell 2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.8 percent lower.In Asia on Monday, the Shanghai market jumped sharply in early trading as the Chinese government began pouring money into brokerage firms to help them and their customers buy shares. But the market quickly surrendered those gains, closing 2.4 percent higher. In early trading Tuesday, Chinese shares continued their fall, dropping almost 2 percent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 1.2 percent early Tuesday, and MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which fell to a six-month low on Monday, was up 0.3 percent.Bonds in Italy, Portugal and Spain, seen as the most exposed to any potential contagion from the Greek crisis, all fell, and their yields spiked higher, indicating that those governments\u2019 borrowing costs could rise.In contrast, yields on British, German and United States government bonds fell, as investors turned toward assets they considered safer. The yield on the 10-year American Treasury note fell to 2.29 percent, from 2.39 percent late Thursday, a big move. United States markets were closed on Friday for the Fourth of July holiday.The major exception was in yields on Greek bonds, which have been little traded since the country\u2019s financial markets were closed last week. The price of the Greek two-year crashed and its yield rose to an astonishingly high 48 percent \u2014 almost 15 percentage points higher than on Friday. The yield for comparable German debt was less than 1 percent.The Greek bonds\u2019 movement has little practical effect on the government\u2019s borrowing costs as the country has been shut out of the capital markets and has issued no new bonds lately. But their plummeting value further undermines the Greek banks, which are the biggest private holders of the country\u2019s sovereign debt.And because Greek banks use their government\u2019s bonds as collateral against loans from the European Central Bank, the plunge could make it even more difficult for the central bank to agree to continue lending to the banks.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Addressing the possibility that the central bank might force Greece\u2019s hand before European political leaders have been able to formulate their own response, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, on Monday told Europe 1 radio that the European Central Bank \u201cmust not cut\u201d its support for Greek banks.United States oil prices fell the most in three months after Greece\u2019s rejection of the debt bailout terms and after China\u2019s measures to support its stock markets.Also taking a toll on the energy market were talks between Iran and world powers to meet a Tuesday deadline on a nuclear deal. That deal could release more oil into already oversupplied markets if sanctions on Iran are eased.Among American stocks making big moves, Aetna sank $8.08, to $117.43, a 6.4 percent loss. That was the biggest slide in the S.&P. 500. The company agreed last week to buy a rival health insurer, Humana, for $35 billion.The euro fell 0.5 percent, to $1.1057. The dollar slipped 0.3 percent, to 122.54 Japanese yen.Gold rose $9.90, to $1,172.90 an ounce, for July contracts. Silver rose 19 cents, to $15.73 an ounce, and copper fell 9 cents, to $2.54 a pound.Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $3.78 to close at $56.54 in London.In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline fell 11 cents to close at $1.924 a gallon; heating oil fell 13.1 cent to close at $1.709 a gallon; and natural gas fell 6.6 cents to close at $2.756 per 1,000 cubic feet.Kymberly Martin, a currency strategist at the Bank of New Zealand, said that the Greek vote and China\u2019s stock market decline both tended to have similar effects on currencies and stock markets.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to disentangle what proportion is the eurozone and what proportion is China,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably both factors are affecting the market in the same direction.\u201dE. William Stone, the executive vice president and chief investment strategist at the PNC Asset Management Group in Philadelphia, said that Greece would be the dominant influence on markets, particularly in Europe and the United States. While the Shanghai stock market has lost more than a quarter of its value since June 12, it is still up nearly 80 percent from a year ago.\u201cIt almost seems like the Chinese authorities are overreacting,\u201d he said.In Hong Kong, where shares closed 3.2 percent lower, investors appeared to be paying considerably more attention to China than Greece.Roger Lam, a 63-year-old retired office worker who was watching computer monitors at a downtown brokerage firm, said: \u201cAnyone who says China does not have the ability to hold up the stock markets in China is a fool. They have just not seen the mighty power of the Chinese government.\u201d David Jolly reported from Paris, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

Many people in China prize financial prudence, and the savings rate is among the highest in the world. But many Chinese also believe passionately in the power of luck, and China has a long history of high-stakes betting.Gambling is widespread and often considered a social activity; mah-jongg games are common on street corners, and the lottery is a popular pursuit.The intense interest in the stock market, in some ways, grew out of those habits. Many investors entered the market with lofty dreams \u2014 finally, they would have the money for an exotic vacation, an engagement ring or a new home.Amateur traders turned to numerology, long a fixture of Chinese culture, to pick the best investments. Some purchased prayer beads made especially for investors, hoping to conjure good luck.In Nanliu, a small town in Shaanxi, workers set up computers so that they could track stock purchases. \u201cEveryone wants a chance to improve their lives, even if they only get a little piece of meat,\u201d said Zhang Li, a longtime resident who invested several hundred dollars.But greed has long been viewed as a particularly dangerous quality in Chinese culture.The ancient scholar Xunzi, in describing the bad nature of human beings, cited a love of profit as his first piece of evidence, noting its ability to cause chaos and a lack of cooperation. Mencius, another ancient Chinese philosopher, warned against acquiring showy material possessions.\u201cThe human tendency to lose focus on that priority,\u201d Mr. Wong said, \u201cis perhaps the primary cause of our loss of connection to and care for each other.\u201dBut the recent volatility has unsettled investors as they grapple with not only the financial toll but also a loss of the day-to-day emotional rush that underpinned the trading culture.In some areas, retirees have made a habit of watching the market\u2019s movements together, finding solace in collective cursing and celebration. At a brokerage house in downtown Beijing last week, retirees gathered before large stock boards, playing cards and assessing how much money they had lost in recent weeks.One man said he was down about $10,000. \u201cWe\u2019ve all lost money,\u201d he said, growing irritated. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pretty much the same.\u201dAt another brokerage house, a 70-year-old man who gave only his surname, Wei, said he had lost about $30,000.\u201cMy wife blamed me, but is it of any use?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is money we could have left to our son. But what else can I do? The damage is done.\u201dMr. Wei had been investing in the market since 2008 but said he was devastated by the recent losses.\u201cI have lots of anger inside me,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just never easy for us ordinary people to make money.\u201dDespite the volatility, Lu Wenjie, an analyst at UBS in China, said that many investors were likely to stay in the market.\u201cThey are kind of stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are reluctant to record losses, and some of them will even try to add money in the coming weeks and bet on a rally.\u201dThe turbulence has rattled some traders, especially those unaccustomed to the ups and downs of the market. In China, some doctors have taken to calling it stock market anxiety syndrome. Academics have warned about the psychological effects of fluctuations in share prices. A study by Taiwanese researchers last year found that falling stock prices correlated with increased hospitalizations for mental health disorders. When a stock index fell for five consecutive days, for instance, hospitalizations increased by 1.6 percent.Yan Zhengwei, a Shanghai psychologist, said he had recently seen several patients who told him they were depressed by the market, including a client who lost more than $1.6 million.\u201cThey say they are fine, but they\u2019re just saying it,\u201d Mr. Yan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money, after all.\u201dBut Mr. Yan said there was a silver lining. Counseling sessions for couples had recently turned remarkably civil, he said, as husbands and wives found a common enemy in the market.\u201cWhen a major blow came, they actually stopped blaming each other and both blamed the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they had both become victims.\u201d\u201cThey are very insecure inside,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think if they can achieve financial stability in a short period of time, they will feel more secure.\u201dFor some investors, the round-the-clock trading has placed a strain on relationships.At the height of the downturn this month, Wang Xiaoming, a 23-year-old bank attendant, had a dilemma: celebrate his girlfriend\u2019s birthday or try to salvage his portfolio? Mr. Wang, who had invested $2,000, about a fifth of his savings, chose the portfolio. His girlfriend quickly scolded him for \u201conly having numbers on my mind,\u201d he said. After that, he promised to spend less time checking stock market chat forums. (He currently belongs to six.)\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find the right balance,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Still, Mr. Wang said he thought it was important to gain experience in the market. He began to elaborate on his idea but abruptly excused himself. It was a quarter past nine, he explained, and the markets were opening.Cecilia Li and Vanessa Piao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Markets Are an Oasis for Buy-and-Hold Investors", "Date": "2015-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThere has been no shortage of market-moving business and economic news this year. But for the overall American stock market, none of it has really seemed to matter.Crises have come and gone, yet the American market has remained astonishingly calm. That was a big move, and because Apple is so important, it drove the main market indexes down for the day. But if you focus on the ripples caused by Apple, you may miss a bigger, quieter picture. While individual stocks and sectors gyrate, the overall indexes have been bound in an unusually tight trading range. For the most part, the stock market has been an oasis of relative calm.In fact, the overall American market has been setting records \u2014 even if they are not the kind that usually attract attention. It has barely budged this year. So far in 2015, for example, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has moved less than it has ever moved before, according to at least one measurement by the mavens at the Bespoke Investment Group. So far in 2015 the index has not closed more than 3.5 percent above or below its starting point. That has never happened before, Paul Hickey, a co-founder of Bespoke, said in an interview. The S.&P. 500 on Friday closed at 2,079.65, up a mere 1 percent for the year.The Dow Jones industrial average has been setting its own dubious records. It has been going nowhere at all since the end of last year, crossing above or below its December 2014 closing level 21 times so far this year. That degree of fruitless up-and-down movement in a single calendar year is already an unsurpassed, if uninspiring achievement for the Dow since 1900, according to Bespoke. Volatility in the American large-capitalization stock market has been quite low, too.What\u2019s startling about the immobility in the Dow and the S.&P. is that other indexes and individual market sectors have been far more active \u2014 for better and for worse. The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology shares, is up 7.4 percent for the year and has been setting records of a more conventional kind, rising to new highs, most recently on Monday. The Nasdaq biotechnology index has risen even more this year \u2014 a sizzling 24.5 percent advance. Energy stocks, meanwhile, have fallen sharply. The S.&P. 500 energy sector has dropped 13 percent this year. And commodity markets have made wrenching moves \u2014 mainly downward lately \u2014 while the currency markets have been shaken by news about the euro. But in aggregate, the major American stock market indexes have held steady. \u201cIt could be mainly that people are waiting for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates \u2014 which the market expects to happen fairly soon \u2014 yet the problems around the world may be inducing the Fed to delay, and that\u2019s bullish for stocks, and it\u2019s all balancing out,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know why. But it\u2019s startling that the main stock market has been so steady when so many other areas haven\u2019t been.\u201dFor buy-and-hold investors in the major American stock market indexes, ignoring the news has been a worthwhile strategy. While it\u2019s difficult to make a short-term killing in a market like this, somnambulistic prices aren\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for long-term investors who have already benefited from the extraordinary run-up of the bull market since 2009. The market hasn\u2019t had a substantial drop for several years. By remaining immobile, stocks may be experiencing a different kind of correction: If prices don\u2019t rise, valuations become more reasonable as corporate earnings increase. That is important because the price-to-earnings ratio of the stock market \u2014 a widely followed measure \u2014 has risen appreciably since the start of the bull market. Bloomberg data for the S.&P. 500 shows that it has gone all the way from 14.31 percent on March 31, 2009, to 18.22 today. While investors wait for market action, they can collect handsome dividends. For the Dow, for example, the average current dividend yield is 2.39 percent, more than the current yield on a 10-year Treasury bond. The historically low yields on bonds are an important reason for the high valuations in the stock market: By comparison with bonds, stocks are relatively appealing. Markets that have sleepwalked like this one in the first half of the year have generally done well in the second half, Bespoke data shows. Of the nine other years with the least market action through June, all of them rose in the second half, on average, by 6 percent. That figure doesn\u2019t include dividends. In short, if you want action, you won\u2019t have much of it in the big stock market averages. But for buy-and-hold investors, there is still a reasonable chance that this could turn out to be a profitable year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market\u2019s Dive Could Delay Economic Reforms in China", "Date": "2015-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuilding off the work of his predecessors in the last three decades, Mr. Xi has been introducing competition into the banking industry, overhauling state-owned companies and making it easier for foreign investors to buy Chinese stocks. But the pace of reform may slow if the stock market slump persists, or even accelerates.The stock market represents the swirl of social, political and economic forces at play in the reform efforts.Tens of millions of individual investors flocked to stocks in the last year, many of them reassured by statements in government media that the stock market had become a stable, more reliable place to invest. Now, they face devastating losses.The China Securities Finance Corporation, a government agency that lends money to brokerages so they can loan to investors who want to buy shares, said on Wednesday morning that it would provide more financing for purchases of shares in small and medium-size companies, while continuing to support shares of large companies. The central bank said soon afterward that it would continue providing liquidity for the finance corporation as well.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.Since June 12, the market has lost $3.2 trillion, roughly a third of its value. And the true extent of the pain could be even greater.Nearly half the listings on China\u2019s exchanges ceased trading by Wednesday morning, mostly because the companies had sought trading halts until further notice, although some listings were also suspended by regulators.Those listings being halted, suspended or frozen by steep falls are disproportionately smaller companies, which had been the most popular with ordinary investors.For a government that loves absolute control, getting pushed around by the markets is an unsettling experience. It has prompted quick action by Beijing to try to prop up share prices.While moving aggressively, the Chinese government has relied mainly on market-oriented tools. It has lent money to brokerages for stock purchases, for example, and did not publicly have government agencies buy shares themselves, as Hong Kong did in 1998.Scott Kennedy, director of the project on Chinese business and political economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, \u201cI think for them, they figured they had to get involved for now, even though it\u2019s not their first choice.\u201dBut the financial losses are starting to stir a populist reaction on social media in China. Some are calling for the government to play a more active role, even bailing out investors who behaved recklessly. Others are accusing Beijing of bumbling its intervention.\u201cWhen the crisis spreads and the middle class is being wiped out, every government will rush to the rescue, no doubt about it \u2014 when someone is about to pass out from bleeding, it makes little sense to discuss his lifestyle or dinner plans,\u201d Ye Tan, a popular financial commentator in Shanghai, said in a telephone interview.So far, government officials have not yet signaled a change in overall strategy.In a speech to overseas Chinese business executives on Monday, Prime Minister Li Keqiang did not mention the stock market upheavals.\u201cWe have the confidence and capacity to cope with all manner of risks and challenges, and to advance sustained, healthy economy development,\u201d Mr. Li told the gathering in Beijing, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.But the losses are already delaying at least one big economic reform. In an effort to reduce its control over the economy, the government wants to sell stakes in big, state-owned companies. But the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets suspended on Saturday all initial public offerings until further notice.The government had encouraged the stock market rally, since strong demand for shares would have made it much easier to sell their shares of state-controlled businesses. Now, their efforts to shore up the stock market are actually reinforcing the dominance of state-owned enterprises.With the new lending initiatives, those state-owned companies, viewed as too big to fail, are actually performing well, as the shares of smaller, private sector business take a major hit. Shanghai-listed shares of PetroChina, the state-controlled oil giant that has some of the closest links to the Chinese Communist Party of any company, have surged 28.8 percent since the start of last week. The company\u2019s New York-listed shares, where no special financing is available, have fallen 5.3 percent in the same period.The fate of the other reform initiatives is less clear.Plans are in the works to connect the Shenzhen stock market to the one in Hong Kong, allowing money and investors to move more freely. It would follow a similar mechanism between the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges.But such programs loosen the government\u2019s grip over capital flows. If the stock market weakness continues, Beijing may want to maintain control, at least for a bit longer.Leading economists in China say that the economy still needs further reforms to reduce bureaucratic control. But they also acknowledge that the stock market debacle may affect the pace of that reform.\u201cIn some areas, it does make sense to be more cautious and gradual,\u201d said Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. \u201cYou can see from what\u2019s happened in the stock market that our regulatory capacity over markets is still quite poor \u2014 we can\u2019t keep a handle on things.\u201dTao Ran, a professor of economics at Renmin University in Beijing, said the panicky stock market downturn would probably hurt the Chinese government\u2019s appetite for deeper changes to the economy, but added that the downturn paradoxically strengthened the case for such changes.\u201cPeople may say that this strengthens the case for not changing things,\u201d Professor Tao said. \u201cBut I think that this has happened exactly because reform has not been done in the right way.\u201dHe added: \u201cSo far the rescue policy has not been working well. They overestimated their own capacity to control, and now people are voting with their feet.\u201dThat outcome does not appear to be what anyone envisioned when China\u2019s government cabinet issued guidelines in May of last year on modernizing China\u2019s capital markets, including stocks, futures and bonds.\u201cRespect the laws of the market, and abide by market rules, pricing and competition to maximize gains and optimize efficiency,\u201d the guidelines said. \u201cGive the markets a decisive role in allocating resources.\u201dPatrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

This dining trend \u201cis being driven by the millennials\u2019 desire for food in which they know the ingredients,\u201d Mr. Schrotberger said. \u201cIt can be fattening, but it\u2019s nutritious, and you know what\u2019s in it.\u201d Zoe\u2019s has about 150 locations, and the Turner managers expect that it could grow more than tenfold and come to rival Chipotle\u2019s current size.In the second quarter, Small Cap Growth returned 11.13 percent, while Emerging Growth returned 7.53 percent, compared with a total return of 0.28 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. The net expense ratio for Small Cap\u2019s shares is 1.25 percent; for the investor shares of Emerging Growth, it is 1.4 percent. The average actively managed United States stock fund tracked by Morningstar has an expense ratio of 1.23 percent. Mr. Cepukenas said two things drive rising profits \u2014 internal engines like new management or a new product and external ones like favorable changes in regulation or demographics. \u201cWe make the most money when we find the intersection of those two,\u201d he said. An example of a company where the engines are firing together is DexCom, he said, which was recently the fund\u2019s top holding, at 6 percent of assets. \u201cThey\u2019re the market leader in continuous glucose monitoring,\u201d helping people with diabetes manage their blood sugar, Mr. Cepukenas said. \u201cWe have a huge Type-1 diabetes problem in the U.S., and an even bigger Type-2 problem is emerging.\u201d Type-1 diabetes is often called juvenile diabetes, while Type-2 is typically called adult onset and can be linked to obesity. DexCom recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a blood-glucose monitor that sends signals wirelessly to a portable receiver and then to a smartphone. And the company is working on a monitor that can transmit directly to a smartphone, Mr. Cepukenas said. Health care is one of four themes woven throughout the Artisan fund. The others are information technology, industrial technology and consumer discretionary companies. Mr. Cepukenas said that about 70 percent of the fund is usually dedicated to these sectors. But just as important for the fund\u2019s performance is what it does not own, he said. \u201cWe stay away from deep cyclical stocks. We\u2019re underweight financials. We don\u2019t own materials, and we have minimal energy exposure.\u201dAnother distinguishing feature is low turnover. Growth investors are known for trading frequently, but the Artisan fund, with an annual turnover ratio of 40 percent, sells only about a third of its holdings each year. The fund, with an expense ratio of 1.21 percent, returned 7.61 percent in the second quarter. \u201cWhen the consensus is negative on companies, we really dig into those and look for ones where the consensus is wrong,\u201d he said. One way Mr. Barbee identifies the unfairly maligned is by poring over financial statements to find undervalued assets. Sometimes the combination of unloved and undervalued leads him to turnarounds. Take Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain based in Maryville, Tenn. It is being retooled by a chief executive \u2014 James J. Buettgen \u2014 who previously worked for Darden Restaurants, owner of the Olive Garden and Capital Grille chains, among others. \u201cThis was a family-run company, and we think there\u2019s low-hanging fruit in terms of running the company more efficiently, like reducing food costs and better management of labor hours,\u201d Mr. Barbee said.Ruby Tuesday also has the sort of asset trove that Mr. Barbee seeks. \u201cOne of the ways we get involved in restaurants and retail is when they own a lot of real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ruby Tuesday owns a significant number of its own stores.\u201d Property can give downside protection; in theory, the stock should be worth at least as much as the real estate. Mr. Barbee started Aegis Value in 1998 and has managed it since. Over that time, it has returned an annualized average of 9.3 percent, though at times its returns have been volatile. Over the last 12 months, for example, it has lost 25.9 percent. The fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.46 percent, returned 8.45 percent in the second quarter. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Connecticut, the Twilight of a Trading Hub", "Date": "2015-07-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, traders and bankers would gather for \u201cpower hour\u201d at the Morton\u2019s steakhouse across the street from the train station in Stamford, Conn. Morton\u2019s red awning waved like an invitation at the base of a hulking 13-story building that held the operations of the Swiss bank UBS.After the trading day ended at 4 p.m., the UBS traders would file downstairs from what was said to be the largest trading floor in the world, and others would meander in from the similarly imposing American headquarters of the British bank RBS nearby. Morton\u2019s red leather chairs would be filled with men in slacks and button-down shirts, knocking back WiAnno oysters and vintage reds from their personal wine lockers. The Morton\u2019s, and Stamford itself, flourished during an expansionary phase of the banking industry. The two squat complexes, topped with the RBS and UBS logos, were emblems of global finance easily visible to anyone passing by on Interstate 95.\u00a0Stamford was Little Manhattan.Now the Morton\u2019s is shuttered. The windows above it, where bankers used to sit, are cluttered with boxes and furniture in disarray. UBS is shrinking, and the remnants of the operation will move across the street to two empty floors of the RBS building, where there have also been huge cuts. For much of the last 30 years, the story of Wall Street was one of ceaseless growth and enormous wealth, as the clubby investment banks and trading firms that used to be based in Lower Manhattan grew into giants of the global economy, with outposts in cities like Stamford. Now these firms are in the middle of a contraction that many in the industry think could last for some time. It\u2019s particularly obvious in a place like Stamford, where tax breaks lured banking operations and a large block of the city was remade for them. But the cuts are happening everywhere.\u201cThe industry gloom that we have been forecasting for some time is now well and truly upon us,\u201d the report said.The financial crisis in Greece is the latest headwind likely to challenge any recovery at European banks. But even aside from the particular problems in Europe, Wall Street banking operations in places like Manhattan and Stamford are being forced to scale back because of a broad combination of bad behavior, stronger regulations, technological innovations and a changing economy. This is a major turning point for the industry that is generically known as Wall Street \u2014 a mix of firms historically based in Lower Manhattan dealing with the issuance and trading of financial products like stocks and bonds. The financial industry today is much bigger than just these businesses, encompassing private equity and hedge funds, along with consumer banking, which was traditionally based outside New York.Some segments of the industry, especially less regulated private equity funds \u2014 and more broadly, financial companies that manage wealth for clients \u2014 have done well recently. But at companies focused on the historical business of Wall Street, the promise of boundless growth and endless wealth has waned and potential recruits are choosing to go elsewhere. To understand the nuances of what is happening, and why, it helps to look at Stamford, and the people who worked there \u2014 people like Ric Elvir, who spent two decades on Wall Street before leaving the UBS trading floor for the last time in 2012. When he was pushed out, he figured he would get right back in at another bank, albeit one with a smaller trading floor. But the jobs he expected to be plentiful weren\u2019t there.\u201cThere are a lot less trading opportunities now than there are traders on the street,\u201d Mr. Elvir said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a death by a thousand cuts,\u201d Simon Wilson-Taylor, the British co-founder of Molten Markets, said of the banking industry he left behind.The trading floors, which seemed to hover beside Route I-95 like floating airships, were the economic engines of the RBS and UBS operations in Stamford. Mr. Elvir moved among jobs and locations in his decade at UBS, but he never forgot the first time he walked onto the Stamford trading floor, back in 2002, and took in the wide, open space big enough to hold 23 basketball courts. With no structural pillars, traders could shout or gesticulate to colleagues at the other end of the floor with nothing to obstruct their view.\u201cI was just like anybody,\u201d he says now with a bit of a reverential hush, as he remembers thinking, \u201cWow, I\u2019m in the middle of something big.\u201d\u00a0The 1,400 people who could fit on the UBS floor made money in many ways. Some simply bought and sold stocks, currencies and bonds, capturing the difference between each trade. Other desks created financial contracts, or derivatives, that made it possible to bet on changes in interest rates or stock prices. Before the financial crisis, some of the most lucrative work involved buying up mortgages and other loans and bundling them into bonds.Those trading businesses ended up accounting for a majority of the profits at the big banks in the years before the financial crisis. This work \u2014 particularly the mortgage operations \u2014 was also the main source of the staggering losses that required RBS, UBS and the other large banks to take government bailouts when the subprime mortgage market collapsed.In the midst of the crisis, RBS and UBS got rid of hundreds of traders in Stamford. But the bailouts allowed the two banks \u2014 and others across the industry \u2014 to rebuild their operations surprisingly quickly in 2009 and 2010. Mr. Wilson-Taylor was hired by UBS in Stamford during this time to oversee some of the bank\u2019s bond trading. When he got to UBS, the floor was half full; a year later it was nearing capacity and buzzing with frenetic energy. \u201cIt was chaos \u2014 they constantly kept bringing in expensive people from other firms,\u201d according to Mr. Wilson-Taylor.The renewed enthusiasm on Wall Street after the crisis was ultimately tempered by many different factors. Central banks around the world did everything in their power to keep interest rates low, to encourage borrowing and stimulate their nations\u2019 economies. But the lower interest rates meant that trading desks earned smaller interest payments on the enormous stockpiles of bonds and loans that they owned. The predictable downward movement of interest rates also discouraged the type of trading from which the desks in Stamford and elsewhere had made money. The financial crisis also emboldened lawmakers and financial regulators. The Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation explicitly banned some of the trading activities that had been big in Stamford before the crisis. But the set of international banking rules that have had the single largest impact require banks to hold capital as a buffer against trading losses \u2014 rules broadly referred to as Basel III. A bank trading $100 billion of corporate bonds, for example, now needs to hold around $10 billion of capital, in comparison with the $3 billion to $5 billion it would have needed before the crisis. If the bank does not have the $10 billion in capital and wants to continue trading, it is required either to raise more money from shareholders or put aside more of its profits, with all the costs that entails. The riskier the products a bank is trading, the more capital it needs to put aside for each dollar of trading. The desire by regulators to have banks trim their risky trading desks has had a particular impact at RBS because the bank\u2019s bailout left the British government as the majority owner. RBS\u2019s government-controlled board has pushed the company to focus more on its British operations for retail and corporate customers and less on the international trading floors.At an industry conference in March, the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, said: \u201cAs we increasingly wave goodbye to some of the hangovers from our past, a new model will emerge that is set up to deliver sustainable returns from a much lower risk profile.\u201d (A spokesman for RBS said the bank had no formal comment for this article.) \u201cOver the past few years, UBS has been executing on a strategy to streamline our real estate footprint throughout the Americas,\u201d said Gregg Rosenberg, a spokesman for the firm. On the trading floors, the men and women who remain face yet another continuing threat to their jobs: technology. The types of trading that were the most profitable before and after the crisis \u2014 buying and selling bonds and derivatives \u2014 are now being shaken up by the sort of automated trading that put many stock traders out of work a decade ago. This was beginning to happen even before the crisis, but new rules have encouraged, and in some cases forced, banks to move toward more computer-driven trading. Mr. Elvir and Mr. Wilson-Taylor were both involved in UBS\u2019s efforts to automate the bank\u2019s bond, currency and derivatives trading, which required fewer employees the more successful it became. By the time they left UBS, the floor was thinning out. UBS moved back-office employees into the vast space so that it didn\u2019t look empty. Last year, the company recognized the new reality when it rechristened the trading floor with a less descriptive name: the Pavilion. Stamford began its bid to capitalize on Wall Street\u2019s expansion in 1994, when it offered $145 million in tax credits, and a free parcel of land, to what was then Swiss Bank to build its American headquarters in the city. The 13-story building that sprouted up \u2014 smaller than the 20-story structure that the company initially promised \u2014 brought big changes to the city, including new power substations and data lines, and more Metro-North trains from Manhattan. Mr. Elvir came to Stamford from Manhattan in 2002 after UBS acquired Paine Webber. New arrivals were challenged to try to throw a Nerf football the length of the trading floor \u2014 and always failed. RBS was in the middle of its own expansion during those years, and agreed to build its American headquarters in Stamford in 2005 after the state promised incentives worth $100 million in exchange for 1,150 new jobs in the state. The incentives, part of the continuing race among local governments to attract international corporations, amounted to more than a quarter of the $345 million that RBS spent on its Connecticut building. But the incentives proved controversial, particularly because the state has had to continue making investments to keep the banks\u2019 operations, even in their reduced form. In 2011, Connecticut\u2019s governor, Dannel P. Malloy, the former mayor of Stamford, gave UBS a $20 million loan to keep employees in the state. Last year, Mr. Malloy, despite criticism, extended the loan to 2021. Mr. Malloy says that the banks still play an important role in the local economy. As recently as 2010, UBS was the largest employer in Stamford, and RBS was, at one point, the fourth largest. But with UBS planning to move out of its enormous complex by 2017, the city could be left with a potentially embarrassing vacancy right next to the train station. Some former employees decamped for other banks in Manhattan; others left banking for hedge funds and other less regulated corners of the financial industry. Some data has suggested that employment in the financial industry over all \u2014 including asset management and insurance \u2014 is staging a recovery, though industry experts say that many of the new jobs are in lower-paying compliance positions. The broader consequences of the contraction of trading are still coming into focus. In places that are particularly reliant on the financial industry, like Stamford and New York, the loss of high-end jobs could have a pernicious ripple effect across the economy. The Partnership for New York City, a civic group sponsored in part by banks, has estimated that the financial industry accounts for a third of the city\u2019s economic output and a quarter of personal income taxes.\u201cThey have pulled in their horns here in Stamford,\u201d said Joseph McGee, the head of public policy at the Business Council of Fairfield County. \u201cEssentially they have become invisible in the city.\u201d But Stamford\u2019s economy over all has shown remarkable resilience. The local unemployment rate has shown no signs of rising, and the average wages remain stable. That appears to be, in part, because the city has already managed to attract several new corporate operations, including those of Starwood Resorts and Hotels Worldwide and Deloitte, which have built in an old industrial area near the waterfront and taken advantage of the infrastructure that the banks brought in, as well as new tax incentives. \u201cIt\u2019s all for the best,\u201d Mr. Philippon said. \u201cWe had way too many people trading before.\u201d As a former member of the trading tribe, Mr. Elvir said that when he was let go by UBS, it came with a surprising sense of relief, and some space to think about what he really wanted. \u201cIf you stay focused on something for too long, it\u2019s very easy to lose the forest for the trees,\u201d he said. \u201cYou tend to forget about work-life balance.\u201d Now, instead of waking up at 5:30 a.m., he gets up at 7:30 and has breakfast with his 9-year-old sons. Trading his own money might not last forever. He has thought of looking for work at another big bank, but doesn\u2019t think he would have much luck even if he really wanted that sort of job. He\u2019s doing a little consulting work and \u201ctrying to figure out where are the new opportunities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Reassess China After Market Free Fall ", "Date": "2015-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt wasn\u2019t long ago that hedge funds were preparing for one of the biggest openings into China in years. In November, foreign investors were for the first time able to buy and sell shares listed in the Shanghai market directly. It was a chance to ride the great China bull run.How times have changed.Hedge funds are now reassessing their positions and questioning the role of the government in China\u2019s stock market.O\u2019Connor, a $5.6 billion hedge fund owned by UBS, is one such investor. The Chinese government\u2019s moves have left the firm unsure about how to maneuver.\u201cThe intent is clearly to restore investor confidence and market stability, but this is a huge setback for Chinese capital market liberalization,\u201d Dawn Fitzpatrick, the chief investment officer of O\u2019Connor, said by email. The government\u2019s moves, she added, \u201cwill materially impact their ability to attract foreign capital, which has been a key policy initiative.\u201dToday, a third of the stock market in China remains frozen. (Last week it was half.) Investors holding more than 5 percent of one company\u2019s stock have been prohibited from selling for six months. At the same time, brokerage firms have been given a mandate to pump billions into the market, and large state-owned companies have been ordered to buy back shares.The Public Security Ministry has promised to investigate \u201cmalicious\u201d short-selling, according to state media reports. Short-selling is one strategy that distinguishes hedge fund managers from other investors.Brokers have told their hedge fund clients to skip the short-selling, which allows them to take a bet against a stock, because it will not be worth the headache when Chinese regulators come knocking on the door.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.All these moves, in succession, have left foreign investors simultaneously panicking and scratching their heads. One hedge fund manager based in Hong Kong said he had no idea whether he had made or lost money in the mayhem. He will not know until some of his positions \u2014 long and short bets on stocks in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong \u2014 start to trade again.For more than a few on Wall Street, the powerful rally and sudden free fall, combined with the Chinese government\u2019s intervention, provided the perfect illustration of why not to buy \u201cA shares\u201d \u2014 China\u2019s domestic stocks.\u201cPeople thought the A shares was a very speculative market and referred to it as a casino,\u201d said Jorge Mariscal, emerging markets chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management. But, he added, this is a misleading analogy. \u201cIn a casino you know the rules of the game. Here they are shifting, and I think this is going to deter foreign investors in this market,\u201d he said.Even as hedge funds and banks expanded their businesses to take advantage of the Stock Connect and other changes, foreign participation in China\u2019s domestic markets remained minuscule.For several years, a small group of hedge funds have participated in a special quota program, called the qualified foreign institutional investors program, that has allowed them to trade shares denominated in renminbi and Hong Kong dollars. But even with this trading, together with trading through the Stock Connect, only about 1 percent of China\u2019s $8.5 trillion domestic market value is owned by foreign investors, according to estimates by UBS.For those foreign investors who got in early, the run-up in share prices in China was remarkable. But there were signs of a bubble early on. Stocks nearly tripled over a 12-month period during which China\u2019s economy and corporate earnings were worsening, said Patrick Chovanec, managing director at Silvercrest Asset Management Group. Valuations of companies skyrocketed and, at the market peak, the median was 85 times earnings, a red flag for most investors.Then came the market purge, which for seasoned China investors was a long time coming.\u201cWelcome to Asia. So, the people who bought the market and thought that it was MSCI investment-worthy? It\u2019s not,\u201d said Seth Fischer, chief investment officer at the Oasis Management Company, a hedge fund based in Hong Kong. \u201cThey should have known that when it went up 50 percent,\u201d he added.During the very worst moments of the recent sell-off, Mr. Fischer was among the few investors buying shares that no one else wanted to own. He said that while investors were running for all the exits, pummeling stocks, many companies would still be standing in the years ahead. He pointed to Shenguan Holdings, which makes casings for sausages, as an example.\u201cIt\u2019s a real company, and the Chinese are not going to stop eating sausages,\u201d Mr. Fischer said.Other investors are optimistic that while this market turmoil has scared off many, it will most likely force China\u2019s leaders to put market changes into effect sooner.As it is, the market has bounced back. Many investors are still in positive territory for the year. Since a low point in the Shanghai stock market on Wednesday, the index is now up 13 percent. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned a good year into an average year if we stop and draw a line here,\u201d Mr. Johnston said about hedge fund performance for China-focused firms.The decline in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets has not erased most of the gains made over the last year. In fact, over a three-year period, the Shanghai market is still ahead of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.At one point last week, the story was radically different in Hong Kong\u2019s stock market. In a single day, the market reversed all of its gains for the year, the biggest drop in one day since the financial crisisIn all the investor soul-searching, one hedge fund manager\u2019s warnings have been louder than others. James S. Chanos, who has bet on a downturn in China for five years, recently compared China to Greece, another country that has caused some gnashing of teeth in the hedge fund community.\u201cI joke to my Chinese friends, somewhat half-seriously, another three-four years they are going to be like my homeland, Greece,\u201d Mr. Chanos said in May on \u201cWall Street Week,\u201d an investing program.Mr. Chanos was briefly vindicated when Chinese stocks on which he taken short positions plummeted in Hong Kong last week. But, as if on cue from China\u2019s government, the Hang Seng index clawed its way back from a low point. By the end of Monday, it had gained 7 percent from its low point last Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Central Bank Now Controls Destiny of Greece\u2019s Battered Banks", "Date": "2015-07-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCelebrants streamed into Syntagma Square on Sunday after a decisive vote against the demands from Greece\u2019s creditors.FRANKFURT \u2014 Now that Greek voters have said no to the economic demands of its international creditors, the fate of the country\u2019s struggling banks is in the hands of the European Central Bank.Greece\u2019s banks, closed since last Monday because they are perilously low on cash, have been kept alive in recent weeks by emergency loans from the European Central Bank. On Monday, the central bank\u2019s policy makers plan to convene to determine how much longer they are willing to prop up the Greek banks, now that the country has essentially said no to the unpopular dictates of the other eurozone countries.No economy can function properly without banks; if they topple, so would the Greek economy.The European Central Bank said it had no immediate comment on Sunday evening.Early Monday morning, Chinese stocks rallied after the government lent billions of dollars to brokerages to help them and their customers buy stocks. But elsewhere in Asia markets slipped as investors reacted to the results of the Greek referendum.If Europe\u2019s central bank hews strictly to its rules \u2014 which require banks to be solvent to receive loans \u2014 its Governing Council on Monday would stop providing cash to Greek banks. But the central bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, who has repeatedly cited the human cost of Greece\u2019s crisis, might be tempted to find a way around those rules, arguing that choking off financial support would thrust untold hardship upon ordinary Greeks and might send the country on its way out of the euro currency union.The summit meeting could be intended to help the European Central Bank make difficult decisions in the coming days, said one analyst, Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. One purpose of the summit is probably to give the E.C.B. \u201cthe political cover it needs if it decides to cut off Greece\u2019s banking system,\u201d he said.The Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers planned to convene in an emergency session on Tuesday ahead of the summit. It was the inability of Greece and the Eurogroup to reach a bailout agreement, despite five months of trying, that prompted Mr. Tsipras to break off negotiations and call for Sunday\u2019s vote.In a statement, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup, said that the result of the referendum was \u201cvery regrettable for the future of Greece\u201d and warned that \u201cdifficult measures and reforms are inevitable\u201d for the recovery of the Greek economy.Greek central bank officials and banking executives were reportedly meeting Sunday night in Athens to discuss next steps, which presumably would include whether to place further restrictions on depositors\u2019 ability to withdraw money.When the government decided to close the banks a week ago, it said they would reopen this Tuesday. But entering the weekend, the banks had only about 1 billion euros, or $1.1 billion, on hand, Louka Katseli, the head of Greece\u2019s banking association, said on Friday.In the panic that is likely to ensue if the banks reopen this week, that money would probably quickly evaporate, unless Athens imposed even stricter limits than the daily cap of \u20ac60, or about $67, which has been in place for people with Greek bank cards.Because no country in the 16-year history of the euro currency union has ever been as close as Greece to an economic collapse with no near-term prospect of bailout help, there are no precedents to draw upon in predicting what could happen next.The European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council, whatever it might do or not do about Greek banks on Monday, could decide to focus its energy on minimizing the collateral damage elsewhere in the 19-nation eurozone. One way to do that would be to pump money into the bloc\u2019s economy by stepping up the central bank\u2019s purchase of government bonds and other debt from other eurozone countries.European leaders weighed the latest measures from Athens.But for Greece, its banks pose the clearest immediate danger. For months, they have depended on the E.C.B.\u2019s emergency loans to compensate for withdrawals of money by Greeks who are worried that their government would be unable to reach a bailout agreement with its creditors.The extent of that dependency became clear last week after the central bank decided to cap the emergency loans at about \u20ac89 billion. Because much of that credit line had already been used, the borrowing cap forced the government to close the banks before they ran completely out of money.Adding further stress, the banks have large holdings of Greek government bonds, which have already plunged in value and are likely to fall further after Sunday\u2019s vote.In a briefing note on Sunday, Mr. Rahman, the Europe director of the Eurasia Group, said that a no vote by Greeks would probably tilt the balance of opinion on the Governing Council in favor of members from Germany, Latvia and other eurozone countries that want to take a hard line with Greece.Peter Kazimir, the finance minister of Slovakia, which is a member of the eurozone, wrote on his Twitter account Sunday night that \u201cthe nightmare\u201d of the architects of the euro \u2014 that a country could quit the single currency \u2014 now \u201cseems like a realistic scenario.\u201d Mr. Kazimir, who has previously taken a tough stance on Greece\u2019s demands, also wrote that there needed to be a response as soon as possible to the referendum. But he emphasized that the vote by the Greeks \u201ccannot mean that they will get the money easier.\u201dEuropean authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.When the Greek government\u2019s debt problems became evident during the financial crisis, leading to international bailouts of the country in 2010 and 2012, one big worry was that other European banks could be dragged down by losses on their Greek holdings.Now, though, as European banks have sold off their Greek investments and new eurozone banking regulations have been put in place, that risk has been greatly reduced, according to the European Banking Federation, an industry trade group.\u201cEuropean banks in recent years have significantly reduced their exposures to Greece, greatly limiting the risk of contagion through the banking system to other countries,\u201d the British bank Barclays wrote in a briefing note on Friday.Barclays said that other euro countries had exposure to Greece amounting to only 3.5 percent of the eurozone\u2019s gross domestic product and that exposure of European banks to Greece had fallen to less than one-tenth of that level.But Barclays warned that the safeguards put in place in the last five years were not \u201cinfallible.\u201dEven if the E.C.B. and other eurozone countries decide that Greece\u2019s banks deserve some sort of rescue, the process would be far from painless.From a small island to the capital in Athens, here is a glimpse into some of the lives of Greeks as their country struggles to repay billions in debt.The central bank\u2019s emergency loans would not be a permanent solution. The longer-term fix would probably need to come from a war chest called the European Stability Mechanism, which the eurozone countries set up during the financial crisis to guard against future calamities.That fund was used in 2012 and 2013 to lend \u20ac41 billion to the Spanish government to help rebuild the assets of Spain\u2019s banking system, which was teetering toward collapse. It was also used the next year to lend \u20ac9 billion to Cyprus; some of those funds were used for its banks.In the case of Cyprus, there were howls of protest when a eurozone bank bailout for the first time required some depositors to take \u201chaircuts,\u201d or losses on their money.But two years later, as the new Cypriot government that came to power during the crisis met the bailout conditions set by the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund, that solution has been deemed largely successful.With no immediate prospect of a resumption in bailout talks between Greece and its creditors, a Cyprus-style rescue of the banks might not be in the cards. But if the European Central Bank and eurozone countries decide not to let the Greek banks collapse, depositors might be forced to take some losses.\u201cThere would certainly have to be a quid pro quo,\u201d said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cAnd I\u2019m almost certain that there would have to be some haircutting.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury \u2018Flash\u2019 Rally Report Is Released", "Date": "2015-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Monday said they now had a deeper understanding of one of the strangest market moves in recent Wall Street history.Typically, extreme volatility in the Treasuries market can be explained by an obvious news event, but no such glaring trigger occurred on Oct. 15. As a result, speculation about the causes surged.Some wondered whether a trading firm had erroneously submitted an enormous trade that drove the price up, or if a technological problem \u2014 like the one that caused the New York Stock Exchange to stop trading last week \u2014 had taken place. In addition, Wall Street bankers and traders, who have chafed at the overhaul of their industry, seized upon the bizarre jump in the price of the 10-year Treasury note to argue that new rules are hurting the market.But the five-agency group, which included the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Wall Street\u2019s closest regulator, avoided identifying any overwhelming single cause in the 70-page report, except to say that there were far more trades to buy Treasuries in those crucial minutes than trades to sell. Acknowledging that such an imbalance is not unusual, the report tried to determine why the rush of buy orders led to such a large move in the 10-year Treasury note.In the Treasuries market, the extent of a bond\u2019s movement is often tracked by looking at the change in its yield, which is the interest payment on the bond expressed as a percentage of the bond\u2019s price. A bond\u2019s yield goes down as its price goes up. On Oct. 15, the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield plummeted to below 1.9 percent on the morning of Oct. 15, after opening above 2.15 percent. After a particularly steep 15-minute plunge around 9:30 a.m., the yield sharply rebounded, and ended the day close to where it started.The Treasury Department and four other agencies released a report into an unusually sharp rise in the price of a benchmark U.S. government bond.The report parses the actions of the two types of institutions that dominate the Treasuries market \u2014 traditional Wall Street banks, and trading firms that make quick-fire bets for their own account, which the report calls principal trading firms.The report asserts that the banks and principal trading firms took steps to protect themselves from a rise in Treasury prices \u2014 and those steps seemed to drive the prices even higher. The banks widened the gap at which they would buy and sell Treasuries, a standard practice in volatile moments in the markets. At one point, they stopped offering to sell Treasuries. The principal trading firms, for their part, reduced the average size of their trades. \u201cBoth actions served as risk management strategies by reducing the number and size of orders that could be executed,\u201d the report said.The report also makes it clear that markets did not \u201cgo dark\u201d on Oct. 15, as some on Wall Street had contended. Instead, transactions occurred continuously and trading volumes surged. The cautious steps taken by the banks and trading firms could have been enough on that day to cause such a wild ride. But to understand how would require a deeper analysis of why trading algorithms behaved as they did on Oct. 15, according to a senior regulator who was involved in the report.Critics of bank regulation in Washington said the report did not do enough to explore whether new rules have constrained the banks\u2019 willingness to step in and correct seemingly irrational moves in securities prices.\u201cThey are trying to paint a narrative that regulations have no role \u2014 that\u2019s the new sound bite,\u201d Daniel M. Gallagher, a Republican commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in an interview. \u201cBut of course it has a role; it\u2019s the main factor.\u201dOn the other side, supporters of the overhaul of the financial system have taken up the report as evidence that Wall Street overstepped in using one market move to push back against new rules. In recent months, many on Wall Street have said that new regulations have made it hard to carry out trades at dependable prices. \u201cThat\u2019s the latest scare that the industry is using to attack reform,\u201d said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a group that has supported many aspects of the financial system overhaul. \u201cThey have no evidence for this. Where\u2019s the data?\u201d The report does not highlight high-frequency trading firms, even though much Treasuries trading takes place on an automated basis. It took that approach because high-frequency trading is now prevalent across different Wall Street institutions. The report did, however, examine practices such as order canceling and \u201cself-trading\u201d within the principal trading firms. Enforcement staff at regulatory agencies may use the report to investigate trading patterns. A footnote in the report stated, \u201cAt times, self-trading may reflect unlawful conduct.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Problem With China\u2019s Efforts to Prop Up Its Stock Market", "Date": "2015-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal MarketsRepeat after me: The stock market is not the economy. And the economy is not the stock market.That\u2019s the central, crucial idea for sound economic policy that seems to be missing from China\u2019s frantic efforts to prop up its plummeting stock market. Those efforts weren\u2019t enough to stop the swoon in prices last week, though they were enough to generate a couple of up days in a week of wild market swings.The Shanghai composite index actually finished the week up 5 percent after the government\u2019s extensive interventions, but remains down 25 percent from its June 12 high. Even that is misleading, as trading was halted earlier in the week in hundreds of Chinese stocks, freezing the price of shares that represent about 40 percent of the market value. No doubt these are scary times in China. It is understandable that government and industry leaders fear what the collapse will do to the savings of the country\u2019s growing middle class, who have taken to stock investing in mass numbers in recent years.It is easy to understand why the headlines out of China would make the rest of the world fret. China is an important global economic player. Persistent uncertainty about what will happen to Greece and the eurozone, another major driver of the world economy, has further fueled the sense of global markets in peril.To the degree that the loss of stock market wealth will ripple through to the broader credit system and economy, it makes sense for Chinese officials to be alarmed. Perhaps losses on margin loans will cause credit to freeze up more broadly, slowing growth. Or the loss of paper wealth could lead Chinese citizens to hunker down and spend less money, leading to a recession.Those are valid fears and help explain why the People\u2019s Bank of China has cut interest rates and loosened bank lending restrictions, hoping to keep Chinese economic growth on an even keel despite the market drop.But others in the long list of actions China has taken to try to shore up the market seem focused more on directly propping up the market itself and less on containing the consequences of the market sell-off. There was the June 29 decision for local government pensions to invest in stocks for the first time, a July 1 relaxation of securities trading fees, a July 2 relaxation of rules on margin trading to make it easier for people to make risky bets on stocks and a July 5 decision by a state-owned investment fund to buy more stocks.At its June 12 high, the Shanghai composite was trading at a level equivalent to 25 times its companies\u2019 annual earnings, a lofty valuation by any historical standard (though not quite as high as the market in the United States at the height of the dot-com bubble, when the price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index reached 30).Given all that, one reaction for the Chinese government would be to take the market correction in stride, to view it as an inevitable process by which markets find balance. If a few million people lose money along the way, so be it; they took on that risk. The broader Chinese economy should be able to weather a loss of paper wealth that had just existed for a few months. (It\u2019s worth noting that even after the drop last week, the Shanghai index is only back to its levels of late March; it is still 90 percent higher than it was a year ago.) But the Chinese government\u2019s actions the last few weeks show what it looks like when the power of the state is truly brought to bear to try to manipulate the ups and downs of securities markets. The Chinese government is actually doing what conspiracy theorists accuse the United States of doing.But those episodes are rare, and with hindsight are frequently viewed as mistakes. No arm of the American government tried to prop up the stock market through outright purchases of stock during either the dot-com bubble crash or the 2008 financial crisis. (Perhaps capital injections into troubled banks in 2008 are an exception, though those interventions were targeted at propping up the banking system, not the stock market as a whole.)In thousands of pages of transcripts from closed-door Federal Reserve policy meetings over the last couple of decades, the stock market is mentioned plenty; it is invariably mentioned in the context of understanding what it means for the real economy \u2014 the spending of consumers, the ability of companies to raise capital and so on.There\u2019s no doubt that the Fed\u2019s monetary easing has driven up the stock market in the last five years, and that is one of the ways its policies have helped the overall economy. But that\u2019s not the same as propping up the stock market as a goal in and of itself. It also helps explain why the Fed didn\u2019t react to sharp stock market sell-offs in June 2013 or October 2014; there was minimal evidence they were affecting the actual ability of Americans to get a job and earn a living.The stock market, when it works well, is a valuable tool for enabling ordinary citizens to invest in companies and companies to obtain capital on favorable terms. When it goes poorly, it becomes an unusually large casino. That happened with dot-com stocks in the United States in the late 1990s, and that has happened by many accounts with Chinese stocks in the last year.When a government intervenes to try to prevent markets from adjusting to sensible levels, it can mean pouring money down a sinkhole and merely delaying an inevitable correction. Having used so many tools to try to prop up stocks, China now faces the knotty problem of its own credibility being on the line and has more to lose from a sell-off than if it had stood aside to begin with and focused on limiting the damage to overall economic growth.That fact is all the more reason governments, on both sides of the Pacific, could think of their \u201cplunge protection team\u201d as something different. \u201cEconomy protection team\u201d has a nicer ring to it.Advertisement"}

He can eat well and travel abroad. He can also afford to pay for his granddaughter\u2019s education.But the losses are rapidly piling up for Mr. Gong, a retired shipyard worker. With China\u2019s stock market 30 percent off its highs, his portfolio is down more than $30,000 in the last few weeks.\u201cI don\u2019t need a high-flying market, just a stable one,\u201d Mr. Gong said.Millions of ordinary investors like Mr. Gong, who piled into an ever-soaring Chinese stock market over the last year, are bracing for a roller-coaster ride.With stock prices plummeting, the government announced plans over the weekend to help prop up the market. While big state-owned companies fared relatively well on Monday, smaller companies continued to slide; and by the opening of trading Tuesday, Chinese shares over all were down 2 percent. The fallout also spread to the Hong Kong markets.The situation is putting ordinary investors, many of whom invested in smaller stocks, in a difficult place. This latest slump may be just another periodic price dip. Or it could be the beginning of a lengthy downturn, like the one that started in late 2007, when the market eventually fell about 70 percent.For now, Mr. Gong, 65, is sticking with stocks.\u201cWhere else can an ordinary person like me put my money?\u201d Mr. Gong said on Monday, as he watched a board of flickering stock prices at a brokerage firm in downtown Shanghai. \u201cPeople like me can\u2019t just start investing in properties.\u201dWhat happened in China over the last year looks like another episode of the madness of crowds, when many investors seem to lose their senses. They started to borrow money on margin to buy shares they couldn\u2019t afford. They bet everything on the belief that this was a new era, gleefully believing stocks moved in only one direction.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.But there is a major difference between the markets in China and those in the other big economies like the United States. In China, mom-and-pop investors, rather than big institutions, make up the bulk of stock purchases. Such smaller players don\u2019t necessarily have the resources to withstand the volatility.The stock market boom began to take shape a year ago.As property prices slumped, the government started to cut interest rates in an effort to stabilize the economy. With share prices looking undervalued and real estate in a rut, money flowed into stocks, said Chang Chun, a finance expert and executive dean at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.The government further fueled interest by viewing the market as a way to help start-ups and innovative companies. The state-run news media began publishing articles about the coming bull run and the creation of exchanges geared toward listing new companies.As droves of investors jumped on board, the stock market boom began to head into bubble territory.The nation\u2019s two major exchanges, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, doubled and even tripled in 12 months. Early this year, the stock of a website that provides financial news and information rose more than 350 percent over two months. Stock valuations in China hit the roof; some companies were trading at 300 times trailing earnings.\u201cThings got crazy, it really became a feeding frenzy,\u201d Mr. Chang said. \u201cPeople were talking about new economy stocks.\u201d In the ChiNext market in Shenzhen, some academics found the average price-to-earnings ratio was about 140, even higher than the Nasdaq bubble in the United States in 2000, he added.The market started to soften a few months ago. Worried about excess speculation, the government started putting restrictions on the so-called leverage, or borrowing, used to buy stocks. In a May report, Credit Suisse analysts said that margin lending and other forms of borrowing to purchase shares amounted to more than $500 billion, increasing the market risk.Just a few weeks ago, analysts at several major banks started calling a top and urging caution among investors. After that, the government once again tightened restrictions on margin borrowing, helping to undermine confidence in the market.Heavy selling led to more selling. Since May, China\u2019s stock market \u2014 the second-largest in the world after the United States \u2014 has lost nearly $3 trillion in market value. The Chinese government\u2019s response to the market downturn has been swift. In late June, China\u2019s Central Bank cut interest rates, a move meant to help make buying stocks more attractive than putting money in the bank. When stock prices continued to fall, the authorities called an emergency meeting last weekend in Beijing. The country suspended new stock listings, and 21 brokerage firms agreed to set up a $19 billion stabilization fund to help prop up the markets.China is facing the stock market slump at a complicated time. The economy has weakened considerably, now that the country is growing at its slowest pace in more than a decade. Many local governments are heavily indebted.With the stock market falling so swiftly, concerns have grown about social and political repercussions. The enormous amount of borrowing that helped lift share prices could turn into bad debt, hurting banks, brokerages and other financial institutions. And small investors could be devastated.\u201cHonestly, my confidence in regulators and the market is diminishing,\u201d said Chen Minliang, a publishing house editor in Shanghai who has been playing the market for years. \u201cBut I still think the market itself has some rules and will likely rebound after reaching the floor.\u201dThe most vulnerable in a sharp, prolonged stock downturn could be people like Mr. Gong, the retired shipyard worker. Most of his family\u2019s assets are tied up in the stock market, with little in the bank.Mr. Gong, who never attended college, made less than $150 a month in the shipyards. In the mid-1990s, he started playing the stocks, after realizing that his job as a state worker was not going to make him rich. He retired in 2005, and has since built up a $100,000 portfolio.\u201cI didn\u2019t really have a good income,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, I\u2019m doing better than some people I know who are just living on their pension.\u201dAbout three times a week, Mr. Gong visits one of his favorite brokerage houses to meet friends, swap tips and watch the markets gyrate. He was there on Monday, off a narrow street in the city\u2019s riverfront district, in front of an enormous screen arrayed with stock prices, ticker symbols and trading volumes.Scores of people, mostly retirees, watched the screens, jumped out of their seats to trade stocks, and argued about the market\u2019s movements. Many had packed a lunch and spent the day reading the electronic stock boards.Zhang Ruoyao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Merger Plan Called Unfair to Some Investors", "Date": "2015-07-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameSamsung has built a name for itself among consumers around the world as a leading manufacturer of smartphones, televisions and home appliances. For investors, though, its reputation is not so stellar.The latest issue for Samsung shareholders is a proposed $8 billion merger of two company affiliates: Samsung C&T, a construction and engineering company, and Cheil Industries, a holding company that issued shares to the public for the first time in December and that has interests in amusement parks, retail fashion, biopharmaceuticals and life insurance.The deal was proposed in late May and is scheduled to go to a shareholder vote on July 17. But some outside investors have criticized the transaction, saying that it is being struck at a price that is unfair to Samsung C&T shareholders. And, they say, Samsung has made matters worse by shifting a 5.76 percent stake of C&T stock held in the company\u2019s treasury into friendly hands to help ensure the deal will go through.It\u2019s not news to investors in any of the large South Korean companies, with their hydra-headed holdings, that they must be wary of transactions between its affiliates. Deals that are not conducted at arms-length can wind up benefiting insiders at the expense of outside investors.Members of the founding family of Samsung own 42 percent of Cheil Industries, according to Forbes magazine. And that has led some investors to speculate that the merger between C&T and Cheil may be motivated by family concerns.In addition, there\u2019s the specter of a $5 billion or $6 billion inheritance tax owed by his children upon his death. Paying such a bill will require that they sell some of their company shares.Chief among the critics of the Cheil-C&T merger is Elliott Management, the $26 billion investment firm overseen by Paul Singer. Elliott, which owns a 7 percent stake in Samsung C&T, filed a lawsuit in South Korea asking the Seoul central district court to stop the transaction. On Wednesday, a judge declined that request.Samsung contends that the terms of the C&T deal comply with South Korean law, which mandates that the computation of a merger ratio be based upon recent stock prices. Management argues that the merger is necessary if C&T is to turn itself around and accuses Elliott of being interested in short-term gains.As for the sale of C&T shares, Samsung called the transaction part of a \u201cpromotion of approval of the merger for procurement of the growth of Samsung C&T.\u201dOfficials at Elliott declined to comment beyond their court filings and public releases. But other investors are also upset about the merger and say they plan to vote against it.\u201cWe are not convinced that it is a good deal for Samsung C&T shareholders, particularly at the proposed merger ratio,\u201d said Hugh Young, managing director in Asia for Aberdeen Asset Management, a $491 billion financial firm.It is not enough that the company simply followed the letter of the law when calculating the merger ratio. \u201cFor the board to fulfill their fiduciary duties, it must be clear that the price is fair to all shareholders of Samsung C&T and fully recognizes the value of the company,\u201d Mr. Young said.According to an analysis by Elliott, C&T was trading at severely depressed levels before the proposed takeover came about. A revenue slowdown in the first quarter of 2015 may have contributed.The day before the deal was announced, C&T\u2019s share price was 40 percent below its aggregate net asset value, Elliott says. That reflected just 63 percent of C&T\u2019s stakes in publicly traded affiliates such as Samsung Electronics, Samsung SDS and Samsung Engineering.At the same time C&T\u2019s shares were falling, Cheil Industries\u2019 stock was racing ahead. The day of the merger, it was trading at 131 times estimated earnings, an enormous premium to its peers and to the South Korean market index, which trades at around 11 times forward earnings.C&T stockholders will receive just 0.35 Cheil shares for each of their shares if the deal goes through. By Elliott\u2019s reckoning, that represents 22 percent of the fair value of C&T shares and will result in a transfer of $7 billion in asset value from C&T shareholders to Cheil.How the merger plays out probably rests in the hands of NPS, the South Korean pension system. It owns a 10 percent stake in C&T; it has not said how it will vote.C&T investors who are siding with Elliott say this transaction highlights the anti-investor practices that are common among the chaebol.These practices, they say, are one of the reasons stocks of South Korean companies trade at such a discount to their rivals in other developed countries.\u201cWe hope that the Samsung group companies immediately start conducting a thorough review of the quality of their respective governance structure and actively communicate with investors on a newly established vision to which corporate governance is central,\u201d Ms. Park said.\u201cWe also wish,\u201d she added, \u201cthat the lessons learned by the Samsung companies through this merger process will be taken aboard by other major groups in Korea, as they face similar structural corporate governance issues.\u201dWill Samsung be forced to forge a new path with investors? Let\u2019s hope so, but don\u2019t hold your breath.The Fair Game column last Sunday, about investors who are critical of a merger between two Samsung affiliates, referred incorrectly to the director of sustainability and governance for Asia at APG Asset Management, who comment-ed on the matter. The director, Yoo-Kyung Park, is a woman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Signs of a Growing Hush in China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As China\u2019s stock market tumbled over the last month, some wealthy apartment owners began trying to sell. Shopping malls became quieter. And customers at automobile dealerships across the country asked to defer delivery and payment for previously ordered cars.While share prices have rebounded modestly in recent days, many business owners in China remain nervous, as they start to notice a perceptible economic chill.\u201cOf course car sales have not returned to normal levels \u2014 people are still very wary,\u201d Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents manufacturers, said on Friday. \u201cThey feel this spike in the stock market today is probably not sustainable.\u201d Even with the rebound, $3.1 trillion in market value, much of it financed with borrowed money, has been erased since mid-June. Many experts worry about the damage to the Chinese economy, particularly if stocks continue to fall. Consumer confidence could suffer, weighing on the country\u2019s growth and on economies elsewhere that depend on exports to China.The government is clearly worried about the potential fallout, at a time when growth is already slowing. In recent weeks, Beijing has moved aggressively to prop up stocks, which is helping to stabilize the market.\u201cThe stock market problem is a heart attack,\u201d said Dong Tao, the chief Asia economist at Credit Suisse. \u201cFor the time being, their overwhelming priority is to stop the bleeding and control systemic risk.\u201dThe economic damage could take two forms.The more straightforward lies in the so-called wealth effect. Chinese consumers may buy less if they feel less prosperous after stock market losses.The more complex risk lies in whether China\u2019s financial drubbing has created yet-unseen problems in the country\u2019s vast array of structured products. Many were introduced over the last year, allowing investors to borrow large sums and control big blocks of stock.The harm has so far been limited. The Chinese stock troubles have not prompted a global rout over concerns about a slowdown.While car dealers, real estate brokers and other sellers of big-ticket items are upset about the market\u2019s fall, Chinese businesses selling less expensive goods, from glove makers to power tool manufacturers, say they see no effect.\u201cSo far, so good,\u201d said Ravin Gandhi, the chief executive of Hong Kong-based GMM Nonstick Coatings, which sells chemicals that houseware manufacturers use to make rice cookers and woks. These manufacturers \u201cdon\u2019t see things falling off a cliff the way we did in October 2008\u201d in the global financial crisis.The economic ripples have been muted because stocks are not broadly owned and the market is only a few weeks into a slump. The ultimate economic impact will depend on what happens in the coming months.If the market bounces back, the economy is unlikely to take a major hit. If the stock market sell-off resumes, the pain could spread across the economy \u2014 and potentially around the world.China is now the world\u2019s largest importer of commodities like crude oil and copper, making many developing countries dependent on China\u2019s continued economic health. China is also the largest market for cars, flat-panel televisions and Apple iPhonesBecause China\u2019s wealthy suffered most of the stock market losses, sales of designer luxuries from Western European and American brands could slip. \u201cIt\u2019s concentrated among the wrong people for a lot of these Western companies,\u201d said Brian Buchwald, the co-founder and chief executive of Bomoda, a consumer research company in New York and ShanghaiThe Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.The government efforts are bearing fruit.A rebound that began on Thursday continued on Friday. The Shanghai stock market rose 4.5 percent and the Shenzhen stock market rose 4.1 percent on heavy buying by the China Securities Futures Corporation.But bolstering the stock market was much easier for the government because trading in about 50 percent of the listings has been halted or suspended. Given that, the government was able to concentrate its purchases on the listings that were still active.The state-owned China Securities Futures Corporation exists to help ensure that the country\u2019s thinly capitalized brokerage firms are able to sustain margin lending to stock buyers even during crises. After providing large sums of money to help sustain loans to stock buyers in the broader economy, the corporation began buying stock itself.The China Securities Futures Corporation \u201cnow has unlimited credit support from the central bank,\u201d said Lu Wenjie, a China stock market strategist at UBS.China\u2019s strategy closely parallels the steps the Hong Kong government took to reverse a stock market rout in 1998. During that Asian financial crisis back, Hong Kong quickly bought $15 billion of shares in 33 component stocks of the Hang Seng Index.Some economists suggest that the economic effects of China\u2019s stock market tumble since June 12 could be small. Paul Gruenwald, the chief Asia economist for Standard & Poor\u2019s, said that changes in financial wealth, like securities, have less effect on spending in Asian countries than changes in real estate prices. And because foreign investors own less than 4 percent of China\u2019s shares, the wealth effect in other countries is very small.The wealth effect in China depends to a considerable extent on how many people own shares. Some researchers say that stock ownership in China is extremely concentrated in a small, very wealthy elite, and that the general public is not so exposed.The recent China Household Finance Survey at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu, China, found that only 9 percent of households actively traded shares. Some 6 percent of these stock traders borrowed money to do so, said Li Gan, a professor at Texas A&M University who has helped write and oversee the survey. Another 4 percent of households owned mutual funds.Mr. Gan said that the survey found that most individual investors had responded calmly to the drop in share prices and had begun trimming their positions carefully. He attributed the speed of the stock market\u2019s decline, and sharp reductions in margin debt, to what he described as a relatively small group of extremely wealthy investors who had taken big risks with mostly borrowed money.\u201cIt is driven by big accounts, enormously big accounts,\u201d Mr. Gan said.Wealthy families play an outsize role in China\u2019s high-priced urban real estate markets. And there have been some signs of panic in these markets.\u201cI have come across apartment owners who urgently want to sell their apartments since they are in desperate need for cash,\u201d said Su Hua, a real estate agent in Shenzhen, in southeastern China. \u201cCompared to a few months ago, people looking to buy have really dwindled.\u201dThe auto industry is feeling the effects of the stock market\u2019s troubles as well. On Friday, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers \u2014 a different group from Mr. Cui\u2019s \u2014 reduced its estimate for sales growth this year to 3 percent, from a forecast of 7 percent in January.There are also hints that retailing might be more broadly affected, although national statistics on such sales in China during July will not be available until mid-August. \u201cBusiness is so slow, there is hardly anyone coming into this shopping area,\u201d said Qiu Jian, the owner of an electrical wiring shop in Changsha, in western China.With pockets of stress emerging, some economists are worried that China could be more heavily affected. They also fret that nobody really understands the risks involved when steep securities losses are suddenly incurred in a country where many brokerage firms and asset management companies are weakly capitalized. The new structured financial products introduced in the last year add to the uncertainty.\u201cThis is why Beijing needs to stop this malaise now,\u201d said Mr. Dong of Credit Suisse, \u201cbecause no one knows where the risk is until it\u2019s too late.\u201dPrime Minister Li Keqiang issued a statement Friday evening expressing confidence that the economy fared better in the second quarter. While he did not mention the stock market, he seemed to allude to the troubles.\u201cThough there will be various challenges and risks along the way,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will never let down our guard and we have the capability and confidence to prevent regional and systemic risks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Investing Is So Complicated, and How to Make It Simpler", "Date": "2015-07-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewI finally faced up to something I had been dreading.After years of procrastinating, I logged on to my retirement account. Just working my way through the rigmarole of retrieving lost passwords and locating my investments was bad enough. But once I started to examine my portfolio, I began to feel anxious. Some of my money was in mutual funds, but I had no sense of how I chose them. And the rest of my money was in cash, earning virtually nothing; how had I let it sit there for so long? With trepidation, I began flicking through screen after screen of investment choices, each one filled with a seemingly endless stream of jargon. I seemed to have fallen into a recurrent nightmare, one in which I am taking a final exam in a class I never attended and a subject I don\u2019t understand. This was even more embarrassing: I am, after all, a trained economist. When new acquaintances learn what I do for a living, they routinely ask, \u201cSo how should I invest my money?\u201d I wish I knew.A relaxing retirement is supposed to be the reward for a lifetime of work, and yet it seems we must pass an entrance exam to reach it.I\u2019ve been wrestling with how we got to this point. Why is investing so complicated? And what should we do about it in our own lives, and as a society? Investing isn\u2019t what most of us do for a living. When a mutual fund company asks me what I want to invest in, it seems like the wrong question. It\u2019s like a taxicab driver in a new city asking me, \u201cWhich route do you want to take?\u201d Don\u2019t ask. Just take me there. I paid the fare. Is it really my job to figure out the route to my hotel? I want to reach my retirement with a nest egg that allows me to maintain my current lifestyle and to travel a bit. If I save what I\u2019m supposed to, I would like someone else to figure out the best route. Employer-provided pensions still do this for you, and if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one \u2014 and it\u2019s solid \u2014 congratulations. For most of us, though, they are not an option: Pensions have been disappearing, for many reasons. And many of the remaining ones are underfunded and vulnerable. Expanding employer-provided pensions seems to be a non-starter, much as we might like to see that happen.Can\u2019t the market fix things? If individuals are forced to choose their investments, why doesn\u2019t the market make these choices easier?The market seems to work well for consumers in other industries. The producers of smartphones, for example, compete fiercely to make simple and elegant user interfaces. If they can make it a breeze to interact with billions of lines of code, why can\u2019t somebody simplify the alchemy of finance? What distinguishes the market for investments is our inability to judge whether we have chosen well. Once I\u2019ve used a phone for a few weeks, I can tell whether it was worth the money. By contrast, I may not know for decades (if ever) whether an investment was wise or foolish. Does a low return signal a prudent choice or a missed opportunity? And by the time the answer becomes clear, it\u2019s already too late. You\u2019ve got to live with your bad choice. What\u2019s more, the invisible hand of competition does not do well by consumers with limited understanding. Rather than eliminating biases, markets often cater to them. For example, many consumers choose a mutual fund by looking at last year\u2019s returns, despite warnings that they should not do so. This creates a winner-take-all situation with the highest-performing funds getting most of the investors. You might think this encourages funds to produce higher returns, and that might seem to be a good thing. But what it actually produces is a perverse incentive for fund companies to take risks. That\u2019s because investors often choose what to do with their money once, and leave it there for a long time. Faced with that reality, the most profitable strategy for a mutual fund company can be to simply take risks in the hope of gaining high short-term returns. Win this high-return lottery and you can draw many investors from whom you will earn fees for decades. Big families of funds can start new funds regularly, each with a different risk strategy. For the companies, it\u2019s like buying many lottery tickets. It doesn\u2019t matter for the company if many of the funds are clunkers as long as they end up with a few near the top of the performance rankings. For consumers of these funds, though, it\u2019s a losing proposition.Educating consumers to be better purchasers seems a sensible idea, but an example from recent history illustrates the problem with that. For a long time, the simple investment advice given to consumers has been \u201cbuy an index fund.\u201d Index funds are such standardized products \u2014 mirroring the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index does not require much management \u2014 that just about all of them were initially low cost while offering wonderful diversification. Consumers have been buying index funds, and the market has responded by providing hundreds of them. Nearly all E.T.F.s are index funds. But the market has also responded by charging high fees for this standardized product. In 2004, Ali Hortacsu and Chad Syverson, economists at the University of Chicago, found that index funds had as much variability in fees as their more labor-intensive actively managed counterparts. And these fees are nothing to be scoffed at \u2014 paying 1 percent more every single year in fees can compound over a lifetime to noticeably lower returns. Initially sound rules of thumb create niches for bad products \u2014 like expensive index funds \u2014 that dilute the value of the advice. In short, the market responds to education with attempts to subvert it. Any simple advice tends to have an Achilles\u2019 heel, and markets are good at finding it. But while there is a large market for it, financial advice poses many risks. But this is not meant to impugn all advisers. The study examined advisers who did not charge clients directly. Their advice was \u201cfree,\u201d but under current rules, their advice only had to meet a very low standard \u2014 it only had to be \u201csuitable\u201d in a broad sense of that word. So it is O.K., legally, for these advisers to steer you to products that they profit from. If you\u2019re seeking advice, ask yourself one simple question: \u201cIf I\u2019m not paying for this adviser, where are they getting their money?\u201d If you don\u2019t know the answer, you may have a problem.Can we do anything? Regulations requiring that all advisers have a fiduciary duty to their advisees would be a terrific start. But we can do more. Even if we receive good financial advice, following it can be hard: Saving more and consuming less is on par with going to the gym more and eating less. Some people can do it easily. Many can\u2019t.For mutual funds, better standards and better labels could simplify choice. For example, suppose the label \u201cStandard S&P 500 Index Fund\u201d was widely used to mean that the fund satisfied certain criteria about transparent pricing, low management fees and limits on trading costs. Consumers buying this fund would know what they were getting. Firms would be free to introduce new, innovative funds, just as an electronics company can introduce new products that are not USB compatible. The restrictions would only prevent products from claiming to be something they are not. What\u2019s to be done now? You are on your own, unfortunately. But I can tell you what I did. I chose a target retirement fund. With these funds, you simply decide on a target retirement year. As you age \u2014 and move closer to the target date \u2014 these funds automatically shift their holdings from riskier stocks to less risky bonds. Even armed with this knowledge, there were hiccups. First, choosing the retirement date raised existential quandaries. Since these funds come in increments of five years (2025, 2030 and so on) I ended up choosing two dates to leave me with mental wiggle room. (\u201cI\u2019m not that close to retirement,\u201d I told myself, choosing one fund. \u201cI might want to retire earlier,\u201d I said, choosing another.) Then I developed a second problem: I was afraid that picking only one kind of fund was imprudent. The economists Shlomo Benartzi at U.C.L.A. and Richard Thaler at the University of Chicago refer to the urge to buy many kinds of funds as \u201cna\u00efve diversification.\u201d One fund can be enough if it\u2019s diversified: What feels like one basket is really a great many baskets. Overcoming this final hurdle was satisfying. I experienced the kind of euphoria usually reserved for major accomplishments. The biggest lesson, I realized, was one that faces me all of the time: The biggest cost of fear is paralysis.It is easy to make a mistake in choosing investments. But in an effort to avoid an error, I had been making an even bigger error. As I procrastinated, my money was uninvested and earning zero returns. That, surely, is not the path to a happy retirement.

{"Headline": "Asian Tech Start-Ups Quietly Earn Backing", "Date": "2015-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The rise of a mobile software company from nothing to a $1 billion valuation in just over a year from its first product release would typically draw rapt attention, and jealousy, inside Silicon Valley.Yet the Apus Group, one company with such a stratospheric rise, is largely unknown in Silicon Valley. That is because the company is based more than 6,000 miles away, in China.Across Asia, investments in technology start-ups have escalated at the same swift pace and to the same heights as in the United States. In the first six months of this year, 46 Asian start-ups, including Apus, have had fund-raising rounds of $100 million or more, just short of the 48 in North America, according to the research firm CB Insights.The focus of investors in Asia \u2014 China and India in particular \u2014 reflects an increasingly decentralized reality in global technology investment. Asian banks, private equity firms, venture capital funds and hardware and Internet giants are all willing to invest in domestic start-ups. And American investors are increasingly willing to back Asian players with advantages in their home markets.The turmoil in China\u2019s stock market in recent weeks, though, raises new questions about whether the pace of investments will continue. The sharp rise of stocks in China over the previous year helped support many of the big fund-raising rounds. But the steep fall over the past month could keep large Chinese investors and private equity firms away from big rounds because of difficulties with other investments.Last week, the Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi said it had raised $2 billion in two weeks when the stock markets were at their worst. The company originally set out to raise $1.5 billion, but it received so much interest, it was able to raise an extra $500 million.\u201cAlso, top funds still have plenty of venture capital,\u201d Mr. Lee said, \u201cso good tech companies will continue to be able to demand fair valuation.\u201dChina and India have two of the world\u2019s largest smartphone markets, and investors are particularly interested in finding ways to make money from these giants. Small hardware companies that use their knowledge of China\u2019s electronics supply chain to make sensors and novel devices like drones are also drawing attention \u2014 realms of technology not yet dominated by the current power players in the industry, namely Apple, Google and Microsoft.In China, the tech market is protected from outside competition by ferocious local competition as well as censorship and blocks on foreign Internet companies. But Beijing\u2019s Internet filters have not stanched the flow of money from domestic or foreign investors.The huge homegrown Internet companies Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 each is one of the world\u2019s 10 largest Internet companies by market capitalization \u2014 have set the pace in major investments. All three have spent billions over the last two years making strategic investments and acquiring smaller companies that complement their core businesses within China.Twice as many Chinese investors have participated in $100 million or larger fund-raising rounds in China than American investors have in China. Already, that money has helped numerous start-ups reach valuations of $1 billion or more; these companies are now called unicorns. In 2014, 13 new unicorns were created by private investment in Asia compared with 30 in North America, according to CB Insights. So far this year, Asia has generated 11 unicorns to North America\u2019s 19.\u201cIndustries that will be huge are e-commerce and the sharing economy, and you\u2019ve got people writing huge checks in order to be big players in the years to come,\u201d said William Bao Bean, a partner at SOSventures and managing director of Chinaccelerator, which invests in and mentors software start-ups.The rise of the Apus Group illustrates how the market has been working.Within three months of the July 2014 release of the company\u2019s original app \u2014 which works as a skin, or visual interface, that makes the Android operating system easier and more efficient to use \u2014 the company had 40 million downloads, many from users in countries like Indonesia where users of cheap Android phones sought out the software to improve their phones\u2019 functionality.With the increasing pace of adoption, Li Tao, Apus Group\u2019s founder and a first-time entrepreneur, looked to raise money. He talked to a dozen major investors within 45 days and ended up raising $100 million from three venture capital firms with a speed and ease that surprised even Mr. Li.Today, more than 200 million people use Apus apps, which now include a mobile browser and a flashlight, along with the app that improves the performance of a user\u2019s phone.In India, the two largest investments were made by the American hedge fund Tiger Global Management and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Alibaba and its finance affiliate Ant Financial invested $575 million in the Indian mobile commerce company One97, while Tiger made a $500 million investment in India\u2019s leading e-commerce site, Flipkart. Tiger Global has yet to make an investment in the United States this year and has focused 82 percent of its new investments in India at companies in their early stages, according to a June report from CB Insights.\u201cIndia is one of the youngest countries, and their mobile penetration is low,\u201d said Michael Dempsey, an analyst for CB Insights. \u201cWith more than a billion people, why wouldn\u2019t it be one of the next major tech hubs? That\u2019s what investors are thinking.\u201dThough many in China agree that this environment has inflated the prices of some start-ups, few are worried about any sort of bubble, at least so far.Neil Shen, a founding and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China \u2014 which has been one of the most active venture capital investors in China over the last six months \u2014 likened the current situation to that of 15 years ago, when he founded the online travel site Ctrip in China. At the time, he said, many investors put money into companies that failed, and yet out of that period came giants like Tencent and Alibaba, and other smaller businesses like the online media company Sina and the gaming company Shanda.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can avoid bubbles when people are all enthusiastic about the segment. It\u2019s the process of natural selection,\u201d Mr. Shen said, adding that investors and companies that are not sufficiently wise, no matter how well funded, naturally fail.He says he finds good reason to continue investing.\u201cCompared to 15 years ago, when I was an entrepreneur,\u201d Mr. Shen said, \u201cthe opportunity is broader, and more importantly, the entrepreneurs are more experienced.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Bell Rings, Computers Fail, Wall Street Cringes", "Date": "2015-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, however, those working on the trading floor were left helpless when the computer systems at the exchange went down for nearly four hours in the middle of the day, bringing an icon of capitalism\u2019s ceaseless energy to a costly halt.The exchange ultimately returned to action shortly before the closing bell, and stocks continued trading throughout the day on other exchanges, like the Nasdaq and BATS Global Markets.The disruption nonetheless rattled investors, who already had reason to be on edge, considering the Greek debt crisis and an overnight market rout in China. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s index of 500 stocks ended the day down 1.7 percent.\u201cWhen we traded physically we didn\u2019t have these problems, but this is the world that we live in,\u201d said Ted Weisberg, a trader with Seaport Securities who has been on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for nearly 50 years.Stray squirrels, security breaches and, more commonly, technical glitches have caused exchanges around the world to halt.Computer technology has revolutionized the trading of stocks in recent decades, making it faster and more efficient. New powers have emerged, including the Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, a commodities and derivatives trading platform based in Atlanta that acquired the New York Stock Exchange for $8.2 billion in 2013.But there have been hiccups along the way. The Nasdaq stock market went down for three hours in 2013 because of a software bug. The year before, software at Knight Capital Group went awry, leading to errant trades that resulted in losses of $440 million.The problem Wednesday at the New York Stock Exchange is likely to revive a debate about how regulators can make the markets more resistant to computer failings.At the same time, technology has created alternatives that allow trading in the United States to go on, even when its most prominent exchange does not. Stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange were traded on Wednesday in the New Jersey and Chicago data centers of upstart exchanges like BATS, which is based in Lenexa, Kan.\u201cThere are 11 exchanges in the U.S. and one of them went down \u2014 I had 10 other places to go,\u201d said Ryan Larson, the head of stock trading at RBC Global Asset Management. \u201cThe fragmentation of the market helped us today.\u201dIndeed, the overall volume of stock trading on Wednesday appeared to be largely consistent with the amount of daily trading earlier in the week. Other exchanges owned by the New York Stock Exchange, like its options exchange, operated normally on Wednesday throughout the shutdown.The problems at the New York exchange emerged soon after the opening bell rang at 9:30 Wednesday morning, when orders for several smaller stocks failed to go through, traders on the floor said.The initial malfunctions affected only a small number of stocks, and the exchange appeared to get the problem under control, but the difficulties reappeared, on a more widespread basis, later that morning, traders said.On a call with other members of the industry, as the problem grew worse, N.Y.S.E. employees expressed \u201cpanic\u201d and a recognition that they had \u201clost control of the system,\u201d according to a person on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Not long after that call, at 11:32 a.m., the exchange announced that it was shutting down all trading, and said on its website that \u201cadditional information will follow as soon as possible.\u201dOn the floor, traders said the exchange gave them no warning before making the move.\u201cI was about to order my lunch and when I turned around the screens all went blank,\u201d said Peter P. Costa, a trader on the floor with Empire Executions.In the silence that followed, traders on the floor, looking for information, flocked to a ramped area of the huge complex on Wall Street where employees of the exchange are located. The traders were told that the exchange had been updating software before the trading day began, and that the software had contained a bug that could not be fixed without shutting down the system.The exchange\u2019s employees on the floor proceeded to manually cancel around 700,000 trades that were in the system when it was shut down, according to Mr. Costa. Once they had finished, the exchange rebooted its system, a process that took around 45 minutes, Mr. Costa said.Trading ultimately resumed around 3:10 p.m., less than an hour before the closing bell.Several hours later, the exchange put out a statement with few details on what happened, other than to attribute blame to a \u201cconfiguration issue.\u201dThroughout the day, federal regulators and law enforcement agencies monitored the situation for any sign of an outside attack and ultimately saw nothing indicating anything other than an internal software error.President Obama was briefed on the exchange shutdown, a White House aide said, adding that officials there and at the Treasury Department were monitoring the situation.The New York Stock Exchange and its new Atlanta owner, the Intercontinental Exchange, are likely to face questions after the shutdown. ICE, which makes most of its money from automated derivatives trading, has been reducing staff at the New York exchange after stating a goal of cutting $450 million in expenses from the joint company.Recent cuts have hit the exchange\u2019s technology and communications teams, which came under pressure on Wednesday.After the failure began, it took over half an hour for the exchange to broadcast even basic information about the shutdown, to allay concerns that it might have been caused by a malicious attack.An ICE spokeswoman, Sara Rich, denied any suggestion the cuts had an effect. \u201cSince the acquisition, we have been investing to build new systems and technology expertise, and the new trading platform will begin rolling out later this year,\u201d she said.Matthew Goldstein and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Stock Exchange System Failure Draws Attention to Staff Cuts", "Date": "2015-07-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s systems went down during the trading day last week, few longtime employees who had helped lead the exchange during past technical problems were on hand.Since Intercontinental Exchange, known as ICE, bought the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, the company, which is based in Atlanta, has cut hundreds of workers from the exchange. That included almost everyone in the exchange\u2019s top ranks.The disruption last week, which lasted more than three hours, has drawn attention to how quick and deep the cuts have been. In a little more than a year, ICE shed 800 jobs, or about 40 percent of the work force at NYSE-Euronext, the New York exchange\u2019s parent company. It also sold off Euronext, a network of European stock exchanges; renovated the exchange\u2019s building at 11 Wall Street; and moved out of the building next door at 20 Broad Street, the old home of the American Stock Exchange.ICE, which has grown into a juggernaut through a series of acquisitions, mostly of derivatives exchanges, is known for its relentless focus on cost-cutting and efficiency. But the reductions in New York have been under scrutiny because of the possibility that they left the exchange without enough experienced people to manage a crisis like the one it faced last Wednesday.A spokeswoman for ICE, Kelly Loeffler, said the staff cuts obscured larger investments that ICE had made in its New York operation, including the use of employees from Atlanta, who had provided support for the stock exchange\u2019s technology and helped build new trading software to be introduced in the coming months. Ms. Loeffler also said most of the organization\u2019s current hiring was being done in New York.Other technical snags that same Wednesday \u2014 most notably a computer failure that temporarily grounded all United Airlines flights \u2014 initially raised concerns about hackers. But exchange officials said then and have maintained since that the technical problems were caused by updates they were making to the software. The problems first appeared as soon as trading began that day.Other exchanges were unaffected, allowing stock trades to continue almost uninterrupted. But the questions about the shutdown have gained traction because it took the New York exchange nearly four hours to get its old system back online, longer than most recent technical disruptions at other exchanges.\u201cIf your crown jewel is down for four hours, that is a really bad statement,\u201d said Jeffrey Wallis, a veteran market structure analyst who was most recently at SunGard Consulting Services. \u201cIt\u2019s an indictment of our technical abilities and I think we can do better.\u201dIn addition to concerns about the length of the failure, some traders on the floor said it was hard to get information from the New York exchange about the nature of the problem and how long it would take to fix. Senior workers who had served as the go-between with traders during past disruptions left over the last year.\u201cThere used to be regular personnel assigned to have interactions with the membership \u2014 those people aren\u2019t around anymore,\u201d said one floor trader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ms. Loeffler said the exchange still had 150 workers, many of them with long histories on the floor, dealing with traders and customers.Stray squirrels, security breaches and, more commonly, technical glitches have caused exchanges around the world to halt.And the exchange won praise from some large banks, saying they were given regular updates during the failure. \u201cN.Y.S.E.\u2019s communications with the industry were proactive and helpful,\u201d a JPMorgan Chase executive wrote to clients the next day. In its communication with the news media and the outside world, on the day of the failure, the exchange was hobbled by the departure, over the last two years, of its senior media officers. That left ICE to rely on a smaller number of relatively junior employees during the shutdown.When members of the New York exchange\u2019s staff were heard on the phone after the problems first arose, they sounded as though they were struggling to identify and respond to the issues, according to two people involved in calls with the exchange.\u201cThere is frankly a level of experience and expertise that isn\u2019t there,\u201d said a former N.Y.S.E. employee who dealt with the exchange last week on behalf of a new employer, and who was not authorized to speak on the record. \u201cYou deal with enough of these situations and you figure out how to recover from them.\u201dScott Visconti, who is now in charge of the New York exchange\u2019s technology operations, has been at the exchange since just 2012. He replaced people who had more experience with the exchange\u2019s complicated trading system, known as the Universal Trading Platform.The fate of the New York exchange \u2014 and all the related jobs in New York \u2014 was a hot topic when ICE announced that it was buying NYSE-Euronext in late 2012 for $8.2 billion. New York politicians sought assurances from the company that it would not shut down the showplace exchange.Even within the world of stock trading, the New York exchange and its live trading floor have been viewed as an expensive relic vulnerable to closure. The ornate club rooms and expansive offices that ICE bought in New York were built in an earlier era, before electronic trading had eroded the fees that the exchanges collected. Since ICE acquired the stock exchange, stock trading fees have accounted for only about 5 percent of the broader company\u2019s revenue, according to data from Sandler O\u2019Neill.The chief executive of ICE, Jeffrey Sprecher, has said many times that he is committed to keeping open the trading floor and he promised to keep dual headquarters in New York and Atlanta. But he was clear from the first day that he was going to squeeze costs in the combined company.\u201cWe really believe that we can operate this combined business with a lower cost, much lower cost base than the two of us have independently,\u201d Mr. Sprecher said on the day the deal was announced.Mr. Sprecher quickly got rid of almost all of the top executives at the New York exchange. The deputy whom Mr. Sprecher installed in New York, a 39-year-old former college baseball player, Thomas Farley, quickly set out to renovate the exchange\u2019s main building on Wall Street to improve communication, to make room for more workers and eliminate the need for the building next door.Mr. Farley has also led an effort to build a new basic trading system, known as Pillar, for the stock exchange. But for the time being, the exchange is still running on its old software. Former employees said they worried that ICE got rid of many of the senior staff who knew the intricacies of the old system before phasing it out.Mr. Wallis said that organizations often made the mistake of putting resources into new software and not spending enough to maintain the existing infrastructure. \u201cThat\u2019s always a risk when you thin out your staff,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Markets Fall Again, Ignoring Beijing\u2019s Efforts to Soothe Them", "Date": "2015-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s stock markets plunged in the final hour of trading on Wednesday, as a series of government measures on Monday night and through the day on Tuesday to prop up share prices once again proved to have little enduring effect.The Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had seemed to recover on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning after Chinese government agencies, companies and trade groups issued upbeat statements. The Chinese Finance Ministry said that it might allow the national pension fund to buy stocks, the China Securities Regulatory Commission denounced \u201cirresponsible rumors\u201d of market weakness and the government-affiliated Asset Management Association of China declared that a \u201cstructural rally is brewing.\u201dSome analysts detected possible signs of large-scale, coordinated buying late Tuesday afternoon by state-controlled enterprises. Guotai, one of China\u2019s biggest brokerage firms, talked of plans to make it even easier for investors to trade stocks with borrowed money.But by Wednesday afternoon, none of these measures seemed to have persuaded investors that now is a good time to own Chinese stocks. Share prices wilted, as waves of selling pushed the Shanghai stock market to a 5.2 percent loss and the Shenzhen market to a 4.8 percent decline.With a handful of exceptions, Chinese regulations do not allow the price of a company\u2019s shares to fall more than 10 percent in a single day. So losses as large as Wednesday\u2019s are a sign that some listings fell to the limit and may fall further on Thursday.Wednesday\u2019s decline represented the second time in three days that government measures to shore up support for the stock market failed to have a lasting effect. After the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets each fell more than 7 percent on Friday, China\u2019s central bank reduced interest rates late Saturday for one-year bank loans and deposits by a quarter percentage point and told banks that they could hold less of their deposits as reserves, freeing them to lend more.But after rising in the first hour of trading on Monday on the Chinese central bank\u2019s action, the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets both descended into bear markets later in the day, with prices more than 20 percent below their high on June 12.Even after recent declines, China\u2019s stock markets still have nearly doubled in the past 12 months. They have risen to these heights on a combination of heavy lending to investors by brokerage firms, hints that government stimulus programs might help the economy recover from a weak spring and numerous statements from government-controlled news organizations saying that stocks represented good investments.The Shanghai market on Wednesday gave up essentially all of its gains from its rebound on Tuesday, closing at 4,053.7 \u2014 virtually indistinguishable from its close on Monday of 4,053.03. The Shenzhen market ended up slightly below its Monday close, at its lowest level since May 8.Investors\u2019 worries may have increased with the Chinese government\u2019s release on Wednesday of its official survey of manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 expectations during June for sales, orders and other indicators of commercial health. The survey was unchanged from May at 50.2, showing a very slight expansion in growth; many economists had expected an improvement, given that the Chinese government has been pursuing a series of stimulus measures that have included stepping up spending on new rail lines and other infrastructure as well as four reductions in interest rates since November.The market decline on Wednesday created a flurry of dark humor on the Chinese Internet. Huashang Daily, a newspaper based in Xi\u2019an, in west-central China, tried to interact with its 2.5 million followers on Weibo, a Chinese social media service, in a discussion of reactions to the market.\u201cShot up yesterday, only to plunge today, how is your heart? Drop a line to describe your mood trading stocks recently,\u201d the newspaper posted around 3:30 p.m. Responses included: \u201cSuicidal,\u201d \u201cSpeechless,\u201d \u201cBe careful,\u201d \u201cThrill is exactly what I need,\u201d and even \u201cHappy Birthday CPC,\u201d a swipe at the anniversary, coincidentally on Wednesday, of the Communist Party of China.Michael Howell, the managing director of CrossBorder Capital, a London-based research firm that specializes in analyzing money flows, said that broad measurements of liquidity in China \u2014 bank credit, informal loans, bonds and other securities \u2014 had been rising strongly in recent months as the central bank has been trying to push the economy toward faster growth. The fall in Chinese stock markets now, he said, shows that they \u201cmay be decoupled from generous liquidity fundamentals \u2014 bubbles can have a life of their own.\u201dPatrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Exchange-Traded Funds for the Active-Minded", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith the growing popularity of exchange-traded funds, the industry is churning out new products targeted at investors\u2019 needs, fears and greed.Many of these innovations are simply being ignored, and although it is still too early to tell for sure, actively traded E.T.F.s have fallen into that category.Actively traded E.T.F.s have yet to burn up the track with mainstream investors, who mostly cling to passive funds that mirror indexes that are benchmarks for stocks, bonds and other investments. Unlike their passive cousins, active E.T.F.s feature a hands-on manager who can take the reins of a portfolio and make daily decisions on how to best invest, much as in a traditional mutual fund.As a relatively new product, such active funds have been evolving over the last seven years. Of the 10 largest funds in this category, six manage bond portfolios.To date, though, this approach has had little appeal. Slightly more than $20 billion is spread across 133 active exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar. That is about 1 percent of the total market for E.T.F.s.Within this group, there\u2019s no superstar fund with megabillions in investor dollars. The largest active fund is the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active E.T.F. (MINT), with about $3.5 billion in assets. That\u2019s a flea compared with its flagship sister Pimco Total Return Bond fund (Pttax), which holds more than $107 billion. One of the largest American stock exchange-traded funds is the SPDR S.&P. 500 index fund (SPY) with more than $180 billion as of June 19.The main argument for active funds is that a dynamic manager can reach beyond a static portfolio to add value by moving in and out of investments. With bonds and stocks becoming skittish as the Federal Reserve comes closer to raising interest rates, active managers may be able to provide an extra measure of flexibility that will dodge market downturns.Ideally, an active fund can combine low costs, daily transparency of fund holdings and the nimbleness of a capable manager who can spot trouble in the market \u2014 or seize profitable opportunities.\u201cAlthough cost is one of best determinants of success,\u201d says Robert Goldsborough, exchange-traded fund analyst for Morningstar, \u201cgood managers can add value.\u201dLet\u2019s say you were concerned about rising interest rates, which generally drive down bond prices and hurt longer-maturity bonds the most. You may favor a bond fund that can search for yield while keeping market risk low.The Pimco Enhanced Fund holds corporate and Treasury bonds that mature in less than a year while yielding 0.72 percent. The fund charges 0.35 percent in annual expenses. If you are looking for an ultrashort bond fund that will not feel much of a pinch when rates rise, this is a consideration.Active funds may also invest in specialized niches or alternative strategies that are bypassed by larger index funds that cover broad sections of particular markets.The First Trust North American Energy Infrastructure fund (EMLP) \u2014 the third-largest active E.T.F. by assets \u2014 invests in publicly traded energy companies and master limited partnerships, which are complicated vehicles known for their high yields and tax complexity.The First Trust fund yields 3 percent and returned nearly 24 percent last year compared with a broad-based energy stock benchmark, which lost 18 percent. If you were looking for a specialized play on the companies benefiting most from the North American shale oil and gas boom, this fund would be worth considering.Although it is still early to see how well active funds will do over time, some new entrants have posted notable performances in recent months as the bond market swoons in anticipation of higher rates in the United States.The SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical E.T.F. (TOTL), a bond fund, has edged out a general bond index, returning 0.20 percent in the last three months through June 19, compared with a loss of about 1 percent for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index, a gauge for the American bond market. While that is hardly impressive, it may be significant if the fund\u2019s managers can make money as bond prices fall, which will be more pronounced if the Fed announces a rate increase.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more interest in active bond E.T.F.s,\u201d notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of exchange-traded and mutual fund research with S&P Capital IQ in New York. \u201cThe DoubleLine fund is worth looking at because of low risk and management.\u201dAs with any actively managed product, though, investors face the possibility of failing to beat benchmarks over time after subtracting market timing errors and fund expenses. Most funds cannot consistently beat their respective indexes over time. Over the five years through 2014, some 88 percent of large-stock funds failed to beat their benchmarks, according to S&P/Dow Jones Indices.For long-maturity government bond funds, the record is even worse: 95 percent of funds tracked by S&P/Dow Jones did not outpace their peer index over the last decade.Costs are also a concern with active funds, since hands-on management always adds to total expenses. The First Trust fund, for example, charges a hefty 0.95 percent for annual management, a relatively high expense level in the E.T.F. world, where an investor can hold a broad-based stock index fund for as little as 0.04 percent.Another difficulty is gauging precisely how well a fund is doing relative to its peers. Elisabeth Kashner, an analyst with ETF.com, notes that there is really no appropriate index for the portfolio managed by the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity fund. \u201cMost of the top 10 active E.T.F.s are difficult to benchmark,\u201d Ms. Kashner said.Of course, much of active investing is built on hope and the prospect that you can find a manager whose experience will help you beat the market in the future. It has happened with stellar managers such as Peter Lynch of Fidelity; Bill Miller of Legg Mason; and Bill Gross, late of Pimco, now with Janus Funds. But it may be a matter of pure luck to find a market-beating manager. You risk even more if you try to time the market.\u201cThis is clearly a fund for trading,\u201d John Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, says of actively managed funds. \u201cIt involves being right twice \u2014 once when you get in and again when you get out.\u201dIf you venture into active funds, it makes sense to take time to examine what is in a portfolio. How is it different from a passive version? How is it likely to perform under changing market conditions given the manager\u2019s strategy? Would it be more or less risky than a conventional index fund?If working with an adviser, you might ask how an active fund would help your portfolio\u2019s diversification or potentially increase returns.Ultimately, what will determine the success of active E.T.F.s is how they perform when the chips are down in losing markets. If they can outrun the bad times, they will gain attention.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Greece\u2019s Lenders Need to Suffer", "Date": "2015-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyThere is definitive proof, for anyone willing to look, that Greece is not solely or even primarily responsible for its own financial crisis. The proof is not especially exciting: It is a single bond, with the identification code GR0133004177. But a consideration of this bond should end, permanently, any discussion of Greece\u2019s crisis as a moral failing on the part of the Greeks.GR0133004177 is the technical name for a bond the Greek government sold on Nov. 10, 2009, in a public auction. Every business day, governments and companies hold auctions like this; it is how they borrow money. Bond auctions, though, are not at all like the auctions we\u2019re used to seeing in movies, with the fast talkers and the loud hammers. They happen silently, electronically. Investors all over the world type a number on their keyboards and submit it as their bid: the amount of interest they would insist on receiving in exchange for the loan. Just as with mortgages and credit cards, the riskier a loan is, the higher the rate would need to be, compensating the lender for the chance that the borrower in question will fail to pay it back.We think of stocks as the paradigmatic investment, but bonds are the single most important force in the financial world, determining which companies and economies rise and which collapse. A bond is a form of i.o.u.; when a government or a company issues one, it is actually borrowing money with a precisely defined promise to pay it back after a specified period of time at a set interest rate. Every bond has the same basic criteria: duration, yield and risk. This means that bonds can be easily compared and traded. The typical bond may be resold dozens of times over its lifetime, for a discount or a premium on its issuing price, based on how the market feels the prospects for that issuer have changed. The current price of old bonds is updated constantly, providing a real-time scorecard for the relative riskiness of those issuing bonds, from the government of Kazakhstan to Citibank to your local hospital.Forget the global fight against terrorism or the Internet and globalization: When historians come to write of our age, the time we are living through now, they may well call it the age of bonds. This age began in 1944, near the end of World War II, when sober men in suits gathered in Bretton Woods, N.H., to prevent future wars. What they wound up creating was the basic architecture of a new global financial system, in which rational economic calculus, not military and political power or ancient prejudices, would determine where money flows.For decades, this was a much better world. Federal bonds funded the growth of an American highway infrastructure and created a truly national economy; municipal bonds brought the South out of its agrarian doldrums. In Europe, the impact was even greater. European bonds allowed money to flow freely across borders, knitting disparate states that had warred for millenniums into one unified economy. More prosaically, bonds provided objective rigor to the funding of private companies\u2019 activities, helping to break up a cozy, WASPy boys\u2019 club that had determined which enterprises got to borrow money.On that day in 2009 when GR0133004177 was issued, investors had every reason to assume that this was an especially risky loan. The Greek government wanted 7 billion euros, or $10.5 billion, which would not be paid back in full until 2026. These were all sophisticated investors, who were expected to think very carefully about the number they typed, because that number had to reflect their belief in the Greek government\u2019s ability to continually pay its debts for the next 17 years. I was shocked, looking back, to see the winning number: 5.3 percent. That is a very low interest rate, only a couple of percentage points above the rate at which Germany, Europe\u2019s most creditworthy nation, was borrowing money. This was a rate that expressed a near certainty that Greece would never miss a payment.In hindsight, of course, we know that the investors should not have lent Greece anything at all, or, if they did, should have demanded something like 100 percent interest. But this is not a case of retrospective genius. At the time, investors had all the information they needed to make a smarter decision. Greece, then as now, was a small, poor, largely agrarian economy, with a spotty track record for adhering to globally recognized financial controls. Just three weeks earlier, a newly elected Greek prime minister revealed that the previous government had scrupulously hidden billions of dollars in debt from the rest of the world. In fact, the new leader revealed, Greece owed considerably more money than the size of its entire annual economy. Within a month of the bond sale, faced with essentially the same information the investors had, Moody\u2019s and the other ratings agencies downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating. In less than six months, Greece was negotiating a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.The original sin of the Greek crisis did not happen in Athens. It happened on those computer terminals, in Frankfurt and London and Shanghai and New York. Yes, the Greeks took the money. But if I offered you \u20ac7 billion at 5.3 percent interest, you would probably take the money, too. I would be the one who looked nuts. And if I didn\u2019t even own that money \u2014 if I was just watching over it for someone else, as most large investors do \u2014 I might even go to jail.Today, the global bond market is twice the size of the stock market. And while bonds barely move in price compared with stocks, bonds\u2019 slight twitches give far more important information. A slight increase in a bond\u2019s interest rate can serve as a warning that investors no longer trust a company or a government quite so much; a drop in rates can be a reward for hard work accomplished, allowing an institution to raise future funds at a lower long-term cost. But a world of bonds works only when the investors who buy the bonds are extremely nervous and wildly cautious. Bonds, that is, are designed to be safe and boring investments, bought by extremely conservative institutions, like pension funds, insurance companies and central banks. When they are bought by (or on behalf of) private investors, they are supposed to represent the more stable portion of the overall mix. The very nature of stock markets inclines them to collapse every decade or so, and when they do, it can be painful. But a stock-market collapse is not debilitating. If the world bond market were to collapse, our way of life would be over.On Sept. 17, 2008, in the late afternoon, this almost happened. For a few dramatic days, prominent economists and other financial experts \u2014 serious, unemotional people who had never before said anything shocking in their lives \u2014 talked privately, if not publicly, about the real possibility of the end of the United States, the end of electricity and industry and democracy. When the bailout money flowed to save the banks, that was just the fastest way to accomplish the real goal: to save the bond market.And in that moment, the essential nature of the bond market shifted. Previously, the stability of bonds was reinforced by the cautiousness of people who owned and managed them, and vice versa. But the bailout broke this virtuous circle, signaling that the bond market would stay safe even when bond buyers were wildly reckless, pouring billions of dollars, for example, into risky subprime-mortgage bonds. The bailout represented a transfer of wealth from the rest of the economy into the bond market \u2014 precisely the opposite of what is supposed to happen. Now, in the moral hand-wringing over Greece and its failure to pay, we see that bondholders expect to be bailed out constantly, even when they were obviously culpable in failing to manage their own risk. The various European Union plans for Greece involve what is essentially a transfer of wealth from poor Greek people to wealthy German bondholding institutions.The institutions that bought that \u20ac7 billion in Greek debt in 2009 made a very bad judgment. Even at the time, it was clearly a foolish gamble \u2014 so foolish, in fact, that it can be explained in only one way. They believed that in the event of default, the Germans would bail the Greeks out. And just to be clear: This doesn\u2019t mean they believed that the Germans would be kind to the Greeks. It means they believed that the Germans would be kind to the people who owned Greek bonds, a significant percentage of whom were certain to be German themselves. In lending money to Greece at 5.3 percent interest, they weren\u2019t calculating Greece\u2019s ability to pay. They were calculating the German government\u2019s willingness to help out German banks.To be fair, the people who owned GR0133004177 did see its value fall by nearly half in 2012, when the Greek government negotiated its second bailout package with the European Union and the I.M.F. But by most estimates, those bondholders should have lost far more, even the full amount of their investment. Instead, the bailout effectively transferred billions of euros from Greek citizens to unwise bond investors.There is an unsentimental logic to markets. If you make a bad investment, you are supposed to pay the full price \u2014 because if you don\u2019t pay the full price, you will keep making bad investments. The only way to get the bond market back to its historic role is to make bondholders feel real fear that they might lose money if they make bad decisions. We need the market to reward bets that are economically wise, instead of those that are politically savvy.Adam Davidson is a contributing writer for the magazine and a founder of NPR\u2019s \u201cPlanet Money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said the relatively subdued reaction showed \u201cthe market has gotten used to the strange things that have been going on with Greece.\u201d He said it also reflected investors\u2019 confidence that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, would take whatever action was necessary to soothe tensions at a moment of crisis.\u201cThat\u2019s preventing markets from going down too much,\u201d Mr. Gijsels said.By the end of the day, nine of the 10 industry groups in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were down. But the index itself had fallen a modest 0.4 percent.Still, many investors were clearly nervous, putting money into assets considered safe bets in turbulent times like United States government bonds. A rout in the stocks of oil drillers and other energy companies fed the selling as the price of oil plunged nearly 8 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to end at 17,683.58. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 8.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,068.76, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 17.27 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,991.94. In Europe, Germany\u2019s DAX fell 1.5 percent while the CAC-40 in France fell 2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.8 percent lower.In Asia on Monday, the Shanghai market jumped sharply in early trading as the Chinese government began pouring money into brokerage firms to help them and their customers buy shares. But the market quickly surrendered those gains, closing 2.4 percent higher. In early trading Tuesday, Chinese shares continued their fall, dropping almost 2 percent. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 1.2 percent early Tuesday, and MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which fell to a six-month low on Monday, was up 0.3 percent.Bonds in Italy, Portugal and Spain, seen as the most exposed to any potential contagion from the Greek crisis, all fell, and their yields spiked higher, indicating that those governments\u2019 borrowing costs could rise.In contrast, yields on British, German and United States government bonds fell, as investors turned toward assets they considered safer. The yield on the 10-year American Treasury note fell to 2.29 percent, from 2.39 percent late Thursday, a big move. United States markets were closed on Friday for the Fourth of July holiday.The major exception was in yields on Greek bonds, which have been little traded since the country\u2019s financial markets were closed last week. The price of the Greek two-year crashed and its yield rose to an astonishingly high 48 percent \u2014 almost 15 percentage points higher than on Friday. The yield for comparable German debt was less than 1 percent.The Greek bonds\u2019 movement has little practical effect on the government\u2019s borrowing costs as the country has been shut out of the capital markets and has issued no new bonds lately. But their plummeting value further undermines the Greek banks, which are the biggest private holders of the country\u2019s sovereign debt.And because Greek banks use their government\u2019s bonds as collateral against loans from the European Central Bank, the plunge could make it even more difficult for the central bank to agree to continue lending to the banks.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Addressing the possibility that the central bank might force Greece\u2019s hand before European political leaders have been able to formulate their own response, the French finance minister, Michel Sapin, on Monday told Europe 1 radio that the European Central Bank \u201cmust not cut\u201d its support for Greek banks.United States oil prices fell the most in three months after Greece\u2019s rejection of the debt bailout terms and after China\u2019s measures to support its stock markets.Also taking a toll on the energy market were talks between Iran and world powers to meet a Tuesday deadline on a nuclear deal. That deal could release more oil into already oversupplied markets if sanctions on Iran are eased.Among American stocks making big moves, Aetna sank $8.08, to $117.43, a 6.4 percent loss. That was the biggest slide in the S.&P. 500. The company agreed last week to buy a rival health insurer, Humana, for $35 billion.The euro fell 0.5 percent, to $1.1057. The dollar slipped 0.3 percent, to 122.54 Japanese yen.Gold rose $9.90, to $1,172.90 an ounce, for July contracts. Silver rose 19 cents, to $15.73 an ounce, and copper fell 9 cents, to $2.54 a pound.Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, fell $3.78 to close at $56.54 in London.In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline fell 11 cents to close at $1.924 a gallon; heating oil fell 13.1 cent to close at $1.709 a gallon; and natural gas fell 6.6 cents to close at $2.756 per 1,000 cubic feet.Kymberly Martin, a currency strategist at the Bank of New Zealand, said that the Greek vote and China\u2019s stock market decline both tended to have similar effects on currencies and stock markets.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to disentangle what proportion is the eurozone and what proportion is China,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably both factors are affecting the market in the same direction.\u201dE. William Stone, the executive vice president and chief investment strategist at the PNC Asset Management Group in Philadelphia, said that Greece would be the dominant influence on markets, particularly in Europe and the United States. While the Shanghai stock market has lost more than a quarter of its value since June 12, it is still up nearly 80 percent from a year ago.\u201cIt almost seems like the Chinese authorities are overreacting,\u201d he said.In Hong Kong, where shares closed 3.2 percent lower, investors appeared to be paying considerably more attention to China than Greece.Roger Lam, a 63-year-old retired office worker who was watching computer monitors at a downtown brokerage firm, said: \u201cAnyone who says China does not have the ability to hold up the stock markets in China is a fool. They have just not seen the mighty power of the Chinese government.\u201d David Jolly reported from Paris, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "The Bumbling, Irrelevant New York Stock Exchange", "Date": "2015-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe good news, if there is any, for the New York Stock Exchange and its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange, is that the extraordinary, nearly four-hour trading halt on Wednesday appears to have been caused by a glitch related to a recently implemented software upgrade. \u201cThe issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach,\u201d the N.Y.S.E. tweeted soon after it halted trading at 11:32 a.m. \u201cWe chose to suspend trading on N.Y.S.E. to avoid problems arising from our technical issue. N.Y.S.E.-listed securities continue to trade unaffected on other market centers.\u201dThat\u2019s comforting. Can you imagine the justifiable panic that would have roiled stock markets if the interruption had been caused by a cyberattack or terrorist attack, or because of contagion from the continuing collapse of the Chinese stock market, which has fallen between 30 percent and 40 percent (depending on the index) since June 12, or because Greece is on the verge of defaulting on its 315 billion euro (about $350 billion) public debt and leaving the eurozone? If those, or some other nefarious reasons, had been the proximate cause of the problem, we would probably be well on the way to the market correction that most professional investors feel is inevitable, given that the market has been on a tear for more than six years and continues to trade near record highs.Instead, according to Thomas W. Farley, the president of the N.Y.S.E., a plain-vanilla technical glitch caused him to make the decision to halt trading two hours after the market opened for the day. Mr. Farley told Bloomberg TV that soon after the market opened, customers weren\u2019t getting the \u201cmessages\u201d they were expecting to get, whatever that means. (The precise reason for the shutdown is still being investigated.) He said he could have switched trading over to the emergency backup system but chose instead to shut down the N.Y.S.E. while technicians scrambled to identify and fix the problem. He said this was more a customer-friendly solution since switching to the emergency system requires complicated interfaces and would have caused customers even more sturm und drang than did the halt. Besides, he made clear, most N.Y.S.E.-listed stocks also trade on other exchanges, so most people would not have experienced interruptions. In the end, trading resumed at 3:18 p.m., leaving another 42 minutes for the market to perfect its 261-point loss for the day and to make sure investors knew what would be considered the \u201clast sale\u201d of the day, a metric mutual funds are required to note in every stock.But for all of Mr. Farley\u2019s polish in the face of corporate embarrassment, the truth is that the N.Y.S.E. long ago lost its dominance over the stock market, with the final blow coming in March 2006 when the veritable New York Stock Exchange, then owned by its 1,366 seat holders, completed its merger with Archipelago Holdings, an electronic-trading company. The new publicly traded company became a mere facilitator of trades or the place to go to ring \u201cthe bell\u201d after a company\u2019s initial public offering. The floor of the N.Y.S.E. is little more than an elaborate backdrop for the cable-TV business programs at CNBC and Fox. Computers, some high-speed, some not, rule the markets for equity, for debt, for commodities, whatever. The United States alone has 11 exchanges and something like 50 places that stocks can be traded off exchanges. The volume of stocks traded on the N.Y.S.E. is a fraction of what it once was.Sure men \u2014 and the very occasional woman \u2014 seem to be scurrying around from post to post in their colorful jackets acting as if they have important things to do. But this is just an elaborate charade. Specialists rarely make markets in particular stocks anymore; instead they wait around all day to record the last sale for reporting purposes. Very little trading, if any at all, takes place on the floor of the N.Y.S.E.; trading is now the province of computers, which now take, match and fill orders night and day. Men have very little to do with it. It\u2019s all about speed, proximity to the data center and tweaking algorithms inside powerful hedge funds. It has nothing to do with liquidity, or making markets. That, too, is left to the computers.That\u2019s why Wednesday\u2019s trading interruption is really just a public-relations problem. Instead of explaining what was going on in real time, N.Y.S.E. executives said nothing, leading nervous investors to think the worst. The N.Y.S.E. failure also came around the same time that a glitch with a router grounded United Airlines flights and that The Wall Street Journal\u2019s website went dark. Were the glitches somehow coordinated? In the absence of an explanation from the N.Y.S.E., that seemed to be the big question everyone was asking. The best the N.Y.S.E. could muster early on was that it was working on \u201ca technical issue\u201d that it was trying to resolve \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201dAs recently as Monday, the N.Y.S.E. had plenty to say about its prowess in being the place companies go to raise equity capital. During the first half of 2015, the N.Y.S.E. trumpeted in a press release that a total of $94 billion was raised in 264 transactions \u2014 \u201cmore than any other exchange in the world\u201d \u2014 including some 42 companies that raised $12 billion from I.P.O.s. \u201cNothing has the power to unlock capital to drive innovation, create new jobs and enable long-term growth like an I.P.O.,\u201d said Garvis Toler, head of global capital markets at the N.Y.S.E. \u201cWe take seriously our role in the capital formation process and are proud of our flawless track record of execution on behalf of our issuers.\u201d Ring that bell!What a difference a few days makes. Given the dominance of computer-driven trading and execution, service interruptions caused by introducing new software are probably here to stay. Of course, we want the latest software because it does all sorts of exciting new things faster and better than before. But why should introducing new software on the N.Y.S.E. be any different from oading your iPhone with iOS 8.4? Sometimes it crashes your phone, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.The good news is that generally speaking, trading in stocks continues virtually uninterrupted around the world, despite technical glitches. One day, of course, trading will halt around the world in a coordinated cyberattack. That would be truly terrifying: an interruption in the one thing finance exists to do \u2014 allocate capital. The most frightening thing on Wednesday \u2014 that the N.Y.S.E. failed to let everyone know in a timely fashion that its problems were nothing more than a few messages that didn\u2019t get through to customers \u2014 was a lot tamer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ace and Chubb Face Headwinds of History", "Date": "2015-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAce has set itself the task of overcoming the ghosts of insurance deals past.The property and casualty insurer, which is based in Zurich, is buying its rival, Chubb, for $28.3 billion in cash and stock. Prospective savings won\u2019t cover the premium being paid, implying that Ace believes strongly in the revenue gains it is promising. They don\u2019t always materialize as planned.Similar top-line increases were trumpeted in the union announced a day earlier between the insurance broker Willis Group and the consultant firm Towers Watson of the United States. Extra profit from two companies that sell each other\u2019s products often proves elusive. And as a rationale for deals, revenue synergies come to the fore when the merger market is hot, as now. The $2.2 trillion of global deals to June this year topped the volume in the first half of 2014 by 40 percent.The 30 percent premium over Tuesday\u2019s closing share price that Ace is offering Chubb owners amounts to about $7.1 billion. About $650 million of anticipated annual cost savings would be worth about $5.3 billion today, taxed and capitalized.There could be tax benefits, too. Though Chubb will keep paying United States tax on domestic revenue, the bill could drop by $60 million a year if Ace\u2019s lower 18.2 percent effective tax rate last year applies to a quarter of Chubb\u2019s 2014 pretax income \u2014 for approximately $600 million of value today.That leaves a shortfall of more than $1 billion for Ace\u2019s chief executive, Evan Greenberg \u2014 who will run the combined entity \u2014 to justify. The companies talk about \u201csubstantial additional revenue\u201d after the merger. Ace reckons it can peddle its insurance offerings to Chubb\u2019s midsize American business clients and Chubb can serve Ace\u2019s rich overseas customers with its upscale policies.Sanford I. Weill had a similar vision for Citicorp and Travelers that failed to materialize. So did two insurers in the United States worker disability market. Provident and Unum experienced big gains in their stocks when they announced a $5.2 billion merger in November 1998 on the back of plans for their sales teams to market the other\u2019s wares.Those hopes were dashed, however. The deal cost more than expected, cutting costs turned out to be a challenge and cultures clashed, leading to higher policy prices, bitter customers and a collapse of the company\u2019s market value. Ace and Chubb have to rewrite that history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cooling of China\u2019s Stock Market Dents Major Driver of Economic Growth", "Date": "2015-07-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 As the usual drivers of economic growth have faltered in China, the stock market euphoria has helped pick up the slack, driven by a slate of businesses feeding off the frenzy.With the market now cooling, the Chinese economy is losing a major boost, adding pressure on the government to take further action.\u201cDefinitely, it can\u2019t last,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, a China economist at Capital Economics, referring to the stock market\u2019s lift to the country\u2019s growth. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable.\u201dThe Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.The stock market rise was fast and furious. At their peak in mid-June, China\u2019s main share indexes, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, had more than doubled over the course of a year.\u201cWhat stands out in China\u2019s case is the sheer velocity of the increase in prices,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote this week in a research note. To find a comparable performance in the United States, they had to go back to the 12 months that ended in July 1933, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 124 percent after the inauguration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the devaluation of the dollar against gold.The Chinese stock market rally has made for big business at the country\u2019s financial firms, a sharp contrast to the slump in manufacturing, real estate and other traditional sources of growth. It also gave banks, brokerage firms and other financial companies an outsize importance in the economy as a whole.In the first quarter of the year \u2014 the most recent comparison available \u2014 the output of the finance industry accounted for 1.3 percentage points of China\u2019s 7 percent growth rate. That compared with a contribution of about 0.7 percentage point to the 7.4 percent growth in all of 2014. It accounted for 15.9 percent of overall G.D.P. in the first quarter.On Wednesday, China reported that its economy in the second quarter increased by 7 percent, in line with government targets. Economists said the expansion had been helped by rising output from the financial industry.\u201cEven if equity prices recover and the market rebounds, we won\u2019t see the same level of turnover,\u201d Mr. Evans-Pritchard said.Securities firms were quick to cash in on their newfound sway and their own inflated market valuations.So far this year, Chinese brokerage houses have raised more than $31 billion selling new shares in themselves on the mainland and in Hong Kong, more than five times as much as any previous annual total, according to the data provider Dealogic. Much of that money has been earmarked for expanding their margin financing businesses, in which they lend money to stock market investors.But China\u2019s market rally has cooled drastically in recent weeks. After rebounding for several days last week on strong signs of government support, mainland stocks slipped again on Wednesday. Shanghai\u2019s main index was down 3 percent at close and Shenzhen\u2019s shed 4.2 percent. From its peak on June 12, the Shanghai index has fallen 26 percent, and Shenzhen shares are down 34 percent. Across both markets, stocks have lost a combined $3 trillion in market value in the last month. The breadth of the stock market sell-off poses risks to the country\u2019s growth outlook in the coming months. Fearing the rout, hundreds of companies suspended their shares from trading, creating an overhang that is only slowly being worked through as those stocks resume trading, usually to fall in value. Investors are also deleveraging as they sell shares, though hundreds of billions of dollars in margin financing remains outstanding.Wang Tao, the chief China economist at UBS, calculated that, if the stock market volume fell to pre-rally levels, the slower activity in the finance sector could shave as much as a half a percentage point off China\u2019s G.D.P. in the second half of the year, when compared with the first half. \u201cSuch a loss would need to be offset by other measures, including more fiscal support for further infrastructure spending to beef up investment,\u201d she said.China has been seeking to counter its industrial slowdown through expanded infrastructure investment, including a combined 1.6 trillion renminbi, or $261 billion, to be spent this year on new rail lines and water treatment centers. These spending initiatives come alongside assertive stimulus measures taken by the central bank, which has cut benchmark interest rates four times since November.These measures appear to be helping the broader economy. While economists have for years expressed concerns about the quality of China\u2019s economic data, separate quarterly figures released on Wednesday for retail sales, investment and industrial production were all better than forecast, suggesting a trend of stabilizing economic growth despite the volatile markets.The leadership in Beijing has already demonstrated its readiness to prop up the stock market through direct and indirect support. This month, the central bank said it would underwrite a new $120 billion stock market stabilization fund, regulators suspended new share offerings and the police said they would seek to investigate short-sellers and market manipulators. On Wednesday, the government further appeared to signal its determination not to allow the sliding market to weigh on growth.\u201cThe Chinese government has the ability and confidence to prevent regional or systemic risks from occurring,\u201d Sheng Laiyun, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said on Wednesday at a news conference in Beijing. He added, \u201cIt has the ability, conditions and confidence to promote the stable development of the stock market and of the national economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Historic Art Proves to Be a Hard Sell in London", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 And finally, the old stuff.This week, to round off Europe\u2019s hectic summer season of commercial art events, London held its traditional July series of auctions and gallery shows devoted to the sort of historic works that 50 years ago topped the wish lists of the world\u2019s wealthiest collectors.These days, Rubens, Guercino and Romney are not the sort of names that most billionaires covet. In its 25th anniversary \u201c200 Top Collectors\u201d survey published on Tuesday, the American magazine ARTnews found that just 10 percent of its sample of top-tier art buyers collects old masters. That figure is down from 15 percent in 1990. Meanwhile, 90 percent of those surveyed buy contemporary art, up 29 percent from 1990. With Greece in danger of crashing out of the eurozone, and stocks in China losing more than 30 percent of their value in the past month, old masters proved a more challenging sell than ever in London.On Wednesday, Sotheby\u2019s held a 57-lot auction of old master and British paintings. A modest 65 percent of the works sold, raising 39.3 million pounds, or about $60.4 million, just above the low estimate of \u00a335.1 million. The company\u2019s equivalent sale last year drew \u00a368.3 million.The evening did have its successes. A highly commercial 1520s Lucas Cranach the Elder painting of the \u201cBocca della Verit\u00e1 (Mouth of Truth),\u201d depicting an adulteress cunningly outwitting a sculpture\u2019s ability to detect lies, sold to an American telephone bidder for \u00a39.3 million. A sensitive 1652 portrait by the Dutch painter Ferdinand Bol of a boy, said to be the artist\u2019s son, aged 8, sold to an Asian telephone bidder for \u00a35.2 million. Both had been exhibited in China ahead of the sale. Fresh to the market, they sold above estimate and their prices were also auction highs for the artists.But swaths of Sotheby\u2019s sale drew little demand, despite it being deemed fresher and superior in quality to what Christie\u2019s would offer the following evening. Old master dealers, the traditional default buyers at auctions, bought just 20 percent of the lots, confirming how difficult it is for traders to sell historic pictures at art fairs and in their galleries.\u201cIt was a bloodless, lifeless sale,\u201d said Cliff Schorer, a Boston collector who is the financial backer of the 198-year-old London dealer Agnew\u2019s, which has just opened a new gallery in St. James\u2019s Place, near Christie\u2019s.Demand fell even more drastically the following night at Christie\u2019s, where an imposing mid-18th-century view of Dresden from the right bank of the Elbe by Bernardo Bellotto, the nephew of Canaletto, failed to sell against a low estimate of \u00a38 million, despite being fresh to the market and in good condition, Christie\u2019s said.Once again, there was little bidding from dealers in the room. Pieter Brueghel the Younger\u2019s copies of his father\u2019s favorite compositions have always been a mainstay at the TEFAF Maastricht fair, but dealers watched impassively as three out of four offered works by the artist failed to sell. These included an unsigned example of one of the artist\u2019s 45 \u201cBird Trap\u201d winter scenes, valued at what dealers apparently regarded as an over-ambitious \u00a32 million to \u00a33 million.The top price of the sale was the mid-estimate \u00a32.5 million given by a telephone bidder for an atmospheric early 19th-century oil of a coastal landscape by Richard Parkes Bonington. Oils by this short-lived British painter are extremely rare, and the price dwarfed the previous auction high of \u00a3341,000 for the artist \u2014 set the day before at Sotheby\u2019s for one of his much-admired watercolors.Christie\u2019s evening sale had been depleted by the withdrawal of six old master paintings with a value of at least \u00a35.3 million from the foundation of the South African mining magnate Alfred Beit. These works had formerly hung in Russborough, the family\u2019s house in Ireland, and the Irish cultural community had objected to their sale. The remaining 48 lots of the old master auction totaled just \u00a319 million \u2014 slightly less than the price a single Christopher Wool painting made in May \u2014 against a low estimate of \u00a331.5 million. As at Sotheby\u2019s, 35 percent of Christie\u2019s material failed to sell.\u201cOld masters aren\u2019t as big, or as international or as fluid as the contemporary market,\u201d said Johan Bosch van Rosenthal, an art adviser based in Amsterdam who attended the Christie\u2019s auction. \u201cYou can\u2019t push estimates to force up prices.\u201dOld master dealers, unlike their equivalent auction-house specialists, can\u2019t cross-market works to other departments, and they don\u2019t have the resources to promote paintings to wealthy clients in Asia or Russia. As a result, the few new buyers interested in pre-1850 pictures tend to buy them at auction.But dealers have to try to make things happen, and so they exhibit at fairs and participate in promotions. Masterpiece London, whose sixth edition ran from June 25 to July 1, is a fair that consciously targets the luxury-minded, impulse-buying 0.1 percent. This elegantly presented fair, which this year attracted 40,000 visitors (up from 35,000 in 2014), seems to be gaining traction as a place where dealers can sell pictures and even antiques.Carter Marsh & Co, a specialist dealership in Winchester, England, brought 44 highlights from the collection of museum-quality 17th- and 18th-century English clocks amassed by the Jersey businessman Tom Scott. Carter Marsh sold 21 clocks for just under \u00a39 million. They included the so-called \u201cMedici Tompion,\u201d an ebony and gilt-brass table clock made in about 1696 by Thomas Tompion, the most celebrated of English clockmakers, for King William III, who gave it to Cosimo de Medici. The \u201cMedici Tompion\u201d sold for \u00a34.5 million to an American collector, who also buys modern art, according to Carter Marsh\u2019s managing director, Jonathan Carter.A panoramic oil of the Bay of Naples by the 18th-century Italian view painter Antonio Joli, priced at about $2 million, was among four old master and contemporary paintings sold at the fair by Robilant + Voena, a dealership with galleries in London, Milan and St. Moritz, Switzerland.\u201cMasterpiece attracts an international crowd,\u201d said Edmondo di Robilant, the gallery co-director. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people I\u2019ve never seen at a fair before. And unlike Frieze Masters, they come two or three times.\u201d Still, Mr. Robilant said he was well aware of the challenges facing dealers in historic art. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to galleries any more, and they don\u2019t buy old masters,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not part of the overall mood of today\u2019s taste.\u201dLondon Art Week, which ran concurrently this year with the old master auctions from July 3 to 10, tries to regenerate interest in those galleries. The event, which unites previously separate promotions for paintings, drawings and sculpture galleries, featured 45 dealers and auction houses on a Mayfair and St. James\u2019s gallery trail.This being the old masters market, not all the dealerships were full of visitors, but a number of well-known dealers mounted serious, thoughtfully compiled exhibitions. And sales were made.Charles Beddington found a buyer for a circa 1740 Michele Marieschi view of the church of Santa Maria della Salute for more than \u00a31 million in a show of 30 paintings and drawings of Venice at the Fine Art Society in Bond Street.There were also discoveries to be made. The young, up-and-coming dealers Coll & Cort\u00e9s unearthed a compelling still life of pears and hanging dead game by the early 17th-century Toledo painter known as the Master of the Stirling-Maxwell Collection, for which they were asking 200,000 euros, or $221,000.But for the uninitiated, buying old masters from dealers can still be an intimidating business. Many of the dealers now operate from more economical upper-floor premises. Door-buzzers have to be pressed, stairs climbed, supercilious assistants negotiated, before one can grapple with the complexities of who on earth the Master of the Stirling-Maxwell Collection might have been. Recognizable names are in short supply, as are the approachable, affordable works that inspire new collectors of contemporary art. There was little to buy at London Art Week for under $5,000.That said, the antiquities dealers Oliver Forge and Brenda Lynch sold four tiny fragments from black-figure vases dating to ancient Greece, for \u00a3900 to \u00a34,000. \u201cThe erotic one was more expensive,\u201d Mr. Forge said solemnly.Advertisement"}

Makes Barely a Ripple in a Day\u2019s Trading", "Date": "2015-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors who wanted to buy and sell shares of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, such as I.B.M. or Target, were still able to do so with ease on Wednesday.In years past, a shutdown of the N.Y.S.E. might have stopped Wall Street dead in its tracks, with a broad range of companies\u2019 shares sitting frozen until all technical problems were unwound.Now, an immense amount of trading takes place on so-called off-exchange venues, including the private stock trading platforms known as \u201cdark pools\u201d that let investors buy and sell shares without tipping their hands to the broader markets.Those alternative markets have multiplied as big investment banks like Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have waded into the business. Dark pools now make up roughly 40 percent of all stock trading volume, having drawn away huge volumes from traditional stock markets. That means that customers can still find plenty of other alternative venues to do business. Such complexity has drawn criticism from analysts and investors who have complained that fragmentation of the stock market world has made the business much more fragile and has provided opportunities for so-called high-frequency trading firms that can execute trades in milliseconds. Yet, that splintering has also provided investors with something of a safety net against many problems.The diversification of trading has been blamed for an array of problems that have bedeviled the markets over the years. But analysts say that spider web of systems has also made issues like the N.Y.S.E.\u2019s less catastrophic than they once might have been.\u201cIt\u2019s much more complicated, but much more robust,\u201d said Larry Tabb, the founder of the Tabb Group, a financial market research firm.Stray squirrels, security breaches and, more commonly, technical glitches have caused exchanges around the world to halt.Long gone are the days when the only exchanges around were the Big Board and the Nasdaq, with floor traders handling huge percentages of stock trading by hand. A monthslong shutdown of the New York exchange in 1914, at the onset of World War I, virtually eliminated stock trading in the country until the exchange reopened.Now there are 11 exchanges, including three owned by the N.Y.S.E., three by the Nasdaq and four by BATS Global Markets, one of the biggest electronic markets around. And the average E-Trade or Charles Schwab customer, for instance, should not have even noticed that there was any problem, because many of these brokerage firms use those other exchanges.\u201cThis is negative for those who complain that market fragmentation is hurting liquidity and small investors,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a research note\u00a0on Wednesday. \u201cYet fragmentation also means there is still robust trading even when a major exchange experiences a technical glitch. To us, this makes it harder to fight against.\u201dGone, too, are the days when N.Y.S.E.-listed stocks could be traded only on the Big Board, and Nasdaq-listed shares on that exchange. Now each of the 11 stock exchanges can handle trades in any issuer. Thus, if one market goes down, others are able to pick up the slack. Then two years ago, system problems shut down the Nasdaq for three hours, stopping trading in huge names ranging from Google to Apple in what became known as the \u201cflash freeze.\u201dInvestors, however, need not rely on traditional exchanges to trade their shares at all. Before, orders would flow to the brokers on the N.Y.S.E. floor, who would then turn to specialists who hand-matched would-be sellers with interested buyers. Now, many Wall Street firms execute trades within their own systems.\u201cThere are many other alternative places to trade,\u201d Mr. Tabb said. The only ones who suffer from that, he added, are the exchanges themselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scant Relief From Beijing for Bruised Investors", "Date": "2015-07-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For millions of ordinary Chinese who have borne the brunt as the mainland\u2019s stock market has plummeted in recent weeks, government measures to bolster the market are offering little relief.Chinese shares fell on Tuesday, with the Shanghai composite index closing down 1.3 percent after a gain on Monday. The Shenzhen index, which covers smaller companies, had another steep drop, down 5.3 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, which fell sharply on Monday, finished down a more moderate 1 percent on Tuesday.The state-run news media reported that an increasing number of companies, 200 on Tuesday alone, were filing for a suspension in trading to insulate themselves from the decline. The China Securities Journal reported that 760 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had suspended trading in their shares, representing about 27 percent of companies on the two markets.The voluntary suspensions, along with rules that automatically halt trading in a company\u2019s stock if it drops 10 percent, combined to keep 44.4 percent of all Chinese stocks from trading for the full session Tuesday. Taking such stocks out of play has probably locked a number of skittish investors into investments they are trying to sell. The hope is that by the time the trading suspensions lift, confidence will have been restored.Elsewhere in Asia, shares were mixed, reacting to the events in Greece and the volatility in China\u2019s markets. The Nikkei 225 share index in Japan finished 1.3 percent higher, while the Kospi in South Korea fell 0.7 percent. Australian shares rose nearly 2 percent.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.For mainland Chinese stocks, the revival of downward momentum on Tuesday suggested that markets were likely to continue falling, said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In many cases, company valuations, in particular for smaller technology companies listed on the ChiNext market, remain irrationally high, he said.Over the weekend, Beijing suspended new stock listings and persuaded a number of large brokerage firms to set up a $19.4 billion stabilization fund to help support the markets. Those moves are not enough to restore confidence, Mr. Liu said.\u201cI would think that these kind of price-supporting operations will only have a couple of days\u2019 effect and not much sustaining power in the medium term,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should allow the market mechanisms to play out, rather than using administrative measures to support share price at certain levels. All evidence has shown elsewhere this type of operations doesn\u2019t work.\u201dAnother major problem could arise from where the brokerage firms involved in the stabilization fund are likely to spend the money: on shares in large state-owned firms, whose valuations are more justifiable than those of smaller companies whose stocks have been bid up to irrational prices.\u201cWith the public money you can only pick large-cap blue chips, but the valuation bubble is in the small-cap sector, and it\u2019s still unraveling,\u201d said Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International. \u201cThat creates a lot of volatility and a contagion effect. At the moment it\u2019s looking ugly.\u201dBefore markets opened on Tuesday, the state media reported remarks by Premier Li Keqiang that China had the confidence and ability to deal with economic challenges and risks. But Mr. Li\u2019s words had little calming effect.Those left footing the bill are individual consumer investors, who make up the bulk of investors in China\u2019s stock markets \u2014 in the world\u2019s other major markets, professional institutional investors are more common. Invested in small, overvalued companies, many of these individual investors are taking advantage of government measures to pull out of their holdings and save what money they can, said Mr. Liu, the A.N.Z. economist.Herald van der Linde, who leads Asia equity strategy for HSBC, said it was important to keep in perspective that the potential losses to most families in China would not be major. As of May, only 15 percent of Chinese family assets were in stocks. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of focus, but it doesn\u2019t mean families are suddenly being bankrupt,\u201d he said.Over the past year, as property prices stagnated, many Chinese investors poured into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Cheered on by state media and supported by cheap loans, investors quickly bid up stock valuations to bubble territory, with price-to-earnings valuations well beyond those of comparable markets elsewhere. Since mid-June, the rout, which many analysts deemed inevitable, has cut nearly $3 trillion in market value from China\u2019s stock market, the second-largest in the world, after the United States market.Even as concerns grew about investors\u2019 borrowing to buy stocks they could not afford, Mr. Liu said he believed the danger from the rout was limited.\u201cI don\u2019t think this market has become a systemic risk at the moment, but this is a wake-up call to the policy makers,\u201d he said, adding that the government should do more to bring professional investors into the market and allow market forces to work out bubbles.Nonetheless, the drop is likely to have an effect on China\u2019s consumption. Mr. Hao, the Bank of Communications strategist, said that when shares were doing well, earnings from the stock market had begun to flow back into the property market, causing prices to rise. Now, with the market back to the level it was in March, much of that spending may disappear. \u201cInevitably consumption patterns will be affected, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this wealth destruction, I would say that there are longer-term effects,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s survive today first.\u201dKeith Bradsher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cellar Full of Collateral, by the Bottle or the Case ", "Date": "2015-07-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthAs a restaurateur and wine collector, Nick Gangas knows the special pleasures of pairing a fine Burgundy with a roast chicken or a leg of lamb. Yet recently, he discovered another use for his Burgundy \u2014 as loan collateral.Like a growing number of collectors, Mr. Gangas has pledged some of his finest French wines for large cash loans with generous terms. Using $300,000 worth of his Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti, Chambertin and other wines, he\u2019s about to receive a loan of about $150,000, which he plans to use to open a new restaurant in the Chicago suburbs.The bottles \u201cwould be just sitting in the cellar aging,\u201d said Mr. Gangas. \u201cWhy not use them to raise capital? By the time they\u2019re ready to drink, I\u2019ll have paid back the loan.\u201dFor the wealthy, wine has become the ultimate liquid asset. With prices for top vintages soaring past $10,000 a bottle, fine wine is being bought, sold and traded at auction like a new investment class, with its own value indexes, investment funds and speculators. And now wealthy collectors are using wine as leverage \u2014 raising cash to invest in more wine and create even more wealth.A new crop of wine lenders has started offering collectors cash for up to 60 percent of the value of their collections, with relatively low interest rates. A collector with a $1 million collection can obtain a $600,000 loan, often at an 8 percent to 10 percent interest rate \u2014 or a fraction of the average credit card rate. In the last two years, wine lenders have issued tens of millions of dollars in loans with wine as the sole collateral, according to several lenders.\u201cWhether it\u2019s real estate or wine, it doesn\u2019t make sense to accumulate assets with pure cash,\u201d said Patrick Stella, the chief executive and founder of WineCredit. \u201cWith wine, you can borrow and not put your home or some other important asset at risk. You can finance toys with toys.\u201dThere are catches, of course. The wine must be valued and verified by an expert, and more expensive, collectible wines are typically preferred. The wine must be stored in an approved, monitored wine-storage facility, so as to prevent borrowers from drinking their collateral at a dinner party.The rise of wine loans is the latest extreme in a tale of two credit markets, where many Americans still can\u2019t get a mortgage but the asset-wealthy are feeling drunk with credit. Banks are eager to extend credit for private jets, multiple homes, art, jewelry and investments as asset values rise and the wealthy prove to be the richest source of borrowing. So far, default has not been a problem (lenders can\u2019t recall a single one). Yet some worry that the rise of wine lending may signal the top of an already pricey collectibles market. Sotheby\u2019s last year sold a 114-bottle collection of Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti for $1.6 million, or more than $14,000 a bottle. Wine also has special financial risks: Aside from being a consumption good (it\u2019s essentially old grape juice) and notoriously prone to fraud, it can be difficult to sell when others are also trying to dump their collections. Adding borrowed money to a market highly linked to stocks and wealth cycles could make the booms and busts in wine even more extreme.For now, however, wine lending is unlocking millions of dollars from the cellars of the rich.Mr. Stella started learning about wine while in college at Stanford. After working in the hedge fund industry investing in junk bonds and synthetic credit derivatives, he noticed that the wine trade was perpetually short of cash. Collectors and restaurants often had millions of dollars of wine in storage but banks were reluctant to lend against wine, usually because they weren\u2019t sure how to value it.WineCredit\u2019s largest loan has been $1.5 million. Borrowers often prefer to hand over their highest-priced Burgundys or Bordeaux so they don\u2019t have to pledge or ship as many bottles. Yet Mr. Stella said he happily accepts wines as low as $100 or $200 if they can easily be sold or traded.Not everyone gets approved. Marc Lazar, Domaine\u2019s chief executive and founder, says collectors who come in with poor records, untradable wine or murky stories don\u2019t get loans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen several deals come across my desk that don\u2019t come to fruition,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be a good paper trail.\u201dBorrowers are mainly using the money to buy more wine, betting they can pick the winners that will surge in value, which they can sell to pay off the loan and make a profit \u2014 similar to buying stocks on margin. Other wealthy borrowers are using the money for divorces or tax payments, or to buy a boat or a car. And many of the wealthy, especially business owners, have frequent short-term cash squeezes.\u201cRich people never have as much liquidity as we think they have,\u201d Mr. Stella said. Of course, turning an age-old beverage meant for enjoyment and sharing into a financial instrument may offend many wine purists. It could also drive up the prices of some wines beyond the reach of everyday buyers,\u00a0as the wealthy bid more aggressively on wine with borrowed cash.Still, Mr. Lazar said, wine lending will affect mainly a small group of trophy wines. \u201cThere is still a lot of darn good juice out there for $40 or $50 a bottle,\u201d he said.ROBERT FRANK is CNBC wealth editor and the author of \u201cRichistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stock Gains in China Help to Calm Investors", "Date": "2015-06-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Chinese stock markets staged a powerful rally late Tuesday, sending share prices sharply higher in a volatile day of trading. The surge in prices came after investors had suffered some of the sharpest losses in years over the previous two sessions.After a roller coaster ride Tuesday, aggressive buying pushed the Shanghai composite index up 5.5 percent, to close at 4,277.22. The Shenzhen composite fared almost as well, rising 4.8 percent, to close at 2,464.23. And in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index edged up 1.1 percent to close at 26,250.03.The gains seemed to calm a jittery market after more than a trillion dollars in market value had been wiped out over the previous few weeks, amid fears that the market\u2019s bull run was coming to an end. Until recently, China has had the world\u2019s best-performing stock market.No one knows for sure why prices recovered Tuesday. But some analysts said they believed that the market had stabilized on the expectation that the Chinese government would find ways to intervene and prop up share prices, some of which are down more than 40 percent from their highs.The government had, after all, seemed to encourage investors to pile into stocks earlier this year, aided by optimistic reports published by the state-run news media. The authorities appeared to view higher stock prices as a way to help indebted state-owned companies to deleverage, analysts said, and with the economy weakening, the government is probably eager to keep prices from falling too sharply.\u201cIt\u2019s in Beijing\u2019s interest to be supportive of the stock market,\u201d said Li Wei, an economist who covers China for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \u201cIt can help facilitate corporate deleveraging and offset some of the pain of the economic slowdown.\u201dOne sign of the government\u2019s intentions came last weekend, when China\u2019s central bank moved to cut interest rates. But share prices plummeted on Monday, and worried investors began selling early Tuesday. Then a rally late in the day created a huge swing in prices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Rise, but Fears Persist", "Date": "2015-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Volatility continues to reign in the Chinese stock market, as investors and the government scramble to deal with wild ups and downs. After a two-day sell-off, Chinese investors got a reprieve on Thursday, aided by a series of market-propping measures by Beijing. The main Shanghai index finished the day 5.8 percent higher, while shares in Shenzhen gained 3.8 percent. On Friday, both indexes were up more than 3 percent in early trading.The swings are likely to persist, with many analysts warning that mainland markets have further to fall. The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.Valuations of many small companies remain too high, putting pressure on those stocks. And big investors are likely to stick with larger companies, which are considered safer.This volatility presents a challenge for the leadership, which has moved aggressively to prop up stocks. The central bank has made more cash available for stock purchases. Brokerage firms, at the government\u2019s prodding, are pouring billions of dollars into the markets. Initial public offerings have been halted.The government wants, in part, to help restore momentum, lest the market slump weigh on confidence and growth. While economists are divided over how big an impact the market malaise will have on China\u2019s economy, many say that it will hurt consumer sentiment and limit the amount the middle class is willing to spend on goods and property. That would weaken consumption while China\u2019s economic growth is already slowing. The ultimate economic impact will depend on whether the slump is short-lived or not. \u201cOnce investors see a rebound in China\u2019s real economy, confidence may return,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. Complicating matters, tens of millions of ordinary investors piled into stocks over the past year, with many using borrowed money to do so. About 15 percent of the assets of Chinese households are locked up in the stock market, according to an estimate by HSBC. And many are holding shares whose values are quickly diminishing.Often, investors are unable to sell the stocks because trading has been suspended. Shares of more than one-third of the companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been halted, in part because of rules intended to limit price declines and put a check on panic selling.\u201cThese kinds of administrative measures are continuing, and over all they will only have a limited effect,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201cThe rules can probably stop the market rout temporarily, but it won\u2019t change the overall fundamentals.\u201dIn the past few years, the stock market rode to new highs, with the major indexes doubling or even tripling. Shares, though, started to defy fundamentals, with economic and corporate growth lagging. Worries mounted that the boom was turning into a bubble. Now, Chinese investors are entering a rocky period. While stocks remain up over all for the year, they have been off 30 percent or more in recent weeks. Other markets, too, have been choppy. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was up 3.9 percent on Thursday after falling nearly 6 percent on Wednesday. Markets in the region also turned positive, with the Nikkei 225 share average in Japan and the Kospi in South Korea both closing 0.6 percent higher.Beijing continued to introduce measures to stabilize the markets on Thursday, with the Public Security Ministry saying that it was investigating \u201cmalicious\u201d short-sellers in a bid to cut down on illegal market activity, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. On Wednesday, China\u2019s security regulator indicated that it would relax trading laws for corporate insiders looking to buy back shares at a low price. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money", "Date": "2015-07-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtNot long ago, if you were a young, brash technologist with a world-conquering start-up idea, there was a good chance you spent much of your waking life working toward a single business milestone: taking your company public.Though luminaries of the tech industry have always expressed skepticism and even hostility toward the finance industry, tech\u2019s dirty secret was that it looked to Wall Street and the ritual of a public offering for affirmation \u2014 not to mention wealth.But something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become d\u00e9class\u00e9. For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits.Silicon Valley\u2019s sudden distaste for the I.P.O. \u2014 rooted in part in Wall Street\u2019s skepticism of new tech stocks \u2014 may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill. It also means Wall Street is doing what it failed to do in the last tech boom: using traditional metrics like growth and profitability to price companies. Investors have been tough on Twitter, for example, because its user growth has slowed. They have been tough on Box, the cloud-storage company that went public last year, because it remains unprofitable. And the e-commerce company Zulily, which went public last year, was likewise punished when it cut its guidance for future sales. That unwillingness to cut much slack to young tech companies limits risk for regular investors. If the bubble pops, the unwashed masses, if that\u2019s what we are, aren\u2019t as likely to get washed out. Private investors, on the other hand, are making big bets on so-called unicorns \u2014 the Silicon Valley jargon for start-up companies valued at more than a billion dollars. If many of those unicorns flop, most Americans will escape unharmed, because losses will be confined to venture capitalists and hedge funds that have begun to buy into tech start-ups, as well as tech founders and their employees. The reluctance \u2014 and sometimes inability \u2014 to go public is spurring the unicorns. By relying on private investors for a longer period of time, start-ups get more runway to figure out sustainable business models. To delay their entrance into the public markets, firms like Airbnb, Dropbox, Palantir, Pinterest, Uber and several other large start-ups are raising hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, that they would otherwise have gained through an initial public offering.The delay in I.P.O.s has altered how some venture capital firms do business. Rather than waiting for an initial offering, Maveron, for instance, says it now sells its stake in a start-up to other, larger private investors once it has made about 100 times its initial investment. It is the sort of return that once was only possible after an I.P.O.But there is also a downside to the new aversion to initial offerings. When the unicorns do eventually go public and begin to soar \u2014 or whatever it is that fantastical horned beasts tend to do when they\u2019re healthy \u2014 the biggest winners will be the private investors that are now bearing most of the risk.It used to be that public investors who got in on the ground floor of an initial offering could earn historic gains. If you invested $1,000 in Amazon at its I.P.O. in 1997, you would now have nearly $250,000. If you had invested $1,000 in Microsoft in 1986, you would have close to half a million. Public investors today are unlikely to get anywhere near such gains from tech I.P.O.s. By the time tech companies come to the market, the biggest gains have already been extracted by private backers.Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve asked several founders and investors why they\u2019re waiting; few were willing to speak on the record about their own companies, but their answers all amounted to \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201dInitial public offerings were also ways to compensate employees and founders who owned lots of stock, but there are now novel mechanisms \u2014 such as selling shares on a secondary market \u2014 for insiders to cash in on some of their shares in private companies. Still, some observers cautioned that the new trend may be a bad deal for employees who aren\u2019t given much information about the company\u2019s performance.\u201cOne thing employees may be confused about is when companies tell them, \u2018We\u2019re basically doing a private I.P.O.,\u2019 it might make them feel like there\u2019s less risk than there really is,\u201d said Ms. Morrill of Mattermark.

{"Headline": "After Week of Turmoil, Chinese Stocks Post Further Gains", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A week of volatility in China\u2019s stock markets ended on a better note than many investors expected, as government policies to prop up shares seemed to have muted some of the panic among sellers.Over the week, Beijing introduced several policy efforts to stop the decline, including coordinating a broker-backed bailout fund and banning certain investors from selling shares in companies. Insurers and large state-owned companies have also been encouraged to invest in the market.Though many criticized the responses as being overly focused on the short-term, for now analysts said the changes seemed to be stanching the bleeding.\u201cMarket movement appears to indicate that government actions are working,\u201d Morgan Stanley wrote in a Friday report. \u201cThough not everyone agrees with the sequence and order of the government actions, we believe they have helped to achieve meaningful deleveraging in the equity market without triggering systemic risks.\u201dThe Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.That leverage came as Chinese investors poured into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets over the past year, looking for better returns as property prices stagnated. Cheered on by state media and supported by cheap loans, investors bid up stock valuations to bubble territory, with price-to-earnings ratios of many smaller companies well beyond those of comparable markets elsewhere.In recent weeks, a correction, in part spurred by concerns at Greece\u2019s potential exit from the eurozone, at one point cut more than $3 trillion from the markets, which remain well below the peak in June.Though many investors in China had invested based on loans, the amount of leverage in the market is relatively small, according to economists, and unlikely to have a broader impact or set off any sort of debt crisis. Nonetheless, in China, the collapse of a major source of middle-class wealth is viewed in political terms as much as in economic ones, and the government\u2019s policies were coupled with statements from politicians seeking to restore calm to the markets.The government can do more. With data out this week indicating low inflation, the People\u2019s Bank of China has the leeway for further rate cuts. Meanwhile fiscal stimulus in the form of debt swaps is also likely to help stabilize the investment climate.After the close of markets on Friday, China\u2019s Prime Minister Li Keqiang said on a government website that the country\u2019s economic growth was stabilizing but that the government had more to do to lift growth. He also said that Beijing would make targeted changes to policies supporting the economy.Volatility in the markets could continue on external factors, like the Greek debt crisis and China\u2019s seesawing stock market, Hong Kong\u2019s financial secretary, John Tsang, said at a news media event on Friday evening. He added that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority would provide liquidity to banks if necessary.Even as stability prevailed by the end of the week, many retail investors have lost huge amounts of wealth as overpriced small cap shares saw their valuations wilt since June 12.That may well hit broader consumer sentiment in a Chinese economy that is continuing to cool, according to economists. In particular, the property market, which had begun to see prices rise again on the stock boom, could see prices stagnate as purchases based on gains in the market dissolve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greece and Creditors Move Toward Deal, and Investor Optimism Surges", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Optimism rose on Friday over the prospects of an accord between Greece and its international creditors, as the two sides weighed the latest measures from Athens aimed at overhauling its economy and securing its place in the euro currency bloc.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government on Thursday agreed to meet most of the terms demanded by the creditors with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, and it requested a three-year, 53.5 billion euro, or $59 billion, bailout as a starting point for talks about possible debt relief.As the long-running crisis entered a climactic stage, the main representatives of the creditors were expected to assess the plan on Friday, and Greek lawmakers were to debate the measures later in the afternoon and evening.Investors seemed increasingly optimistic in Friday trading. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone blue chips rose 2.6 percent at midday, picking up where it left off on Thursday after signs of a thaw in the Greek negotiations began to emerge. The FTSE 100 in London gained 1.1 percent, and trading in Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index futures indicated that New York was heading for a rally at the opening. The markets were also buoyed by a continued rebound in Shanghai shares after Beijing introduced measures to support cratering Chinese stocks.While the Athens stock market remains closed, Greek bond yields plummeted, a sign of confidence that lenders will be repaid. Two-year Greek government debt soared in price, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, plunged 15 percentage points to 36.5 percent.The Greek government\u2019s latest batch of policy overhauls received a positive welcome from President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, though some officials in Germany, the biggest eurozone creditor, expressed doubts.\u201cThe Greek program is serious, credible and shows a determination to remain in the eurozone,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cNothing is done, yet everything can be done.\u201dEuropean leaders weighed the latest measures from Athens.A European Union official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were evolving, suggested that an agreement could, in theory, be reached on Saturday at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. If so, the official said, a summit meeting of the 19 leaders of eurozone nations planned for Sunday would probably be called off.In its proposal, the Greek government is basically conceding to things that it had said it did not want, and which the nation voted no to in the referendum on Sunday.The offer included a proposal to raise certain value-added taxes and eliminate parts of a politically charged tax break that has long applied to the Greek islands, in a bid to pull in billions of euros in tax revenue. In addition, Athens proposed raising the corporate tax rate, broadening the tax base to include lower-income earners and eventually raising the retirement age to 67.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The proposal also contained pledges that Greece has made in years past, but which have made little progress, including a vow to speed up the privatization of state assets to raise cash and to crack down on corruption and an inefficient judicial system.Critically, though, Athens proposed targeting a low so-called primary surplus of 1 percent this year with gradual increases in subsequent moves; the term refers to the amount of cash in its treasury after expenses and interest payments. Athens has argued that being allowed to keep more money on hand rather than spending it on debt payments will allow for some spending stimulus that is needed to stoke the moribund economy.Hans-Peter Friedrich, a member of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, which is part of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative bloc, expressed skepticism about the program, noting that many of its points were part of the deal rejected by Greeks in the referendum last weekend.\u201cThat means there are two possibilities: either the Greek government is tricking its own people, or us yet again,\u201d Mr. Friedrich told Deutschlandfunk radio early Friday, noting that he had not yet seen the full proposal.This is the text of the proposed actions that Greece submitted to its European creditors on Thursday. It lists a series of measures that the nation would undertake in exchange for a new bailout plan.\u201cWe will see what the experts have to say,\u201d Mr. Friedrich said, referring to the creditor institutions. \u201cAnd we will ask critical questions.\u201dLawmakers of the governing Syriza party in Greece huddled in Parliament in Athens to discuss the latest proposal before a debate in the House scheduled for Friday evening. Some legislators expressed serious objections to the additional austerity foreseen in the proposal.Arriving for the session on Friday morning, Greek ministers struck very different tones. Visibly rattled, Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads the radical Left Platform branch of Syriza and who has railed against further austerity, refused to answer reporters\u2019 questions.Culture Minister Nikos Xydakis said the proposed measures were \u201cvery tough,\u201d adding that Greece faced an \u201cintransigent Germany.\u201d\u201cWe will have to see how we will survive in this very tough framework,\u201d he said.Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis appeared more upbeat, saying he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that Greece would secure \u201ca very good agreement.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe will discuss and everything will go well.\u201dMr. Tsipras, addressing Syriza lawmakers in the morning, emphasized that the priority was to seal a deal. \u201cWe have a mandate from the Greek People to bring a better agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a mandate to take the country out of the eurozone.He added, \u201cEither we all stay together or we all leave together.\u201dCarsten Brzeski, an economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, said in a research note that the latest Greek proposal was \u201cmore or less identical\u201d with the plan it had rejected from Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.Perhaps most important, he said, Athens appears to have given in on \u201cthe two most critical issues,\u201d tax and pension overhauls, and dropped outright demands for debt restructuring.In spite of \u201cthe obvious caveats,\u201d he added, \u201cthe chances for a deal and another bailout for Greece have increased again.\u201dLiz Alderman reported from Athens and David Jolly from Paris.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Incendiary Market Is Fanned by Borrowers and Manipulation", "Date": "2015-07-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 At the height of the frenzy for Chinese stocks, just about every company was a winner.An online gaming start-up was valued at $7 billion. Shares in a fireworks company that had moved into finance shot up 300 percent. A struggling property developer was transformed into a stock market darling, just by changing its name to suggest it was an Internet company.Then there was the case of Beijing Baofeng Technology, an online video company whose stock price soared 4,200 percent in the three months after it went public early this year. The company\u2019s shares climbed by 10 percent \u2014 the maximum amount allowable under exchange rules \u2014 nearly every day for more than 30 days.Viewed through the lens of the recent market tumult, experts said China\u2019s stock bonanza bordered on the insane.Before things fell apart a few weeks ago, China\u2019s remarkable bull run was reminiscent of the Internet bubble that gripped the Nasdaq stock market between 1998 and 2000, when companies like Pets.com and Webvan that had no profit quickly became more valuable than some industrial stalwarts. At the time, everyone talked about how technologies and industries would transform society, justifying eye-popping valuations. They were right about the future, just not necessarily about specific companies and the high stock prices.The same may now be said of China in early 2015. Even as stocks have stabilized in recent days, investors have continued to pummel such smaller companies, the same ones they had bid up in the boom.\u201cPeople got too enthusiastic,\u201d said Teng Bingsheng, who teaches strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing. \u201cThere was a huge amount of energy, like a nuclear bomb, and they let it go off.\u201dThe madness was driven, in part, by the peculiar dynamics of China\u2019s stock market. Unlike in the United States, where institutions and big funds are the primary investors, trading here is dominated by smaller players \u2014 speculators, day traders and inexperienced retail investors, many of whom started financing stock purchases with borrowed money.China\u2019s market is also shaped by the heavy hand of the government, which makes decisions about what companies can list shares, when to promote stock rallies and, now, how to intervene when prices plummet. The government, in other words, views the market as a policy instrument, a mechanism to fulfill its political and economic goals. The result can be a volatile market that swings from boom to bust.\u201cIn China, the regulators aren\u2019t neutral,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at Yale University and an expert on China\u2019s financial system. \u201cThe government\u2019s stated intention this time was that they wanted to use the stock market boom to fuel innovation and start-ups. This isn\u2019t how a market is supposed to work.\u201dThis helps explain why some of China\u2019s most dynamic companies have chosen to list overseas, primarily in Hong Kong and New York. Although prices tend to be higher in China, mainland exchanges are often not the first choice for homegrown companies. Companies seeking to list in China complain about the long queue to list, the government approval process and various restrictions like the amount of foreign ownership, which eliminates many of the hottest start-ups.It is a source of embarrassment for the authorities. Chinese citizens can\u2019t, for instance, purchase shares in the e-commerce goliath Alibaba, which chose to list on the New York Stock Exchange. The company raised $25 billion last September in the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opting out of the domestic market by bigger, better groups,\u201d said Peter Fuhrman, who runs China First Capital, a Shenzhen-based investment bank and advisory firm. \u201cThere\u2019s no analogous situation in any other country in the world.\u201dFor years, government reformers have pushed to loosen the state\u2019s grip on the economy and financial markets, hoping to create a more efficient marketplace to aid private companies, particularly small businesses that have a difficult time borrowing from state banks. The idea was to restructure the stock market, moving it away from its roots where it served mostly state-owned companies.A breakthrough seemed to come last year, when the government put innovation and the development of tech start-ups high on its agenda. It began to consider using the stock market as a way to aid young companies while also bolstering a slowing economy.Following a one-year moratorium on new listings, regulators began approving public stock offerings in late 2013. The floodgates opened soon after, and hundreds of companies went public in Shanghai and Shenzhen, helping China overtake New York as the world\u2019s biggest I.P.O. market in the first half of this year.Investors went mad for the shares of new companies, bidding them up to stratospheric levels. On Shenzhen\u2019s ChiNext board, a kind of Nasdaq-style marketplace, 69 companies went public this year. Those stocks, on average, gained 672 percent through June, when prices peaked. Three companies rose more than 2,000 percent, including Beijing Baofeng Technology.During this time, the government also began promoting the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, an experimental over-the-counter market with looser listing standards. There was no government approval system to list and no requirement to show earnings, a boon to young tech start-ups that had yet to book a profit.Little noticed, the Third Board soared along with the country\u2019s major exchanges. In early 2014, the board had 642 listed companies. Today, there are 2,700 companies listed on the exchange, where trading is restricted to institutions and wealthy individuals.Jason Zhao, a managing partner at CGF Capital Management, a Shanghai-based investment fund, said the government wanted to experiment with a more market-oriented system, much like that in the United States. \u201cThe government knows the current system is flawed and they can\u2019t put patches on it, so that\u2019s why they set up the third market,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. \u201cIt mimics the Nasdaq. They were trying to create a new market to fit the current stage of development.\u201dAs share prices soared, another government goal seemed within reach. Chinese companies listed in the United States began considering a return home, where valuations were higher. This year, more than 20 United States-listed Chinese companies announced management-led buyouts in an attempt to eventually re-list their shares in China. Among them: Momo, a mobile social networking company that had listed on Nasdaq for just six months.\u201cThe government has been strongly supporting bringing these companies home,\u201d said Paul Gillis, who teaches accounting at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University. With share prices rising, the government also put its imprimatur on a raging bull market. The state media began promoting a new golden age of stocks. As recently as April, the state media editorialized that the bull market was \u201cjust beginning.\u201dThe first signs of trouble came in May, when prices began to slump. The next month, in the face of a flood of new listings and warnings about overpriced shares and a possible market \u201ccorrection,\u201d share prices began to plunge. Even after China\u2019s central bank cut interest rates in late June, making stocks relatively more attractive than bank deposits, the market continued to slide.Worried that a stock market crash could lead to social unrest and weaken an already slumping economy, the government announced a raft of measures to pump up shares. In recent weeks, the government has funded purchases, suspended new public offerings and opened an investigation into stock manipulation.While the measures had stabilized stocks at the end of last week, the situation had created confusion about what signal the government was sending. Regulators who had pushed for a more market-oriented system now seemed to be setting a precedent for more intervention by the government, said Professor Teng at the Cheung Kong School. \u201cThe logic of the new government was to jump-start the stock market to generate cash into the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey thought it would be a virtuous cycle. But it became a vicious cycle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Adds 223,000 Jobs; Unemployment at 5.3%", "Date": "2015-07-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot too hot, not too cold. But not, alas, just right.Although the unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent, the lowest in seven years, that was driven largely by an exodus from the work force, rather than more people finding jobs. Moreover, the strong payroll gains for April and May, which had led many analysts to conclude that the economy might finally be gaining momentum, were revised downward by 60,000 jobs.\u201cThis was an O.K. report, but the unemployment rate didn\u2019t go down for the right reasons,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Perhaps most discouraging, average hourly earnings didn\u2019t budge in June despite the drop in the unemployment rate from 5.5 percent in May, disappointing hopes that wages were finally increasing for most workers. It was a strong sign that plenty of slack remains in the job market, and that companies do not yet feel much pressure to raise pay to attract needed employees.The share of American adults either working or looking for a job, which in many ways is a better gauge of economic strength than the oft-cited unemployment rate, fell 0.3 percentage point in June. With June\u2019s drop to 62.6 percent, the so-called labor participation rate is now at its lowest since 1977. Among prime-age adults, those 25 to 54, there has been no improvement in participation this year.The latest jobs report is likely to sharpen debate among Federal Reserve officials about when to start raising the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, and other officials have pointed to the healthy pace of job growth as a reason to raise rates later this year. They say a stronger labor market will inevitably result in faster inflation, and the Fed needs to start moving in anticipation of that trend.Some officials, however, point to the weak pace of wage growth, which also continued in June, as evidence that concerns about inflation are premature.The Fed has already indicated that it does not plan to raise rates before September, and some analysts said that remained the most likely scenario.\u201cAltogether, we do not view this report as significantly shifting opinions within the Fed about the timing of the first rate hike,\u201d Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, wrote on Thursday. \u201cWe continue to look for the first rate hike in September.\u201dInvestors, however, responded to the jobs report by increasing their bets that the Fed will not move until December, and perhaps not until next year. In New York, stocks initially rose after the report but finished the day modestly lower. Bond yields fell. The Fed and private economists have been watching participation in the labor market closely for any sign that millions of people who dropped out of the work force after the recession are being lured back as hiring picks up.That did not happen last month. Although seasonal factors and the timing of the survey of households by government pollsters in June may have exacerbated the drop in the size of the labor force, \u201cwe\u2019re not running out of slack,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS.The fall in the participation rate and the failure of hourly earnings to grow at all last month also suggest that the Fed still has plenty of room to maneuver as it waits for the right moment to move on rates, he said.\u201cThe good news is that we are not on the verge of an inflation spiral and we can put people back to work for quite some time without the danger of inflation,\u201d Mr. Berger said.Wage growth has picked up slightly this year, but gains remain relatively restrained. Over the last 12 months, wages are up 2 percent, only modestly ahead of inflation, which is running at around 1.5 percent, according to the latest data.As a result, exporters have had to contend with the headwinds from Europe, China and a stronger dollar, leaving domestically focused sectors like health care, education and professional services to supply much of the labor market\u2019s oomph.White-collar workers in fields like insurance, software and marketing have been in especially high demand, a turnaround from the early days of the recovery, when many new jobs tended to be concentrated in low-wage sectors like retailing and restaurants.But there is still a feast-or-famine quality in many corners of the American economy.Since last summer, for example, the financial sector has added more than 100,000 new positions, bringing total employment in finance to just over eight million, the highest since the fall of 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed. In June alone, insurers, investment companies and other financial institutions added 20,000 workers.That may be poetic exaggeration, but CohnReznick is definitely hiring and paying up for the right people, those with the necessary degrees, accounting credentials and licensing. So far this year, CohnReznick has hired 90 directors and managers, whose salaries range from $100,000 to $300,000 and who tend to be either certified public accountants or lawyers.There are similar tales around the country. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing companies put money into the back office,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago-based staffing firm. \u201cThey want to hire for permanent positions in areas like marketing, human resources and accounting.\u201dEven as those back-office, white-collar jobs are filled with workers who nearly always have bachelor\u2019s degrees, he noted, employers also want college graduates for positions where a high school diploma used to suffice, like call center operators.As the pool of college graduates has grown larger, younger workers have found themselves forced to take jobs they once would have turned down cold.\u201cMore kids are going to college and some of them don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said. Students from less prestigious colleges or candidates with lower grade point averages are taking jobs at call centers, earning $25,000 to $30,000 a year, he said.On the brighter side, the Labor Department\u2019s broadest possible measure of unemployment, which includes people forced to take part-time jobs because full-time work was not available, fell 0.3 percentage point to 10.5 percent.Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putting the Public Back in Public Finance", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt all came down to the penguins. Jase Wilson and Patrick Hosty, two self-described urban enthusiasts, were having breakfast in a coffee shop in Kansas City, Mo., one morning in 2012. They were discussing a $500 million general obligation bond issue before voters that would pay for critical improvements in the city\u2019s sewer system as well as a host of smaller projects, including a new penguin exhibit at the zoo. An acquaintance who overheard the conversation declared that she opposed the bond issue. \u201cWhy should I pay for penguins?\u201d she demanded.Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hosty asked if she had ever bought a municipal bond. She hadn\u2019t. Nor did she quite know what a bond was. And never mind that just a tiny fraction of the funds was earmarked for the zoo.\u201cWe realized right there that our generation \u2014 and in fact most people \u2014 do not understand how public finance works, or that it finances projects for the public good,\u201d said Mr. Hosty, a bond broker in Kansas City. \u201cLots of people talk about taxes without understanding how the process works.\u201dFor Mr. Wilson, an entrepreneur who had founded Luminopolis, a company that creates open-source software systems for towns and cities, the penguins represented an opportunity to rethink municipal finance. Could you break that $500 million bond offering into smaller, discrete projects that citizens \u2014 whether penguin lovers or more pragmatic sewer proponents \u2014 might want to back? And could you give them the opportunity to invest directly in the bond, the way they might back a project on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter? In many ways, municipal bonds \u2014 loans that finance public works like schools, roads, water treatment plants and other projects, often paying tax-exempt interest \u2014 are ripe for innovation. Compared with the stock market, the vast market for municipal bonds is opaque and relatively untouched by technological change, leading to higher prices for retail investors.Although individuals hold 75 percent of municipal bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are typically at the end of a long supply chain, starting with bank underwriters that buy securities from municipalities and resell them to brokers and big institutions. A bond may change hands several times before it reaches an end investor. Each time it does, the price may be marked up \u2014 in ways that are not always clear. (Unlike stockbrokers, who must disclose fees, bond dealers are not required to reveal their markups.)For the 50,000 or so municipalities and agencies that issue roughly $350 billion in bonds annually, the current muni market offers many benefits. Capital costs are typically low for issuers. Because the bonds are usually exempt from federal and state taxes, and sometimes local taxes, investors are willing to accept lower yields than for taxable bonds. And the fees that issuers pay Wall Street bankers have dropped steeply since 2008, when many municipalities took big losses because of ill-advised derivative deals.Municipal governments in the bond market face challenges, though. Some banks have exited the market, put off by the thin margins that come with originating muni bonds. Structural and regulatory changes have also made the bonds less attractive to banks.Yet as America\u2019s infrastructure ages, the need for state and local spending on road, bridge and building repairs is mounting. As a result, some states and cities have begun experimenting with new ways of pulling in capital, including green bonds for environmental projects; mini-bonds in lower denominations that ordinary investors can more easily afford; and more direct sales to individual investors. \u201cWe want to create a more intimate link between issuers and investors \u2014 not just the large investor,\u201d said Steven Grossman, former state treasurer of Massachusetts, which sold the country\u2019s first green bonds and started an online ordering system that gives individual investors direct access to new bonds.Muni bonds are historically a safe asset class, but some are looking more risky lately as many cities struggle with underfunded pension obligations.\u201cYou want to make sure that people understand the risks that they are getting into,\u201d said Tom Kozlik, a municipal credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff you need to be paying attention to, especially in this market.\u201dMr. Kozlik does not see a big need for crowdfunding in municipal finance. For one thing, he said, the market is pretty efficient as it is. He also worries that municipal bonds could be difficult for unsophisticated investors to assess. In addition to underfunded city pension obligations, he points to high-yielding bonds for charter schools as an area of risk.Mr. Wilson remains undaunted. \u201cPart of the challenge and opportunity is to turn one of the least understood investment classes in the world into what could and should be one of the easiest and most accessible,\u201d he said.For a glimpse of one possible municipal finance future, look at Denver. Last August, the city made waves when it crowdfunded $12 million worth of mini-bonds. The bond offering, the last phase of a $550 million voter-approved bond program to upgrade roads and civic buildings, was available only to Colorado residents. The bonds were priced in affordable denominations of $500, versus the typical $5,000 minimum for municipal bonds. Orders were limited to $20,000 per person. Had the bonds been offered in the usual way through Wall Street, the average purchase would most likely have been in the $500,000 to $1 million range, said Cary Kennedy, deputy mayor of Denver.Denver had offered mini-bonds for five years, but this was the first time it did so online. They went on sale at 8 a.m. on a Monday, and orders swamped the city\u2019s website. By 8:16 the bonds were gone; officials had to make refunds to 375 people who placed orders after the bonds sold out.The bonds were unusual. Investors could buy either a nine- or 14-year zero-coupon bond \u2014 which does not pay interest until maturity \u2014 with a yield from 4.38 percent to 4.89 percent, higher than that for many municipal bonds at the time. The interest was exempt from city, state and federal taxes. But there was a catch: The Denver bonds could not be easily resold. And while Denver has a triple-A bond rating, these bonds were not rated. \u201cThis was an opportunity for the people of Colorado to invest back into their hometown, in a very safe way,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.Denver worked with a local bank, Vectra Bank, to handle the online sales, and did not use a bank underwriter. \u201cWe had to start from scratch,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.That is where a service like Neighborly\u2019s could come in. Though the company has yet to help any municipality issue a bond, Mr. Wilson said it aspired to be \u201cDenver in a box for all cities.\u201d Neighborly is testing an online marketplace that offers conventionally issued and rated municipal bonds. Mr. Wilson said it could one day replace some fee-collecting middlemen with an automated system that tracked prices and transactions more efficiently. He also hopes to give municipalities a way to directly issue bonds that would still be rated by outside agencies. Neighborly is exploring block chain technology \u2014 a kind of distributed ledger system used by the virtual currency Bitcoin \u2014 as a way to accomplish some of that.It is still settling on a revenue model, and is considering taking a small cut of transactions or licensing its technology to issuers. It hasn\u2019t been a straight path for the three-year-old company. After their penguin epiphany in 2012, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hosty began by starting an online platform that made it easier to donate money to civic projects like community gardens, dog parks and bike lanes. In its first two years, Neighborly helped raise $3 million for around 60 projects. Over that period, Mr. Wilson was accepted into three programs aimed at accelerating the start-up process: Points of Light, in Washington; Tumml, in San Francisco; and 500 Startups, in Silicon Valley. (Mr. Hosty has participated in Neighborly while continuing with his job at a bond firm.)Eliminating some of the layers in the municipal bond process would \u201cput more money into the project rather than the hands of middlemen,\u201d said Adam Blowers, the comptroller for Geneva, N.Y.Patrick Sabol, a senior researcher with the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program, said the civic implications of the idea appealed to him. \u201cThe interest behind this is less about accessing low-cost capital and more about community involvement and engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has kind of been lost in the U.S. in many ways.\u201dIn the building that serves as Neighborly\u2019s San Francisco headquarters hangs a framed municipal bond certificate from the 1930s. The Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District issued it to finance the bridge. For Mr. Wilson, the certificate is a reminder of the vital role municipal finance should play, especially in smaller cities and towns, where many projects were once funded without the need for Wall Street banks.For decades, though, municipal finance has grown increasingly complex. Under the guidance of Wall Street underwriters, bond deals grew larger and more intricate, combining many projects into single megabonds. A typical muni bond today bundles together all sorts of public financing needs. Sewage plant improvements are combined with zoo projects, making it difficult for ordinary people to comprehend funding that flows both to penguins and vital infrastructure. It has become hard for people to track how money is being spent.\u201cMuni bonds fell out of favor with people because they became decoupled from people\u2019s civic lives,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. Today, munis are often esoteric instruments bought mostly by high-net-worth investors looking to reduce their tax bills. Is it possible, or even wise, to rewind municipal finance back to a simpler time?Some industry professionals argue that the American municipal finance market works extremely well, and in fact is the envy of the world. And while interesting in theory, crowdfunding may be ill-equipped for the challenges of municipal finance. \u201cCrowdfunding is terrific at raising money,\u201d said Sean W. McCarthy, chief executive of Build America Mutual, a municipal bond insurer, \u201cbut making a market around it is more difficult.\u201d That includes tracking the performance of thousands of municipal issuers over time and providing a ready market when investors need to sell. In that sense, he added, \u201cthe market is served well now by established players\u201d like national and regional underwriting banks.The federal government effectively subsidizes municipal bonds by granting them an exemption from taxes, which allows municipalities to offer lower yields and also adds a layer of regulatory oversight. An army of advisers, specialists and bankers are typically required for a bond sale as a result, making it costly to sell bonds in small denominations. \u201cThere are 10 different participants to facilitate your $5,000 loan,\u201d said Thomas G. Doe, president of Municipal Market Analytics, an independent research firm based in Concord, Mass.Abolishing this tax-exempt status is a perennial discussion in Washington, but for now that status makes the bonds most suitable to people in high tax brackets, said Tom Lockard, a former muni bond banker and now a vice president at the real estate crowdfunding site Fundrise. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a slippery slope,\u201d he said, to promote such bonds to people for whom the tax break is less important.Fundrise used its crowdfunding platform in January to offer $5,000 chunks of $100,000 bonds with 5 percent tax-free yields issued by the New York Liberty Development Corporation to finance 3 World Trade Center. The catch was that investors had to be wealthy or, technically, \u201caccredited.\u201d \u201cWe know the difficulties\u201d of offering muni bonds on a broader scale, Mr. Lockard said. \u201cWe continue to study it.\u201dMr. Doe of Municipal Market Analytics said crowdfunding offered a direct connection between issuers and their constituents. \u201cIs there a better way to attract capital to public projects in this new era of social media?\u201dIt\u2019s possible, he said, that crowdfunded bonds could play an important role, but they would need to meet large infrastructure needs while surmounting the regulatory hurdles that come with tax-exempt municipal finance. Important details need to be worked out, he said, but this much is certain: \u201cWe need new ways of doing this.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Efforts Fail to Contain Market Plunge", "Date": "2015-07-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As the Chinese stock market slumps, the country\u2019s government has stepped in boldly, unveiling a series of measures to prop up shares. But those efforts have done little to stabilize the market, with stocks continuing to slide on Wednesday.The losses create a political and economic challenge for the nation\u2019s leadership.Beijing could face social unrest if the sell-off accelerates, since tens of millions of ordinary investors have plowed their savings into the market. The psychological toll on investors, in turn, could erode consumer confidence, dragging down growth in the already slowing economy.\u201cThe stock market is connected to the real economy,\u201d says Fraser Howie, a longtime Asia banker and co-author of \u201cRed Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise.\u201d \u201cWhen you see such violent moves, you don\u2019t know what kinds of ripples are going to come down.\u201dThe Chinese government is moving swiftly to prevent any broader fallout.The country\u2019s central bank has made extra cash available to fund share purchases. Brokerage houses have been ordered to pump billions of dollars into the market. And government-backed funds have earmarked billions more to prop up the shares of flagging companies.The mess in China has not roiled global markets. That is partly because the \u201cChinese financial system is largely sealed off from the global financial system,\u201d Derek Scissors, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said in a report.For now, the action is domestically focused. China\u2019s Communist Party leaders are trying to restore confidence and stabilize the market before things get too ugly at home, introducing new fixes nearly every day. On Wednesday, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance pledged to \u201cadopt measures to safeguard the stability of capital markets,\u201d and in particular protect state-owned financial enterprises. The move signals that this broad-based effort is being directed from the very top echelons of the state.\u201cThere are no buyers, only sellers,\u201d said Francis Cheung, a market analyst at CLSA, the brokerage house. \u201cSo the government is buying, and they\u2019ll ramp up buying to stabilize the market.\u201dTrouble is, they haven\u2019t found the right formula. Despite the latest batch of moves, China\u2019s markets were battered on Wednesday. In Shanghai, prices plunged 5.9 percent. In Shenzhen, they fell 2.5 percent. The damage is also spreading regionally, to Hong Kong and Japan, where shares also fell sharply.While the markets are up over all for the year, the recent downward spiral is creating substantial pain. Both major exchanges are off between 30 percent to 40 percent in six weeks, putting them in bear market territory.The numbers don\u2019t give the complete picture either. In recent days, many stocks have been halted because of exchange rules that are supposed to guard against too much misery in a single trading session. At least a third of the companies listed on the major stock exchanges had trading in their shares suspended on Wednesday.Those market dynamics can create a chain reaction of selling. China\u2019s major exchanges prevent a stock from falling more than 10 percent on any given day. When that happens, analysts say, many investors opt for selling other shares, broadening the sell-off. Then when the market opens the next day, they continue selling down the stock that was previously halted, effectively prolonging the turmoil.\u201cIt just delays the correction, so it delays the downturn,\u201d said Mr. Cheung at CLSA.While China\u2019s stock markets have a long history of volatility, the environment is different now. The country\u2019s economy has been sluggish. The stock market is far bigger than it has ever been, second in size only to that of the United States.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.And aggressive investors, many of them first-time buyers of equities, have been playing a different game. They were buying stocks with borrowed funds, using leverage as if they were \u201cbarbarians at the gate.\u201dThe panic, in part, is being driven by concerns about the huge amount of borrowing. Some analysts estimated that margin buying reached about $550 billion, or as much as 15 percent of the value of all tradable shares on the two major exchanges.Fear is gripping the market after a phenomenal bull run in which mainland China\u2019s major stock indexes doubled, tripled and even quintupled over the past few years. By the time the market peaked, in early June, share prices in China were among the most expensive in the world, vastly costlier than in the United States, Europe or Hong Kong.Investors in mainland China, in other words, had to pay a huge premium to buy domestic shares, a sign the country\u2019s stock market was frothy. Some analysts have noted that the price-to-earnings ratio of companies listed on China\u2019s start-up index, called ChiNext, were far higher than those listed on the Nasdaq stock market in 2000, when the Internet bubble burst.Just a few weeks ago, the pipeline of initial public stock offerings was robust. There was the promise of innovative companies that could use the capital markets, rather than the banks, as a source of cash, and the prospect of new bourses being set up for China\u2019s technology start-ups.China\u2019s state-run news media, including The People\u2019s Daily, helped hype the rip-roaring market. As recently as April, news media said that the bull market had \u201cjust begun,\u201d only to warn some weeks later of the risks.Since then, sentiment has soured, and investors have lost confidence. The worry, analysts said, is that it could be a prolonged downturn, like the one that began in 2007 and lasted about seven years.The sharp decline in prices wiped out trillions of dollars in value from a market that at one point topped $10 trillion. Still, the decline has not yet erased all, or even most, of the gains. China\u2019s major exchanges remain up about 75 percent from a year ago, in part because big state-owned companies have fared better.In late June, the government cut interest rates, which is ordinarily a good sign for stocks, since it makes them more attractive relative to bank deposits. But share prices fell anyway.Since then, the authorities have introduced a wave of additional measures meant to prop up prices. Stock trading transactions were slashed. I.P.O.s were suspended. Huge stabilization funds were set up to purchase shares. Brokerage houses promised to buy more. And China\u2019s insurance regulator eased rules so that insurers could more easily invest in stocks.In the face of further selling, the government continued to introduce new measures on Wednesday.China\u2019s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees the country\u2019s big state corporations, ordered many such companies with public listings not to reduce holdings of their own stock.The China Securities Regulatory Commission even issued a notice encouraging major shareholders, directors and executives of companies to increase their holdings of their companies\u2019 stock. The commission emphasized that rules about the timing of insider stock transactions that might deter such purchases would not apply.It\u2019s a \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach, said Patrick Ho, a market analyst at UBS in Hong Kong. And more measures could come, as the authorities look to stimulate the economy and try to keep the market from falling too rapidly.Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Danh Vo and Bert Kreuk\u2019s Legal Battle Pits Artist Against Collector", "Date": "2015-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROTTERDAM, the Netherlands \u2014 In the booming international art market, Danh Vo ranks highly as an \u201cearly blue chip\u201d artist, his works coveted by speculators who buy low and sell quickly for big gains. His top-selling works are castoff cardboard boxes, turned gold in every way \u2014 like a gilded Budweiser carton from 2013 called \u201cFiat Veritas,\u201d or \u201cLet There Be Truth.\u201dSo far, Mr. Kreuk is winning in the courts. He has waged a successful two-year legal battle to force Mr. Vo to complete the installation, which he had commissioned in 2013 for a set fee of $350,000 \u2014 far below the soaring prices Mr. Vo\u2019s works command today.The feud is a tug-of-art over mistrust and claims of broken promises, with a ruling that appears to be a first in Dutch legal history. But it is also a struggle intensified by the rapid rise in art prices and the unwritten rules of the unregulated art market, in which quick sales are more common for young, emerging artists like Mr. Vo, 39. Very wealthy art collectors are on the prowl for works produced by an elite group of artists like Oscar Murillo, Lucien Smith and Eddie Peake, whose works have been rated like technology stocks, their prices rising steeply. Artnet, the online art researcher, said that in 2014, the number of works created in the past three years and sold at auction topped 9,800, compared with about 3,100 in 2012.The total sales of Mr. Vo\u2019s works at auction have risen from about $33,700 in 2012 to $2.37 million this year.\u201cHe\u2019ll be around for a long time \u2014 one of the most important artists working today,\u201d said Carlos A. Rivera, the founder of the data website ArtRank, which tracks sales patterns. He added that Mr. Vo\u2019s classification as \u201cearly blue chip\u201d was a designation \u201cfor artists whose work may have exponentially gained value, yet who we do not feel is overvalued, nor due for a near-term correction.\u201d\u201cIf they only look at my work as a commodity, then that is something I am not interested in,\u201d Mr. Vo said. He intends to appeal the June 24 ruling, he added, before a September filing deadline.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a Kafka situation,\u201d he said, complaining about sharks and \u201cart flippers\u201d who buy and sell his works quickly, including, he says, Mr. Kreuk. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can work like this. I don\u2019t think anything can come out of me because there is such a deep resistance. It goes against everything I believe as an artist.\u201dMr. Kreuk said that he, too, believed that he had been exploited. He took the unusual step of suing, he said, on principle because the competition for contemporary art had become so fierce, and because the artist and his gallery failed to deliver the expected work. \u201cThe market has become so crazy that as a collector, you have a couple of hours to decide from a JPEG if you want something,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not, there are five others on the waiting list.\u201dMr. Vo, a Vietnamese immigrant, typically explores his past in his works. When he was 4, his family fled Vietnam in a homemade boat and was rescued at sea by a Danish ship. His family settled in Denmark, and since then, his art has reflected themes of immigration and displaced identity. He relates this history with fragments like flowers, cardboard boxes, photographs and crosses. For his installation \u201cWe the People,\u201d a copper replica of the Statue of Liberty that he made was divided into pieces that were scattered in two parks last year at opposite ends of the Brooklyn Bridge.Mr. Vo and Mr. Kreuk never signed a contract. But the legal system in the Netherlands recognizes verbal agreements backed by witnesses and other forms of evidence. Copies of the emails, provided by Mr. Kreuk, show that Mr. Vo traveled to The Hague in early 2013 to inspect the space for the coming exhibition. Rooms were booked for Mr. Vo at the request of his Berlin gallery to assemble the installation. At one point during the preparations, the gallery wrote that Mr. Vo was distracted by his father\u2019s illness, but \u201cwould be able to go ahead with the show in The Hague.\u201dMr. Kreuk, 50, who lives in Switzerland and whose wealth stems from the 2007 sale of Holland Sky Supplies, an airline supply packaging business, said: \u201cI never dictated to Vo what to make. He talked about the idea of hanging large gold carton boxes from the ceiling, which had an open skylight. We talked about the American flag theme and beer boxes.\u201dBut a few days before the exhibition, Mr. Kreuk said a package arrived at the museum with one work from Mr. Vo: the gilded Budweiser carton, with noexplanation about what had happened to the larger work, he said.After the exhibition, Mr. Kreuk was convinced that the artist had a better offer elsewhere and did not want to finish the work. He also created a debate about his role as a guest curator, because in November 2013, he put 11 works by emerging artists up for sale at Sotheby\u2019s in New York, four of them from the exhibition, including one created in 2011 by Mr. Vo.Mr. Kreuk has been unapologetic, saying he culls and sells pieces from his collection of 800 works to buy better art. The real issue, he said, is the \u201cneed for more regulation\u201d to establish a code of conduct for galleries and artists.\u201cEverybody sells,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not everybody is open about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Jeb Bush the investor made a big bet on the Affordable Care Act, and it paid off.Tim Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said he sold shares in Tenet, a health care services company, for reasons of \u201cportfolio balancing.\u201d His tax returns reflect that he also sold stock in Xerox the same day as most of his Tenet share sales. Mr. Bush served as a director of Tenet from 2007 to 2014, and like other directors, he was required as a condition of his employment to hold a significant investment in Tenet.Mr. Bush\u2019s tax returns reflect a gain of 105 percent on Tenet stock he acquired in May 2011 and sold in October 2013. Tenet shares actually gained 68 percent over that period; Mr. Bush\u2019s higher gain may be related to his receipt of restricted stock grants. Still, Tenet\u2019s 68 percent gain was much stronger than the 26 percent overall gain for the S.&P. 500 index over the same period.Like other hospital-related stocks, Tenet rose sharply from October 2012 through March 2013 \u2014 starting with the time when it seemed likely that President Obama would be re-elected and that the A.C.A. would be implemented. The law was considered a boon for hospitals because it was expected to increase usage and reduce the expense of caring for uninsured patients who could not pay their bills.Most of Mr. Bush\u2019s Tenet share sales were on Oct. 2, 2013, at a time when two events in Washington were creating uncertainty for health care companies and threatening to unwind the bull run for health care stocks driven by Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election. Oct. 2 was the second day of the government shutdown, precipitated by Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s demand that any bill to keep the government open also \u201cde-fund\u201d the health care law. It was also the second day that HealthCare.gov was supposed to be in operation, but users were not having much success navigating the site to buy health plans.In retrospect, we know those twin threats were not able to stop the health care law, and perhaps the financial markets knew it at the time: Tenet shares were actually up 6 percent on Oct. 2, 2013. The company had completed its acquisition of a rival, Vanguard Health Systems, the previous day \u2014 part of a broader trend of consolidation in the health care industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Stocks Still Look Overvalued", "Date": "2015-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsFor all the Chinese authorities\u2019 increasingly overt meddling in the market, Chinese shares are still looking expensive. Even after the country\u2019s main market indexes plunged roughly 30 percent in three weeks, on any fundamental analysis, they have further to fall.Imagine Chinese stocks give up all the gains they made in the last nine months. That\u2019s effectively how the country\u2019s last equity bubble in 2007 and 2008 ended. If Shanghai\u2019s SSE Composite Index returned to where it was last November, it would fall by roughly a third from its closing level on July 3.Another way is to compare Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong with the same companies listed on the mainland. Back in early November, shares on both markets were worth roughly the same. By early June, mainland-listed shares were trading at a 43 percent premium. Even now, the gap is 24 percent. This measure captures mostly large state-owned groups, not the smaller companies whose shares have risen even faster.There\u2019s no reason to believe that owners of China\u2019s 90 million share-trading accounts will start doing fundamental equity analysis any time soon. The boom was driven by an explosion of margin lending and belief that the government would support the market. Investors are now unwinding leveraged positions, and question whether the authorities can do much to help.The government isn\u2019t giving in yet. It has frozen new share offerings, and institutions are under pressure to buy. But even a proposed $19 billion stabilization fund looks small next to roughly $3 trillion worth of freely tradable shares, and combined average daily trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen of over $200 billion. If fundamental factors matter, Chinese share prices are still too high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why China\u2019s Stock Market Bailout Just Might Work", "Date": "2015-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOutside of China, the consensus among economists is overwhelming: The country\u2019s efforts to prop up its plunging stock markets are doomed, the financial equivalent of King Canute trying to halt the incoming tide. But this being China, the conventional wisdom may turn out to be wrong.So far, it\u2019s hard to tell whether the government\u2019s intervention is having much impact. After modest gains on Monday on news of the government\u2019s plans, Chinese shares resumed their decline, with losses on Wednesday spreading from more speculative issues (many of which have now halted trading) to investor favorites listed on United States exchanges, like the online retailer the Alibaba Group and the Internet search company Baidu. But Chinese stocks rebounded on Thursday.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.\u201cFrom a Western market perspective, what China is trying to do cuts against everything we know that will work,\u201d said Tsuyoshi Jin Saito, a founder and managing director of the Observatory Group, an economic and political advisory firm based in Washington. \u201cBut they don\u2019t see this the way we do. People in the Western democracies tolerate volatility. But the failure of equity markets in China could translate into social unrest, which is a horrifying prospect for the Chinese leadership.\u201dNo one doubts that China could step up the effort. \u201cThe truth is, they have the resources to pour into this if they want to,\u201d said Robert F. Whitelaw, chairman of the finance department at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and the co-author of several articles on valuations in China\u2019s stock markets. \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s wealth is huge. They have incredibly deep pockets.\u201dWhether China\u2019s effort at stabilizing the market succeeds is of far more than academic interest to global investors. Even though the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are largely restricted to Chinese investors, the turmoil spilled over into other markets this week on fears that a collapse in China could set off a worldwide economic slowdown. (Although investors have also been preoccupied with the Greek debt crisis, the nearly $3 trillion that China\u2019s markets have dropped is a number that dwarfs Greece\u2019s gross domestic product.)Since the 2008 financial crisis, China\u2019s relatively strong economic growth has helped propel a global recovery. And in theory, economic damage from even a precipitous market drop should be contained \u2014 Chinese stocks are still much higher than they were a year ago.But the Chinese economy was faltering even before its markets began plunging last month. Many investors are now worried that further declines in stock prices could depress Chinese consumer sentiment and demand, as well as growth prospects, with ripple effects around the globe. China is the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil and other raw materials, and commodity prices and stocks of commodity producers were hit especially hard in the sell-off this week.Even in the market-oriented United States, stock prices are not entirely free from government influence. The Federal Reserve typically floods the market with liquidity and eases monetary policy at times of crisis and market panic. During the financial crisis, United States regulators banned the short sale of stocks of financial companies in the belief that short-selling, in which investors borrow shares hoping to sell them later at a lower price, drives down prices. (Subsequent studies concluded that the effort was futile.) China is also restricting short-selling.But Mr. Saito pointed out that a similar effort in Japan in the early 1990s also seemed to be working \u2014 until it didn\u2019t. The Nikkei index hit a historical high of nearly 40,000 at the end of 1989, and the market\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio was an astronomical 60. After the bubble burst, the market dropped 38 percent in 1990. By 1992, the index had dropped below 17,000, and the government began buying stocks. The Nikkei rallied for two years but then resumed its plunge, hitting a low of close to 7,000 after the financial crisis. (This week it traded just below 20,000.)China now faces the consequences of its own bubble. The Shanghai stock market jumped 135 percent in just nine months and was trading at a post-financial-crisis high in June. At its recent peak, the price-to-earnings ratio was over 37, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ, compared with a historical average of just over 10. The Shenzhen market valuation was even more elevated, with a price-earnings ratio in June of nearly 80. And many investors do not trust the reported earnings of Chinese companies, believing them to be inflated, especially those of smaller companies.The lofty valuations were accompanied by frenzied retail investing, heavy buying using borrowed money and people leaving their jobs to day-trade \u2014 all signs of a classic bubble. In recent months, trading volume has sometimes exceeded that of all the world\u2019s other stock markets combined. And all of this was occurring during a pronounced slowdown in Chinese economic growth, growing concerns about a real estate bubble, and huge nonperforming loans on the books of Chinese banks.Not only does the Chinese government\u2019s timing seem bad, but its target investment in stocks of just under $20 billion is also a negligible percentage of China\u2019s total market value, according to Mr. Saito. Together, the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges are the world\u2019s second largest (behind the United States stock market), with a total market capitalization of over $9.5 trillion. By comparison, he said, Japan is believed to have spent about 0.8 percent of its market\u2019s value in the 1990s, a much larger relative amount that was nonetheless insufficient.\u201cFrom a purely economic perspective, all of this suggests China\u2019s effort will fail,\u201d Mr. Saito said.Still, he added, \u201cChina is a Communist regime that can ignore market rules.\u201d Both he and Mr. Whitelaw agreed that if China hopes to succeed, it could substantially increase the size of its financial commitment, and at some point the market will respond.Because of the recent plunge, Chinese stocks are starting to look more reasonably valued, with the blue-chip Hang Seng index trading this week at a price-earnings ratio of just 11, according to Capital IQ. This week\u2019s volatility suggested to some traders that Chinese stocks were finding a bottom for now, which might make additional government-backed buying more effective.There have been rumors that the government is readying a much larger fund for direct stock purchases. \u201cThe Chinese government doesn\u2019t care about losing a few billion dollars here or there,\u201d Mr. Whitelaw said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to protect investors and maintain stability. Who wouldn\u2019t want that?\u201dBut Mr. Saito warned that the best China can hope for, even with major intervention, is to buy time while it waits for the country\u2019s economic fundamentals to improve. If they don\u2019t, the Chinese market, like all stock markets, will eventually fall to the level that reflects investors\u2019 expectations for future earnings.\u201cUltimately, not even China can defy the laws of economic gravity,\u201d Mr. Saito said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Guide to China\u2019s Market Turmoil", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nThe Chinese stock market rout in recent weeks has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide. If stocks continue to fall, that could erode consumer confidence in China and slow further the country\u2019s already weakening economy, which would have painful implications for the global economy.\nBut the rally defied fundamentals, prompting concerns of a bubble. Stocks rose even as the Chinese economy was slowing. While foreigners and domestic institutions bought shares in large companies with fairly stable businesses, working-class and middle-class families mainly bought inexpensive shares in small and medium-size companies, and kept buying these shares simply because they were rising. Weak balance sheets and chronic problems with corporate governance at many of these companies were swept aside. In recent months, the Chinese stocks have experienced brief periods of weakness, as investors started to grow concerned that the market was getting overheated. The government, though, has regularly reassured investors, helping to steady the markets. RelatedSince June 25, the Chinese government has tried a series of policy measures to halt the slide. It has cut interest rates, made more loans available to buyers of stocks and promised to investigate anyone involved in market manipulation. Brokerage houses have been ordered to pump billions of dollars into the market. And government-backed funds have earmarked billions more to prop up the shares of flagging companies.A wave of additional measures are meant to prop up prices. Stock trading transactions were slashed. I.P.O.s were suspended. And China\u2019s insurance regulator eased rules so that insurers could more easily invest in stocks.On July 8, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance pledged to \u201cadopt measures to safeguard the stability of capital markets,\u201d and in particular protect state-owned financial enterprises. The move signals that this broad-based effort is being directed from the very top echelons of the state.The Chinese markets have only recently started to open up to outside investors, so overseas players are not heavily exposed to the downturn. Such investors own an estimated 4 percent of Chinese shares. And they have been heavily concentrated in large companies, which have not been as volatile as their smaller brethren.But stock market routs can quickly spread. The Hong Kong market withstood previous bouts of selling, but fell on July 6 after the Chinese government\u2019s moves. And foreigners have invested heavily in the Hong Kong market, often as a proxy for mainland China.Possibly.China has the world\u2019s second-largest economy. It is the biggest importer of commodities, from countries like Australia and Brazil. China is also a huge buyer of factory equipment and other machinery in Germany and other places. If the Chinese stock market slump damages consumer confidence, it could lead to a slowdown in those purchases.The stock market weakness, should it spread to the Chinese economy over the long term, could prompt Beijing to reassess its overseas loans and investments. Many countries, industries and companies have come to depend on Chinese money to fund their own growth. But Chinese outbound investment could still increase if companies and individuals seek safety overseas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Investing Signals to Listen To? They\u2019re Personal, Not in the Markets", "Date": "2015-07-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyWhat happens when we\u2019re driving and we reach a red light? We stop, right? When the light turns green, we hit the gas. If we don\u2019t, it usually doesn\u2019t take long for the driver behind us to start honking the horn.Anyone who has survived driver\u2019s education (or sitting in the back of a taxi) knows we\u2019re inclined to connect certain behavior with red and green lights. We\u2019ve gotten so used to certain signals, in fact, that sometimes we forget to consider whether the signal truly requires us to act or has somehow managed to confuse us.For instance, the light may be green, but what if a crazy pedestrian crosses the street in front of us? We don\u2019t keep going. We stop, wait for that person to reach the other side of the road, and then go.Now, consider the stock market\u2019s signals and noises. Its performance gets measured every moment of every day, down to a tenth of a point. That\u2019s a lot of noise, and we often confuse it for a signal. The most common example has to be down days versus up days. If the market goes up, the nonrational part of our brain hears the noise of that higher number and thinks, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a signal to buy.\u201d If the market goes down, that same area urges us to \u201cSell, sell, sell.\u201dBut what if \u2014 and maybe this is a silly idea \u2014 we didn\u2019t do anything? Or, what if we at least didn\u2019t do anything that wasn\u2019t based on a plan? What if we ignored the noise and instead focused on signals that relate to us personally?Of course, if you don\u2019t have a simple financial plan guiding your overall strategy, this experiment will prove a little tricky. For now, though, let\u2019s assume you do have one. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s built on the weighty evidence of history, your goals and your values. What signals does your plan tell you actually matter? I\u2019m betting it\u2019s not the daily movement of the markets.In my experience, a well-designed plan relies on two signals. First, there would need to be a change in goals or values before you bought or sold stock. Second, there might be a change that you had actually scheduled, like selling stocks and buying bonds when stocks have gone up. In both instances, how the markets are moving and what the talking heads are reporting are not signals to act. Instead, you\u2019re weighing what you said you wanted to happen five years ago with what you want to have happen right now or five years from now.Did you decide that you really love your work, and retiring in a few years just doesn\u2019t make sense anymore? That\u2019s a signal to change your plan. As part of your investment strategy, did you decide to keep your portfolio divided 70/30 between stocks and bonds? If your portfolio value now measures closer to a 65/35 split, that\u2019s a signal to rebalance.These signals are personal. They\u2019re based on what\u2019s happening to you, not what\u2019s happening in China or Greece. But we\u2019ve grown used to the idea that when markets move, they\u2019re a signal for us to move, too. In most cases, we\u2019re better off ignoring the noise and doing the exact opposite.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Case for a Tax on Financial Transactions", "Date": "2015-07-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 LIKE it or not, the campaign season is upon us, and that almost certainly means somebody is going to try to buy your vote with a tax cut \u2014 even though average federal tax rates are already low in historical terms, our tax code remains tilted in favor of the wealthy, and our children, neighborhoods and infrastructure desperately need public investment.What would really be interesting is if a candidate proposed the opposite: a new way to raise more revenues.What\u2019s more, a financial transaction tax could significantly reduce the amount of high-frequency trading. This trading, most of it automated, is used to make windfall profits through arbitrage (taking advantage of small differences in price) in milliseconds. It does nothing to help ordinary investors and can destabilize financial markets.Before addressing potential objections, consider this: A one-basis-point tax on $1,000 worth of stock would cost the stock trader a dime. A $100,000 trade would generate a tax of only $10.How, then, does such a tiny tax raise so many billions? Because the base to which it\u2019s applied \u2014 the mass of securities traded in United States financial markets \u2014 is in the hundreds of trillions of dollars.One concern is that if we tax trades, we\u2019ll get fewer trades, and less liquidity. History suggests that trading volume would in fact decline somewhat as transactions became more expensive. But is this a bad thing?Liquidity is critical in financial markets, both for efficient \u201cprice discovery\u201d \u2014 quickly discerning the market value of assets \u2014 and for the basic market operation of matching buyers and sellers. If a market gets too \u201cthin,\u201d say because increased transaction costs lead to a decline in trading volumes, price discovery gets harder.There is, however, such a thing as too much liquidity, particularly when high-frequency traders get into the mix. Instead of improving efficiency, these traders often insert themselves between normal-speed traders, a practice known as \u201cfront-running.\u201dWith a transaction tax in place, the sheer magnitude of high-frequency trades and the tiny margins they pursue will become unprofitable.The historical evidence on whether reduced liquidity resulting from a transaction tax raises or lowers market volatility \u2014 sharp, distortionary movements in prices \u2014 is inconclusive. But high-frequency trading has recently become a much larger share of the market, now over 50 percent in some of our busiest exchanges. So while we should proceed with caution, introducing such a tax is likely to reduce excessive liquidity.Still, a transaction tax would be more effective if it were adopted worldwide. Fortunately, we may be headed in that direction. Eleven countries of the European Union agreed to implement such a tax, in 2013, though pressure from opponents caused the introduction to be postponed until next year.It\u2019s also worth noting that transaction taxes of one type or another have long been in place in countries with thriving financial markets, including Britain, Hong Kong, Singapore and many others. So it simply can\u2019t be the case that they\u2019re unworkable.As you\u2019d expect, the financial transaction tax would be highly progressive, another selling point given our era of high and growing inequality. According to the Tax Policy Center, 75 percent of the liability from the tax would fall on the top fifth of taxpayers, and 40 percent on the top 1 percent. The tax would also fall more on high-volume traders than on long-term investors, of course. And the proceeds could be used for investments to reduce inequality and increase mobility.There are still many issues to consider. Should the tax fall on buyers, sellers or both? Should government debt be exempt? How, for the purpose of the tax, do you value complex derivatives? One insight from the tax in other countries: Whatever you exempt quickly becomes the security that everyone is trading. So if we want to keep the rate low, we\u2019ll need to keep the base broad.I\u2019d recommend a three- to five-basis-points financial transaction tax, preferably introduced in tandem with the European Union\u2019s. (I view Senator Sanders\u2019s proposal for a 50-basis-point tax on stock trades to be too high.) By phasing the tax in by one basis point per year, we can monitor its impact on liquidity and volatility. To opponents, I say: If our financial markets will crumble in the face of a one-basis-point financial transaction tax, then we\u2019ve got much bigger problems than I thought.A financial transaction tax is a smart, fair way to raise urgently needed revenues while reducing unnecessary trading that makes our markets more volatile. Let\u2019s give it a shot.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Bond Yields Rise, Go Long. Also Short.", "Date": "2015-07-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySudden leaps in bond yields during the second quarter caused prices to experience scary downdrafts. That may lead investors to wonder whether this is a time for buying or selling. The answer for some managers is: Yes.Long/short bond funds hold a mix of positions, some that benefit when prices rise and others when they fall. The approach may be used to anticipate performance discrepancies between types of bonds based on a call on some broad factor like the direction of interest rates or currency movements. The long and short holdings can be in bonds with different maturities: high yield versus investment grade or foreign versus domestic.Another tactic is to focus on one niche, often high-yield, and execute pair trades, buying corporate bonds thought to have strong prospects and selling others that are substantially alike \u2014 same industry, similar maturity, similar credit rating \u2014 but that the manager holds in lower regard. Pair trades create little net investment in any area and, depending on what else it owns, the fund can have net market exposure that is positive, negative or neutral.If your goal is to limit risk in your portfolio, analysts and financial advisers encourage caution before giving long/short bond funds a try. After migrating from the hedge fund universe into mainstream mutual funds, they are a fairly new vehicle. Morningstar identifies 24 funds, including just three with track records beyond five years. It is unclear how they will perform in different conditions, especially when the love affair with riskier debt cools off \u2014 the very development that prospective buyers may want immunity from.\u201cGiven where we are in the credit cycle, people are starting to think about what happens when high-yield bonds sell off,\u201d said Jason Kephart, an analyst at Morningstar who specializes in alternative investments. Long/short funds \u201ccan offer protection against that, but none of them have been around for any significant credit sell-off. That\u2019s why we\u2019re neutral on them. The question is whether they can outperform a long-only credit fund over a full market cycle.\u201dRichard Saperstein, chief investment officer of HighTower Treasury Partners, has similar questions. Not only is there little history on which to evaluate the funds, he said, but they also tend to have high costs, creating an especially heavy burden with interest rates low and bond income meager. Several funds have annual expenses exceeding 2 percent, and many are sold with upfront sales charges, too.The funds can be expensive to operate for several reasons. Their asset bases are small, finding bonds ripe for moving in one direction or the other requires extensive analysis, and some funds borrow heavily to have more money to invest and, if all goes well, amplify gains.Do long/short funds deliver sufficient returns to compensate for their high costs and complexity? It depends on what they are compared with. The average one was up 1.14 percent in the first five months of 2015. That is better than the 0.85 percent gain of the average nontraditional bond fund, the category in which Morningstar places long/short funds, but below the 2.41 percent gain for high-yield funds. Long/short lagged the other groups over one and three years and was between the two, albeit with a smaller number of funds, over five years. Long/short funds have held up fairly well in part because many have sold short sparingly or selectively, or both, especially in stronger segments of the market like high yield. That has been a wise policy during a long bull market that still may be in progress.\u201cIt\u2019s humbling and challenging to make money shorting\u201d high-yield debt, said Mark Kiesel, manager of Pimco Credit Absolute Return, one of the larger long/short funds and one of the better performers over one and three years. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been short much because we have a positive view on the market.\u201dMr. Kiesel finds that picking bonds to buy and sell requires the same skills as picking stocks, including an understanding of dynamics within companies, industries and the economy. His long bond positions lately have been in companies involved in energy production and other economically sensitive areas like lodging and building materials. He also favors specialty finance companies as a play on consumer spending.He is either shorting or avoiding bonds of companies involved in mining, which he expects to suffer as Chinese imports subside, and in retailing and oil field services. The portfolio also contains bets on continued declines in the euro and yen against the dollar.No matter how a company makes a profit, he considers ones that are the targets of shareholder activists to be good shorting candidates. Shareholders tend to lobby for corporate policies that produce better deals for themselves at the expense of bondholders, Mr. Kiesel said.Cedar Ridge Unconstrained Credit, a much smaller fund that has performed well since it was introduced in late 2013, emphasizes domestic high-yield and investment-grade corporate issues. The fund is usually net long, although it can be net short at times, and often maintains pair trades, said Jeff Hudson, a co-manager.The portfolio, like Pimco\u2019s, has long positions in specialty finance, but it owns bonds of mining companies, a niche where Pimco has been short. Cedar Ridge Unconstrained has been short in technology; telecommunications; heavy industry, including chemicals; and in consumer discretionary, the sector that encompasses retailing and carmaking. As of Feb. 28, the latest date for which details were available, its largest short position, apart from Treasury instruments, was a 2043 Ford bond with a 4.75 percent coupon.The consumer shorts, Mr. Hudson said, are \u201ca call on some big companies that aren\u2019t growing as much as some people think they are.\u201dThe fund also maintains a short Treasury bond position, something that it or its predecessor hedge fund has used for most of the 11 years of the long/short strategy\u2019s existence. It is not a bet on higher interest rates, but an effort not to bet on rates at all. The short is intended to neutralize the rate risk inherent in the fund\u2019s other holdings so that the only exposure is to credit risk.\u201cWe use Treasuries to isolate the portfolio and be rate-agnostic as best we can and be less susceptible to rate moves,\u201d Mr. Hudson said.For true believers in forecasts of a fresh round of Federal Reserve rate increases, one factor underpinning recent nervousness in the bond market, Mr. Saperstein of HighTower contends that there are easier ways to guard against them than long/short funds.\u201cThe more elegant way to protect against rate risk is to reduce duration in a portfolio,\u201d he said, meaning to own bonds with shorter maturities, which makes them less sensitive to changes in rates. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to sell longer-term paper to reduce overall price risk.\u201dShorting Treasuries in an otherwise substantially long bond portfolio, especially one concentrated in less creditworthy issues, also opens up the possibility of having the worst of both worlds in case of an event similar to the 2008 collapse of the high-yield market, even a milder version, Mr. Kephart of Morningstar warned.\u201cIf there\u2019s a big credit sell-off,\u201d a long/short fund \u201cis going to fall less than a long-only fund, but Treasuries would do well in a rush to safety,\u201d he said. Long/short funds are no substitute for funds that hold safer, higher-quality instruments, in his view, and should be considered only for holding riskier bonds in a potentially safer way.\u201cThese funds are good for diversifying a high-yield portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can make sense provided you go for a good manager of a good fund at a fair price \u2014 ideally a cheap price.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Much of this catch comes from the waters off Thailand, where Mr. Long was held, and is sold to the United States, typically for canned cat and dog food or feed for poultry, pigs and farm-raised fish that Americans consume.The misery endured by Mr. Long, who was eventually rescued by an aid group, is not uncommon in the maritime world. Labor abuse at sea can be so severe that the boys and men who are its victims might as well be captives from a bygone era. In interviews, those who fled recounted horrific violence: the sick cast overboard, the defiant beheaded, the insubordinate sealed for days below deck in a dark, fetid fishing hold.The harsh practices have intensified in recent years, a review of hundreds of accounts from escaped deckhands provided to police, immigration and human rights workers shows. That is because of lax maritime labor laws and an insatiable global demand for seafood even as fishing stocks are depleted.Shipping records, customs data and dozens of interviews with government and maritime officials point to a greater reliance on long-haul fishing, in which vessels stay at sea, sometimes for years, far from the reach of authorities. With rising fuel prices and fewer fish close to shore, fisheries experts predict that more boats will resort to venturing out farther, exacerbating the potential for mistreatment.While forced labor exists throughout the world, nowhere is the problem more pronounced than here in the South China Sea, especially in the Thai fishing fleet, which faces an annual shortage of about 50,000 mariners, based on United Nations estimates. The shortfall is primarily filled by using migrants, mostly from Cambodia and Myanmar.The migrants, who are relatively invisible because most are undocumented, disappear beyond the horizon on \u201cghost ships\u201d \u2014 unregistered vessels that the Thai government does not know exist.They usually do not speak the language of their Thai captains, do not know how to swim, and have never seen the sea before being whisked from shore, according to interviews in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. These interviews, in port or on fishing boats at sea, were conducted with more than three dozen current deckhands or former crew members.Government intervention is rare. While United Nations pacts and various human rights protections prohibit forced labor, the Thai military and law enforcement authorities do little to counter misconduct on the high seas. United Nations officials and rights organizations accuse some of them of taking bribes from traffickers to allow safe passage across the border. Migrants often report being rescued by police officers from one smuggler only to be resold to another.The United States is the biggest customer of Thai fish, and pet food is among the fastest growing exports from Thailand, more than doubling since 2009 and last year totaling more than $190 million. The average pet cat in the United States eats 30 pounds of fish per year, about double that of a typical American.Though there is growing pressure from Americans and other Western consumers for more accountability in seafood companies\u2019 supply chains to ensure against illegal fishing and contaminated or counterfeit fish, virtually no attention has focused on the labor that supplies the seafood that people eat, much less the fish that is fed to animals.\u201cHow fast do their pets eat what\u2019s put in front of them, and are there whole meat chunks in that meal?\u201d asked Giovanni M. Turchini, an environmental professor at Deakin University in Australia who studies the global fish markets. \u201cThese are the factors that pet owners most focus on.\u201dIt is difficult to overstate the dangers of commercial fishing. Two days spent more than 100 miles from shore on a Thai fishing ship with two dozen Cambodian boys, some as young as 15, showed the brutal rhythm of this work.Rain or shine, shifts run 18 to 20 hours. Summer temperatures top 100 degrees. The deck is an obstacle course of jagged tackle, whirring winches and tall stacks of 500-pound nets. Ocean spray and fish innards make the floor skating-rink slippery. The ship seesaws, particularly in rough seas and gale winds. Most boys work barefoot; 15-foot swells climb the sides, clipping them below the knees. Much of this occurs in pitch blackness. Purse seiners, like this ship, usually cast their nets at night when the small silver forage fish that they target \u2014 mostly jack mackerel and herring \u2014 are easier to spot.When they are not fishing, the Cambodians, most of whom were recruited by traffickers, sort their catch and fix the nets, which are prone to ripping. One 17-year-old boy proudly showed a hand missing two fingers \u2014 severed by a nylon line that had coiled around a spinning crank. The migrants\u2019 hands, which are virtually never fully dry, have open wounds, slit from fish scales and torn from the nets\u2019 friction. \u201cFish is inside us,\u201d one of the boys said. They stitch closed the deeper cuts themselves. Infections are constant.Thailand\u2019s commercial fishing fleet consists predominantly of bottom trawlers, called the strip-miners of the sea because they use nets weighted to sink to the ocean floor and ensnare almost everything in their path. But purse seine boats, like the one where these Cambodians work, are common too. They use circular nets to target fish closer to the water\u2019s surface. After the nets are hauled upward, they are pinched at the top, like old-style coin purses.Before arriving on the ship, most of the Cambodians had never seen a body of water larger than a lake. The few who could swim were responsible for diving into the inky sea to ensure that the 50-foot mouth of the nets closed properly. If one of them were to get tangled in the mesh and yanked underwater, it is likely that no one would notice right away. The work is frenzied and loud, as the boys chant in unison while pulling the nets.Meals on board consist of a once-daily bowl of rice, flecked with boiled squid or other throwaway fish. In the galley, the wheel room and elsewhere, countertops crawl with roaches. The toilet is a removable wooden floorboard on deck. At night, vermin clean the boys\u2019 unwashed plates. The ship\u2019s mangy dog barely lifts her head when rats, which roam all over the ship, eat from her bowl.Crew members tend to sleep in two-hour snatches, packed into an intensely hot crawl space. Too many bodies share the same air, with fishing-net hammocks hanging from a ceiling that is less than five feet above the floor. Deafening, the engine turbines throb incessantly, shaking the ship\u2019s wooden deck. Every so often, the engine coughs a black cloud of acrid fumes into the sleeping quarters.These conditions, which are typical on long-haul fishing vessels, are part of the reason that the Thai fishing fleet is chronically short of men. Thailand has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world \u2014 generally less than 1 percent \u2014 which means native workers have no trouble finding easier, better paying jobs on land.\u201cYou just have to work hard,\u201d said Pier, 17, one of the migrants on the purse seiner. Pier, who goes by only one name, said he liked life on the ship. \u201cBetter than home,\u201d he said, \u201cNothing to do there.\u201d He flexed his sinewy biceps, showing the results of his labor.In the dead of night, the captain spotted a school of fish on radar. He roused the crew with an air horn. Pier, in his second year of working on the ship, explained that he still owed the captain some of the $300 he paid a smuggler to get him from the border to port. The rest of his debt, $90, was from a cash advance he sent back to his family, he said. Willing to answer other questions, Pier silently looked down when asked whether he had ever been beaten. Several other boys, questioned about the same, furtively looked to the captain and shook their heads to indicate that they did not want to be interviewed.Indentured servitude \u2014 a \u201ctravel now, pay later\u201d labor system where people work to clear a debt typically accrued for getting free passage to another country \u2014 is common in the developing world, especially in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and the sex industry. It is more pervasive and abusive at sea, human rights experts say, because those workers are so isolated.Historically, Thai boat captains paid large advances to deckhands so they could sustain their families during their long absences. But the country\u2019s labor crisis has converted this upfront cash into a price per head (or \u201ckha hua\u201d fee) given to smugglers who ferry workers across the border.Standing on the boat next to Pier, another Cambodian boy tried to explain how elusive the kha hua debt becomes once they leave land. Pointing to his own shadow and moving around as if he were trying to grab it, he said: \u201cCan\u2019t catch.\u201dThe boat\u2019s Thai crew master, Tang, a man with pockmarked skin and missing front teeth, ordered the boys back to work. He then ticked off a list of the pressures on deep-sea captains. Fuel costs eat up about 60 percent of a vessel\u2019s earnings, double what they did two decades ago. Once fish are caught, storing them in melting ice is a race against the clock. As fish thaw, their protein content falls, dropping their sale price. And, Tang added, because deep-sea fishing boats work on commission, \u201cCrews only get paid if we catch enough.\u201dCaptains fear their crews as intensely as they drive them. Language and cultural barriers create divisions; most boats here have three Thai officers and foreign deckhands. The captain is armed, in part because of the threat of pirates, but Tang also talked of a gruesome mutiny on another ship that left all the officers dead.Tales of forced labor are not always what they seem, according to the boat\u2019s captain, who insisted on anonymity as a condition of allowing a reporter on board. Some workers sign up willingly, only to change their minds once at sea, while others make up stories of mistreatment in hopes of getting back to their families, he said.Still, a half-dozen other captains acknowledged that forced labor is common. It is unavoidable, they argue, given the country\u2019s demand for laborers. Every time a boat docks, they said, they fret that their willing workers will bolt to better-paying ships. That is also the moment when captive migrants make a run for it.Short-handed at the 11th hour, captains sometimes take desperate measures. \u201cThey just snatch people,\u201d one captain explained, noting that some migrants are drugged or kidnapped and forced onto boats. \u201cBrokers charge double.\u201dTraveling the coast of the South China Sea, it can seem that every migrant has his own story of abuse.Skippers never lacked for amphetamines so laborers could work longer, but rarely stocked antibiotics for infected wounds. Former deckhands described \u201cprison islands\u201d \u2014 most often uninhabited atolls, of which there are hundreds in the South China Sea. Fishing captains sometimes maroon their captive crews on those islands, sometimes for weeks, while their vessels are taken to port for dry docking and repair.Thai government officials said they have stepped up the number of investigations and prosecutions and plan to continue doing so. A registration drive is underway to count undocumented workers and provide them with identity cards, added Vijavat Isarabhakdi, Thailand\u2019s ambassador to the United States until this year. The government has also established several centers around the country for trafficking victims.San Oo, 35, a soft-spoken Burmese man with weather-beaten skin, predicted that until ship captains are prosecuted, little will improve. He described how on his first day of two and a half years in captivity, his captain warned that he had killed the seaman Mr. Oo was replacing. \u201cIf you disobey or run or get sick I will do it again,\u201d he recalled his captain saying.Pak, a 38-year-old Cambodian who fled a Thai trawler last year, ended up on the Kei Islands, in Indonesia\u2019s eastern Banda Sea. The United Nations estimated that hundreds of migrants there escaped fishing boats over the last decade. \u201cYou belong to the captain,\u201d Pak said, recounting watching a man so desperate that he jumped overboard and drowned. \u201cSo he can sell you if he wants.\u201dCritics have faulted Thailand for what they say is a deliberate failure to confront the larger causes of abuse in fishing. Compared to its neighbors, Thailand has less stringent rules on how long boats can remain at sea. Last year, it was the only country to vote against a United Nations treaty on forced labor requiring governments to punish traffickers, before reversing its stance in the face of international pressure.Thai officials also proposed using prison labor on fishing boats as a way to shift away from migrant workers, a plan dropped after an outcry from human rights groups. On Monday, the State Department renewed Thailand\u2019s ranking on the lowest rung of governments that do not meet minimum standards in countering human trafficking.The other Thai industry where forced labor is common is sex work, said Mr. Robertson, from Human Rights Watch. The two industries intersect in run-down towns like Ranong, along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Labor brokers operate with impunity in these towns. Karaoke bars double as brothels and debt traps.A tavern owner named Rui sat down to make his pitch late one night in November, pointing to two prepubescent girls who sat in a corner, wearing caked-on makeup and tight, glittery skirts. He spread a stack of Polaroid pictures of them from a year before. Each clutched a stuffed animal in the photos and looked scared. \u201cPopular,\u201d Rui said of the girls now. \u201cVery popular now.\u201dA beer at Rui\u2019s tavern cost about $1. Sex with a \u201cpopular\u201d girl: $12. For the tattered men, mostly Burmese, who end up here, a couple of evenings at the tavern can add up to kingly sum. Many of them have trekked hundreds of miles by foot, not a cent on them, hoping for work. Meals, drugs and lodging, offered as favors, show up later as fees. To clear these bills, migrants are sometimes sold to the sea.Checking boats for human rights abuses is difficult. Most fishing vessels are exempt from international rules requiring the onboard tracking systems used by law enforcement. Marine officials in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia said that their navies rarely inspect for labor and immigration violations. Authorities in those countries added that they lack boats and fuel needed to reach the ships farthest from shore that are most prone to using captive labor.Deep-sea fishing generally does not lend itself to timecards or pay stubs. Labor contracts common in the region often include terms that would seem unthinkable in jobs on land.For instance, a contract from a manpower agency in Singapore, provided to The New York Times, committed deckhands to a three-year tour during which the agency retained the full $200 per month for the first six months and $150 per month thereafter. \u201cDaily working hours will be around 18 hours,\u201d the contract stipulates, adding that there is no overtime pay. Boats may remain at sea for longer than a year per trip. Only seawater may be used for bathing and laundry. Mariners can be traded from boat to boat at the captain\u2019s discretion.\u201cAll biscuits, noodles, soft drinks and cigarettes\u201d are to be purchased by the sailor, the contract says. \u201cAny crew who breaches the contract (own sickness, lazy or rejected by the Captain, etc.) must bear all the expenses incurred in going back home.\u201dThe boat that delivered Mr. Long to captivity and subsequently rescued him was known as a \u201cmothership.\u201d Carrying everything from fuel and extra food to spare nets and replacement labor, these lumbering vessels, often over a hundred feet long, function as the roving resupply stores of the marine world. Motherships are the reason that slow-moving trawlers can fish more than 1,500 miles from land. They allow fishermen to stay out at sea for months or years and still get their catch cleaned, canned and shipped to American shelves less than a week after netting.But once a load of fish is transferred to a mothership, which keeps the cargo below deck in cavernous refrigerators, there is almost no way for port-side authorities to determine its provenance. It becomes virtually impossible to know whether it was caught legally by paid fishermen or poached illegally by shackled migrants.Bar codes on pet food in some European countries enable far-flung consumers to track Thai-exported seafood to its onshore processing facilities, where it was canned or otherwise packaged. But the supply chain for the 28 million tons of forage fish caught annually around the globe, about a third of all fish caught at sea and much of it used for pet and animal feed, is invisible before that.Human rights advocates have called for a variety of measures to provide greater oversight, including requiring all commercial fishing ships to have electronic transponders for onshore monitoring and banning the system of long stays at sea and the supply ships that make them possible. But their efforts have gotten little traction. The profits for seafood businesses still far exceed the risks for those who exploit workers, said Mark P. Lagon, who formerly served as the State Department\u2019s ambassador at large focused on human trafficking.Lisa K. Gibby, vice president of corporate communications for Nestl\u00e9, which makes pet food brands including Fancy Feast and Purina, said that the company is working hard to ensure that forced labor is not used to produce its pet food. \u201cThis is neither an easy nor a quick endeavor,\u201d she added, because the fish it purchases comes from multiple ports and fishing vessels operating in international waters.Some pet food companies are trying to move away from using fish. Mars Inc., for example, which sold more than $16 billion worth of pet food globally in 2012, roughly a quarter of the world\u2019s market, has already replaced fishmeal in some of its pet food and will continue in that direction. By 2020, the company plans to use only non-threatened fish caught legally or raised on farms and certified by third-party auditors as not being linked to forced labor.Over the past year, Mars received more than 90,000 cartons of cat and dog food from the cannery supplied by one of the boats where Lang Long was held captive, according to the Customs documents.In Songkhla, on Thailand\u2019s southeast coast, Suchat Junthalukkhana thumbed through an inch-thick binder, each page with a photograph of a fleeing mariner whom his organization, the Stella Maris Seafarers Center, had helped.\u201cWe get a new case every week,\u201d he said.The fate of the men who escape from the fishing boats often relies on chance encounters with altruistic strangers who contact Stella Maris or the other groups that make up an underground railroad that runs through Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand.One such inadvertent rescuer was Som Nang, 41, who said his name means \u201cgood luck\u201d in Khmer. A squat man, he is quick to show off the retractable metal rod that he keeps with him for protection.Having worked dockside for several years, Som Nang had heard the tales of fishing-boat brutality. None of it prepared him, however, for what he would witness on his maiden voyage on a mothership late in 2013.\u201cI wish I had never seen it,\u201d Som Nang said, sitting in his cinder-block home just outside Songkhla. After a four-day trip from shore, Som Nang\u2019s supply boat pulled alongside a dilapidated Thai-flagged trawler with an eight-man crew that had just finished two weeks fishing in Indonesian waters where they were not allowed.It was difficult not to notice Mr. Long, who crouched near the front of the fishing boat, Som Nang said. Padlocked around his bruised neck was a rusty metal collar attached to a three-foot chain looped to an anchor post. Mr. Long, who was the only Cambodian among the Burmese deckhands and the Thai senior crew, stared, unblinking, at anyone willing to make eye contact.\u201cPlease help me,\u201d Som Nang, who is also Cambodian, recounted Mr. Long whispering in Khmer. That was 30 months after Mr. Long had met a trafficker along the Thai-Cambodian border during a festival. Mr. Long said he never intended to work in Thailand but the job offer was attractive. When he instead arrived at a port near Samut Prakan, the trafficker sold him to a boat captain for about $530, less than a water buffalo typically costs. He was then marched up a gangplank, and sent due west for four days.A police report later described his account of his arrival in captivity: \u201cThree fishing boats surrounded the supply boat and began fighting for Mr. Long,\u201d the report says. Similar arguments broke out a year later when Mr. Long was sold again in the middle of the night between trawlers.The longer he spent on the boats, the more his trafficking debt should have lightened, bettering his prospects for release. But the opposite was the case, Mr. Long explained. The more experience he had, the bleaker his fate, the higher the price on his head, the hotter the arguments over him between short-handed trawler captains.Having never seen the sea before, Mr. Long seemed to tangle his portion of the nets more than others, he said. All the fish looked the same to him \u2014 small and silver \u2014 making sorting difficult. Slowed at first by intense seasickness, Mr. Long said he sped up after witnessing a captain whipping a man for working too slowly.Mr. Long suffered similarly. \u201cHe was beat with a pole made of wood or metal,\u201d said a case report about him from the Office of the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand. \u201cSome days he had rest of only 1 hour.\u201d When drinking water ran low, deckhands stole foul-tasting ice from the barrels of fish. If one of the seamen put gear away incorrectly, the crew master docked the day\u2019s meal for the offender.Mr. Long said he often considered jumping overboard to escape. He did not know how to swim, though, and he never once saw land during his time at sea, Mr. Long told a doctor who later treated him. At night he had access to the ship\u2019s radio. But he had no idea whom or how he could call for help.As much as he feared the captains, Mr. Long said, the ocean scared him more. Waves, some five stories high, battered the deck in rough seas.When Som Nang\u2019s boat showed up, Mr. Long had been wearing the shackle on and off for about nine months. The captain typically put it on him once a week, Mr. Long said, whenever other boats approached.After offloading fish for about 10 minutes, Som Nang said he asked the captain why Mr. Long was chained. \u201cBecause he keeps trying to escape,\u201d the captain replied, according to Som Nang. Based on the looks he got from the crew on his mothership, Som Nang said he figured it best to stop asking questions. But after returning to port, he contacted Stella Maris, which began raising the 25,000 baht, roughly $750, needed to buy Mr. Long\u2019s freedom.Over the next several months, Som Nang resupplied the fishing boat twice. Each time, Mr. Long was shackled. Som Nang said he discreetly tried to reassure him that he was working to free him.In April 2014, Mr. Long\u2019s captivity ended in the most undramatic of ways. Som Nang carried a brown paper bag full of Thai currency from Stella Maris to a meeting point in the middle of the South China Sea, roughly a week\u2019s travel from shore. With few words exchanged, the money was handed to Mr. Long\u2019s captain. His debt paid, Mr. Long, rail-thin, stepped onto Som Nang\u2019s boat and began his journey back to solid ground and a hope for home.Thai immigration officials who have investigated his case say they found it credible. Mr. Long is in the process of being repatriated back to his native village, Koh Sotin, in Cambodia. He hopes to go back to his old job cleaning a local Buddhist temple, he said. Thai and Indonesian marine officials say they are trying to locate his last boat captain but they are not hopeful because there are so many of these illegal vessels.During his six-day voyage back to shore on the mothership, Mr. Long cried and slept most of the time. Som Nang said the crew hid him to avoid word getting out to other fishing boats about their role in the rescue.Mr. Long, who has a perpetually vacant gaze, said he never wanted to eat fish again. He added that at first he had tried to keep track of the passing days and months at sea by etching notches in the wooden railing. Eventually he gave that up. \u201cI never thought I would see land again,\u201d he said.Som Nang, who is now a security guard at a factory, said he stopped working at sea shortly after his rescue trip. His explanation: \u201cI don\u2019t like what is out there.\u201dKitty Bennett and Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

In and of itself, the price of Chinese equities shouldn\u2019t matter all that much. But the authorities have chosen to put their credibility on the line by trying to control that market \u2014 and are in the process of demonstrating that, China\u2019s remarkable success over the past 25 years notwithstanding, the nation\u2019s rulers have no idea what they\u2019re doing.Start with the fundamentals. China is at the end of an era \u2014 the era of superfast growth, made possible in large part by a vast migration of underemployed peasants from the countryside to coastal cities. This reserve of surplus labor is now dwindling, which means that growth must slow.Meanwhile, China\u2019s leaders appear to be terrified \u2014 probably for political reasons \u2014 by the prospect of even a brief recession. So they\u2019ve been pumping up demand by, in effect, force-feeding the system with credit, including fostering a stock market boom. Such measures can work for a while, and all might have been well if the big reforms were moving fast enough. But they aren\u2019t, and the result is a bubble that wants to burst.What do Chinese authorities think they\u2019re doing?But it also looks as if the Chinese government, having encouraged citizens to buy stocks, now feels that it must defend stock prices to preserve its reputation. And what it\u2019s ending up doing, of course, is shredding that reputation at record speed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Stock Crash Raises New Fears", "Date": "2015-07-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThough the CSI index rebounded 6.4 percent on Thursday, it\u2019s far from clear that these interventions will halt the slide for long. Government efforts to prop up markets, without broader financial reforms, generally do little more than delay the inevitable. A stock market crash, slow-motion or quick, is likely to stir social unrest, which the Chinese government fears. But bailing out investors is likely to fuel more speculation in stocks and other parts of the financial market.The government should instead be trying to strengthen the foundations of its economy and financial system. It could do so by better regulating and policing its securities market to root out fraud and speculation. Many foreign investors and analysts say they have no confidence in the financial statements of companies listed on China\u2019s mainland exchanges; many are equally suspicious of some companies that trade on the Hong Kong stock market.Chinese officials have said they want to modernize the country\u2019s economy and give markets a \u201cdecisive role\u201d in allocating resources. At the same time, they are deeply worried that stock market tumbles will cause growth to slow down drastically or lead to a broader financial crisis. But trying to rescue the market when prices plummet isn\u2019t likely to work when what is needed is a more resilient and mature financial system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Sense of China\u2019s Plummeting Stock Market", "Date": "2015-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal MarketsBut the numbers suggest that the stock market collapse \u2014 it\u2019s down 32 percent in four weeks \u2014 may be less a shocking turn of events and more an inevitable correction in a market that featured many of the classic signs of a financial bubble.The data, though, suggest that the market declines thus far aren\u2019t as outlandish as the Chinese government seems to think. The Shanghai composite index began an upward tear in late 2014, soaring 151 percent from the start of July last year to the June 12 high.The chart shows how easy it is to frame market data in a way that sounds either scary or benign, depending on your inclination. \u201cThe Chinese stock market has dropped 32 percent in a month\u201d is scary. \u201cThe Chinese stock market is up 70 percent over the last year\u201d sounds great. Both are true.In that sense, the people who have lost money in the last month are those who plowed money into Chinese stocks just in the last few months, aiming to take part in what seemed a rocket trajectory rise in prices. Anyone who has been invested for more than a few months is doing just fine, so far at least.As it turns out, if you look at a slightly longer time horizon, the kind of volatility in Chinese stocks witnessed over the last year isn\u2019t that uncommon. The 2010 to 2013 period was more aberration than trend in the steady, consistent rise in prices.Consider the Shanghai composite over the last decade, indexed to its June 2005 level and compared to an index of all global stocks. The Chinese market experienced much larger swings during its 2007 boom, 2008 bust and 2009-2010 resurgence than the rest of the world. And those swings were larger in percentage terms than the recent volatility. Big swings in the Chinese stock market may be damaging for Chinese savers, but they don\u2019t necessarily ripple across the global economy the way problems in United States mortgage securities did in 2008 or European debt did in 2011.Why so much volatility? The Chinese stock market is less well developed than those in countries with more advanced financial markets. Many of the strongest Chinese companies list their shares in Hong Kong or New York, with those listing within China more likely to have questionable business models, accounting and corporate governance.That has helped fuel wild swings between great optimism and great pessimism for Chinese stocks. That is no salve for the pain of individual investors who have lost their savings in the recent market drop, but it does support the idea that they had reason to know the kind of risk they were taking on.But what about fundamentals? Are Chinese stocks falling toward a fair price relative to their earnings and growth rates or overshooting with further to fall?Just a year ago, Chinese stocks looked relatively reasonably priced, with a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10, meaning an investor paid the equivalent of about $10 for a share of stock that offered $1 per share in annual earnings. By contrast, at the same time last summer, an investor in American stocks had to pay more like $17 for a share that produced $1 in income.But the sharp rise in Chinese share prices starting in late 2014 took place without an accompanying rise in earnings. The shares rose because investors were willing to pay more for the same return.By early June, the price-earnings ratio of the Shanghai composite index had soared to nearly 26, meaning the same dollar in earnings that cost $10 a year ago now cost an investor in those stocks $26. The swoon in prices since then has left that ratio at 18, still a bit pricier than the American market, but still quite a bit higher than the valuation of the Chinese market just a year ago.There is a case that Chinese stocks deserve a rich valuation. If you expect that the companies whose shares you are buying will become much more profitable over time \u2014 that is, that they will grow quickly \u2014 it might make perfect sense to pay $18 or $26 for a dollar of earnings. That dollar, after all, might soon be two, and then four.But it\u2019s worth looking at the economic backdrop as those companies will be trying to increase their earnings.The Chinese economy was growing by 10 to 12 percent a decade ago, an environment conducive to rapid growth in corporate profits. That has been falling steadily, to 7 percent in the most recent reading. China has been trying to adjust to a more consumer-driven economy, away from housing, infrastructure and imports, but it has been a rocky process.In other words, valuations are higher relative to earnings, even as economic growth prospects have slowed. And it\u2019s hard to see anything in Chinese economic conditions or policies that changed between July 2014 and June 2015 that would justify the kind of remarkable increase that preceded the recent crash.Put all these pieces together, and here\u2019s what we have: a rise in Chinese share prices in the last year that seemed to be driven more by investor psychology than by anything fundamental. It is hard to see how the prices as of a month ago were justified, and easy to see why the sell-off of the last month would occur.That, in turn, implies that Chinese officials are fighting an uphill battle in their policy moves to try to stop the correction, and helps explain why their policy actions have had little effect so far.The question now for China \u2014 and hence for the world economy \u2014 is how far the Chinese market has to fall, and, regardless of whether the drop is justified, how much pain it will cause.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Markets Uneasy After Huge Sell-Off", "Date": "2015-07-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Instability continued to roil China\u2019s stock markets on Tuesday in spite of new pledges of support from the government.The precarious display on China\u2019s bourses after several weeks of relatively calm movements has shaken global financial markets. Prices for metals like copper, of which China is a major buyer, fell to six-year lows during the past two days. Oil has also slumped, trading closer to the six-year lows it reached this spring.\u201cThis is not the first time that massive volatility has found its way into the Chinese equity market,\u201d said Peter Alexander, the founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a financial consultancy based in Shanghai. \u201cBut this is the first time in modern history that the Chinese markets are on the global radar screen.\u201dThe renewed volatility came despite reassurances from the government that it would continue to support the stability of the markets.The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.After the 8.5 percent plunge in the index on Monday, China\u2019s central bank issued a statement on Tuesday before markets reopened, saying that \u201cstable financial markets are expected to continue supporting steady gains in the real economy.\u201dIn the coming months, the bank pledged to \u201cbe flexible in putting to use various monetary policy tools to maintain liquidity at a reasonable level.\u201d The People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, has cut interest rates four times since November. It has also moved several times to free banks to lend more of their deposits.Those measures appeared to reassure investors. Before plummeting on Monday, markets had been rebounding modestly in recent weeks.As the turbulence continued, 64 percent of the 1,125 stocks that make up the Shanghai composite index closed lower on Tuesday. The companies whose shares rose included state-backed stock brokerage houses, which rebounded strongly from the plunge on Monday. Shares in Citic Securities, Haitong Securities and Guotai Junan Securities all rose significantly.Laggards included the CRRC Corporation, a state-owned train maker whose shares fell 5.7 percent on heavy trading, and Ping An Insurance, which closed down 4 percent.Analysts attributed the sell-off that started on Monday to a number of potential factors. They included lackluster economic data and fears that the state may be removing some support for share prices. But most analysts expect the government to continue its intervention.\u201cThe government intervened on the way up; they tried to avoid a bubble when the market was rallying quite quickly,\u201d Herald van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy in Hong Kong for HSBC, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve obviously also intervened on the way down, so I suspect that they\u2019ll try to do that again in order to stabilize the market.\u201dIn fact, the message from Beijing has so far been clear on this account. For example, late Monday evening, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a statement responding to recent news reports that the state was retreating from its market rescue operations.\u201cThis is completely untrue,\u201d Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesman for the regulator, said in the statement. \u201cThe commission will continue to stabilize the market and provide reassurance, and will use all its resources working toward the goal of preventing systemic risk.\u201dMr. Zhang also rejected claims that the China Securities Finance Corporation, the state-backed entity charged with managing the market stabilization fund, has withdrawn support.The agency \u201cdid not withdraw, will add support and will continue to play a positive stabilizing role in the market,\u201d he added.In a separate statement Tuesday afternoon, after the market closed, Mr. Zhang said the regulator had received complaints about the sell-off on Monday and that it would take enforcement action soon against those who engaged in what he said was \u201ccoordinated stock dumping.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Asks Supreme Court to Review Insider Trading Ruling", "Date": "2015-07-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ruling was a major setback for Mr. Bharara, whose office secured over 80 convictions in a multiyear crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street. The ruling, if left standing, threatens to undermine several of the convictions and pleas won by his office.Mr. Bharara has argued for months that the ruling will make it more difficult for federal prosecutors to pursue insider trading cases in the future and could open the door to more rogue trading on Wall Street. Mr. Verrilli adopted much of Mr. Bharara\u2019s view in urging the Supreme Court to intervene.The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to review a court ruling that sharply narrowed the definition of insider trading.In his petition, the solicitor general said the appellate decision \u201cunjustifiably impedes the government\u2019s ability to restrain and punish\u201d those who provide confidential tips and those who benefit from them. The ruling, Mr. Verrilli said, will \u201churt market participants, disadvantage scrupulous market analysts and impair the government\u2019s ability to protect the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.\u201dStill, that risk was seen as one worth taking. The appellate court ruling has raised concern that the authorities will have a higher burden of proof when mounting insider trading cases. Under the ruling, prosecutors have to show, among other things, that a person passing an inside tip expected to receive something \u201cof some consequence\u201d in return.\u201cThe government\u2019s decision to seek Supreme Court review of the Newman decision shows how significantly that case has altered the landscape of insider trading law,\u201d said John T. Zach, a former assistant United States attorney in Manhattan who had been involved in the trial of Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman. By filing the petition, the government is \u201csignaling that it strongly believes that the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decisions criminalized that type of insider trading and that allowing Newman to legalize it would deeply undermine the public\u2019s confidence in the securities markets,\u201d Mr. Zach said.Mr. Chiasson, a co-founder of Level Global Investors, and Mr. Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, were convicted in 2012 of conspiring with six others to illegally trade technology stocks, reaping $70 million.The United States attorney in Manhattan oversaw a sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry, but a federal appeals court upended the campaign.That appeals court decision in December narrowed the parameters of insider trading by coming up with a new definition for what constitutes the exchange of a personal benefit to the person who passes an inside tip. Until now, the ruling in Dirks had been interpreted by most lower courts as meaning the personal benefit received by a person passing information could be as simple as wanting to help a friend.But the appellate court said that friendship was not enough, that the person providing the tip must also have received something more tangible.The ruling also said that anyone trading on the information had to be aware of the exchange of that benefit to be found guilty of insider trading.In the case of Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman, the appeals court found the two were too far down the chain of sharing information to know whether the corporate insiders at Dell and Nvidia had received a personal benefit for passing on information about earnings. The court then went further and said the corporate insiders had not even received a personal benefit under its interpretation of the Dirks ruling.On Thursday, Gregory Morvillo, Mr. Chiasson\u2019s lawyer, said a Supreme Court review of the definition of personal benefit would not have any impact on his client.\u201cRegardless of that definition, the Second Circuit acquitted Mr. Chiasson because there was no evidence that he had knowledge of any benefit provided to any corporate insider,\u201d he said.\u201cMr. Chiasson remains confident that the carefully reasoned analysis of the Second Circuit is well grounded in the facts and the law and will withstand Supreme Court review,\u201d Mr. Morvillo added.John A. Nathanson, a lawyer for Mr. Newman, declined to comment.Some lawyers thought the Justice Department might be better off not taking the case to the Supreme Court, predicting that federal judges, even ones in New York, would eventually start to whittle away at the appellate ruling and bring it more in line with the definition as it existed under the Dirks decision.In one recent case, a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California drew some distinctions with the appellate ruling in New York. The decision, written by Jed S. Rakoff, a federal judge in Manhattan temporarily assigned to the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, took a more favorable interpretation for the government of proving benefit that was more in line with how courts have traditionally interpreted Dirks.Mr. Verrilli seized on the Ninth Circuit ruling in his petition to urge the Supreme Court to take on the appeal from the Second Circuit ruling. He pointed to the rulings as an example of a judicial circuit split \u2014 the kind of situation the Supreme Court is known to abhor because it raises the specter of federal courts enforcing the laws unevenly.\u201cThe Ninth Circuit thus rejected the novel personal benefit test fashioned by the court in this case,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote. He added that the different judicial rulings could lead to \u201cuneven enforcement of the securities laws against individuals who are all participating in the same nationwide capital markets.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court will take the case. Justice Antonin Scalia, for one, has suggested that it should be up to Congress to regulate and prosecute insider trading, not the courts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ultrarich Keep Contemporary Art Market Bustling", "Date": "2015-07-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 This has been, by any reckoning, a momentous first half of the year for the art market.In February we learned that Qatar had bought a Gauguin painting for an undisclosed price of as much as $300 million; in May, an experimental week of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art sales in New York raised more than $2 billion, including $179.4 million for Picasso\u2019s 1955 \u201cLes Femmes d\u2019Alger (Version \u2018O\u2019),\u201d a high for artwork sold at auction; and in June, several prominent contemporary dealers reported their best-ever Art Basel fair, which attracted a record 98,000 visitors. As collectors, advisers and dealers head off for the Hamptons, or Provence, or other favored vacation spots, this might be the moment to take stock \u2014 or as two medieval peasants asked in a classic New Yorker cartoon, after a minstrel sauntered past singing \u201cSumer is icumen in\u201d: What was that all about?When art prices surge, there is always talk of a \u201cbubble.\u201d But for the moment, despite the uncertainty over Greece and despite Chinese stocks losing $3 trillion of their value in less than a month, those involved in the art market remain insouciant about prospects for the second half of 2015.On June 30, the London analysts ArtTactic published a study based on the responses of 128 art collectors, advisers, auction experts, dealers and media commentators. More than half of the participants think the market for postwar and contemporary art will continue to grow over the next six months and less than half think it will remain flat. None expected it to contract.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bubble in the classical sense of the word,\u201d said Tom Flynn, director of art appraisal at Kingston University in Surrey, England. \u201cThe cyclical process appears to have gone from the top end of the contemporary market. It\u2019s being driven by almost unprecedented levels of wealth in the world, and by an influx of people from finance who are treating art as a pure asset class.\u201dIn 2009, during the depths of the financial crisis, worldwide auction sales of postwar and contemporary art contracted to 1.4 billion euros, about $1.5 billion today, less than half the \u20ac3.5 billion achieved in 2007, according to a report published by the European Fine Art Foundation in March. The report said auction sales of contemporary art hit an all-time high of \u20ac5.9 billion in 2014. Or, to put it another way, no \u201cbubble\u201d burst in 2009; the market for contemporary art simply paused.\u201cThere\u2019s so much wealth around, and it keeps on being created and put into tangible assets like art,\u201d said Suzanne Gyorgy, global head of art advisory and finance at Citi Private Bank in New York.\u201cThe recession created opportunities for huge wealth creation,\u201d she added, referring to the quantitative easing policies that over the past five years have raised asset prices in the United States and Europe. \u201cMoney goes to people who are able to make more money out of it.\u201dAn increasing number of these people are looking to make money out of contemporary art.The Victoria Miro gallery in London, for example, represents the veteran Japanese avant-garde artist Yayoi Kusama. A 2006 version of one of the white \u201cInfinity-Net\u201d paintings Ms. Kusama has been producing for more than 50 years sold at auction in Hong Kong in November for $2.3 million, according to the auction results database Artnet.Little wonder, then, that Victoria Miro had a waiting list of more than 200 clients for the four fresh Infinity-Nets, priced at $450,000 each, it took to Art Basel. These were among 15 works the gallery either sold or had firmly reserved within an hour of the fair opening to V.I.P. guests on June 16.\u201cThat\u2019s never happened before,\u201d said the gallery\u2019s co-director, Glenn Scott Wright. \u201cPeople have been saying the contemporary market is a bubble for 20 years. But it\u2019s a different beast now. So many people see art as an alternative investment.\u201dThat said, the market for contemporary art remains a fickle beast. The speculative trade in hot, young \u201cprocess-based\u201d abstract painters such as Lucien Smith, Alex Israel, Parker Ito and Israel Lund, whose works were routinely being flipped by multiple-estimate auction prices in 2014, has cooled.Blue-chip names like Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol and Gerhard Richter can also prove problematic. Ambitiously valued, so-so examples of these highly regarded artists\u2019 work failed to achieve estimates as high as 35 million pounds, about $55 million, at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s in London on June 30 and July 1.But over all, contemporary art retains its allure as a wealth preservative. Back in January, the Hong Kong-based website Larry\u2019s List calculated that there were about 8,000 to 10,000 collectors worldwide who regularly buy substantially priced works from galleries and from the major art fairs such as Art Basel. That is a tiny segment of what Tefaf said was a world population of 35 million millionaires, and more than 200,000 ultrahigh-net-worth individuals with $30 million or more to spend, in 2014.But with their multiple homes, tax-efficient private museums and sophisticated offshore investment plans, wealthy contemporary art collectors are people who, by and large, have managed to detach themselves from the everyday concerns of national economies. Unlike Greek shopkeepers and Chinese small investors, art magnates like Dakis Joannou and Budi Tek are in little danger of going bust.In fact, the very rich do not seem to have much interest in collecting any other kind of art, other than postwar and contemporary. There were clear signs of the ever-widening inequality with other art markets at recent auctions in London.Christie\u2019s evening sale of contemporary works raised \u00a395.7 million on June 30, and the company\u2019s equivalent auction of Old Masters paintings raised just \u00a319 million. Christie\u2019s said in an email that Richard Knight, co-chairman of the Old Masters department, would be leaving the company at the end of the month.Despite some high-value failures, Sotheby\u2019s contemporary sale on July 1 managed to raise \u00a3130.4 million, the company\u2019s highest total for the category in Europe.On Wednesday, Sotheby\u2019s auction of Victorian, Pre-Raphaelite and British Impressionist art took in \u00a34.7 million. The auction house\u2019s publicity department made the most of the \u00a3167,000 paid by an American collector for an 1895 pencil and white chalk study for Frederic Leighton\u2019s much-reproduced painting, \u201cFlaming June.\u201dBut those results were a far cry from 2000, when wealthy individuals were buying a broader range of status-enhancing art, and the British collector Andrew Lloyd Webber had to pay \u00a36.6 million for John William Waterhouse\u2019s \u201cSt. Cecilia\u201d at auction.Still, there have been other exceptions. Though just half of the 61 lots at Christie\u2019s \u00a318 million \u201cExceptional\u201d sale of miscellaneous historical items on July 9 found buyers, a circa 1880 wooden figural bow-stand from Congo\u2019s Luba culture was pushed by two telephone bidders to \u00a36.1 million with fees. It is one of just eight works attributed to the Warua Master, who worked for Luba royalty, and fetched more than double the high estimate and the second-highest auction price paid for an African work of art at auction.A number of wealthy collectors of modern and contemporary works also have a taste for Oceanic and African art.\u201cThis piece did have an aesthetic that appealed to a broader spectrum of buyers,\u201d said William Robinson, Christie\u2019s international head of world art, who would not divulge the collecting tastes of either of the telephone bidders. \u201cIt was just a spectacular piece of sculpture.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Share Sell-Off Spills Over to Hong Kong", "Date": "2015-07-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Heavy government-coordinated purchases pushed up the value of large companies\u2019 shares on mainland Chinese stock exchanges on Monday, interrupting at least temporarily a three-week downturn. But shares in smaller and midsize companies, which make up as much as two-thirds of the market by value, kept falling.A widening gap between the relative strength of large companies\u2019 shares and the seemingly unending slide in the rest of the market threatens to widen social divisions in China. Millions of working- and middle-class families invested their life\u2019s savings and borrowed heavily over the past year to buy shares in smaller companies, simply because the shares kept rising and almost regardless of the companies\u2019 financial fundamentals.By contrast, Chinese and foreign institutional investors heavily favored the larger companies. Many of the large companies are partially owned by the state, and their executives are senior Communist Party officials who wield considerable political influence. Some large companies also have close ties to some of the country\u2019s leading political families.With the Chinese government supporting the prices of many companies\u2019 shares on mainland markets on Monday, particularly large companies, it was the turn of Hong Kong-listed shares to fall heavily.The Hong Kong stock market had previously been nearly immune to the sell-off on the mainland. It has tighter restrictions on trading with borrowed money and stronger corporate governance rules. So it did not rise nearly as fast as mainland indexes over the past year and until Monday had not fallen very far either.But the broad Hang Seng index of Hong Kong stocks slipped 3.2 percent on Monday, the Hang Seng index of 100 large mainland companies dropped 3.7 percent and the Growth Enterprise Market of mainly small mainland companies plummeted 14.4 percent.Andy Wong, a Hong Kong stockbroker, noted that it was much easier for foreigners to sell shares in Hong Kong in response to developments in mainland China than to sell shares on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock markets.The falling Hong Kong market \u201cis mainly the result of the overseas players\u2019 offloading Hong Kong stocks in a big way \u2014 they appear angry at the Chinese government for coming out to interfere in the China stock markets,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they have no room to play up north, the overseas players have switched to playing the Hong Kong stock market today.\u201dThe Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country\u2019s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.At a brokerage house in Hong Kong, investors were divided on how much to worry about the day\u2019s setback.Some, like Wong Chun, a 72-year-old investor who has been trading stocks since the 1980s, were clearly worried. \u201cIt is hard to say whether the current market-support measures taken by the Chinese government will work in the long term,\u201d she said. \u201cShould the public truly have fear in their heart, then nothing will stop the slide.\u201dBut others were more blithe.\u201cIf the Chinese government has the will, it certainly has the ability to stop the slide in the Chinese stock market,\u201d said Daisy Kong, a 52-year-old homemaker who was checking stock prices at the same brokerage house. \u201cThe Chinese government has so much money, they don\u2019t need to borrow like Greece.\u201dActing at the Chinese government\u2019s behest, 21 mainland brokerage firms set up a $19.4 billion fund over the weekend to buy large companies\u2019 stocks. The central bank also provided money indirectly for the brokerage firms to provide to buyers who wanted to borrow money to invest \u2014 or who at least wanted to roll over their existing loans despite having lost heavily.That support produced a sharp rally in large-company stocks at the opening in Shanghai and Shenzhen. These shares gave up their gains by late morning, stayed largely flat into the afternoon and then surged in the final half-hour, with the CSI 300 index of large-capitalization shares closing with a gain of 2.9 percent.By contrast, shares in small and midsize companies kept falling. The ChiNext price index of small companies lost 4.3 percent on Monday.At a branch of the China Securities brokerage firm near the Dongzhimen neighborhood in Beijing, investors gossiped in front of nine large LED screens flashing stock prices. By midafternoon, the nearly uniformly falling prices on the screens only further dispirited the investors in the trading hall, mostly gray-haired retirees. As the afternoon trading started, those who sat in the back rows fished out their lunchboxes and started eating.Mr. Huang, with a receding hairline and wearing a faded yellow polo shirt and shorts, was the most talkative. \u201cSell off as soon as you can,\u201d he exhorted his friends, women huddled silently in the last row, two of them with jade rosaries in their hands and another absent-mindedly knitting.\u201cHurry up! Trust me, it\u2019s really hopeless,\u201d continued Mr. Huang, who declined to provide his given name. \u201cJust stop trading. Let it drop.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of bailout is this?\u201d complained a woman sitting behind Mr. Huang.A voice came from the back of the hall: \u201cThis is strafing China\u2019s middle class with a machine gun.\u201d The agitated murmur in the room stopped momentarily at the comment, but soon resumed.An earlier version of this article misstated the meaning of green lights on stock price display boards in mainland China. They indicate falling prices, not rising prices.Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Housing Market Still Isn\u2019t Rational", "Date": "2015-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewHome prices have been climbing. They have risen 27 percent nationally since 2012, even more in places like San Francisco. But why worry? If you accept the efficient markets theory \u2014 and believe that real estate is an efficient market \u2014 then these prices are based on \u201cnew information,\u201d even if you don\u2019t know what that information is.The problem with this kind of thinking is that the efficient markets theory is at best a half-truth, as a voluminous literature on market anomalies shows. What\u2019s more, even that half-truth is grounded mainly in the stock market, which attracts professional investors who sometimes do make the market behave efficiently.The housing market is another matter. It is far less rational than even the often irrational stock market, for a couple of important reasons. First, most investors find it difficult to understand how housing supply responds to changes in demand. Only a small minority of people think carefully about such things. Second, it is very hard for the minority of smart-money investors who do understand such matters to bet against bubble-level prices in real estate markets. In housing, the smart money has relatively little voice.Short-selling helps prevent bubbles from forming, but such negative bets cannot easily occur in the housing market. You can\u2019t routinely borrow a house and sell it, promising to buy back the same house later to repay the loan.Markets without the possibility of making these negative bets will be inefficient. That\u2019s because if it is not possible to short, the smart money can do no more than avoid holding an overpriced asset. Canny traders are forced to sit on the sidelines, and watch in futility as prices decline as they expected. Without short-sellers, there is nothing to stop a group of ignorant investors \u2014 who get some ill-conceived idea that a certain investment is just terrific \u2014 from bidding up prices to extravagant levels. In the housing market, that poses an enormous problem.In San Francisco, for example, we found that while the median expectation for annual home price increases over the next 10 years was only 5 percent, a quarter of the respondents said they thought prices would increase each year by 10 percent or more. That would mean a net 150 percent increase in a decade. These people are apparently not thinking about the supply response that so big a price increase would generate. People like this could bid prices in some places so high that eventually the local market will collapse. Yet the smart money can\u2019t find a profitable way to correct such errors today.The bottom line is that there is no reason to assume that the real estate market is even close to efficient. You may want to buy a house if you love it and can afford it. But remember that you cannot safely rely on \u201ccomparable sales\u201d to judge that the price is fair. The market isn\u2019t efficient enough for that.Advertisement"}
