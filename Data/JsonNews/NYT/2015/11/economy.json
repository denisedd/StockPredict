{"Headline": "For Investors, \u2018Portfolio Insurance\u2019 Against Market Declines", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth Special SectionWhenever the stock market shows a bad hand, as it did in the third quarter, nearly all stock investors hope they have something akin to an ace in the hole.Investing professionals call this favored-card strategy \u201cportfolio insurance,\u201d a way of hedging against the brutal loss of a broad-based market decline. In recent years, more specialized investments to stem market downturns have become available to individual investors.Although portfolio-protection strategies are complicated and none work perfectly, they can be widely employed to protect wealth over time. But shielding against future loss in retirement income and addressing short-term volatility are often two different missions that have varying costs and results.What most unnerves many investors is volatility, the day-to-day sell-offs that can shave up to 3 percent off stock prices; this happened more than once in August. To safeguard against those Tilt-A-Whirl rides, people can turn to investments that actually reward them in the most skittish periods. That approach would have paid off in August, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 6 percent, and in September, when it lost nearly 3 percent.Nine exchange-traded funds, known as E.T.F.s, are linked to indexes that track stock volatility. The idea behind these funds is that when short-term fears derail stock returns, investors can make still money. The funds follow a \u201cfear\u201d index listed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange that gains when stocks head south.The largest fear E.T.F. by assets is the VIX Short-Term Futures E.T.F. (VIXY). The fund was up 27 percent for the third quarter, a handsome return considering the S.&P. 500 was down 6 percent during that period.As investors have become more skittish during market dips, trading in the volatility products has soared. In August, the C.B.O.E. reported that trading in such funds was the \u201csecond-busiest of all time,\u201d eclipsed only by the 2008 collapse.But when the market flattens out or posts gains, the returns on fear-index funds are abysmal. The ProShares fund is down 49 percent over the last three years as of Oct. 19. As with all short-term trading funds, investors have to be fairly precise about when they enter and exit this E.T.F., which is not something most individuals can do with consistent success.Another strategy that has grown in popularity among individual investors in recent years is the low-volatility or smart beta stock approach. These funds select stocks that don\u2019t have as much downside movement as the rest of the market, may offer growth and are often less prone to huge declines because they pay consistent dividends.\u201cI love the idea of stock growth and lower portfolio risk,\u201d said Howard Erman, a certified financial planner in Seal Beach, Calif. \u201cThe idea is to manage volatility and not avoid it. That means investing in stocks and having confidence in the growth of the global economy. Every bear market ends. When it does, you need to be invested in stocks.\u201dWhile low-volatility funds can and do lose money in a downturn, their losses are not as great as that of the S.&P. 500. Steve Stanganelli, a certified financial planner with Clear View Wealth Advisors in Amesbury, Mass., recommended the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility E.T.F. (USMV), which owns durable dividend payers such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The fund was down slightly more than 1 percent in the third quarter, compared with more than 6 percent for the S.&P. 500.A more active approach to portfolio protection can be found through hedgelike or alternative mutual funds, which can skew a portfolio toward making money on the downside if market conditions warrant. You can also invest in commodity and real estate funds that tend not to move in lockstep with stocks of American companies most of the time (except for 2008).The managers in these funds are free to home in on securities that could do well during a downturn, or to \u201cshort\u201d companies \u2014 that is, to make money when the companies decline in value.Returns for the more than 100 long-short funds on the market, however, vary widely and are expensive to own. The Turner Medical Sciences Long/Short Fund (TMSFX), for example, is up 20 percent for this year, through Oct. 19. It holds mostly small health care growth stocks.Be careful with any active strategy, because managers can still guess poorly or whole industries can fall out of favor. Then you will pay dearly for their mistakes and will not have the downside protection you seek.For even more sophisticated investors, options \u2014 bets that a security or index will rise or fall over a given period \u2014 can provide some downside protection.You can, for example, buy \u201cput\u201d options on a single stock or an entire index, which pay off if a security declines over a specific time. For this strategy to make sense, you need to have some understanding of how options work; commissions and taxes are involved. It may be helpful to work with an adviser who specializes in options.For most investors, though, a comprehensive portfolio review that involves a combination of strategies can smooth out some of the bumps. Most, if not all, certified financial planners, chartered financial analysts and registered investment advisers can model the portfolio that will allow you to sleep at night.You can, of course, set up your own portfolios or go online to create one through a robo-adviser such as Betterment, Wealthfront or Personal Capital. But if you have some specific needs such as saving for college, a late retirement or tax reduction, a personal adviser can do some hand-holding and perhaps better tailor an investment plan to your risk and return goals.Mr. Stanganelli, for example, uses a broad array of low-volatility, option-based and dividend-focused funds in his client portfolios, which are customized according to goals and risk tolerance.\u201cThe market\u2019s going to be volatile and things change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as you have a plan, there\u2019s no need to panic as long as you\u2019re meeting your goals.\u201dIf you choose to work with an adviser, ask that any suggested portfolios be \u201cstress tested\u201d so you can see how much money you would lose under a 10 percent, 20 percent or 2008-scale sell-off. Then you can determine which hedging strategy feels right to you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blacks Are Challenged to Buy From Black-Owned Businesses to Close Gap", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 Should black people go out of their way to patronize black-owned business?Maggie Anderson says they should. In 2008, with the economy in the middle of the worst downturn since the 1930s, Ms. Anderson enlisted her husband and two daughters in a yearlong plan to consume goods and services exclusively from black-owned businesses. The journey became a basis for her 2012 book, \u201cOur Black Year,\u201d the subject of several TED talks about how to increase wealth in the African-American community, and the narrative behind a current cross-country tour aimed at spreading her gospel.For Ms. Anderson, buying black presented multiple challenges. She purchased gas from a black-owned Citgo gas station 35 miles away from her home in Oak Park, Ill. Because that was inconvenient, she eventually bought gas cards from a black-owned store and used them at a station near her home. Finding a black-owned grocery store, bank and other establishments was more challenging than she had expected.\u201cWhen I think back on that year, driving was the least of it,\u201d said Ms. Anderson, a lawyer with a master\u2019s degree in business administration. \u201cIt was heartbreaking taking in how the West Side and the South Side used to have so many business owners, and now most of those businesses are owned by outsiders.\u201dCritics of Ms. Anderson\u2019s book said she was discriminating by refusing to buy from businesses owned by whites and other ethnicities. And some argued that promoting black-on-black business could do more harm than good if it discouraged black entrepreneurs from trying to serve all consumers.But Ms. Anderson says that her goals are inclusive, and that she has also sought to encourage companies in industries like fashion, entertainment and liquor that profit from black clientele to do more to support black communities and do business with black suppliers.\u201cWhen we think about diversity, we still think about H.R. diversity,\u201d Ms. Anderson said at a public meeting here in Chicago, referring to human resources and recruiting for jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not about H.R. diversity; it\u2019s about supplier diversity. If you want us to do business with you, you have to do business with us.\u201dShe noted that black-owned businesses employed high percentages of black people, multiplying the benefits of buying from them.\u201cAt first, I did take it personally that people would call us racist,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. But \u201cif we want to create jobs in the black community, we have to support black businesses.\u201dSpurring job creation in the black community is one of her goals. A study by the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University found that between half a million and a million jobs could be created if higher-income black households spent only $1 of every $10 at black-owned stores and other enterprises.\u201cIt was government intervention that created a white, asset-based middle class,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s going to take government intervention to create a black, asset-based middle class as well.\u201dEven though African-American income growth outpaced that of whites, the median net worth of black households in 2011 was only $6,446, a decline of nearly 10 percent from 1984, when it was $7,150 in inflation-adjusted dollars. By contrast, the median net worth for whites, already far higher than for blacks, rose 11 percent to $91,405 over the same period.On average, business equity was the second-biggest asset class among whites, after personal homes, but it was the least valuable asset for blacks, accounting for less than 4 percent on average.Discriminatory lending practices and mishandled policies have led many blacks to distrust conventional financial institutions, Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cFor 250 years, we had no opportunity to create wealth; we created wealth for others,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of distrust and miseducation.\u201dAmong black business owners, generating capital requires unusual creativity and initiative. Chris Brown, an entrepreneur who runs a fitness gym, an online T-shirt creation website and an online boat rental service, said running multiple ventures allowed him to generate enough revenue to create his own \u201cbank,\u201d or pool of investment capital, rather than seeking financing elsewhere. And to succeed, he said, he looked beyond the black community.A former Marine, Mr. Brown started with The Boot Camp Guy, a fitness center on Chicago\u2019s South Side. In addition to his service in the Marines, Mr. Brown attributes his ability to relate to customers from widely varying backgrounds to his childhood experiences traveling with his stepfather, who was an executive with the Peace Corps.\u201cI\u2019ve found a way to break down the barrier where they\u2019re not looking at a black male,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at a person that lived in a country that\u2019s very culturally similar to what they\u2019ve experienced.\u201dThe study found that discrimination was greater in markets where black and white residents were geographically isolated from one another. Black sellers were offered less money and respondents to black sellers exhibited lower trust.For African-American communities, black support for black-owned businesses is critical to their survival, said Veranda Dickens, chairwoman of Seaway Bank, which is based in Chicago, was founded in 1965 and is now the third-largest black-owned bank in the country, behind Liberty Bank & Trust and One United Bank.\u201cThe mission is still as important today as it was 50 years ago,\u201d Ms. Dickens said.Ms. Anderson said she was developing Maggie\u2019s List, an online guide to help consumers find black-owned businesses, which she hopes to have running in six to eight months.Her black year \u201cwas hard, because I tried to do it 100 percent, but there are little things that we can do to increase our spending with black-owned businesses,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cOnce you get started, it gets easier and easier.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misattributed a quotation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we can do if we make small sacrifices,\u201d was said by Maggie Anderson, not Eugene Mitchell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Official Expects Test for Big Banks to Be Stricter", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery year, the largest banks have to undergo a theoretical test to assess how they might fare in a period of extreme stress in the markets and the economy.Now, that test may become substantially tougher.A senior official at the Federal Reserve, the bank regulator that administers the so-called stress tests, said on Monday that the Fed was discussing changes to the test that could make it harder for banks to pass.The stress tests estimate losses during a period of turbulence and then subtract those losses from a bank\u2019s capital, the financial buffer that a bank has to maintain to insulate itself from shocks and losses. A bank effectively fails the tests if its capital falls below a minimum level after the theoretical losses.In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor who oversees regulation, said there was \u201cmore than a pretty good chance\u201d that banks would have to have a higher amount of minimum capital left after suffering the theoretical losses envisioned in the stress tests.The Fed has indicated in the past that the tests could get more stringent. And Mr. Tarullo\u2019s comments underscored its intent to press ahead with changes to the tests, which were introduced after the financial crisis to give regulators a way to check the health of big banks each year. The Fed wants to make the tests tougher to reduce the risk that a failure of single large bank could bring down other big firms. No actual proposal has been made, however. The tests have become something of a thorn in the side of the banks. Banks that fail them can be barred from making payouts to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Bankers have also asserted that the Fed\u2019s communications about the tests have not always been clear. And the tests appear to have pressed banks to have more capital than they would if they were subject only to traditional capital rules.Higher capital has made the big banks more resilient. But there is debate over whether the requirements can crimp lending and trading.Banks build up capital by financing their activities with more equity and less borrowing. They measure their performance by a metric that expresses profits as a percentage of equity.So as banks have increased their equity to meet stiffer capital requirements, the percentage return has shrunk. Banks have been getting out of businesses on which the return is low.In some ways, this winnowing may be beneficial, since activities with low profitability may not be helpful to the wider economy in the longer term. And higher capital does not appear to have held back certain crucial activities.In recent years, for instance, banks have bolstered lending to corporations while their Wall Street operations have helped funnel trillions of dollars to companies through the bond market.Still, lending to consumers has been relatively subdued. As a result, some analysts wonder whether tougher stress tests, and the even higher capital levels they might lead to, would start to have negative consequences.\u201cAt some point, there\u2019s a trade-off,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banks analyst at the international brokerage and investment firm CLSA. \u201cLoan growth in this economic expansion has only been one-third of the usual pace.\u201dMr. Tarullo, in the Bloomberg interview, suggested ways in which stress tests may be changed.The changes could affect the amount of capital a bank would have to have left after the losses estimated by the test. Right now, a bank passes if during its test its capital does not fall below certain levels. On one measure, for instance, the level cannot fall below 4.5 percent of a bank\u2019s assets.Mr. Tarullo suggested a way of raising the stress test minimum that would stem from a different set of capital rules. These other rules state that the bigger the bank, the more capital it must hold. A large bank may, for instance, have to keep extra capital, or a surcharge, of 3 percent of its assets, on top of a basic requirement of 7 percent. He also suggested that the Fed might decide to add some or all of that surcharge to the stress test minimum.. In a theoretical case, if all of the surcharge were added to a minimum of 4.5 percent, a bank\u2019s capital could not fall below 7.5 percent in order to pass.The Fed could, of course, add only a portion of the surcharge. And it could give banks some relief by softening other parts of the test if it ends up adding some or all of the surcharge to the capital requirement, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Any changes would be incorporated in the 2017 stress tests.Even so, any capital increase, could prompt banks to start raising capital to make sure they did not fall below the minimum. They could raise capital levels by paying out less of their equity to shareholders. Faced with tougher capital requirements, banks may also choose to continue get smaller. Indeed, when discussing a new capital measure last year, Mr. Tarullo seemed to welcome some shrinkage of the big banks. \u201cThis measure,\u201d he said, \u201cmight also create incentives for them to reduce their systemic footprint and risk profile.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strong Growth in Jobs May Encourage Fed to Raise Rates", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 271,000 jump in payrolls reported by the Labor Department on Friday was much more robust than expected and suggested that economic growth had enough momentum to allow the central bank to begin its move away from the ultralow, crisis-level interest-rate policy it has been following for seven years.\u201cIt was pretty much everything you could ask for in a jobs report,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cNot only was the headline number strong, but there were upward revisions for prior months, the unemployment rate fell and wage growth accelerated.\u201dA healthy, improving economy tends to favor the incumbent party in the White House, and it could blunt Republican attacks on President Obama\u2019s economic record, a mainstay of the Republican candidates\u2019 message.After the release of the employment data, economists lined up to predict that a rate increase is now nearly a lock at the Fed\u2019s mid-December meeting.\u201cThe report was so strong and broad-based that it will be difficult to deter them from raising rates,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. Until Friday, Barclays had been predicting the Fed would wait until March 2016 to act, but moved that up to next month after Friday\u2019s announcement. \u201cI think the odds are about 80 to 85 percent that they will move,\u201d Mr. Gapen said.The unemployment rate dipped to 5 percent, from 5.1 percent in September. Average hourly earnings also bounced back, rising 0.4 percent in October after showing no increase in September. That lifted the gain to 2.5 percent over the last 12 months, the healthiest pace since 2009.Still, most workers will need bigger raises for some time to come to make up for ground lost after a long period of wage stagnation. What\u2019s more, many Americans remain on the sidelines of the job market, discouraged by years of lackluster hiring after the Great Recession.The proportion of Americans who are in the labor force, which fell to a 38-year low of 62.4 percent in September, was unchanged last month.Still, at 5 percent, the official unemployment rate is very close to the threshold that the Fed and many private economists consider consistent with stable prices over the long term. The slack that built up in the labor market after the recession, however, has changed traditional calculations of how far unemployment can fall before the job market tightens and the risk of inflation rises.An additional jobs report for November will be in hand by the time the Open Market Committee gathers for its last meeting of the year, on Dec. 15 and 16.Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, had long advocated waiting until 2016, but he said on Friday that he expected internal debate to start shifting toward the timing of subsequent rate increases.\u201cI think what we\u2019re likely to get into discussing before too long is what\u2019s the path of the rate increases,\u201d Mr. Evans said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to dictate how accommodative or restrictive our policy is. And so I think we need to have communications which indicate that the path is going to be gradual.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.But some analysts said the Fed would be forced to move faster than it currently plans.\u201cRegardless of the exact timing of the first rate hike, we still believe that the big story next year will be an unexpectedly strong pickup in wage growth and price inflation,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. This trend, he predicted, \u201cwill force the Fed into a much more aggressive policy-tightening cycle than the Fed\u2019s projections currently suggest.\u201dMr. Evans is among Fed officials who do not want the central bank to move too quickly, before there is clear evidence of inflationary pressure. Prices have increased slowly in recent years, rising just 0.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, well below the 2 percent pace that the Fed regards as optimal.At the same time, many workers are still working fewer hours than they would like, or taking jobs that pay much less than they would like.The Labor Department\u2019s broadest measure of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time jobs because full-time work is unavailable, fell to 9.8 percent in October from 10 percent in September. A year ago, it was over 11.1 percent.The picture of labor market strength evident in the data sent bond yields surging as traders rapidly adjusted for the likelihood of a December move. Stocks were mixed in trading Friday, as investors weighed the risks that higher rates pose to earnings and company valuations.In a separate report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said consumer borrowing surged by $28.9 billion in September, the biggest monthly jump since the start of data collection in 1941. Student debt and car loans posted big increases.As has been the case for several months, there was a feast-or-famine quality to the job report. Sectors tied to commodities and exports treaded water while domestically focused areas of the economy performed well.The pattern persisted in October: Factory jobs were unchanged, while mining and logging lost 4,000 positions. Professional and business services recorded a huge 78,000 increase in jobs. Health care hiring was also robust, with a 56,700 increase.White-collar employers like Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting giant, have been on something of a hiring binge. Over the course of the company\u2019s 2016 fiscal year, which began in July, Ernst & Young plans to hire just over 17,000 new employees in the United States, roughly 10,000 joining straight out of college.In July, August and September, the firm added 2,500 more experienced accountants and consultants, said Dan Black, director of recruiting for the Americas. \u201cWhether it\u2019s dealing with taxes, regulations or technology, our clients want help,\u201d Mr. Black said.Nearly all the positions, whether entry-level or for more experienced workers, require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, underscoring how crucial credentials and specialized skills have become in today\u2019s job market.\u201cFor experienced talent, it\u2019s a dogfight,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cIn 2008 and 2009, as companies cut back, we had our pick of the litter. Now it\u2019s much more competitive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the response of bond trading to the jobs report.

{"Headline": "Pfizer-Allergan Merger Reignites Tax Reform Discussion", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For almost four years, Congress and the White House have done little to make their long-promised overhaul of the corporate tax code a reality. Now the blockbuster pharmaceutical merger of Pfizer and Allergan has put new pressure on all sides to act.Pfizer\u2019s takeover of Ireland-based Allergan \u2014 the largest deal to date to avoid American taxes by reincorporating in a lower-tax country \u2014 provoked a leading Republican on Monday to call for at least stemming so-called corporate inversions, if a sweeping rewrite of the tax code remains out of reach.\u201cThe best way to resolve these issues would be through a comprehensive tax overhaul,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement. But, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s imperative we explore what actions can be taken now.\u201dThat is a shift for Mr. Hatch from an all-or-nothing approach to tax reform, but sweeping change has remained elusive. In a polarized capital given more to legislative crisis than to compromise, leaders in both parties have long claimed that an overhaul of the loophole-laden corporate tax code could yield common ground. Business groups have clamored to make it so.In a raft of statements from Capitol Hill on Monday, lawmakers in both parties condemned Pfizer\u2019s move and reiterated their calls for comprehensive tax reform. But the reiterations only underscored that talk has long stood in for legislating.President Obama\u2019s Treasury Department released a detailed framework for rewriting the code in 2012, proposing to close corporate loopholes, broaden the base of taxable business income and reduce the corporate income tax rates that are sending businesses like Pfizer overseas.Senior congressional Republicans were broadly on board with that approach, which is the same formula \u2014 broader tax base, lower rates \u2014 that defined Congress\u2019s previous landmark rewrite of the tax code in 1986, under President Ronald Reagan.But Mr. Obama has hardly made corporate tax reform a priority, and a reluctance by the generally assertive Republican-controlled Congress to move without the president suggests that Republicans worry a signature issue may be better politics than policy. The details inevitably divide business allies into winners and losers.\u201cAny permanent solution to combating inversions should be legislated by Congress,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. But \u201cfor that to happen,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe must have strong leadership from the White House.\u201dA Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, former Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, put forward a comprehensive plan in 2014 but got little support from party colleagues. His successor as chairman, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, embraced the Camp plan in spirit at least. Then Mr. Ryan was elevated to speaker last month, and now defers on tax policy to a new, untested chairman, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas. In the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Hatch \u2014 one of the few current lawmakers who were in office for the tax rewrite nearly 30 years ago \u2014 has not initiated a similar tax overhaul effort since Republicans took over the Senate in January. Two committee members, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, have worked toward a bipartisan framework along with Mr. Ryan in the House \u2014 not for a full overhaul of the corporate code, but for a change in international taxation that would also address inversions.The initial impetus for the Portman-Schumer-Ryan effort to overhaul international taxes was both parties\u2019 desire to come up with billions to finance the cost of a multiyear transportation and infrastructure bill this year. The tax bill, in theory, would raise those revenues with a one-time tax on multinational corporations\u2019 earnings held outside the United States, and would also provide a new minimum tax on foreign earnings.But in recent weeks, with Senate Republican leaders including Mr. Hatch and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, cool to the idea of an international tax package, Congress made progress on a separate transportation bill, with its costs offset by assorted revenue provisions and budget changes.Congressional Republicans began openly suggesting that they should just wait to overhaul the corporate tax code until 2017, when perhaps they would have a Republican president to work with. Then came the Pfizer-Allergan news, made official on Monday, and once again Americans were learning that brand-name companies were becoming corporate expatriates to cut their tax bills, while most of their operations remained stateside, with all the advantages of American residency.Twice since last year, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew has issued regulations to reduce the incentives for corporate inversions \u2014 in September 2014 and just last week. But, he warned, the administration can only do so much without Congress.\u201cOur actions can only slow the pace of these transactions. Only legislation can decisively stop them,\u201d Mr. Lew told reporters on Friday.In the year since the administration first urged Congress to act against inversions \u2014 with Mr. Obama assailing corporate expatriates as unpatriotic \u2014 Republicans and some Democrats have resisted acting. What was needed, they said again, was a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate code. Yet again they did not propose one.While the Pfizer-Allergan merger had Mr. Hatch and a few others, mostly Democrats, summoning action specifically against corporate inversions, many lawmakers fell back on the familiar call for the holy grail of a complete overhaul of the code.\u201cLet\u2019s stop the political hand-wringing and get to work creating a U.S. tax code that\u2019s built for growth,\u201d said Representative Brady, the new Ways and Means Committee chairman. \u201cTax reform is a key pillar of our pro-growth agenda.\u201dSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, warned against more limited legislation simply to address inversions, saying on Monday, \u201cThe only course of action that will stop this concerning trend of American firms continuously looking for ways to shift their headquarters overseas is comprehensive tax reform.\u201d\u201cOur tax code and our economy work as an ecosystem, so when Congress or the administration make changes in one area to solve an immediate crisis like inversions, there\u2019s always a risk of unforeseen effects popping up somewhere else,\u201d Mr. Wyden added. \u201cBipartisan, comprehensive tax reform will require serious political will and independence from members of Congress, but this inversion crisis shows that it needs to happen soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The measure is expected to pass, because the governing coalition has a majority in the 300-seat Parliament.Of the money, \u20ac2 billion would be spent on Greece\u2019s domestic needs, while up to \u20ac10 billion would go toward recapitalizing the Greek banks \u2014 rebuilding their cash reserves to make them less vulnerable to risk.In Brussels on Tuesday, the head of the eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, hailed the \u201csubstantive agreement\u201d as \u201cgood news.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s commissioner for economic and financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, struck a similar tone. \u201cI\u2019m happy to confirm that the agreement has been reached on the main measures needed to complete the first set of milestones,\u201d he said.Thursday\u2019s parliamentary vote will be the fourth in recent weeks on economic changes demanded by creditors. The previous three votes endorsed some but not all of the 48 economic overhauls demanded by lenders in exchange for releasing the next allotment of loan money.Creditors\u2019 demands for home foreclosures in the case of overly indebted mortgage-holders had been a sticking point in negotiations as the leftist-led government has argued that shielding Greek families from losing their homes was necessary to ensure social cohesion.Under the agreement described on Tuesday, 25 percent of homeowners deemed to belong to \u201cvulnerable social groups\u201d would continue to be granted protection from foreclosures.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.An additional 35 percent of homeowners are to be eligible for foreclosure protection based on a series of criteria, including their repayment record and the value of their property.Bad loans are one of the biggest problems plaguing Greek banks, although nonperforming business loans are an even bigger burden for the institutions than home mortgages in arrears.An assessment by the European Central Bank last month found that \u20ac14.4 billion would be required to address the problem of bad loans and enable the country\u2019s four main banks to resume operating fully as lenders, helping to pump money into the ailing economy.Since that assessment, Greek banks have sought private funding, which might limit the amount of bailout money they require. The banks and their investors would rather limit the state\u2019s involvement in the process, if they can. Mr. Tsakalotos said on Tuesday that the bailout money set aside for the banks would be released once Greek banks had arranged that separate financing.Issues still to be resolved in subsequent negotiations include determining which nonperforming bank loans can be sold to foreign investors, and whether home mortgages can be included.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Workers at all levels who are interested and invested in their work, supported by their managers, and emotionally committed to their employers can have a tremendous impact on not only their organization\u2019s success but also the U.S. economy.According to a 2013 study by Gallup, when organizations successfully engage their customers and employees, they experience a 240% boost across key business outcomes compared with organizations that don\u2019t. These include increased productivity, workers who feel empowered to do what is right for customers and customers who, in turn, spend more time with the brand.\u201cEngaged employees are more attentive and vigilant,\u201d Jim Harter Ph.D., chief scientist of workplace management and wellbeing at Gallup Research, explained in an interview with \u201cHarvard Business Review.\u201d \u201cThey look out for the needs of their coworkers and the overall enterprise, because they personally \u2018own\u2019 the result of their work and that of the organization.\u201d\u00a0Yet Gallup also reported that currently only 30 percent of the approximately 100 million Americans with full-time jobs report being engaged and inspired at work. That means 70 percent of U.S. workers are either \u201cnot engaged\u201d (50 percent), which is to say they\u2019re just kind of going through the motions, or \u201cactively disengaged\u201d (20 percent), meaning deeply unhappy. The annual cost of workplace disenchantment to the U.S. economy is $450 billion to $550 billion. It is assessed in things like increased likelihood of employee theft, negatively influenced co-workers, reduction in productivity, absenteeism and lost customers.Smart employers are increasingly making it a strategic priority to engage employees and Walmart is among them.To ensure that every employee can find a clear path to advance, as these employees have, the retail company has launched a new program, called Pathways. It includes a series of YouTube-like videos that provide everything from job training to basic business and math skills to guidance on r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing and interviewing. Employees, or \u201cassociates,\u201d as Walmart refers to them, then work with their supervisors to implement what they have learned. When new hires complete the program, typically in about six months, they become eligible for pay raises and performance bonuses.\u00a0Melissa Kersey, Walmart\u2019s senior vice president of human resources, says the program grew out of a \u201cdeep dive\u201d into what associates and applicants around the country said they wanted most. \u201cThe number-one thing they asked for,\u201d she says, \u201cwas training and development to get to the next level.\u201d\u00a0\u201cOur future is dependent upon our associates,\u201d Kersey says, \u201cso we\u2019ve got to invest in them.\u201dWhen Donnie Dean began working as a cashier at a Walmart supercenter in Conway, Arkansas, six years ago, he was 18 and had just left his hometown, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to attend the University of Central Arkansas. He hoped the job would help him pay for school and support his family. He never imagined it would open so many doors.While attending school full-time, Dean moved steadily up the ranks, making it a point to learn and do everything he could in the store. When the need arose, he even jumped in to mix paint or decorate cakes.\u00a0\u201cThose cakes were failures,\u201d Dean, now 24, admits with a rueful laugh, \u201cbut I tried!\u201d\u00a0Everything else about Dean\u2019s time in the store, though, was a success. At 19, he took on his first supervisory role, and by the time he completed his B.B.A. in management information systems, in 2014, Dean was the store\u2019s operations manager, with more than 80 people reporting to him.\u00a0\u201cI gained a lot of leadership knowledge from that job,\u201d he says, looking back, \u201cmore than any leadership class I took.\u201dAfter graduation, Dean was selected to work at Walmart\u2019s home office in Bentonville, Arkansas, as part of a new company STEM initiative, placing employees with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math in technology positions. He has since been promoted to senior systems administrator in the information-security division.He credits his achievements to his mom\u2019s unwavering support and the \u201cawesome managers\u201d who\u2019ve mentored him, as well as his own willingness to work hard, take risks, keep learning and be part of a team.These days, Dean is trying to learn everything he can in his new role. And after that? \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like this is not the end. It\u2019s just the beginning of something even better than what it was before.\u201dNot long after Tanya Berner, then a 19-year-old college student, was hired as a temporary part-time cashier at a Walmart in Aurora, Colorado, in 2003, one of the store\u2019s co-managers presented her with an unexpected opportunity: A department manager was on leave. Would she like to take over temporarily?\u201cI said, \u2018Well, I haven\u2019t been here very long,\u2019\u201d Berner, now 31, recalls, \u201cand he said, \u2018Tanya, you can go as far as you want with the company. There are unreachable limits.\u2019\u201d That co-manager\u2019s words, Berner says, have \u201cjust stuck with me.\u201d\u00a0Berner took the temporary job, which led to a permanent one and then to a series of promotions and eventually to the role she recently assumed: store manager of a Walmart in Sterling, Colorado. Her new job marks the achievement of a long-held goal.\u201cWhen that co-manager said \u2018you can go as high as you want,\u2019 I set my sights on becoming store manager. I wanted my name at the top of a receipt,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very big honor to have within the company.\u201d Now, as store manager, her name is printed atop \u2013 and stands behind -- every transaction at her store.Berner, who is still pursuing her college degree on a part-time basis, knows she couldn\u2019t have reached her goal without the help of her mentors and co-workers within Walmart, whom she calls \u201cfamily.\u201d She says she hopes to rise further in order to extend her ability to have a positive impact on the people with whom she works and on Walmart\u2019s customers.Carlos Gomez calls his decision to take his first job with Walmart, as a department manager at a store in Cerritos, California, in 1993, a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d The company offered him not only a significantly higher hourly rate than he\u2019d made after three and a half years working for a competitor, but also better hours and a clearer role.\u00a0What Gomez, a high school graduate who never attended college, didn\u2019t predict was how far that dream would take him. Today, after multiple promotions and more than 21 years at the company, Gomez, now 40, is a market manager overseeing nine stores in the Los Angeles/Orange County, California, area that collectively serve around 300,000 customers weekly, 2,500-2,800 employees, and, he estimates, around $50 million in inventory.\u00a0He finds the responsibility to be challenging and exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s like running your own business, and that requires pretty much a little of everything,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thrill of it all.\u201dAnother thing Gomez was surprised to discover, after joining Walmart, is how closely its values align with those his parents had instilled in him. \u201cHard work was something I was raised with,\u201d he says. \u201cThey brought me up to have honesty and integrity\u201d and to treat people with respect.Although he has worked hard to get where he is today and to help others advance, Gomez marvels at the opportunities and support he has been given along the way.\u00a0Good business starts with the best people.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Marvel, an architect whose regional style of modernism left an imprint on dozens of public buildings, churches and houses across the Caribbean, died on Tuesday at his home in San Juan, P.R. He was 80. The cause was prostate cancer, his son Jonathan said. Mr. Marvel first went to Puerto Rico in 1959 to build low-cost housing for the International Basic Economy Corporation, a company founded by Nelson A. Rockefeller to improve developing nations. At the end of his three-month assignment, he decided to stay.Using local materials whenever possible, including cement mined from local limestone mountains, he designed stylish buildings sensitive to their tropical island settings. He preferred natural ventilation to air-conditioning; he also liked to use natural light and incorporate gardens into his structures. Some of his more notable projects included the American embassies in Costa Rica and Guatemala; the United States Court House and Federal Building in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; and, in Puerto Rico, where he did most of his work, a Carmelite convent in Trujillo Alto, the municipal building and theater in Bayam\u00f3n, and several buildings for campuses of the University of Puerto Rico.Thomas Stahl Marvel was born on March 15, 1935, in Newburgh, N.Y., where his father practiced as an architect, and grew up in the nearby village of Washingtonville. After working on affordable housing projects in Iran and Puerto Rico, Mr. Marvel returned to Harvard to complete his master\u2019s degree in architecture, which he received in 1962. Touring the world on a traveling fellowship, he was deeply impressed, during a brief stay in Japan, by the blurring of boundaries between interior and exterior space. He applied this approach to two houses he built for his family in San Juan, with overhanging eaves, interior patios and furniture made from local mahogany, all reflecting his design aesthetic. In 1990 the Society of Architects and Landscape Architects of Puerto Rico gave him the Henry Klumb Award, its highest honor.Mr. Marvel was the author of \u201cThe Architecture of the Parish Churches of Puerto Rico,\u201d written with Mar\u00eda Luisa Moreno, and \u201cAntonin Nechodoma, 1877-1928: The Prairie School in the Caribbean.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "WWII Hero Credits Luck and Chance in Foiling Hitler\u2019s Nuclear Ambitions", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileM.R.D. Foot, the official historian of Britain\u2019s wartime sabotage and intelligence service, the Special Operations Executive, which organized Mr. Ronneberg\u2019s mission, described the raid on a Norsk Hydro plant producing heavy water in Nazi-occupied Norway as a \u201ccoup\u201d that \u201cchanged the course of the war\u201d and deserved the \u201cgratitude of humanity.\u201dYet Mr. Ronneberg, speaking softly over coffee and biscuits in the modest, white clapboard house overlooking a fjord where he has lived since 1947, explained that the whole mission \u2014 and perhaps the outcome of World War II \u2014 would have been very different had he not decided on a whim to go to the movies and then a series of pubs in England before parachuting into Norway in February 1943.Still mentally sharp at his advanced age and still possessed of the unflappable calm that so impressed British military commanders more than 70 years ago, he recalled how, during a day off from training in Cambridge, England, in early 1943, he went to a movie theater and then happened \u201centirely by chance\u201d to walk by a hardware store selling heavy-duty metal cutters. He decided to buy a pair on the off chance they might come in handy, and he took them on his sabotage mission.Without this happenstance purchase, Mr. Ronneberg said, he and his men would never have been able to gain entry to and destroy the heavily guarded heavy water production plant at Vemork, in southern Norway. The handsaw that British planners had intended for use on a heavy padlock on the plant\u2019s side gate, he said, would have taken too much time, made too much noise and alerted Nazi guards. The success of the mission \u201cwas mostly luck, definitely,\u201d he said, smiling at his memories of a nighttime raid that, until the very end, had seemed a suicide mission.Once inside a hall containing the heavy water production, Mr. Ronneberg planted two strings of explosive charges provided by Britain\u2019s Special Operations Executive. He said he decided at the last minute to cut fuses designed to burn for two minutes so that they lasted only 30 seconds. This, he said, gave his men just enough time to get out safely, but made sure they would still be close enough \u201cto hear the bang\u201d and know \u201cwe had done our job.\u201dBut it took years before Mr. Ronneberg came to understand the exact purpose and importance of the job. All the British told him before dropping him onto a snow-covered Norwegian mountain, he said, was that a row of pipes at the Vemork plant needed to be destroyed.\u201cThey just said it was important and had to be blown up,\u201d he said, recalling his wartime exploits in his tidy living room, filled with family photos, including a large framed portrait of his wife, who died last year. The only hint of his past are a few books and magazines in an adjacent study devoted to the history of the war.He added that he knew nothing at the time about nuclear physics, heavy water or the race to build a nuclear bomb. He knew that Britain had lost more than 35 men in a disastrous 1942 attempt to sabotage the Norsk Hydro plant, but he had no idea why it was so intent on disabling a remote mountain facility whose only product as far as he knew was fertilizer.\u201cThe first time I heard about atom bombs and heavy water was after the Americans dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u201d in 1945, he said. \u201cThen we started to understand our raid and why.\u201d And also that, had it failed, London could have ended up \u201clooking like Hiroshima.\u201d This belated realization of the huge stakes at play \u201cwas a tremendous satisfaction,\u201d he said.Historians have long argued over how close Hitler came to developing nuclear weapons. A German historian claimed in a controversial 2005 book that the Nazis conducted several nuclear weapons tests in 1944-45. But a more widely accepted view is that Hitler\u2019s nuclear program, begun well before the Manhattan Project, stumbled badly because of its own inferior science and its enemy\u2019s exceptional saboteurs.It was handicapped by the flight and murder of Jewish scientists but suffered most gravely from a decision by the physicist Werner Heisenberg to use heavy water, deuterium oxide, instead of graphite, as a so-called moderator in the production of bomb-grade plutonium. Heavy water was not only less effective than graphite but also far more difficult to obtain in sufficiently large quantities, leaving the Nazis dependent on steady supplies from the Norsk Hydro plant in Norway.While long celebrated by foreign, particularly British, filmmakers, the exploits of Mr. Ronneberg and nine other Norwegians involved in thwarting the Nazi nuclear project became widely known in Norway only this year, when NRK, the state broadcaster, ran \u201cThe Heavy Water War,\u201d a six-episode mini-series that became a national sensation. The statue of Mr. Ronneberg in front of City Hall here in Alesund was put up only last year to observe his 95th birthday.Inscribed on its base is a message \u2014 \u201cPeace and Freedom are not to be taken for granted\u201d \u2014 that Mr. Ronneberg says has been ignored for too long by many in Norway, where painful memories of collaboration with the Nazis by the country\u2019s wartime leader Vidkun Quisling and his fascist regime have stilled enthusiasm for too much digging into the past.He said it was \u201cquite incredible\u201d that executives at Norsk Hydro, many of whom worked closely with the Nazis, were never prosecuted for their wartime treachery. The issue is still so delicate for a company that survived the war to become a pillar of the Norwegian economy that the television series broadcast this year altered the names of Norsk Hydro directors who had collaborated with Hitler.A journalist and administrator with the national broadcaster for most of his postwar career, Mr. Ronneberg for decades avoided talking publicly about the 1943 mission but, worried that younger Norwegians knew little about the war, started to open up in the 1970s and has since spoken regularly at schools.\u201cThere is a lot of talk about \u2018never again,\u2019 but this is impossible if we don\u2019t remember what happened back then,\u201d said Mr. Ronneberg, whose three children have all pursued careers outside the military. Remembering, he added, will only grow more difficult as his own generation dies off. \u201cThe challenge ahead is that it will be hard to interest people in history when there is nobody left alive who was a witness.\u201dMr. Ronneberg still follows current events and, despite trouble walking, still occasionally meets with fellow veterans and also members of Norway\u2019s royal family, whose forebears fled to Britain to escape the Nazis and helped rally resistance. Earlier this year he traveled to London to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Special Forces Club.He said he worries today about a newly assertive Russia and what he sees as the reluctance of many in Europe to understand that \u201cit is not a stable world\u201d and that peace is not guaranteed. \u201cIt ought to be obvious to people that peace and freedom have to be fought for,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians seem to have forgotten this.\u201dThe Saturday Profile article on Nov. 21, about Joachim Ronneberg, 96, the only living member of a World War II commando team that blew up a Norwegian plant that was Nazi Germany\u2019s only source of heavy water, thereby dashing its opportunity to produce nuclear weapons, referred incorrectly to the role that heavy water plays in nuclear science. It is used as a so-called moderator to produce bomb-grade plutonium, not bomb-grade uranium. The article also erroneously credited Mr. Ronneberg with a distinction. He is Norway\u2019s most decorated living war hero, not the most decorated over all.Henrik Pryser Libell contributed reporting from Oslo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Men\u2019s Lib!", "Date": "2015-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSO far the gender revolution has been a one-sided effort. Women have entered previously male precincts of economic and political life, and for the most part they have succeeded. They can lead companies, fly fighter jets, even run for president.But along the way something crucial has been left out. We have not pushed hard enough to put men in traditionally female roles \u2014 that is where our priority should lie now. This is not just about gender equality. The stakes are even higher. The jobs that many men used to do are gone or going fast, and families need two engaged parents to share the task of raising children.As painful as it may be, men need to adapt to what a modern economy and family life demand. There has been progress in recent years, but it hasn\u2019t been equal to the depth and urgency of the transformation we\u2019re undergoing. The old economy and the old model of masculinity are obsolete. Women have learned to become more like men. Now men need to learn to become more like women.Will this transformation be good for men? In the long run, we think so. But in any case they don\u2019t really have a choice. Recent changes in women\u2019s status and in the economy aren\u2019t going to be reversed. Men must either adapt or be left behind.Many men have felt a double whammy: a loss of economic status as jobs in traditionally masculine sectors have disappeared and a loss of social status as women have advanced. Male wages are stagnant and among the less educated, they have fallen: Median earnings for men with only a high school diploma have dropped in real terms by 28 percent since 1980.These disturbing trends have led many observers to call on boys and men to regain their competitive edge over women, so they can once again be successful breadwinners and leaders. But that\u2019s the wrong message. Rather than trying to recreate a patriarchal past, men have to embrace a more feminine future.Instead, some men, especially those with the bleakest economic prospects, are retreating into what some scholars have labeled \u201chyper-masculinity.\u201d At the extreme this leads to violence and misogyny, and may be a form of compensation for low status or loss of respect.But given their own limited prospects, these men are the very ones who most need female partners, along with a partner\u2019s paycheck, to survive in today\u2019s economy.The greater success being enjoyed by girls results not from superior intellect but from better study habits. Girls typically demonstrate more focus, effort and self-discipline. Boys and young men are more likely to be distracted by video games, or even derailed by drink or drugs.The labor market is becoming steadily more female-friendly. Jobs are being created as the economy recovers from the blow it received during the Great Recession. The problem is that they are largely \u201cwomen\u2019s jobs,\u201d so men aren\u2019t taking them. Women have moved into formerly all-male provinces like law and business, but men have not made the reverse trek into health and education.LATELY, there has been a laudable push to get girls and women into jobs that require STEM skills (science, technology, engineering and math). But it is equally important to train and encourage men to take jobs that require skills in health, education, administration and literacy, so-called HEAL jobs.Right now, HEAL jobs are dominated by women. Men make up 20 percent of elementary and middle-school teachers, 9 percent of nurses, 16 percent of personal care aides and 6 percent of personal assistants.Until men seize opportunities in these \u201cpink collar\u201d sectors, they will continue to lose out in this dynamic area of the labor market. Women currently dominate the sectors expected to produce the most jobs. Unless the gender imbalance in the 30 fastest-growing occupations changes, women will take up a million jobs that would otherwise have gone to men.There are no legal obstacles to men becoming schoolteachers or nurses, so this is largely a question of culture and attitude. We need to match the campaigns to help girls and women see traditionally male jobs as appropriate for them with equally effective efforts in the other direction.Small messages can be powerful here. We know that girls are less likely to apply to study science if they see boy-oriented posters, featuring \u201cStar Trek\u201d or Harry Potter. Boys almost surely react the same way to images and environments with a feminine feel.\u201cStewardesses\u201d have become flight attendants. Good. So why not call nurses \u201chealth attendants\u201d (if entry level) or \u201chealth associates\u201d (if more highly trained)? Getting more men into teaching would have two advantages: widening male job prospects and at the same time providing more diverse role models for boys in the classroom.But the proportion of married mothers out-earning their husbands has also risen, from 4 percent in 1960 to 17 percent in 2015. In half the families where both parents work full time, the mother earns as much as or more than the father.Family leave policies can be designed to help here, though the frequency with which they are relabeled \u201cmaternity leave\u201d shows how far behind we still are. Right now, the United States is the only advanced country without a national paid leave policy.There are some small signs of hope from the campaign trail. Hillary Rodham Clinton proposes a national mandate requiring employers to offer all new parents three months of paid time off. Senator Marco Rubio suggests a 25 percent tax credit for companies that provide at least four weeks of paid leave to employees.We should go further, and institute leave rights specifically and solely for fathers. Policy is usually built on the assumption that if there is a father in the picture, he should either be earning or paying child support; his role as a potential caretaker is typically ignored or stigmatized.Sweden and Germany have already successfully introduced this kind of \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d leave policy (in other words, only the father can make use of it), and a similar program in Quebec demonstrates what can be accomplished. Since 2006, parents in the province have been offered a generous benefit of 70 percent income replacement for a year. A critical feature of the policy is that five weeks of leave are reserved for fathers.The effects lasted, too. In the three years following the leave, mothers and fathers continued to pursue a more egalitarian division of both domestic and market work. There is an important message here. Policies deliberately aimed at helping fathers to take on a bigger role at home can have profound and rapid effects on gender roles.MORE symmetry in gender roles will also reshape (and is already reshaping) what economists unromantically label \u201cmarriage markets.\u201d The old model of the marriage contract was lopsided; women would marry men who were more educated, more successful and older than they were. (Social scientists, even less romantically, call this hypergamy.)But the idea that men will be the \u201csenior partner\u201d in a marriage is no longer realistic; soon, there will be as many successful women as men. This means men need to get used to the idea of \u201cmarrying up\u201d \u2014 and women to the idea of \u201cmarrying down.\u201d This seems to be happening to some extent already: In 2012, 27 percent of newlywed men married \u201cup\u201d educationally.More men ought to be doing what women did historically: improving their economic prospects by marrying well. With apologies to Jane Austen, even a man who is not in possession of a fortune will still be in want of a wife \u2014 ideally one who has a fortune of her own.The problem is that many men and women, disoriented by the shake-up of gender roles, are not marrying at all \u2014 less-educated adults, especially \u2014 resulting in a class-based marriage gap. Marriage rates among men under 35 have dropped by 23 percentage points since 1980.Outdated ideas are doing some damage here. Too many men and women are holding out for a traditional marriage when the traditional conditions that supported it have largely disappeared. Men with poor job prospects do not see themselves as husband material. Many of the women they know agree with them.More educated couples are meanwhile reshaping marriage into a more symmetrical and egalitarian institution. Married men seem to be adapting more quickly, probably because they are more educated and more economically secure.In feminist thought, marriage is typically seen as a patriarchal institution. Twenty-first-century marriage seems in fact to be providing fertile ground for a renegotiation of gender roles in an egalitarian direction.But rather than encouraging the transition to these more equal marriages, public policies are too often formulated, framed or communicated in a way that reinforces, rather than replaces, outdated gender stereotypes.There is, for example, a growing desire among some policy mavens to create more \u201cmarriageable men\u201d by providing them with the kinds of apprenticeships and wage subsidies that will enhance their marriage prospects. This whole enterprise is shot through with a breadwinner-male definition of marriage that is well past its sell-by date.None of this is to say that better wages and more skills aren\u2019t needed for men: They are, desperately. But it is just as important to keep lifting up women\u2019s skills, earnings and incomes. We don\u2019t want a world in which men can get better jobs than women simply because they are men. Nor are we going to restore marriages based on the superior earning power of men.Resistance to these kinds of changes in familial roles is often based on assumptions about innate biological differences. There is little doubt that evolutionary differences exist. But it is hard to say how much they influence the adoption of certain roles under current cultural conditions. We suspect beliefs about innate differences are often an excuse for preserving the status quo. If the role of biology is exaggerated, society will suffer.Cultural recalibration to the new economic and social realities certainly won\u2019t happen overnight. Think how easily the terms \u201cworking mother\u201d and \u201ccareer woman\u201d still trip off the tongue, by comparison with \u201cworking father\u201d or \u201ccareer man.\u201d About a third of adults in the United States still agree that \u201cit is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family.\u201dThis is a clear improvement over the 1970s, when more than half concurred: But attitudes have shifted most slowly among men and women with the least education. Among those without a high school diploma, a majority still believe in the sole-breadwinner model (even the women split 50-50 on the question).It has been clear for a long time that cramped gender roles are bad for women. It is becoming obvious that now they are hurting men, too. So a transformation of our ideas of male roles and masculinity is required, if many of the economic and social shifts described above are actually going to occur.This kind of cultural change is hard, of course. But it can happen; sometimes quickly. Think of the gains that women have made in the last 50 years, or changing attitudes toward gay rights, and interracial marriage.America now seems to be experiencing a renewed bout of cultural turbulence over what it means to be a woman, or a wife; a man, or a husband. Gay marriage, even after legalization, sharply divides opinion. Women\u2019s reproductive freedom is being curtailed. The growing confidence and strengthening rights of the transgender community are causing wildly disproportionate anxiety.The way forward, we believe, is for men to embrace and adapt to the new, more androgynous world. There is no point in harking back. The world in which high-paid manufacturing jobs could support a family, and where women were expected to focus only on being wives and mothers is gone. Women have shown they are ready for this transition. But what about men?Richard V. Reeves and Isabel V.

{"Headline": "Simon Winchester\u2019s \u2018Pacific\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAudiobooksOver the decades, the British-born Simon Winchester has emerged as one of those increasingly rare geographic generalists, migrating from region to region, sharing with his readers an almost tactile sense of the earth, its history and its peoples. His narratives exist within that depressingly vast space between the hairsplitting nuances and abstractions of academia and the vulgar simplicities of cable news pundits. A highbrow out to educate middlebrows, Winchester writes books like someone telling a good yarn around the fireplace, whether about volcanoes, Indian slums or the 19th-century American West. He is an outdoorsman who knows about such things as geology and ocean sailing, which invigorates his prose in the same way as that of another journalistic travel writer, William Langewiesche, who flies planes and also sails. And he certainly has the knack for comparison. When Winchester writes that Hawaii, deep down, \u201cin its perceived cultural essence,\u201d still evokes what \u201cwas felt by Gauguin during his time in the Marquesas,\u201d it is reminiscent of the British travel writer Jan Morris describing in 1960 how the smells and landscape of the Lido in Venice ignite thoughts of Carthage and Marrakesh.His new and structurally ambitious book is \u201cPacific: Silicon Chips and Surfboards, Coral Reefs and Atom Bombs, Brutal Dictators, Fading Empires, and the Coming Collision of the World\u2019s Superpowers.\u201d In the audio version, Winchester, who has also written a volume on the Atlantic, provides his own narration, speaking with a beautifully enunciated theatrical edge \u2014 akin to a BBC announcer\u2019s \u2014 that makes the succession of \u00adimages in the print version especially easy to visualize and to hear. He tells about grand military, technological and environmental trends playing out on a cartographic feature that represents the \u201cunsleeping Eye of the earth,\u201d as the poet Robinson Jeffers called the Pacific Ocean: the whole of history, in other words, seen through the lens of a common geography, 45 percent of the world\u2019s surface water.But how to organize such an overwhelming story within a reasonable length? Winchester was inspired by a book of essays published by the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig in 1927, dealing with what Winchester calls the \u201cseminal moments in the tide of human experience.\u201d Consequently, \u201cPacific\u201d is organized around 10 essayistic chapters about such seemingly disparate subjects as thermonuclear bombs, surfboarding, the transistor radio revolution, coral reefs, cyclones and naval competition. Moreover, Winchester is concerned only with developments that have occurred since the near-halfway point of the last century, when, in his quirky mind, radiocarbon dating stopped being accurate \u2014 because nuclear-bomb-created isotopes in the air henceforth distorted measurements.The effect of these 10 chapters does not quite make the amorphous Pacific cohere as a historical or literary unit, something that may well be impossible. But Winchester does, nevertheless, delineate both the tragedy and dynamism of contemporary world history, with all of its ghastly horrors. He excels at putting geopolitical trends, themselves quite broad, into an even wider metaphorical context for the general reader and listener: by, for example, tying such slow-motion events as the collapse of the British Empire to the unseemly demise of the R.M.S. Queen Elizabeth in the Hong Kong harbor in 1972, and the departure of the American Navy and Air Force from the Philippines to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. Every\u00adwhere, the author is taking a step back and saying, in effect, let\u2019s look at the really big picture.Winchester digests expert data in order to take the listener beyond it. Here is his description of an underwater plutonium bomb exploding at Bikini Atoll in 1946: \u201cWith a gigantic whoosh, it suddenly created at first a mile-wide glass-bubble sphere of water and steam and condensate and crushed coral and mud that thundered out of the mirror-\u00adcalm blue of the lagoon.\u201d But even in the midst of the empty Pacific, he reminds us, there are human casualties to this series of bomb tests: 236 local islanders \u201chad received doses of radiation every bit as great as those suffered by the Japanese in Hiroshima.\u201d Yet \u201cno alarm had sounded. Instead, the bomb managers\u2019 first reaction was to think of employing the Rongelapese as case studies, as human guinea pigs.\u201dMeanwhile, in the late 1940s, the Japanese were emerging from their own devastation. Barely half of Tokyo\u2019s inhabitants \u201chad a roof over their heads. One in five had tuberculosis. On all sides in the capital were ruined buildings, broken water mains and sewage drains, shattered schools. There was no public transportation: All the buses were destroyed.\u201d This is how Winchester improbably sets up the transistor radio revolution and the emergence of postwar Japan as a technological dynamo. (The name \u201cSony\u201d was chosen by the entrepreneur Akio Morita because of an Al Jolson song with the title \u201cSonny Boy.\u201d After all, it was American consumers whom Morita first had to please.)Winchester arrives in Tokyo Bay in 2014 not by plane but by boat from Russia\u2019s Far East, and immediately notices the relative paucity of container ships in the harbor. For, as he explains, the cynosure of the Asian economy had in the intervening decades moved from Japan to China, a place on which the American military is now obsessively fixated.Winchester\u2019s description of conflict in the South China Sea is more efficient, balanced and lucid than those in many publications by Washington research institutions. China\u2019s aim is to take over the blue-water extensions of its continental landmass through steps \u201cindividually small enough to make retaliation difficult.\u201d It is typical Chinese strategy: \u201cinfuriating and clever, and right out of Sun Tzu\u2019s handbook.\u201d And no matter the evolution of American policy, China will keep doing what it has been doing in the South China Sea until it can\u2019t: that is, until its troubled economy or unstable internal politics inhibits its naval expansion. That\u2019s why the future of the Western Pacific battle space may be written inside China itself, a subject not covered in this already sprawling book.A larger question Winchester confronts is that of the future of the environment. \u201cA coral reef is the marine equivalent of a rain forest,\u201d he writes, registering all the dangers that human activity places on the ecosystem, and the Pacific has \u201ctwice as many species of coral as the Atlantic does.\u201d As for climate change itself, it really means atmospheric turbulence. On the eve of super\u00adcyclone Tracy, in 1974, the Australian city of Darwin \u201cwas a tough little frontier town, a hard-drinking, broken-jaw kind of place \u2014 Australia in the raw, ready for most kinds of trouble.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t ready for a storm that \u201ccrushed building after building like a giant\u2019s hand.\u201d Eighty percent of the city\u2019s houses were totally destroyed.By interweaving history, fascinating trivia and acute observation, Winchester demonstrates how travel writing has a future. But it will be less as a one-\u00addimensional gonzo narrative than as a vehicle providing readable explanations for every kind of complex subject, from \u00adscience to geopolitics.PACIFICSilicon Chips and Surfboards, Coral Reefs and Atom Bombs, Brutal Dictators, Fading Empires, and the Coming Collision of the World\u2019s SuperpowersBy Simon WinchesterRead by the author14\u00bc hours.

It has rippled through the economy, affecting construction and power companies and even threatening to tarnish the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Fiercely independent judges are spearheading the inquiry, and Ms. Rousseff is in no position to try to influence them. Some 50 politicians are being investigated for bribery.The president has not been implicated, though she was chairwoman of the Petrobras board when much of the supposed improbity occurred. But she is hugely unpopular, blamed for sending the economy into its worst recession in 25 years and the austerity she espouses to fix it. Demonstrators have called for her impeachment.Brazil\u2019s institutions have been growing stronger since democracy was restored in the 1980s, however, and can act as a bulwark against the populism that Ms. Rousseff has compared to coup-mongering. If she were impeached, it would probably be for questionable government accounting practices rather than incompetence and would only happen after a long process in Congress. She could also be in trouble if the Petrobras investigation finds illicit contributions to her 2014 re-election campaign.Plea bargains and other legal measures have made it easier to investigate companies since a huge vote-buying scandal known as the mensal\u00e3o broke a decade ago. Though the court system has pockets of corruption and bogs down in bureaucracy, a well-functioning judiciary can offer more security for investors and eventually help the economy recover.The nation stands out from regional laggards like Venezuela, where the Bolivarian revolution of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his hapless successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has seriously compromised the independence of government institutions. Facing crises of their own, such countries would do well to watch for the silver lining in Brazil\u2019s: the rule of law.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Says Whistle-Blower Pushed It to Admit Broader Cheating", "Date": "2015-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn trying to determine who was responsible for the diesel cheating scandal, Volkswagen\u2019s internal investigators have reportedly been hampered by an ingrained fear of delivering bad news to superiors. But in the case of the new disclosure, some employees have evidently been willing to come forward under the company\u2019s new management.Volkswagen on Sunday broadly confirmed a report in Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper, that an engineer at the company had volunteered information about how employees had manipulated tests for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy. Tires, for example, were filled with more air than normal, the newspaper reported.\u201cIn the course of internal investigations, employees have admitted that there were irregularities in communication of fuel consumption values,\u201d Volkswagen said in a statement on Sunday.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Eric Felber, a Volkswagen spokesman, said he could not provide further details.The diesel cheating scandal involves the company\u2019s manipulation of pollution control systems on 11 million cars that enabled them to pass emissions control tests in laboratory settings but allowed the cars on the road to emit up to 40 times the allowable limits of nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can damage lungs.The more recently disclosed problem involves understating the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by 800,000 Volkswagen cars \u2014 mainly diesels but also some gasoline vehicles \u2014 sold in Europe. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.The United States and the European Union have both set standards aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars. But unlike the United States, many countries in Europe have added a further inducement to owners of gasoline and diesel cars: allowing tax credits based on low carbon emissions in relation to higher fuel economy. Volkswagen said last week that it would set aside 2 billion euros, or about $2.1 billion, to pay back European tax credits the company and car owners had received under false pretenses.In the case of the diesel scandal, the cheating apparently began around 2008 after it became apparent that Volkswagen would be unable to achieve the clean-diesel promises it had made publicly as the company bet a big part of its future on diesel vehicles.Employees were afraid to admit to Mr. Winterkorn that they could not meet the goals, and decided to cheat, Bild am Sonntag reported. The newspaper\u2019s reports about Volkswagen have been reliable in the past, and a person close to top management, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he had no reason to doubt the information.The company has said that 11 million cars, including 500,000 in the United States, have the illegal software. Volkswagen is trying to find a way to make the vehicles compliant with regulations.But it remains a mystery who was responsible for the software used to fool regulators about nitrogen oxide emissions.Volkswagen has been trying to demonstrate that it is determined to discover the source of the wrongdoing and be more forthcoming about what happened. Employees may be more willing to speak under the new chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller, who replaced Mr. Winterkorn and vowed to overhaul the company\u2019s management culture.As part of an effort to demonstrate more openness, top officials at Volkswagen personally informed Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, about the false carbon dioxide claims before issuing the public statement last week, according to a person briefed on the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Mr. M\u00fcller and Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, chairman of the supervisory board, traveled to Berlin to speak with Ms. Merkel and other high-ranking government officials. The meeting was first reported by Bild am Sonntag.Volkswagen\u2019s most recent admissions about false carbon dioxide claims also put pressure on the German government, raising questions about why regulators did not scrutinize automaker data more closely.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about underreported carbon dioxide emissions in 800,000 diesel- and gasoline-powered Volkswagen vehicles in Europe referred incompletely to the approach the United States and European countries take in regulating carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars. Both the United States and European countries have specific regulations on such emissions; it is not the case that the Europeans are more focused on reducing carbon dioxide emissions than the United States. (European countries have, however, added further incentives, like giving tax credits to owners of gasoline or diesel cars based on their low emissions of carbon dioxide.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela's Threatened Elections", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLate last month, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela said that in the event of a defeat for his party in December\u2019s legislative election, he would \u201cnot hand over the revolution.\u201d That outcome, he warned, would force him to govern \u201cwith the people in a civil-military union.\u201d That message is disturbing. Mr. Maduro appears to be suggesting that if his ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela takes a beating at the ballot box on Dec. 6, as polls predict, he will render the legislative branch toothless.As his support base has dwindled in recent years, Mr. Maduro\u2019s government has arbitrarily prosecuted political opponents and unfairly disqualified opposition leaders from running for office. He gerrymandered voting districts to give his party a leg up and sought to shore up popular support by picking fights with two neighbors, Guyana and Colombia.The world has noticed. On Nov. 10, Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, sent the chief of the Venezuelan election commission an 18-page letter raising alarm about the fairness of the coming vote. The tone of the letter was remarkable because the O.A.S., of which Venezuela is a member, has historically been reluctant to publicly criticize Latin American leaders. The following day, a group of 157 lawmakers from the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru sent Mr. Maduro a letter urging him to allow international observers to monitor the vote.Mr. Maduro has never taken international criticism to heart, and he is likely to dismiss these recent complaints as part of an American conspiracy against him. But they signal the extent to which he has become a pariah in a region where leaders are traditionally reluctant to publicly criticize how their neighbors govern. Further usurping the will of voters would only deepen Mr. Maduro\u2019s isolation and erode his legitimacy.New leadership in Venezuela\u2019s Congress could give the country a welcome jolt. The nation desperately needs to mend its devastated economy and rebuild the democratic institutions that have withered under Mr. Maduro\u2019s watch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Beat Mugabe, Zimbabwe Needs a United Opposition", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Political violence is on the rise in Zimbabwe. Two people were axed to death and three others were hospitalized in clashes earlier this month. More than 50 people were arrested for holding rallies in the capital, Harare, in November, prompting statements of concern last week from the United States and the European Union. The opposition has stepped up protests, promising mass weekly demonstrations nationwide against President Robert Mugabe\u2019s nearly four decades in power.Zimbabwe\u2019s beleaguered opposition is down but not out. Because of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s grip on the security services, a public uprising such as the one seen in Burkina Faso last year is unlikely in Zimbabwe. But there is another option to help bring genuine democracy to the country: quietly supporting a broad opposition coalition.In September, former Vice President Joice Mujuru released a political manifesto that was a strong rebuke to Mr. Mugabe, 91, and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party. Ms. Mujuru matters because she is a veteran of Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation war, has belonged to the ruling party for over three decades and was for many years a close associate of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s. She was sacked from her position in December 2014 for allegedly planning to topple Mr. Mugabe.Ms. Mujuru\u2019s newly unveiled political manifesto has made a splash: It calls for re-engagement with Western countries and a reversal of some of Zimbabwe\u2019s most controversial policies, including land reform.But could she actually unseat Mr. Mugabe, who has been in power since 1980? Yes, but not by herself. Ms. Mujuru seems to understand this; plans for a coalition with other opposition groups are currently being discussed. With Ms. Mujuru\u2019s liberation war credentials and the opposition\u2019s diminished but still considerable support, a coalition could finally beat ZANU-PF in polls scheduled for 2018, if elections are reasonably free and fair.Mr. Mugabe is unlikely to hand over power voluntarily. If he does not die in office, he will most likely run for re-election. But because of the plunging state of the economy and unprecedented splits in the ruling party, Mr. Mugabe, or his anointed successor, could be beaten.If Mr. Mugabe hands the reins to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa \u2014 who is now the front-runner to succeed him \u2014 before elections, ZANU-PF\u2019s political fortunes might actually sink lower than if Mr. Mugabe runs himself in 2018. This is because Mr. Mnangagwa lacks broad political support and because Ms. Mujuru has grass-roots popularity among ZANU-PF supporters. Before she was sacked in 2014, Ms. Mujuru commanded support from nine out of 10 provinces in party elections.The longstanding opposition, led by Morgan Tsvangirai\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change, has splintered over leadership struggles. In January 2014, its former secretary general and finance minister, Tendai Biti, broke ranks with Mr. Tsvangirai, forming his own movement, now known as the People\u2019s Democratic Party.But all is not lost for the opposition. Mr. Tsvangirai is now engaged in coalition talks with Ms. Mujuru and her People First camp. Speaking on the potential of joining forces, Mr. Tsvangirai said Ms. Mujuru and her allies \u201cdeserve our support for their new sense of patriotism and the realization that together we are bigger, better and more formidable.\u201d Ms. Mujuru\u2019s camp has also discussed potential alliances with Mr. Biti and other smaller opposition parties.Academic research shows that broad opposition coalitions greatly improve the chances of transition to democracy in authoritarian-leaning countries like Zimbabwe. A case in point is Nigeria, where earlier this year opposition unity led to a peaceful transfer of power. My own research in Zimbabwe found that splits in the opposition and a lack of sound political strategies hurt the chances for democratic reform during Zimbabwe\u2019s power-sharing government, in office from 2008 to 2013. The opposition must learn from these mistakes and come together.The benefits of a coalition in Zimbabwe are clear. Given Ms. Mujuru\u2019s nationalist credentials and Mr. Tsvangirai\u2019s broad support base, a cohesive opposition alliance between the two stands a real chance against ZANU-PF in 2018, with or without Mr. Mugabe.There are, of course, a number of challenges \u2014 namely deciding who would lead and who would play second fiddle.Moreover, ZANU-PF will not go down without a fight. A Mujuru-Tsvangirai coalition would face harassment and violence at the hands of the state security apparatus, as seen in 2008 and previous elections in Zimbabwe. This month a military general admitted as much, saying that ZANU-PF would rule forever. The opposition would need to win big and make conciliatory promises to the old guard, most likely including amnesties, in order to avoid a repeat of the 2008 violence.Despite these obstacles, a broad opposition alliance remains Zimbabwe\u2019s best chance to escape the yoke of Mr. Mugabe. While Western governments must tread carefully, they can play an important role in helping to quietly push opposition leaders to join hands for the good of Zimbabwe and democracy in southern Africa.Alexander Noyes is a doctoral candidate in the department of politics and international relations at Oxford University.Advertisement"}

He was 96.His death was confirmed by Teresa Maria Frei, spokeswoman for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, where Mr. Schmidt was co-publisher.In a statement, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she had visited Mr. Schmidt at his home less than a year ago and praised him as a source of \u201cadvice and judgment I valued.\u201dMr. Schmidt, a Social Democrat, had not shied from criticizing policies put forth by her as leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union Party.\u201cWe Germans have lost a father figure,\u201d said Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, one of a generation of Social Democratic leaders formed by Mr. Schmidt and Willy Brandt.Mr. Schmidt\u2019s life all but traced the history of 20th-century Germany. A son of working-class Hamburg, he was born in the wake of Germany\u2019s humiliating defeat in World War I, witnessed the Nazis\u2019 rise, joined the Hitler Youth, served in Hitler\u2019s army \u2014 hiding the fact that he had a Jewish grandfather \u2014 and emerged politically in a postwar Germany divided against itself.12 PhotosElected in 1974, Mr. Schmidt rode a difficult period as chancellor: The global economy was in turmoil, and tensions with the Communist east had not slackened. Unlike his more accommodating predecessors, he jousted with the United States over global economics and relations with the Soviet Union. He barely concealed his disdain for President Jimmy Carter, a novice in international affairs, and his wariness of a bellicose President Ronald Reagan.At home, he compelled his left-leaning Social Democratic Party to embrace pro-business policies and to support the buildup of the West German armed forces into a bulwark of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.At the same time, he pressed the Federal Republic of Germany to forge closer ties with the Communist regime in East Germany. And working with his close friend President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing of France, he helped soften European distrust of his country for its Nazi past, still fresh in painful memory.Mr. Schmidt made grievous policy errors, which were compounded by his unwillingness to admit mistakes and a seeming disregard for diplomacy, with foes and allies alike. They were failings that led the Bundestag, Germany\u2019s parliament, to dismiss him after eight years in office.His detractors accused him of being overwilling to assuage Moscow in his desire to salvage d\u00e9tente, an effort, embraced by West Germany and France, to ensure peace through stronger political and economic ties with Moscow.Moreover, his intemperate criticism of Washington promoted neutralist, anti-American tendencies in the Social Democratic Party, which only helped undermine his chancellorship.Mr. Schmidt was confident \u2014 too confident, some said \u2014 about his ability to sustain prosperity in West Germany. Under his stewardship, his nation fared better than the rest of Europe during the economic crisis of the 1970s, provoked by a sharp rise in petroleum prices controlled by OPEC, the cartel of oil-exporting countries. But he was criticized in the early \u201980s as having failed to prepare West Germans for recession.Mr. Schmidt might have been able to survive politically if he had antagonized opponents less. But in the Bundestag he was resented for his attacks on legislators who disagreed with him.Even after his downfall, Mr. Schmidt was unapologetic. In a 1986 speech, on his retirement from the Bundestag, he noted that unemployment had continued to climb under Chancellor Kohl. Then, facing Mr. Kohl, he said that the real jobless rate \u201cwould be a little higher if you hadn\u2019t manipulated the numbers a little downward.\u201dNearing retirement, Mr. Schmidt spent much of his time in Hamburg, his native port city. He wrote a memoir and other books as well as articles in which he defended his outspoken exchanges with American presidents.\u201cI have always regarded myself as a reliable friend of the United States, but never have I misunderstood an alliance to be a system of control and command,\u201d he said in a 1984 interview with The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s rather a system of advice and consent, if I may borrow a phrase from your Constitution.\u201d Family Secret Revealed Helmut Heinrich Waldemar Schmidt was born on Dec. 23, 1918, in Barmbek, a working-class district of Hamburg. His father, Gustav, was a schoolteacher; his mother, Ludovica, was an artistically gifted homemaker.With Hitler rising to power in 1933, Helmut Schmidt joined the Hitler Youth, and in 1937 he was drafted into the German Army. After the war began in 1939, he became a first lieutenant in an antiaircraft artillery battery on the Russian front and was awarded the Iron Cross.He and Hannelore Glaser, known as Loki, married in 1942. They had known each other since they were schoolchildren. They had a daughter, Susanne.After the war, Mr. Schmidt obtained a degree in political economy at the University of Hamburg, and his wife became a schoolteacher. While still a student, he joined the Social Democratic Party and took a job in Hamburg\u2019s municipal government in 1948. Five years later, he was elected to the Bundestag in Bonn, the West German capital.Early on he established himself as a conservative, pragmatic maverick in the left-leaning Social Democratic mainstream. He backed West German rearmament in the 1950s, for instance, while most party members opposed it. A Return to Hamburg Bored with the Bundestag, he returned to Hamburg in 1961 and became the city\u2019s interior minister. Early the next year, while the mayor was away on vacation, Mr. Schmidt vaulted into national prominence by supervising the emergency response to a calamitous flood in which at least 300 people drowned, victims of heavy winds that had swept over the coast and sent a swollen Elbe River pouring over its dikes. Even after the mayor hurried back to the city, Mr. Schmidt relegated him to the sideline while remaining in charge on the ground.(In her statement, Chancellor Merkel, a native of Hamburg, warmly described a childhood memory of Mr. Schmidt in command of rescue efforts.)Mr. Schmidt returned to the Bundestag in 1965 and became an expert on defense policy. He also drew closer to the views of Mr. Brandt, the Social Democratic Party leader, who wanted to normalize relations with East Germany. In 1969, after the Social Democrats gained power, Chancellor Brandt named Mr. Schmidt defense minister, and any lingering doubts about the willingness of the antimilitarist Social Democrats to reconcile themselves with the armed forces vanished. Military spending rose, weaponry was modernized, and Mr. Schmidt embraced the United States military presence in Europe.Mr. Schmidt was named finance minister in 1972 and promptly sought to make left-wing Social Democrats understand that West Germany\u2019s open-armed social benefits could be financed only by a thriving capitalist economy.He also, crucially, developed a friendship and alliance with his French counterpart, Mr. Giscard d\u2019Estaing \u2014 one that would determine the balance of power in Western Europe.They seemed mismatched. Mr. Giscard d\u2019Estaing was tall, aristocratic and politically conservative; Mr. Schmidt was short, devoid of social pretensions and leader of a center-left party. But both had lightning intelligence, technical expertise and a proclivity to believe they were always right. Most important, they shared a vision: of Western Europe under French-German leadership achieving economic integration.Mr. Schmidt\u2019s path to the pinnacle of power was cleared in 1974, when Mr. Brandt resigned in a scandal in which a close adviser had been revealed to be an East German spy. A few days later, on May 16, 1974, Mr. Schmidt became the fifth chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. His first trip abroad was to Paris, to meet with the new French president, Mr. Giscard d\u2019Estaing. Unable to speak each other\u2019s language, they conversed in English.French-German unity had been a cornerstone of West European postwar policy. The prevailing view was that West Germany offered economic strength while France lent a confident voice on foreign affairs \u2014 one that West Germans, hesitant to speak out so soon after the Hitler era, eagerly welcomed.The more pragmatic, if not cynical, take on the relationship was that it allowed the French to keep close tabs on a historic rival and Germans to rid themselves of the Nazi stigma.The Schmidt-Giscard d\u2019Estaing bond went beyond pragmatism, however. They spoke often by phone and made unannounced visits to each other. At international conferences they usually sat side by side, whispering to each other as they shaped common positions.Together they pushed for the establishment of the European Council, in which heads of governments met regularly. They backed the European monetary system, which in 1999 led to a common currency, the euro, for members of the European Union.Mr. Schmidt also had early successes at home. His government was skillful in handling the sharp rise in oil prices that began in 1973, and despite a huge bill for oil imports, the country built a record trade surplus. He also proved effective in dealing with a West German terrorist group, the Red Army Faction, whose ranks were decimated by arrests after the kidnapping and killing of a German industrialist, Hanns-Martin Schleyer, in 1977. Mr. Schmidt emerged with the highest public opinion ratings of any German politician since the first postwar chancellor, Konrad Adenauer.Meanwhile, friction was growing between the United States and West Germany. One cause of unease in Bonn was a perception that President Carter, elected in 1976, was inexperienced and unpredictable. \u201cPersonally, he was a very nice man,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said in his 1984 interview with The Times Magazine. \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t depend on his carrying through what he had agreed with you to do.\u201dThe most contentious question was how to cope with the arsenal of Soviet SS-20 nuclear missiles aimed at Western Europe. In December 1979, NATO decided to install American nuclear-armed Pershing and cruise missiles in several Western European countries by 1983 unless the Soviets agreed to remove their SS-20 missiles.Mr. Schmidt, defying opponents in his own party, agreed to base the bulk of the American weapons in West Germany. But he complained that Washington failed to understand how critical it was to overcome West Germans\u2019 vehement opposition to the missiles.\u201cThink of a situation where an American administration puts 5,000 nuclear rockets in Oregon\u201d \u2014 a state roughly the size of West Germany \u2014 \u201cand makes plans for adding some hundreds more that could hit the Soviet Union and thereby make Oregon a great target area for Soviet missiles,\u201d he said in a 1982 Times interview.The Euromissile talks were suspended after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and Mr. Carter decreed a grain embargo and a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.In Europe, only West Germany, Monaco, Norway and Turkey honored the boycott. Though Mr. Schmidt went along with it, he grumbled that American officials had assured him several times that no boycott would be called.Relations between Washington and Bonn did not improve after Reagan denied Mr. Carter a second term in 1980. Early on, Reagan took a hard line toward the Soviet Union and scared Europeans by suggesting that the West could win a limited nuclear war.Meanwhile, setbacks at home and abroad had begun sapping Mr. Schmidt\u2019s power. Recession Takes a Toll In France, Mr. Giscard d\u2019Estaing lost his re-election bid in 1981, and though his successor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, a socialist, had links to West German Social Democrats, he and Mr. Schmidt had a cool relationship. Mr. Mitterrand suspected that Mr. Schmidt had supported Mr. Giscard d\u2019Estaing in the election.At home the economy was in trouble. Signs of stagnation had appeared when Mr. Schmidt won re-election in 1980, but he had not issued warnings. Soon recession set in, unemployment rose, and the public was angry. Left-wing Social Democrats pressed for more state ownership of banks and industry, wider social benefits and subsidies to create jobs \u2014 measures anathema to Mr. Schmidt.And suddenly he was out, on a no-confidence vote in the Bundestag. On Oct. 1, 1982, Mr. Kohl, the Christian Democratic Party leader, replaced him. Mr. Schmidt was furious. Legislators, he said, had broken precedent by not waiting for a general election. \u201cYour conduct is legal, but it has no inner, no moral justification,\u201d he said in the Bundestag.The Christian Democrats blamed the Social Democrats for Mr. Schmidt\u2019s fall. \u201cNone of us spoke so insultingly about you as did some of your own people,\u201d one conservative politician said to him.The country\u2019s rightward shift was confirmed in 1983, when Mr. Kohl\u2019s conservative coalition trounced the Social Democrats in a general election.Mr. Schmidt\u2019s survivors include his daughter, Susanne, a television producer in London; and Ruth Loah, his longtime assistant, who was introduced as his companion in 2012. A son born in 1944, Helmut Walter, died in infancy.Asked to assess his successor, Mr. Kohl, he was characteristically withering. \u201cI think there are still two or three fields in which he still needs a lot of education,\u201d he told The Times. Asked which ones, he answered, \u201cInternational affairs, arms control and military strategy, and economics and finance.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year Mr. Schmidt was re-elected chancellor. It was 1980, not 1981.An earlier version of the caption for picture No. 11 in the accompanying slide show misspelled the given name of a former political leader in Germany. He is Helmut Kohl, not Helmet.An earlier version of this obituary contained an incorrect link. It was to an organ performance by the German actor and comedian Harald Schmidt, not to a piano performance by Helmut Schmidt.An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to a flood in Hamburg in 1962, when Mr. Schmidt was the city\u2019s interior minister. It was caused by hurricane-force winds that pushed water from the North Sea into the estuary of the Elbe River along the coast, not by heavy rains.Alison Smale and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World,\u2019 by Tim Whitmarsh", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser, beloved by generations of Columbia University students (including me), was known for lines of wit that yielded nuggets of insight. He kept up his instructive shtick until the end, remarking to a colleague shortly before he died: \u201cWhy is God making me suffer so much? Just because I don\u2019t believe in him?\u201d For Morgenbesser, nothing worth pondering, including disbelief, could be entirely de-\u00adparadoxed.The major thesis of Tim Whitmarsh\u2019s excellent \u201cBattling the Gods\u201d is that atheism \u2014 in all its nuanced varieties, even Morgenbesserian \u2014 isn\u2019t a product of the modern age but rather reaches back to early Western intellectual tradition in the ancient Greek world.The period that Whitmarsh covers is roughly 1,000 years, during which the Greek-speaking population emerged from illiteracy and anomie, became organized into independent city-states that spawned a high-achieving culture, were absorbed into the Macedonian Empire and then into the Roman Empire, and finally became Christianized. These momentous political shifts are efficiently traced, with astute commentary on their reflection in religious attitudes.But the best part of \u201cBattling the Gods\u201d is the Greek chorus of atheists themselves, who speak distinctively throughout each of the political transformations \u2014 until, that is, the last of them, when they go silent. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to contemporary atheists you might be startled by the familiarity of the ancient positions.So here is Democritus in the fifth century B.C. \u2014 he who coined the term \u201catom,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cindivisible,\u201d speculating that reality consisted of nothing but fundamental particles swirling randomly around in the void \u2014 propounding an anthropological theory of the origins of religious beliefs. Talk of \u201cthe gods,\u201d he argued, comes naturally to primitive people who, unable yet to grasp the laws of nature, resort to fantastical storytelling. The exact titles of his works remain in doubt, but his naturalist explanation of the origins of conventional religion might have made use of Daniel C. Dennett\u2019s title \u201cBreaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon.\u201dBut whereas Lucretius focused on the immorality of men when under their religious delusions, other ancients stressed the immorality of the gods themselves, who either passively permit or actively participate in human tragedies. The gods are not great. Euripides, toward the end of his life, composed \u201cThe Madness of Heracles,\u201d which has one character dressing down Zeus: \u201cYou are a stupid kind of god, or by nature you are unjust.\u201d Mortals morally overtake immortals, the gods being oblivious to what the virtuous know: the value of human life, the outrage of its guiltless suffering.And then there are those pre-\u00adSocratics, like Xenophanes and Anaxagoras, who, in my mind, foreshadow what would be Spinoza\u2019s special brand of atheism, identifying God with nature \u2014 or, more specifically, the intelligible structure of nature expressed in unchangeable laws. \u201cXenophanes, then, was not an atheist in any straightforward sense,\u201d Whitmarsh writes. \u201cHe was not denying the existence of deity but radically redefining it.\u201d The author goes on to ask whether anything would be lost \u201cin Xenophanes\u2019 account of the world if we substituted \u2018nature\u2019 for \u2018the one god.\u2019\u200a\u201d Such a redefinition reappears not only in Spinoza\u2019s magnum opus, the posthumously published Ethics, but in those who studied Spinoza, including Einstein. When asked whether he believed in God, Einstein responded, \u201cI believe in Spinoza\u2019s God,\u201d which amounted to an affirmation of the guiding principle of science, namely nature\u2019s beautiful intelligibility.But where, among the ancient Greeks, did I catch the strains of Sidney Morgenbesser? Not surprisingly, it was in a play by the comic poet Aristophanes, who, like Euripides, was an Athenian of the fifth century B.C. In the opening scene of \u201cKnights,\u201d two slaves are complaining about another overbearing slave. How can they evade him? One suggests they go to the statue of some god and prostrate themselves, which calls forth a disdainful reaction from the other: Do you really believe in gods? What\u2019s your proof? \u201cThe fact that I\u2019m cursed by them,\u201d comes the response. I can well imagine Sidney in the role.Ancient Greece was full of myths, and we are full of myths about ancient Greece. One of these is that Greece was so replete with religion \u2014 for there were indeed religious rites accompanying almost every facet of public life \u2014 that it soaked through to the Greek view of both the physical and the moral spheres. This is demonstrably false. As Whitmarsh states, Greek religion was consistently silent on precisely those questions on which religion as we know it is most noisily insistent: \u201cAs a rule, Greek religion had very little to say about morality and the nature of the world.\u201d Scholars have all too often imposed the Abrahamic conception of religion onto the ancient Greek world, thereby failing to see how a secular worldview easily cohabited with frenetic religious activity.But if Greek religion didn\u2019t ponder the great moral and metaphysical questions, what was its point? Whitmarsh argues convincingly that Greek religion functioned mainly as an expression of civic engagement, both at the local level of the city-states, each of which had its own favored divinities and rites, and at the broader level of greater Hellenicity.The civic function of their religion left Greeks the intellectual space in which to exercise reason in pursuing ontological and normative questions, which led to the beginnings of both natural philosophy (later called science), devoted to puzzling out the nature of reality, and moral philosophy, devoted to puzzling out how we best ought to live. Both disciplines are necessary for a robust secularism; Whitmarsh shortchanges one of them, which results in some sentences that I would wish away from this admirable book, including: \u201cIn an advanced capitalist economy based on technological innovation, it has been necessary to claw intellectual and moral authority away from the clergy and reallocate it to the secular specialists in science and engineering.\u201dThank God, secular specialties aren\u2019t confined to science and engineering but also include moral philosophy, which, if it has stopped short of presuming the mantle of \u201cmoral authority,\u201d has nevertheless helped in the laborious process of expanding our moral intuitions.Or rather, don\u2019t thank God. Thank the Greeks.BATTLING THE GODSAtheism in the Ancient WorldBy Tim Whitmarsh290 pp. Alfred A.

{"Headline": "An Irishman\u2019s Blazing Trail Into Japan\u2019s Racing Circles", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Japan CupAn estimated 100,000 people are expected to be on hand in the quiet Fuchu neighborhood of Tokyo on Sunday for the 35th running of the Japan Cup. But up in the owners\u2019 boxes of the modern, six-story Tokyo Racecourse, Harry Sweeney will stand out.The reason is not only because the 54-year-old Irish veterinarian was the first non-Japanese breeder and owner permitted to enter the country\u2019s once-closed racing society. And not only because he watched a horse he bred win the Japanese Derby on the same course. It\u2019s also because he simply makes himself heard.Sweeney\u2019s Japanese peers have never seen anyone like him. As his brother Finbarr, a farmer in the Sweeneys\u2019 native County Louth, joked, \u201cHarry says more than his prayers,\u201d using an Irish expression to describe his garrulous and jocular older brother.\u201cThey know that I\u2019m a straight-talker and if I don\u2019t like something, I\u2019ll say it,\u201d Harry Sweeney said, referring to the Japanese. \u201cThey\u2019re reasonably accepting of me \u2026 reasonably. I would say the respect I have for Japan is reciprocated towards me.\u201dSweeney is a trailblazer in the development of Japanese racing. And now in the last few years, some of the most deep-pocketed racing operations have begun venturing to Japan for its unique bloodlines and the world\u2019s largest purses.In 1990, Sweeney and his new wife, Anne, landed in the northern island of Hokkaido and intended on staying one year. They never left. The question of leaving now sounds ridiculous, he said.\u201cWhy would you leave?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an absolute racing utopia, but it\u2019s as close as you\u2019re going to get anywhere.\u201dFor Sweeney, Japan is the only place where the racing economics are balanced. The Japan Racing Association\u2019s average purse is $300,000 per race, which makes buying foals and yearlings a profitable enterprise, at least theoretically, unlike in most of Europe and the United States. The association also compensates owners if their horses suffer injuries on the racecourse or in training, and pays purse money to finishers through 10th place, in addition to an appearance fee of $4,000.Sweeney also said Japan has a passion for horse racing unmatched in other countries. Betting is a major part of that. Last year, nearly $30 billion was wagered on racing, or a fifth of the total bets worldwide.But there is more to Japan\u2019s racing scene than gambling. The best horses and jockeys occupy celebrity status.At the Japan Cup, fans sport hats bearing the names of past horses and clamor for autographs from their favorite jockeys. On Sunday, the best horses, whether male or female, will be competing for the $5.2 million purse, including the 5-year-old horse Lovely Day and the 3-year-old filly Mikko Queen.\u201cThere\u2019s no dodging here,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThe purpose of the calendar is to establish the best horses. It\u2019s true progeny testing.\u201dHe added that retiring the top 3-year-olds for immediate stallion careers \u2014 Golden Horn of England and the American Triple Crown winner American Pharoah are the latest examples \u2014 would be unacceptable in Japan. After Deep Impact, the 2005 Japanese Triple Crown winner, retired after his 4-year-old season, some still felt he should return for another year.Sweeney sometimes speaks to English-speaking audiences about the joys of Japanese racing and his path in it.His first move was to become the farm manager and veterinarian for Taiki Farm, in 1990. He was offered a salary six times larger than what he was making in Dublin, where the economy was in the dumps at the time. He and his wife expected it to be a short adventure.He was stationed in remote Tokachi on the island of Hokkaido. The closest English speaker was more than an hour\u2019s drive away, so learning Japanese was his primary task. \u201cI would wake up at 5 in the morning and study for an hour before work,\u201d he said. \u201cI did that for a number of years.\u201dAfter five years, Sweeney had enough confidence to move to a larger stable. Before long, he decided to open his own farm, called Paca Paca, which is Japanese for clip clop.No foreigner had ever owned agricultural land before. Sweeney said he needed the \u201cpatience of 100 saints\u201d to meet all the municipal government requirements. The same applied to obtaining a license from the Japanese Racing Association \u2014 no foreign owner had ever received one \u2014 and then joining the Hokkaido Breeders Association, where a friend tipped him off to a back-door route that sidestepped an informal \u201cJapanese only\u201d rule.Sweeney\u2019s perseverance quickly paid off. He started with three broodmares and now has 20, from England, France, Ireland, Japan and the United States. He added to his original 100 acres with an additional 450 acres of undulating fields, which he said are not unlike County Louth farmland. His first Group 1 winner, Pink Cameo, was Paca Paca\u2019s 36th foal.In 2012, the Paca Paca-bred Deep Brillante became Deep Impact\u2019s first son to win the Japanese Derby. Katsumi Yoshida, Japan\u2019s leading owner-breeder, had purchased Deep Brillante as a yearling for about $300,000. At the time of his victory, Sweeney had only bred 75 horses of racing age. Six weeks later, he had Deep Brillante\u2019s sister up for sale as a foal. She sold for $1.79 million.Sweeney\u2019s accomplishments stand out for a small breeder. He works with a small budget, canvassing American and European sales for broodmares who were successful on the track but at a cut below Grade or Group 1-winning status.It is no longer only in Japanese racing that Paca Paca is respected. At the two-day Japan Racing Association select sale in July, Sweeney sold two yearlings and eight foals for $2.09 million combined. WinStar Farm of Kentucky purchased a pair of Paca Paca foals, the first American stable to buy horses at the sale. Sweeney\u2019s top lot, a Deep Impact foal out of the United States stakes winner Payton d\u2019Oro, sold for $330,646, to the Irish bloodstock agent Mick Flanagan on behalf of a group of Americans.It was the most international auction Japan had ever seen, with buyers from Australia, England, France, Ireland, Qatar and the United States spending freely. Sweeney, for one, could take pride in that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan\u2019s Party in Turkey Regains Parliamentary Majority", "Date": "2015-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe result will permit Mr. Erdogan to remain the country\u2019s pre-eminent political figure while pushing the boundaries of the constitutional limits of the presidency, a largely ceremonial role.With 99 percent of the votes counted, according to the state broadcaster TRT, the Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., captured 49.3 percent of the popular vote, giving it a solid majority of 316 seats in Parliament.The outcome was also a spectacular upset given that most polls had predicted a result similar to June\u2019s national election, which had denied the A.K.P. a parliamentary majority for the first time in more than a decade.\u201cThe gamble has seemed to work,\u201d said Suat Kiniklioglu, the executive director of the Center for Strategic Communication, a research organization in Ankara. Mr. Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party who has become a sharp critic of his policies, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge success for the A.K.P.\u201dThe election, a reprise of June\u2019s vote, which failed to produce a coalition government after weeks of talks, came after five months of violence and political instability. Nigar Goksel, the Turkey analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the voting reflected \u201cthe yearning for stability and the end to this limbo.\u201dIn a victory speech from the balcony of the A.K.P.\u2019s headquarters in Ankara early Monday, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, \u201cLet\u2019s work together toward a Turkey where conflict, tension and polarization are nonexistent and everyone salutes each other in peace.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m calling on all parties entering Parliament to form a new civilian national constitution,\u201d a reference to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ambitions to concentrate more power in an executive presidency.The election results will return the country to single-party rule, and thus achieve a measure of stability by foreclosing the possibility of a fractious coalition, but it is unlikely to unite what has become a deeply polarized country, with roughly half of the population opposed to Mr. Erdogan and his party.The vote, though close, also affirmed the political rise of Turkey\u2019s long-oppressed Kurds: Once again the Kurdish-dominated Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or H.D.P., surpassed a 10 percent legal threshold to enter Parliament. But the H.D.P. saw its vote decline, to a little over 10 percent on Sunday from about 13 percent in June, as some religious Kurds seemed to switch to the A.K.P.Kurdish celebrations this time were tempered, though, partly because of the loss of votes and partly by the continuing war between the Turkish state and the militants of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K.And in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-majority city in Turkey, there were street protests as Kurds angry about the vote losses clashed with the police, who fired tear gas at the crowd, according to Reuters.In recent months, Turks have felt whipsawed, as they have watched their nation come to resemble the chaotic countries of the Middle East more than the model of Islamic democracy that many Turks thought their country to be.A decades-long war with Kurdish militants in the southeast resumed, killing hundreds. Two large-scale terrorist attacks blamed on the Islamic State, including the one in Ankara, killed more than 100 people. Turkey\u2019s once-booming economy, perhaps Mr. Erdogan\u2019s signature accomplishment, faltered, as did the Turkish lira, as investors fretted over the country\u2019s future.In seeking a comeback at the polls, Mr. Erdogan, who as president is supposed to be above partisan politics, and Mr. Davutoglu, the official head of the party, pushed a simple message: Invoking fears of the 1990s, a decade defined by shaky coalition governments and violence, they said a vote for them was a vote for stability.Mr. Erdogan, while casting his vote on Sunday in Uskudar, a conservative district on the Asian side of Istanbul where he owns a home, said, \u201cI hope our nation makes its choice for stability. We must all respect the result of the national will.\u201dFor Mr. Erdogan\u2019s core constituency of religious conservatives, and apparently many more this time around at polls, the message resonated.\u201cI will vote for the A.K.P. because in this environment of chaos we need a strong government,\u201d said Bertan Aydin, 28, a student and taxi driver in Istanbul, just before voting on Sunday. \u201cCoalition governments don\u2019t work. They will only drag us backward.\u201dVoter turnout was high \u2014 more than 85 percent cast ballots \u2014 despite Election Day coming at the end of a four-day holiday for Turkey\u2019s Republic Day.Many Turks were fatigued after so many elections \u2014 in addition to the June vote, last year Turks voted for president and for local municipalities \u2014 but they came out, nonetheless, hoping at the very least that the result would bring some stability.While the United States has long sought Turkey\u2019s help in fighting ISIS, getting its help has revealed a tangle of diverging interests in the region.\u201cAll the elections over the past year have brought the people against one another, and the country has become a war zone,\u201d said Zeynep Cetindemir, 46, a business consultant in Istanbul who voted for the main secular party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, or C.H.P. \u201cWe need to unite for peace.\u201dCicek Tuzmen, an architect who voted for the C.H.P. in Istanbul\u2019s Sariyer district, a secular stronghold, said, \u201cToday I\u2019m voting for peace. Peace and stability. That\u2019s all I hope for.\u201dWhile the election was hailed as historic by many analysts, it never held the possibility of a decisive transfer of power, as Mr. Erdogan\u2019s term as president does not expire until 2019, and it was a certainty that his party would still win the largest share of votes. Rather, the many opponents of the A.K.P. \u2014 roughly 60 percent of the country voted against the party in June \u2014 hoped the outcome would result in power sharing among Turkey\u2019s political parties and reduced power for Mr. Erdogan and the A.K.P.Instead, Sunday\u2019s vote secured the power of Mr. Erdogan and the A.K.P. for many more years, and those who were hoping to see the beginning of the end of an era were left stunned.\u201cI think we are all trying to digest it right now,\u201d Mr. Kiniklioglu said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what it means for the opposition and the rest of the country.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s rather shocking for many people.\u201dThe opposition to Mr. Erdogan, who in his early years in power counted on the support of many liberals, found its voice in widespread street protests in 2013 that at the time represented a serious challenge to his rule. A corruption scandal involving many in his inner circle erupted later that year, and many felt that they were witnessing the slow decline of the A.K.P.\u2019s power, a notion validated by the June election.Now, though, that trajectory \u2014 of the A.K.P. seeming to slowly lose its grip over Turkey \u2014 has been emphatically interrupted by Sunday\u2019s victory.\u201cIt seems that Erdogan\u2019s tactics of war and chaos have worked,\u201d said Can Yuksel, an activist who took part in the protests two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing because this result comes at the expense of freedom, rule of law and democracy.\u201dAn article on Nov. 2 about a stunning comeback by the Islamist party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in parliamentary elections misstated part of the name of a Kurdish-dominated party that surpassed a legal threshold of 10 percent of the vote to enter Parliament. It is the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, not the Peoples\u2019 Republic Party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paris Terror Attacks Leave Awful Realization: Another Massacre", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The night was chilly but thick with excitement as the big match between France\u2019s national soccer team and archrival Germany was underway at the national stadium in a northern suburb of Paris. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande watched with the crowd as the French players pushed the ball across midfield.The symmetry could not be more jarring. A Parisian year that began with the bloodshed and chaos of the terrorist attacks at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and later at a Jewish grocery now had an even deadlier coda: With events still fluid and exact details unclear, the authorities said more than 100 people had been killed in a series of attacks across Paris. And dozens of people were taken hostage at a Parisian theater.The urgent, bleating screech of sirens filled the evening air as police cruisers raced through the streets, uncertain if more mayhem was to come. Taxis ferried people home without charge as the police advised residents to stay inside. Ambulances screamed down the boulevards, as a stunned and confused French capital was again left to wonder: Why us? Once again?12 Photos\u201cParis has been hit again by terror tonight,\u201d Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman said on Twitter.For three days in January, Paris was gripped with fear as the police searched for Ch\u00e9rif and Sa\u00efd Kouachi after the two brothers attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices, a manhunt that ended with the Kouachis dying in a shootout. The terror only deepened when a third terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, attacked a Jewish grocery, killing customers, before the police stormed the building and killed him.Those attacks left France reeling for months, dredging up sadness and fury and horror. They also stirred a national debate over freedom of expression and the state of French Islam, a topic that has divided France like few others and seems certain to intensify now.The attackers\u2019 names, or whether they are linked to radical Islamist groups, are not yet known. But some witnesses described militants shouting \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic before opening fire.France was already in a foul temper, with the economy stagnant and far-right politicians stoking anti-immigrant sentiment, especially Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front. Ms. Le Pen has mocked Mr. Hollande as weak and stirred French nationalism by vowing to close borders. With regional elections scheduled for Dec. 16, Ms. Le Pen seems certain to keep rising in the polls.\u201cOf course Le Pen is going to capitalize on this,\u201d said Laurence Bagot, 45, a French entrepreneur. \u201cShe has already been using rhetoric like closing borders and increasing national security. Now that\u2019s actually happening.\u201dThe French authorities, sharply criticized for failing to monitor the homegrown jihadists who had been known to security officials, vowed to tighten scrutiny of suspected terror cells and protect the country. Ms. Bagot said the attacks seemed to occur after French security was lowered months after the Charlie Hebdo attacks.\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve created a monster, where the terrorists know better than our own security forces how to maneuver,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people are agile, young, have no morals and no limits.\u201dOn Friday night, the usual Parisian reverie was replaced by chaos.At the Stade de France, spectators described a sense of panic as the explosions shook the stadium and quickly undermined whatever confidence had returned in the months since the attack on the magazine.\u201cOf course I\u2019m afraid for the future,\u201d said Tony Vandelle, 31, who attended the France-Germany match with his brother. \u201cWith all the strikes in Syria, we\u2019re not safe anymore.\u201d\u201cAlready France was traumatized when Charlie Hebdo happened, including our children, who still talk about it at school,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is taking things to another level. To see something like this again so soon is frightening for the future.\u201dKarim Laruelle and his brother, Smaen, described hearing three explosions. \u201cIt sounded like firecrackers,\u201d Karim Laruelle said. \u201cWe did not really know what was happening until we started getting texts from our families telling us the shootings had happened elsewhere in Paris.\u201cThey wanted to know if we were safe.\u201dIt was a question that resonated in every corner of the city. At the junction of Folie-M\u00e9ricourt and Oberkampf, roughly 150 yards from the Bataclan theater, where a rock concert had become a hostage scene, the sound of shooting echoed from the direction of the theater: single shots followed by automatic fire and a series of loud bangs.Besides the assaults at the Bataclan and the stadium, the attackers chose several of Paris\u2019s busiest night life streets and intersections, including the Boulevard Voltaire, the Boulevard Beaumarchais and the Rue de Charonne.A man calling himself Leo, who lives near the Rue de Charonne, told Europe 1, a radio network, that his wife was among the first to help victims near the Petit Cambodge restaurant \u2014 describing the scene as a \u201cmassacre\u201d and \u201capocalyptic.\u201dHis wife told him that bodies were \u201clittered on the ground.\u201dAt the Bataclan, a reporter named Julien Pearce told Europe 1 that two men entered the theater with guns blazing.\u201cThe men shot at the audience, which lasted for about 10 minutes, with one shot lasting three or four seconds,\u201d he said. \u201cThey shot, recharged their guns, and shot again, even aiming at those already lying on the ground. I saw about 10 bodies lying on the ground, but couldn\u2019t tell whether they were injured or dead.\u201dThe day had begun with ominous warnings: bomb threats at the German soccer team\u2019s hotel and at Gare de Lyon, one of the city\u2019s train stations. Trains coming into the station were halted or rerouted as officers combed the building for explosives. The hotel was also searched. Time passed.Then the police reopened the station. It was a bomb scare. They happen fairly often in Paris. The city resumed its rhythms, unaware of what was to come.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Jim Yardley from Rome.

{"Headline": "The Key to Political Persuasion", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterIN business, everyone knows that if you want to persuade people to make a deal with you, you have to focus on what they value, not what you do. If you\u2019re trying to sell your car, you emphasize the features of the sale that appeal to the buyer (the reliability and reasonable price of the vehicle), not the ones that appeal to you (the influx of cash).In one study, we presented liberals and conservatives with one of two messages in support of same-sex marriage. One message emphasized the need for equal rights for same-sex couples. This is the sort of fairness-based message that liberals typically advance for same-sex marriage. It is framed in terms of a value \u2014 equality \u2014 that research has shown resonates more strongly among liberals than conservatives. The other message was designed to appeal to values of patriotism and group loyalty, which have been shown to resonate more with conservatives. (It argued that \u201csame-sex couples are proud and patriotic Americans\u201d who \u201ccontribute to the American economy and society.\u201d)Liberals showed the same support for same-sex marriage regardless of which message they encountered. But conservatives supported same-sex marriage significantly more if they read the patriotism message rather than the fairness one.In a parallel experiment, we targeted liberals for persuasion. We presented a group of liberals and conservatives with one of two messages in support of increased military spending. One message argued that we should \u201ctake pride in our military,\u201d which \u201cunifies us both at home and abroad.\u201d The other argued that military spending is necessary because, through the military, the poor and disadvantaged \u201ccan achieve equal standing,\u201d by ensuring they have \u201ca reliable salary and a future apart from the challenges of poverty and inequality.\u201dFor conservatives, it didn\u2019t matter which message they read; their support for military spending was the same. However, liberals expressed significantly greater support for increasing military spending if they read the fairness message rather than the patriotism one.If you\u2019re thinking that these reframed arguments don\u2019t sound like ones that conservatives and liberals would naturally be inclined to make, you\u2019re right. In an additional study, we asked liberals to write a persuasive argument in favor of same-sex marriage aimed at convincing conservatives \u2014 and we offered a cash prize to the participant who wrote the most persuasive message. Despite the financial incentive, just 9 percent of liberals made arguments that appealed to more conservative notions of morality, while 69 percent made arguments based on more liberal values.Conservatives were not much better. When asked to write an argument in favor of making English the official language of the United States that would be persuasive to liberals (with the same cash incentive), just 8 percent of conservatives appealed to liberal values, while 59 percent drew upon conservative values.Why do we find moral reframing so challenging? There are a number of reasons. You might find it off-putting to endorse values that you don\u2019t hold yourself. You might not see a link between your political positions and your audience\u2019s values. And you might not even know that your audience endorses different values from your own. But whatever the source of the gulf, it can be bridged with effort and consideration.Maybe reframing political arguments in terms of your audience\u2019s morality should be viewed less as an exercise in targeted, strategic persuasion, and more as an exercise in real, substantive perspective taking. To do it, you have to get into the heads of the people you\u2019d like to persuade, think about what they care about and make arguments that embrace their principles. If you can do that, it will show that you view those with whom you disagree not as enemies, but as people whose values are worth your consideration.Even if the arguments that you wind up making aren\u2019t those that you would find most appealing, you will have dignified the morality of your political rivals with your attention, which, if you think about it, is the least that we owe our fellow citizens.Robb Willer is a professor of sociology at Stanford.

{"Headline": "India Is Caught in a Climate Change Quandary", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneSpare a thought for poor India.India is home to 30 percent of the world\u2019s poorest, those living on less than $1.90 a day. Of the 1.3 billion Indians, 304 million do not have access to electricity; 92 million have no access to safe drinking water.And India is going to be hammered by climate change.The livelihoods of 600 million Indians are threatened by the expected disruption of the southwest monsoon from July to September, which accounts for 70 percent of India\u2019s rainfall. India\u2019s rivers depend on the health of thousands of Himalayan glaciers at risk of melting because of a warming climate, while 150 million people are at risk from storm surges associated with rising sea levels.A lot of damage is already inevitable, a consequence of the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by richer countries. So, many Indians ask, Why must we pay more? On what grounds can India be asked to temper its use of energy to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide?The successful resolution of this confrontation of priorities does not matter just for India\u2019s sake. The tension between economic development and the imperative to curb greenhouse gas emissions remains the central challenge of the diplomatic effort to muster a coalition of rich and poor countries to combat climate change.The United Nations expects India\u2019s population to reach 1.5 billion by 2030, bigger than China\u2019s. If over the next 15 years it follows anything like the fossil-fuel-heavy path out of poverty that China took over the last 15, it could blow any chance the world has of preventing a disaster.A critical question for anyone with a stake in preventing a climatic catastrophe is how to conceive and finance a development path for 1.5 billion Indians that prevents this outcome.After so many failed rounds of diplomacy, everyone involved is eager to declare the coming meeting a success. So far, 129 countries accounting for nearly 90 percent of greenhouse gas emissions have submitted plans to contribute to the cause.Advanced countries will offer absolute cuts in carbon emissions. But the less developed are expected only to reduce their emissions intensity \u2014 a measure of the carbon dioxide released to produce a certain amount of economic activity \u2014 in a recognition that their energy consumption still has a long way to grow.The new approach was necessary to achieve any progress. But it required putting the tough questions aside. Nearly as populous as China, yet way behind in terms of economic development, India presents one of the tougher ones.By most accounts, the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions must be brought close to zero by the end of the century, at the latest. This constrains everyone.To put it mildly, that is going to be a challenge.Jairam Ramesh, who was minister of the environment under the previous prime minister, Manmohan Singh, argues that India must continue to grow at 7.5 to 8 percent a year for the next 15 years.To power this growth, India\u2019s electricity consumption \u2014 which accounts for over half its greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 would rise 6 to 7 percent a year. Even under the most ambitious goals for nuclear power and renewable energy, more than half of this power is expected to come from coal, the dirtiest fuel. \u201cBy 2030 India\u2019s coal consumption could triple or quadruple,\u201d Mr. Ramesh told me.The plan, however, pointedly notes that India\u2019s energy consumption amounts to only 0.6 metric tons of oil equivalent per person, about a third of the world average. It explains that \u201cno country in the world\u201d has ever achieved the development level of today\u2019s advanced nations without consuming at least four tons.\u201cIndia has a lot to do to provide a dignified life to its population and meet their rightful aspirations,\u201d it states.Some analysts say there is a way to thread the needle. Development can be decoupled from carbon emissions, the World Bank insists.\u201cThe goals are extremely ambitious; only a minority of scenarios get us there,\u201d said Stephane Hallegatte, who led the study. \u201cBut they are achievable.\u201dUnder the right set of policies, the World Bank projects, even the most disruptive climate change would add only three million people to India\u2019s extreme poor in 2030. Bad choices, by contrast, would add 42 million to that number.Some in India seem convinced by the logic. \u201cOur traditional defensive stance has simply not been in the enlightened national interest,\u201d Mr. Ramesh argued in an address last year to the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore.\u201cIndia must view the era of the green economy not as a threat to its developmental plans,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it must be viewed as an opportunity to build and demonstrate technological capability to the world.\u201dAnd yet, there is still a significant risk that India will say no to the West\u2019s climate change agenda. \u201cIt plays hugely well domestically,\u201d Mr. Ramesh told me. \u201cOne should never discount that possibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Anticorruption Plea in Kenya: \u2018Please, Just Steal a Little\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 When it comes to honesty, politicians here don\u2019t usually win many awards.But even for Kenyans, who have witnessed countless corruption scandals over the years, the graft coming to light now is almost too outrageous to believe.This week, a parliamentary committee was given a document detailing millions of dollars that disappeared through some very curious government spending. It included thousands of dollars for simple condom dispensers and, apparently, $85 for ballpoint pens \u2014 that is, $85 each.\u201cA pen?\u201d said John Githongo, a leading anticorruption activist. \u201cMore than $80 on a single pen? Come on, this is the biggest bunch of crooks to ever run a government in this part of Africa. This is literally the rape of the country, everything from the poaching of our wildlife to the accumulation of debt at an extraordinary level.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s scandal after scandal,\u201d said Mr. Githongo, who was once a senior government anticorruption official but had to flee Kenya because of death threats. (He returned a few years later.) \u201cWe don\u2019t have a government. We have a scandal.\u201dPrices of staples are going up. The currency is tanking. Kenya, historically considered one of the most stable and strategically important nations in Africa, is going deeper and deeper into debt.Just a few months ago, the government refused to give public schoolteachers a court-ordered raise, saying it had no money, which resulted in an acrimonious strike with children out of class for weeks.At the same time, the daily newspapers are filled with allegations against ministers and high-ranking officials accused of everything from trying to steal playground land from a primary school to skimming millions off a pipeline contract.\u201cCan you imagine? We pay taxes, I can barely afford flour, and now this?\u201d said Boniface Wanyama Wekesa, a security guard, looking at a front-page article on Wednesday about the $85 pens. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to steal,\u201d he said, echoing the famous words of Mobutu Sese Seko, the former dictator of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), \u201cplease, just steal a little.\u201dThe implicated officials have denied any wrongdoing. Manoah Esipisu, a government spokesman, said in a text that \u201callegations are being investigated.\u201d\u201cIn Kenya,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe believe in our institutions. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission; director of public prosecutions, judiciary, etc.\u201dKenya is a vital Western ally, home to a large Western intelligence community and several Western military bases, overt and covert. It is seen as a reliable bulwark in the battle against the Islamist extremism that troubles neighbors like Somalia. The United States has a tricky line to walk here, because while it needs the Kenyan government\u2019s cooperation for counterterrorism operations, it does not want to be silent on runaway graft.The United States announced a joint anticorruption commitment with Kenya and recently pledged more than $1 million to set up a specialized Kenyan investigative unit to uncover public corruption connected to transnational crime. The American ambassador to Kenya, Robert F. Godec, said Wednesday, \u201cThe United States is deeply concerned by recent allegations of corruption and the misuse of public funds.\u201dBut the West seems to be banging its head against a wall. Activists say that Kenya\u2019s corruption is only getting worse and that the West needs to say less and do more, like denying visas to any Kenyan official accused of stealing public money. Kenya, after all, is still a poor country where many people don\u2019t have clean water to drink or access to electricity. It is not a stretch to say that many lives are made much harder \u2014 or even lost \u2014 because of all the stolen money.But today\u2019s apparent looting spree seems more blatant and desperate, and there may be a few reasons. Already, analysts said, Kenyan politicians are trying to build war chests for the national elections in 2017. The economy is also growing fast, making real estate in Nairobi, the capital, suddenly incredibly valuable, leading to illegal land grabs by those in power.But Mr. Githongo said it went even deeper than that. He pointed to the fact that Kenya\u2019s two top leaders came into office in 2013 under a cloud, having been indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity tied to the violence that broke out after the disputed 2007 election. President Uhuru Kenyatta was eventually cleared, though the case against the vice president, William Ruto, continues.\u201cThis has a major existential impact,\u201d Mr. Githongo said. \u201cIt creates a bohemian, permissive atmosphere from the very top to the bottom. People at all levels of government are saying, \u2018If our leaders can get away with it, why not us?\u2019 \u201dAn article last Thursday about an extraordinary rise in public corruption in Kenya, no stranger to graft, erroneously included remarks attributed to Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president, saying that Kenyans were thieves and telling his countrymen to be on alert when visiting Kenya so as not to catch \u201cthat disease.\u201d The Spectator, a Kenyan newsmagazine that published the remarks, said last week that they had been fabricated, and were intended as satire. videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Report on Climate Change Depicts Somber Scenarios", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.It presents global warming as squeezing China from two fronts: the environmental hazards and the international response.To ward off those international demands, one section of the report urges Beijing to be more flexible in negotiations, where China\u2019s dual status as a huge developing economy and the biggest polluter has generated friction with the European Union and the United States and other countries that want firmer commitments for when its greenhouse-gas output will start to fall.\u201cNew arrangements in global climate governance are unavoidable,\u201d the report says. \u201cChina should confront the vagueness of its role and change.\u201d\u201cThere is an unavoidable trend for all countries to participate in emissions cuts, and for the major developing countries to shoulder larger emissions-reduction responsibilities,\u201d the report said. \u201cChina must fully prepare for this.\u201dThe report acknowledges disagreement among policy advisers over how many years China\u2019s emissions will keep growing before they level off.China\u2019s current goals try to reduce the carbon-dioxide pollution released for each unit of economic growth. That means that emissions still grow, but more slowly than the economy, and there is no absolute ceiling on those emissions.\u201cIt\u2019s precisely because of the uncertainties that we need controls,\u201d Professor He said. \u201cWithout a goal, your future emissions might be even higher.\u201d Yet even if China and other big powers agreed to stringent cuts in greenhouse gases, the effects of climate change are already coursing through the environment. The report urges more spending on preparing to cope with increasingly frequent and extreme droughts, floods and heat waves.\u201cClimate change will make the urban conurbations along the coast the regions most affected by climate change nationwide,\u201d it says. \u201cSome cities may even face risks of massive disasters that are hard to forecast.\u201d While there is much debate about the extent of future rises, the report cites projections that, by the end of this century, the sea off eastern China could rise between 16 and 24 inches, or 40 and 60 centimeters, compared to 20th-century averages, exposing cities like Shanghai and nearby areas to tidal inundations and more severe damage from storms and typhoons. Some projections are even higher.Inland China will experience major shifts in rain and snowfall, which will reshape agriculture. Although global warming can conjure up images of advancing deserts, rising temperatures also mean air absorbs more moisture, which is then likely to be dumped in increasingly erratic rainfall, especially in northern China. Overall, the report says, China\u2019s water resources, already strained, could shrink by 5 percent by midcentury because of climate change.That will demand major changes in farming, and could strain the Three Gorges Dam, one of the world\u2019s largest, says the report. Changing rainfall patterns will eventually mean that the dam endures more frequent shortfalls in dry seasons and more intense floods in wet seasons. This will be \u201cextremely detrimental to reservoir management, dam safety and flood prevention,\u201d says the report.Across Tibet and other high-altitude regions of western China, glaciers have been retreating, as has permafrost: the layer of earth below the surface that remains frozen throughout the year. China\u2019s glaciers shrank by 10 percent between the 1970s and the early 2000s, and the permafrost had retreated by about 26 percent by 2012, says the report.The risks to China from these changes are not only environmental or economic; one section of the report is devoted to the national security implications. Rising temperatures will first accelerate glacier melting, increasing river flows, but from about midcentury those flows could tail off, said Professor Zhang of Peking University, who helped write that section.\u201cThe shrinking of river flows caused by the melting away of glaciers in western China may lead to struggles over cross-border water resources and surges of transnational migration, triggering international disputes and conflict,\u201d according to the report. \u201cOverall, climate change could have a broad impact on China\u2019s national security, but for now that is mainly latent.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Chicagonomics\u2019 and \u2018Economics Rules\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe believed that government had a crucial role to play in a well-functioning economy. It should finance and run good schools, as well as build roads, bridges and parks, he argued. It should tax alcohol, sugar and tobacco, all of which impose costs on society. It should regulate businesses to protect workers. And it should tax the rich \u2014 who suffer from \u201cindolence and vanity\u201d \u2014 to help the poor.Which leftist economist was this? None other than Adam Smith, the inventor of the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d and the icon of \u00adlaissez-faire economics today. Smith\u2019s modern reputation is a caricature. He was a giant of the Enlightenment in large part because he was a careful and nuanced thinker. He certainly believed that a market economy was a powerful force for good. The exchange of goods and services, as he explained, could lift living standards and free 18th-century Europeans from the tight strictures of tradition and government. Yet he did not have a religious faith in the market. Smith was a classical liberal, in the European sense of the word, who emphasized the essential equality among human beings.Lanny Ebenstein\u2019s mission, in \u201cChicagonomics,\u201d is to rescue not only Smith from his caricature but also some of Smith\u2019s modern-day acolytes: the economists who built the so-called Chicago school of economics, chief among them Milton \u00adFriedman. From their home base at the University of Chicago, these economists became influential around the world. They provided much of the intellectual ballast for the free-market revolution of the late 20th century. They advised Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, became gurus to reformers in post-Communist Eastern Europe and elsewhere and inspired others in China, India and the rest of Asia.As the list of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s makes clear, Friedman and his allies were politically conservative, pushing against state control of industry much as Smith had. But Ebenstein argues that the message of the Chicago school has nonetheless been perverted in recent years. Many members of the Chicago school subscribed to \u201cclassical liberalism,\u201d in Ebenstein\u2019s preferred term, rather than \u201ccontemporary libertarianism.\u201d Classical liberalism manages to grasp two different ideas: The state\u2019s economic role can \u2014 and often has \u2014 \u00adbecome too large, but that does not mean its role should be as small as possible. Indeed, the state can become marginalized to the point of undermining the larger goals that Smith, Friedman and others championed, including freedom, prosperity and equality.Ebenstein, the son of a political scientist who taught briefly at the University of Chicago, has written 10 books on economic and political history, including biographies of Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. With this book, he joins a group of detractors of modern-day American conservatism who are sympathetic to many of the ideas of conservatism but harshly critical of how it is now practiced.\u201cContemporary libertarianism too often denotes cranky obscurantism, intolerance, irrelevance and, frankly, poor scholarship and the manipulation of data, although these are not always the case or unique to it,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere is no reason to compromise on anything. They are utopians working toward and often living in a mythical land, \u2018Libertania.\u2019\u200a\u201d Anyone who watched the House Republicans devour their own leaders \u2014 and prevent Congress from functioning \u2014 will recognize the description.The radicalization and nihilism of much of modern American conservatism is worrisome for many reasons, not least the important role that actual conservatism has played in recent decades and could play today. Friedman, after all, was a deeply creative thinker who shaped numerous policy successes, as did many of his brethren. (Although, Ebenstein notes, Friedman himself tilted toward zealotry in his later years.) The rise of market economies in Asia has led to perhaps the most rapid and widespread decline in poverty in human history. Friedman also argued for the end to the military draft, for flexible currency exchange rates and for a negative income tax to combat poverty, which became the earned-income tax credit.Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economics professor, has written a much less political book than Ebenstein has, titled \u201cEconomics Rules,\u201d in which he sets out to explain the discipline to outsiders (and does a nice job). Yet in surveying the larger \u201crights and wrongs\u201d of economics, to quote his subtitle, Rodrik has diagnosed the central mistake that contemporary libertarians have made: They have conflated ideas that often make sense with those that always make sense.Some of this confusion is deliberate. By pushing for less government, regardless of the situation, contemporary libertarians act as a kind of lobbyist working on behalf of the affluent. Less government tends to mean lower taxes for the people with the most money to lose to taxes. Less government also means cuts to schools, and health-insurance and retirement programs on which the affluent do not depend.\u201cWhat are economic models?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe easiest way to understand them is as simplifications designed to show how specific mechanisms work by isolating them from other, confounding effects. A model focuses on particular causes and seeks to show how they work their effects through the system.\u201d A fable, similarly, trades complexity and comprehensiveness for a clear but still true lesson.The trouble comes when economists \u2014 and the rest of us \u2014 try to make such a lesson universal. Universality has its place in the physical sciences but rarely in the social sciences. \u201cWe cannot look to economics for universal explanations or prescriptions that apply regardless of context,\u201d Rodrik writes. \u201cThe possibilities of social life are too diverse to be squeezed into unique frameworks.\u201dThe lure of universality is not a uniquely right-wing phenomenon, of course. The left and center suffer from it, too. Liberals, for instance, can slip from believing that government is often necessary into believing that it is inherently effective \u2014 and defend public schools and anti-poverty programs that ill serve the poor. Centrists sometimes leap from the reasonable judgment that neither political party has a monopoly on the truth to the unreasonable one that the truth on any one issue lies roughly halfway between the extremes.That last point has a particular relevance to modern American politics, and to the problems Ebenstein describes. While all political ideologies (not to mention all human beings) are susceptible to overlearning a lesson, the damages from that mistake come mostly from the right half of the spectrum in the United States today. The political right has spent five years wrongly predicting hyperinflation and, in the process, kept the federal government from doing more to combat unemployment. There are similar stories about climate policy, tax policy, health care and even voting rights and voter fraud.Reducing complex issues to their essence is unavoidable. The alternative is an often paralyzing level of detail. Rodrik cites a story by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, \u201cOn Exactitude in Science,\u201d about a mythical empire in which the mapmakers could not tolerate any oversimplification. Ultimately, they created a map as large as the empire itself, which is no more useful than a map consisting of a single tiny dot \u2014 or an economic philosophy that offers only one answer, no matter the question. As Rodrik says, quoting an adage often attributed to Einstein, \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201dCHICAGONOMICSThe Evolution of Chicago Free Market EconomicsBy Lanny EbensteinIllustrated. 278 pp. St. Martin\u2019s Press. $29.99.ECONOMICS RULESThe Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal ScienceBy Dani Rodrik253 pp. W.W.

{"Headline": "If Jobs Report Heralds a Solid Upturn, Democrats\u2019 Fortunes May Also Rise", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Friday\u2019s surprisingly robust jobs report cheered Democrats hoping to retain the White House and capture the Senate next year, but it heralded a new atmosphere of uncertainty by flashing a green light to the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which could undermine economic growth.\u201cWe finally may be seeing some wage acceleration, and if it sticks, that would be a very big story,\u201d the economist Jared Bernstein, a former adviser in the Obama White House, wrote on his blog. A more tangible economic upturn would almost certainly benefit Democrats, who want to keep the White House after two terms under a president who has struggled with a slow economic recovery. It could blunt Republicans\u2019 generalized demands for change, prompting them to focus on more granular issues, such as which party can better address wage growth and economic inequality.\u201cGood economic news for the country is bad political news for the Republicans, because it takes the air out of their argument that we need a big change from Obama\u2019s economic policies,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster working for Priorities USA, a super PAC supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton.But growth remains weak by historical standards, and much of the electorate has remained in a sour mood about the economy\u2019s ability to deliver fatter paychecks to anyone but the richest Americans.That disquiet has stoked the challenge of Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, against Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, and on the Republican side it has powered the campaigns of political outsiders such as Ben Carson against party-establishment favorites like Jeb Bush.Bill McInturff, the Republican half of a bipartisan polling team for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, sounded a cautious note about the jobs report. While consumer confidence\u00a0is at its highest level in years, he said, \u201cthis has done nothing\u00a0to lower the almost 12 straight years that a majority of Americans say they believe the country is headed off on the \u2018wrong track.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cIt is going to take a lot more than one positive jobs report to seriously dent the pessimism people feel about where the country is headed,\u201d he said.Caution is warranted: Economic indicators have risen and fallen throughout the 68 months of growth since the recession and financial collapse that President Obama inherited.The unemployment rate is less than half its 2009 peak, but these days the more consequential economic data for gauging the political climate may be wage growth. October\u2019s uptick in workers\u2019 earnings made the month\u2019s data encouraging, especially after the downbeat showing in September. \u201cThe now-closely watched hourly earnings data showed the largest year-over-year increase since July 2009 \u2014 up 2.5 percent,\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic adviser to Republicans and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, wrote after the jobs report was released. \u201cThis represents real wage growth, which has been a missing ingredient. The only nit to pick was flat average weekly hours.\u201dBut \u201cthe more interesting issue,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin added, \u201cis whether the strong October report represents a one-time blip in the aftermath of the weak August and September performance, or is an early sign of growth that will remain above the 2.2 percent average since the recovery began.\u201d There is a looming risk to continued growth: Interest rates are headed up.The strong jobs report has cleared the way for the Fed to begin a long-awaited retreat from its economic stimulus campaign. The central bank, which has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008, is expected to act at its final meeting of the year in December.The Fed does not want to stall growth, only to prevent the economy\u2019s overheating. It plans to raise rates more slowly than it has in past periods of growth. Officials expect to raise rates by roughly one percentage point over the next year.Even so, some liberal economists \u2014 including a minority of the Fed\u2019s own policy-making committee \u2014 warn that the central bank could undermine growth by raising rates prematurely. There is an old quip in economics that periods of growth never die of old age \u2014 they become recessions when the Fed increases interest rates.In both parties, candidates and voters have shifted from emphasizing overall growth and jobs to focusing on economic inequality and the woes of the middle class.But there are signs that Americans are starting to feel more confident about their own prospects, an important development because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of domestic economic activity.Consumer sentiment over the last year has been higher than in any year since 2004, the University of Michigan reported last week. More people are working and wages are starting to rise more quickly, and the survey found that people had increased confidence that their finances would improve over the next five years.\u201cThe most impressive aspect has been a newfound resilience by consumers to a host of negative developments,\u201d like the recent volatility of financial markets, said Richard Curtin, the chief economist for the Michigan Survey of Consumers.Will it last? Holding rates near zero has encouraged borrowing and risk-taking, supporting faster economic growth. As the Fed takes its foot off the gas, lenders may raise borrowing costs for businesses and consumers faster than the Fed would like.Since the financial crisis, every developed nation that has tried to raise interest rates has been forced to reverse course. Investors see about a one-in-five chance that the Fed, after it begins to raise rates, will return to zero within two years \u2014 implying that they expect higher rates to significantly undermine growth.Donald J. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, shares this bleak view. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bubble, and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said recently in New York. He suggested that the Fed was keeping rates low at the behest of the Obama administration, to postpone the crash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toyota Invests $1 Billion in Artificial Intelligence in U.S.", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 Silicon Valley is diving into artificial intelligence technology, with start-ups sprouting up and Google and Facebook pouring vast sums into projects that would teach machines how to learn and make decisions. Now Toyota wants a piece of the action.Conceived as a research facility bridging basic science and commercial engineering, it will be organized as a new company to be named Toyota Research Institute. Toyota will initially have a laboratory adjacent to Stanford University and another near M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass.Toyota\u2019s investment invites comparisons to earlier research initiatives, such as the Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, created by Xerox in 1970 to help the company compete with IBM. Xerox was never able to find a strategy to make it a significant player in computing, but the technologies invented at PARC during the next decade were used by Apple and Microsoft to completely remake the computer industry.The new effort by Toyota is also the latest indication of a changing of the guard in Silicon Valley\u2019s basic technology research. Last year, for example, Microsoft closed a satellite laboratory of its Microsoft Research division in Silicon Valley and laid off about 75 researchers.Corporate research done by Internet companies like Facebook and Google has generally focused on things that can be turned into a product or service, breaking with the traditions of industrial laboratories run by AT&T and IBM, which focused on basic science.International corporations like General Electric; Baidu, the Chinese search engine; Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate; and all the major automakers have been establishing research outposts in or near the region to take advantage of its engineering talent.Artificial intelligence technologies were disappointing for decades, but they have finally begun paying off, leading to systems such as Siri, the personal assistant from Apple, and rapid improvements in self-driving vehicle technology.And in recent years, there has been a rush to recruit talented researchers in so-called machine learning, many of them produced by Stanford and the nearby University of California, Berkeley. Toyota plans to hire 200 scientists for its artificial intelligence research center.\u201cThe density of people doing this kind of work in Silicon Valley is higher than any other place in the world,\u201d said Gill Pratt, a roboticist and former official at the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency, or Darpa, who will lead the new company.The new center will initially focus on artificial intelligence and robotics technologies and will explore how humans move both outdoors and indoors, including technologies intended to help the elderly.When the center begins operating in January, it will prioritize technologies that make driving safer for humans rather than completely replacing them. That approach is in stark contrast with existing research efforts being pursued by Google and Uber to create self-driving cars.\u201cWe want to create cars that are both safer and incredibly fun to drive,\u201d Dr. Pratt said. Rather than completely removing driving from the equation, he described a collection of sensors and software that will serve as a \u201cguardian angel,\u201d protecting human drivers.In September, when Dr. Pratt joined Toyota, the company announced an initial artificial intelligence research effort committing $50 million in funding to the computer science departments of both Stanford and M.I.T. He said the initiative was intended to turn one of the world\u2019s most successful carmakers into one of the world\u2019s top software developers.A similar challenge is now facing many of world\u2019s largest noncomputing technology companies. In September, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, predicted that the company would be \u201ca top 10 software company\u201d by 2020.In addition to the software engineers in each of its businesses that make jet engines, locomotives, power turbines, medical imaging equipment and other devices, the company now has more than 1,200 engineers at a specialized software center in San Ramon, Calif., just across San Francisco Bay from Silicon Valley.\u201cThere is a software layer over everything now,\u201d said John Zysman, a U.C. Berkeley political scientist and the co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. And that is a powerful magnet that continues to draw companies.By shifting its focus to include mobility for a rapidly aging population, Toyota is also acknowledging that demographic changes may soon affect traditional automotive markets.\u201cToyota has been a reasonable, conservative car company, so it is intriguing that they are making this move,\u201d said Jameson M. Wetmore, an associate professor at the School for the Future of Innovation in Society at Arizona State University. \u201cKids are getting their licenses later and the car companies are becoming concerned they don\u2019t have the place in society they once had.\u201dIn addition to focusing on navigation technologies, the new research corporation will also apply artificial intelligence technologies to Toyota\u2019s factory automation systems, Dr. Pratt said.The company describes its manufacturing system as the Toyota Production Systems.\u201cAs extraordinary as the T.P.S. is, we believe it can be improved still further through the use of more data and more A.I.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may also be advances in robot perception, planning, collaboration, and electromechanical design from T.R.I. that will translate into improvements in manufacturing robotics.\u201dDr. Pratt said he began his career as a research scientist at Bell Laboratories and was influenced by his time there.Before coming to Darpa, where he was responsible for the agency\u2019s most recent contest for building robots capable of working in hazardous environments, he was known for his earlier research at M.I.T., where he pioneered so-called collaborative technologies making it safer for humans to work near robots.Steve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Calls for Closing of Coal-Fired Power Plants by 2025", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government on Wednesday called for the closing of all coal-fired power plants in the country by 2025, and proposed that use of the plants be restricted two years before that.The commission also forecast that by 2020, Europe would be able to increase to 20 percent from roughly 12 percent the share of energy it consumes from renewable sources like the sun and wind. But the report cautioned that some countries, including Britain, \u201cneed to assess whether their policies and tools are efficient and effective\u201d in raising the use of renewable forms of energy.Analysts say the proposal to close coal-fired power stations could also put pressure on Britain\u2019s electricity providers and on its electricity grid, which has recently shown signs of strain.The government will publish its detailed proposals in the spring, she said. Britain would only close the coal plants if the government believed that a shift to other methods of creating energy could be achieved.\u201cIf we take this step,\u201d she said, \u201cwe will be one of the first developed countries to deliver on a commitment to take coal off the system.\u201dSince becoming Britain\u2019s energy and climate change minister this year, Ms. Rudd has shaken up energy policy, cutting back subsidies for renewable forms of energy like wind and solar, arguing that these technologies needed to be more cost-effective.Coal use in Britain is in decline as utilities close aging plants, but more than 20 percent of the country\u2019s electricity was still being generated from the fuel in the second quarter of this year. By comparison, just over 30 percent of British electricity came from natural gas, 25.3 percent from renewables and 21.5 percent from nuclear plants.Analysts say that most British coal plants are likely to be shut by the mid-2020s anyway, but they add that forcing the closing of all coal plants within a decade could be too hasty. Earlier, Britain announced plans to build new nuclear plants, but the first is not scheduled to begin operating until 2025. Utilities are also no longer investing in natural gas-fired power plants because of their expense.\u201cThis is a lot of posturing ahead of Paris,\u201d said Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, referring to the climate conference. \u201cGiven that new nuclear is delayed, no one is building new gas,\u201d and the urgency to get rid of the rest of Britain\u2019s coal plants \u201cappears premature,\u201d she said.Utility executives say that coal remains a reliable, flexible source of power at a time when the electric grid is moving toward greater reliance on sources like wind and solar, which at present are much less reliable than coal. The contributions from wind and solar energy still vary with wind speeds and the amount of sunlight available.In a sign that the British electrical grid is under some strain, electricity prices spiked briefly this month. National Grid, which operates the system, asked electricity generators to provide more power while requesting industrial users to cut back on consumption.Speaking in London on Wednesday to an organization of civil engineers, Ms. Rudd said that Britain should be using natural gas instead of coal to generate electricity because gas burns cleaner than coal. With the decline in production of oil from the North Sea, she added, Britain may need to get 75 percent of its natural gas from other countries by 2030, compared with the roughly half that it now imports.Britain, she said, should be encouraging the building of gas-fired power plants and the exploitation of shale gas, which has been largely stymied by environmental activists and local opposition. She also said that the coal plants would be closed only when the government was convinced that the country could shift effectively to generating gas.Dieter Helm, a professor of energy politics at the University of Oxford, said that Ms. Rudd was correct to be targeting coal.\u201cIf you are serious about climate change, the first thing to do is get out of coal,\u201d he said in an interview. From this perspective, he said, Britain appears to be more serious about tackling climate change than is Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China, Japan and South Korea Pledge to Expand Trade at Joint Meeting", "Date": "2015-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis summit meeting carries a historic significance because it restores a system of cooperation among the three countries, which in turn is an important frame of peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia,\u201d Ms. Park said during a joint news conference with the two other leaders.During their talks, held at Ms. Park\u2019s presidential headquarters, the Blue House, the three appeared to have skirted their countries\u2019 territorial and other thorny disputes, with their joint statement saying they would work for regional peace and stability \u201cin the spirit of marching to the future while looking squarely at the history.\u201dThey also produced widely expected pledges to stay committed to ending North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons ambitions and to add momentum to efforts to negotiate a trilateral free trade agreement, a new engine for joint economic advancement. They also agreed to meet again next year, in Tokyo, in a continuation of discussions that were suspended for three years because of political tensions between Japan and the other two.Even before the three leaders met on Sunday, few analysts expected any major deal to emerge. But their discussions reflected the fact that their countries, which are among the world\u2019s largest economies, rely on one another for badly needed growth, despite the persistence of animosities rooted in Japan\u2019s colonial aggression in the early 20th century.Mr. Li came close to calling Mr. Abe to task during the news conference. Without mentioning Japan by name, he said that the three countries needed to \u201cheighten mutual political trust\u201d and that \u201cmutual trust is conditioned on a mutual understanding of historical and other important issues.\u201d He said that Beijing did not want its trilateral and bilateral ties with the others to be disrupted again.Leaders of the three neighbors held five annual trilateral meetings between 2008 and 2012, but those ended after Mr. Abe took office in late 2012. Tokyo\u2019s relations with Seoul and Beijing, already frosty because of territorial disputes over islands and conflicting interpretations of wartime history, chilled further after the Japanese leader visited or sent offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where war criminals, as well as other war dead, are honored.Mr. Abe\u2019s insistence that there was no proof that Japan\u2019s military systematically forced Korean and other Asian women to serve as sex slaves during World War II so angered South Koreans that Ms. Park has refused to meet with him one on one. She has met with Mr. Li and President Xi Jinping of China several times since taking office in early 2013.Mr. Abe was traveling with no compromise on historical issues, South Korean officials said. The rift between him and Ms. Park remained so wide, especially over the sex slaves, known euphemistically as comfort women, that South Korea decided not to hold a state banquet for him, an honor it gave Mr. Li on Saturday, when he discussed trade and other ties with Ms. Park and South Korean business leaders.Washington has repeatedly asked Japan and South Korea, its key allies in Northeast Asia, to mend ties to cope with China\u2019s growing regional influence.Mr. Abe\u2019s arrival in Seoul came as many Japanese accuse Ms. Park of taking South Korea too close to China, to the detriment of the regional security partnership linking Japan, South Korea and the United States. South Korea recently completed a free-trade agreement with China, already its biggest trading partner.Also Sunday, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter of the United States visited the buffer zone separating North and South Korea, highlighting the American commitment to defend South Korea from what he called a \u201cnotoriously unpredictable\u201d North Korea, an ally of China. Mr. Carter was on a trip to Seoul for annual defense talks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Paris Attacks, Waiting for Shopping and Culture to Come Back to Life", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Monday, a gray and windy day here, there was not the usual long line outside the Abercrombie & Fitch store. Instead a guard beckoned in the occasional customer. Nearby, dozens of stalls in the Christmas market remained closed by official order, leaving the small merchants unable to sell their spiced wine, beer and sausages, or wares like clothes and ornaments.Though holiday shopping might seem a minor consideration compared with the loss of life, activity in the coming days on the French capital\u2019s most famous shopping street could be an indicator of whether the attacks have dealt a blow to the city\u2019s commerce and the country\u2019s effort to achieve a sustained economic recovery.European leaders, along with President Obama, have identified the threat from the Islamic State group as broader than a French risk, raising concern of a wider economic impact if fear keeps people from wanting to travel or to gather in holiday crowds. It is already a bad time for the eurozone economy, which has been plagued for years by slow growth and high unemployment.How lasting the effect will be on the Paris economy or beyond, once the initial shock has faded, is difficult to predict. Typically, economists say, the commercial impact of terrorist attacks tends to be minor and temporary. That was the case after attacks in London in 2005, in Madrid in 2004, and even in New York in 2001.\u201cSo probably we\u2019ll see the same in France,\u201d said Philippe Waechter, research director at Natixis Asset Management. \u201cMaybe in the first few weeks, when you go to shopping malls and things like that, maybe we\u2019ll find that people are a little shy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after that, people will go through a sort of normalization.\u201dYet, because this is also the start of what is traditionally a significant tourist season for Paris and other parts of France and Europe, much will depend not only on local psychology but also on the willingness of visitors to set worries aside.\u201cIf people don\u2019t come, if the tourists are too scared, there will be big economic repercussions for everyone,\u201d said a Frenchwoman named Mauricette, who declined to give her last name as she directed workmen repairing her shuttered stall in the Christmas market. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m just hoping to cover my costs, never mind making a profit.\u201dIn the short term, the terrorism in Paris has chilled consumer spending in the French capital, essentially shutting down much of the city\u2019s retail business for most of the weekend. Disneyland Paris remained closed and was not set to reopen until Wednesday. The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower reopened to the public Monday afternoon after being closed for two days because of security measures.Several concerts scheduled to take place in Paris were canceled after terrorists stormed the Bataclan concert hall and slaughtered 89 people who were listening to a rock band. Performances by the bands Marilyn Manson and Papa Roach scheduled for Monday night were called off, and the musician Prince suspended his planned European tour and a Paris concert in December. Producers have also temporarily halted performances of a French comedy musical, \u201cR\u00e9siste.\u201dOn Monday, the French culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, announced plans for a special government fund to help theaters cope with financial losses stemming from the impact of the terrorist attacks and the costs of increased security.\u201cEverything will be done so that music remains alive in our country,\u201d Ms. Pellerin said. \u201cCulture is our greatest shield, and our artists are our best weapon.\u201dAlthough European stock markets opened lower on Monday, led down by the main French index, the CAC 40 in Paris, by late afternoon, the European indexes were all flat or in slightly positive territory.French companies catering to travel and tourism were taking a hit, though. Shares of Air France-KLM were down about 6 percent through the late afternoon, and the French group AccorHotel\u2019s stock was off by more than 5 percent.Luxury-hotel executives and a French trade association of hotels and restaurants on Monday reported a wave of reservation cancellations. The Regional Tourism Committee for Paris announced a plan to convene a conference on Wednesday to assess the potential economic impact with representatives from museums, hotels, amusement parks and department stores.Worried about a drop in customers, a trade union of hotels and restaurants is calling on Parisians to head to their neighborhood haunts Tuesday night to observe a minute of silence for the victims and then to support local merchants with a campaign called \u201cTous au Bistrot!\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201ceverybody to the bistro!\u201dTourism represents about 8 percent of the French economy. If fear of additional attacks keeps foreign visitors away and makes households reluctant to spend, those sectors and the tens of thousands of jobs related to them will suffer.On Monday, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency said that the annual rate of inflation in the eurozone in October was 0.1 percent, a sign of a weak economy \u2014 even if the number was higher than in September, when consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 0.1 percent.In terms of growth, the eurozone economy expanded at a meager annual rate of 1.2 percent during the third quarter, and total economic output is still lower than it was in 2007, before the beginning of the financial crisis.Expectations that the European Central Bank will step up its stimulus to the eurozone economy when it meets next month have been further solidified by the Paris attacks.\u201cIt compounds all the problems that we were already facing,\u201d Vitor Const\u00e2ncio, vice president of the European Central Bank, said on Monday after a speech in Frankfurt. The attacks could have a psychological effect, he said, adding that would depend on any further consequences.It might be too much to expect Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, to mimic former President George W. Bush, who after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States famously called on Americans to \u201cgo out shopping more.\u201d But Mr. Waechter, at Natixis Asset Management, predicted that Parisians, who have been living with the risk of terrorist attacks since at least the 1980s, would prove as resilient as New Yorkers.The weekend attacks, though, killing more than 100, seemed aimed at making no one feel safe anywhere \u2014 at a sporting event, at a rock concert, at a cafe. That factor could make the near-term consumer psychology harder to predict, not only in Paris, but also across Europe.One barometer may be the outdoor Christmas markets, a tradition throughout Europe. Such markets in German cities like Nuremberg and Dresden, which have two of the oldest, attract huge crowds to drink mulled wine or browse among stands selling items like wooden tree ornaments or handmade mittens.The markets have been threatened by terrorists in the past but still drew crowds, said Werner Hammerschmidt, executive director of a group that represents businesses that sell food and gifts at Christmas markets.\u201cThere have been threats for years,\u201d Mr. Hammerschmidt said. \u201cPeople have shown they won\u2019t let their lives be influenced by terrorists. I suspect that will be the case this time.\u201dAt least one French celebrity, the singer Shy\u2019m, insisted this week that the show must go on. She has concerts scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday nights in Paris, at the AccorHotels Arena, an indoor sports venue and concert hall. The hall is in the 12th arrondissement, not far from where at least five of Friday night\u2019s attacks took place and where the Charlie Hebdo massacre occurred in January.\u201cAfter much reflection, doubt and fear, but above all a powerful and profound need to respond, to respond to fear, I decided to go on stage,\u201d she wrote in a post on her Facebook page on Sunday evening. \u201cWhat has happened to France and humanity is unspeakable and unbearable, but it is out of the question to hole up and stay silent.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously included one Paris tourist attraction among those that reopened to the public on Monday. The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower did so; the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, which is routinely closed on Mondays, did not.David Jolly and Doreen Carvajal reported from Paris, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paris Deal Would Herald an Important First Step on Climate Change", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Obama and more than 100 world leaders will convene with thousands of diplomats on Monday on the outskirts of Paris to open two weeks of intense negotiations aimed at forging an accord that could begin to avert the most devastating effects of global warming and redefine the economy of the 21st century.Here is a guide to what is at stake. If the talks fail \u2014 as they did in two previous attempts to achieve such a deal \u2014 then nations will continue on a trajectory that scientists say locks the planet into a future of rising sea levels, more frequent floods, worsening droughts, food and water shortages, destructive hurricanes and other catastrophic events.Still, veterans of two decades of United Nations climate change negotiations say there is reason to think that the Paris summit meeting could be different from previous efforts, and yield a deal that could stave off the more destructive effects of warming.\u201cThe stage is set for the possibility of getting this right, but on the other hand there are all these wrinkles and hurdles at the last minute,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said in an interview last week.If you are thinking you have seen this before, you are right. Since 1992, United Nations negotiators have held annual summit meetings aimed at drafting a global climate change treaty. They came close to a deal twice.Since then, more than 170 countries, representing more than 90 percent of global carbon emissions, have put forth proposals to reduce emissions. Those plans, expected to form the core of a new agreement, represent a major change from the usual brinkmanship of climate negotiations.The objective of climate change policy is to curb greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid a global average temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Beyond that threshold, scientists say, there will be devastating effects. Research shows the globe has already warmed about 1.7 degrees since the Industrial Revolution.Still, that would count as progress. Without the Paris climate policies, scientists say, the planet is headed toward a far more destructive temperature increase of more than 8 degrees Fahrenheit.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cThe national plans will not put us on the path to lower temperatures enough, but they will bend the temperature curve,\u201d said Janos Pasztor, the United Nations assistant secretary general for climate change. \u201cWhile it is significant progress, it is not the endpoint. It is a turning point. It must mark the floor, not the ceiling.\u201dThat means there is a lot more work to come. A key word in the Paris talks is \u201cratchet,\u201d meaning that negotiators want to schedule countries to reconvene every five to 10 years with more stringent emissions plans to ratchet up their Paris commitments.It sounds simple, but the concept is controversial. In many countries, including the United States, pollution reduction plans are already causing domestic political upheaval. The idea that world leaders and lawmakers would have to go back to voters with even tougher policies is a hard sell. Many countries say that any \u201cratchet\u201d meetings should not come until at least 10 years out, but American negotiators are pushing for tougher new targets every five years.Who would pay is another big obstacle.In Copenhagen, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, pledged that by 2020 the developed world would send developing countries $100 billion annually to help them make the transition to cleaner energy and pay for the effects of climate change, including floods and droughts.\u201cThe cost of action is not $100 billion,\u201d said Prakash Javadekar, the Indian environment minister. \u201cIt is trillions; $100 billion is just a reparation.\u201dThat argument, and the word \u201creparations,\u201d are likely to be heard until the talks end.Traditionally, negotiators have sought to forge a legally binding treaty that needed ratification by the governments of the participating countries to have force.There is no way to get that in this case, because of the United States. A treaty would be dead on arrival on Capitol Hill without the required two-thirds majority vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.So the voluntary plans are taking the place of mandatory, top-down targets \u2014 or what one negotiator called \u201clegal jujitsu\u201d that avoids the legal definition of a treaty.Here\u2019s another way to think about it: You are given a school assignment, but there won\u2019t be any punishment if you don\u2019t turn it in. However, you are required to attend an assembly with your peers and to show them your homework. The hope is that the \u201cstudent leaders,\u201d the largest economies, will createa dynamic of international peer pressure.The United Nations is a unique institution. It passes new pacts only by unanimous consent. So in a system designed to ensure that even the smallest, poorest nations have equal voices, a single country can upend a deal. That is what happened when fewer than a half dozen countries opposed the Copenhagen accord.After Paris, a single wild-card nation \u2014 eyes are on Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan or Venezuela \u2014 could bring the process down.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Efforts to Rein In Arbitration Come Under Well-Financed Attack", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA television ad during the Republican presidential debate last Tuesday depicted pale bureaucrats rubber-stamping the word \u201cDENIED\u201d on the files of frustrated Americans, beneath a red banner of Senator Elizabeth Warren evoking a Communist apparatchik.The consumer agency\u2019s stance on arbitration, while difficult to convey in a TV spot, \u201cis a perfect example of how government is taking away the power of individuals and handing it to the trial lawyers,\u201d said Mike Shields, president of the American Action Network and a former top aide at the Republican National Committee.Last week\u2019s ad is one of multiple efforts across the country in recent weeks by both advocates and opponents of arbitration to revisit the much-debated practice, which, in two powerful decisions beginning in 2011, has been affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. The most significant moves came in Washington, where regulators, lawmakers and the Justice Department pushed for new restrictions on arbitration.At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business lobby in the country, started a new effort to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by lobbying lawmakers to attach a rider to the federal budget bill that would force the regulator to conduct a new study before issuing any rule, according to people with direct knowledge of the strategy.\u201cIf the Chamber of Commerce thinks they are going to slip a provision into a spending bill that cuts off consumer rights without a fight, they are very much mistaken,\u201d Senator Warren said.Matt Webb, a senior vice president of the chamber\u2019s Institute for Legal Reform, called the bureau\u2019s work \u201cdeeply flawed and incomplete.\u201dProponents of arbitration, who say it provides an efficient alternative to courts, view the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as among its biggest threats. They say a new rule proposed by the consumer agency, which would prevent financial services companies from including class-action bans in consumer contracts, could in effect kill arbitration altogether.On Wednesday, the Justice Department issued a proposal to protect military service members from arbitration requirements. Earlier this month, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota and a longtime opponent of arbitration, renewed his push for Congress to pass a bill he introduced this year that would prevent companies from requiring employees to go to arbitration.Several Democrats are expected to introduce bills intended to more widely curtail the use of arbitration clauses, according to the people who knew of the strategy. But with Congress deeply divided, some Democrats are calling on President Obama to use his executive authority to prevent federal contractors from including arbitration clauses in their contracts with customers and employees.San Francisco\u2019s city attorney, Dennis Herrera, sued American Express this month over what he claimed were \u201cillegal and anti-competitive rules, policies and practices.\u201d The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court, will probably help small businesses whose contracts with the credit card company prevented them from filing a class-action lawsuit.Marina H. Norville, a spokeswoman for American Express, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the suit has merit,\u201d adding that the company planned to \u201cvigorously\u201d defend itself against it.In Chicago, Alderman Edward M. Burke said he planned to introduce a bill this week that would prevent the city from doing business with companies that push employees and customers out of court. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get at a practice that is destroying a core American principle,\u201d he said in an interview.Arbitration has remained largely untouchable because of a pair of Supreme Court rulings in 2011 and 2013 that cleared the way for the use of class-action bans in contracts. With the current Supreme Court\u2019s having now twice enshrined the wide use of arbitration, many opponents have pinned their hopes on the consumer agency\u2019s proposed rule.When the agency was created five years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 the federal law overhauling the financial industry \u2014 it was given authority to study and create rules to address arbitration. The agency\u2019s research shows, among other things, that businesses have tended to get bigger awards than consumers in arbitration.In 2010 and 2011, businesses won arbitration claims against consumers totaling $2.8 million, the findings showed, compared with awards to consumers totaling less than $400,000. The agency\u2019s findings formed the basis for its proposed rule, which was released in draft form last month.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others have said the agency\u2019s findings do not support its proposed rules. \u201cBy ignoring its own data that clearly shows major deficiencies with court-based litigation and disregards the real-world advantages of arbitration, the C.F.P.B. has demonstrated its bias for trial lawyers over average Americans,\u201d Mr. Webb, of the chamber\u2019s Institute for Legal Reform, said.Considerable sums of money are at stake. Late last month, the bond-rating firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service warned that if enacted, the bureau\u2019s proposed rule might leave companies more vulnerable to class actions that could \u201cforce changes to company practices that cut into revenues\u201d or \u201cdraw regulatory scrutiny.\u201dOne reason arbitration advocates consider the bureau a significant threat is that it is empowered to issue rules without legislative approval, making them more difficult to defeat. Furthermore, unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is overseen by a bipartisan commission, the consumer agency has a single head, appointed by the president.At a legal summit hosted by the Chamber of Commerce late last month in Washington, participants spoke out forcefully against the consumer agency and its proposed arbitration rule. As attendees waited for one session to begin, Darth Vader\u2019s theme song played on the sound system.In his keynote speech on the virtues of free markets, John Stossel of the Fox Business Network lobbed a breast implant into the audience while discussing what he said was abusive litigation including lawsuits that involved claims of faulty implants. Mr. Stossel did not mention arbitration, but the subject came up during a session called Regulators Gone Rogue, in which a panelist cited the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s arbitration rule as an example of overreaching government oversight.A chamber executive, introducing the panel, likened the chamber\u2019s fight against regulations to the rebels\u2019 revolt in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies. \u201cPerhaps it is the real reason that Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie fought back against the evil empire,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lights Out in Britain for the Coal Industry", "Date": "2015-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKELLINGLEY, England \u2014 Tens of thousands of British coal miners have lost their jobs in recent decades, during the steep decline of an industry that stoked the nation\u2019s industrial rise, sustained it through two world wars and once employed more than one million people.Chris Jamieson will be one of the very last.In December, his job is set to disappear when Kellingley colliery, Britain\u2019s last deep coal mine, is scheduled to close for good.In the mine\u2019s empty parking lot, Mr. Jamieson, 50, is already thinking about the moment in a few weeks\u2019 time when the last group of miners is hauled to the surface. He expects to work the final shift at the colliery, which has been reduced to little more than a quarter of its peak work force and is succumbing to pressure from cheaper imported coal.\u201cI will be putting the lights out,\u201d he said, adding that, after a quarter-century in the industry, he would particularly miss not just his paycheck but the unique camaraderie among colleagues who work together underground.\u201cWe are the last of the dinosaurs,\u201d he said.Like the largest dinosaurs, the miners have left a giant footprint.Though open cast mining will continue in Britain, Kellingley\u2019s closing is the final chapter in the story of underground mining, an enterprise that spanned more than two centuries and helped make Britain an industrial power and a thriving exporter.The miners have not gone quietly. In the 1980s, they mounted bitter strikes to resist closings, and even as their clout has steadily diminished through the subsequent decades, they have remained proud and defiant.\u201cCoal put \u2018great\u2019 into Great Britain \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Chris Kitchen, president of the once mighty National Union of Mineworkers, which in the 1970s sometimes brought the country to a halt with its demands.\u201cIt fueled the Industrial Revolution, it kept the lights on, it kept people warm, it worked as a nationalized industry,\u201d Mr. Kitchen said. He is a former Kellingley miner and spoke in the miners\u2019 social club in Knottingley, a few miles from the colliery.Here, the mood is understandably subdued because the colliery closing means not just the loss of a well-paid job (miners here can expect to earn around \u00a320, or more than $30, an hour), but also of a way of life.Partly because of the dangers underground, miners enjoyed a special status in the labor movement.Even now, mining remains a risky job; on their way to work, Kellingley\u2019s miners pass a memorial they built to 17 people who died here.Inside a cluttered office, the union branch secretary, Keith Poulson, recalled having to pronounce one colleague dead underground and trying to resuscitate two others, who also died from injuries.\u201cGoing out and telling a wife that her husband isn\u2019t coming home,\u201d Mr. Poulson said, is \u201cthe most difficult job I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Poulson, 55, said he remained as passionate about mining as he was when he started work in 1977, believing he had a job for life.That notion was shattered 30 years ago, when plans to close collieries deemed uneconomical led to a confrontation between the miners and the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.The result was a bitter, divisive and sometimes violent dispute, involving splits in communities and clashes with horse-mounted police \u2014 and eventual defeat for the striking miners.Those events still reverberate around this region, where mining engendered a camaraderie and sense of identity with which few other occupations can compete.So the closure of Kellingley, known as \u201cBig K,\u201d is a blow to Yorkshire, whose residents have a reputation for plain-speaking.Paul Routledge, an author, journalist and Yorkshire native who has written extensively about the miners, describes this part of the country as \u201cEngland\u2019s Texas, but without the sun and the guns.\u201dCoal, he said, \u201cwas so integral to the life of this part of the world that it was part of the cultural fabric.\u201d Villages were sometimes created around collieries, which supported clubs, bands and, in earlier decades, schools and hospitals.\u201cIt was the linchpin of everything,\u201d he said, one reason the area suffered so acutely when many mines closed after the strike.The National Union of Mineworkers, he added, \u201cwas a power in the land, not just in industrial muscle but in political muscle,\u201d and acted as the \u201cPraetorian Guard of the union movement.\u201dBut in confronting the Thatcher government, which was intent on curbing the influence of organized labor, the union overreached. Government officials had prepared for the strike, sat it out and then pushed through the closings. Looking back, Mr. Routledge calls it \u201can act of industrial policy by Margaret Thatcher invigorated by political vindictiveness.\u201dAt its headquarters, the National Union of Mineworkers still displays the banners of its branches, but these are now industrial relics.The reality lies at the converted Caphouse colliery, which is now a mining museum, attracting 120,000 visitors a year, including thousands of schoolchildren for whom coal extraction is history.Darran Cowd, the museum\u2019s collections officer, said it was hard to overestimate the role mining played in this part of Yorkshire until a few decades ago.\u201cIf you stood on any high ground and couldn\u2019t see pit head gear somewhere around you, that would be unusual,\u201d he said.But confronting a gradual switch to green energy, and facing cheaper coal imports from Russia, the United States and Colombia, Kellingley\u2019s coal is now uncompetitive.\u201cWhen you look at the world economy, British coal, to a degree, has got too expensive to compete without government support,\u201d Mr. Cowd said.UK Coal, the company that operates Kellingley, would not discuss the closing. But last year, Kevin McCullough, then its chief executive, blamed a \u201chistorically low international coal price\u201d and a strong British currency.Although it feeds nearby coal-fired power stations, UK Coal buys and sells on the international market in dollars because most coal used in Britain is imported, the company said.Mr. Poulson said he believed that there were ways to save Kellingley, which he said had enough reserves to remain open until the 2030s.More than a fifth of Britain\u2019s energy needs are still met by coal. When Kellingley closes, the Drax coal-fired power station, a few miles away, \u201cwill burn Russian coal for the next 10 to 15 years, because it\u2019s needed so that the lights don\u2019t go out,\u201d Mr. Poulson said. He said he was angry that money from the mineworkers\u2019 pension fund had not been used to help keep the colliery going, while other energy sectors, including nuclear, receive substantial state aid.Mr. Kitchen, leader of the National Union of Mineworkers, said, \u201cIt would have been nice if someone had tried to assist and take away the roadblocks, instead of just building barricades in front of us.\u201dBut with the battle lost, the miners are closing in on their last working day at Kellingley.\u201cIt will be an emotional time for the men that are losing their jobs,\u201d Mr. Kitchen said, asking: \u201cIs it something to celebrate?\u201dHe would like a brass band to lead a march out of the pit, he said, but that decision rests with Kellingley\u2019s miners.\u201cThey should decide how they want to mark it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to just let it slip away quietly, that\u2019s up to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women and Blacks Make Little Progress at Big Law Firms", "Date": "2015-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen and blacks have made almost no headway in recent years in increasing their ranks at major United States law firms, according to the latest data from the National Association for Law Placement.The organization\u2019s annual compilation of legal employer data shows that although women and minorities made small gains at the level of law firm partner this year, the overall percentage of women associates, or entry-level lawyers, dropped in the last five years, and the percentage of African-American associates has declined every year since 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to see the numbers for women and African-American associates seemingly reversing course,\u201d said James G. Leipold, the association\u2019s executive director. This year, he said, \u201cmarks the sixth year of decline in representation of black associates and, while the percentage decrease is small, the overall number itself was small to begin with, so any decline is significant, and the trend is distressing.\u201dAt the partnership level, representation of women and minorities rose slightly this year, compared with 2014. Women accounted for 21.46 percent of partners, up from 21.05 percent last year. Minorities accounted for 7.52 percent, up from 7.33 percent in 2014. Twenty-three years ago, in 1993, when the association first began tracking the numbers, women made up 12.27 percent of partners and minorities accounted for 2.55 percent of partners.Much of the increase in minority partners since 2009, the report found, comes from a rise in the number of Asian and Hispanic partners. African-Americans made up only 1.7 percent of partners in 2015. Minority women fared better at firms of more than 700 lawyers, holding 3.12 percent of partnerships, but only 2.55 percent of such law firm jobs over all.Minorities expanded their presence among associate lawyers after being thinned in 2009 because of layoffs resulting from the shaky economy. The number of female associates remained nearly flat over the last three years, settling at 44.68 percent this year, which the association said was the lowest percentage since 2006. The peak number of female associates was in 2009, when they represented 45.66 percent.\u201cFor women too,\u201d Mr. Leipold said, \u201cafter years of small gains, the pattern of flat to declining representation among associates in law firms is disturbing.\u201dIt was only in the recruitment of summer associates that law firm numbers compared more favorably to the population of recent law school graduates. According to American Bar Association figures, women have accounted for 46 percent to 49 percent of law school graduates, and minorities accounted for 20 percent and 26 percent of graduates since 2000. Summer associate jobs, however, are essentially two- or three-month tryouts that do not necessarily lead to a full-time associate job.Although firm records vary widely, with some firms excelling at diversity, Mr. Leipold noted that future gains for women and minorities \u201care jeopardized by the shrinking pool at the associate level, and it is clear that measuring overall levels of diversity within law firms is inadequate without also looking at representation by specific race and ethnicity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the same time, the plan said China wanted to improve Internet speeds \u2014 a task seemingly incompatible, at least on a global level, with the country\u2019s Great Firewall system of web censorship.The new policy is also expected to be approved by the National People\u2019s Congress next spring and will go into effect afterward, although economists and demographers say they do not expect a big spike in the national birthrate.On Tuesday, some critics expressed skepticism about whether any five-year plan could address the evolving complexity of China.\u201cRarely do people compare the plan and the eventual reality,\u201d said Mao Yushi, chairman of the Unirule Institute of Economics in Beijing. \u201cNot one five-year plan has unfolded as planned. Why? Because you can\u2019t predict the problems five years from now.\u201dMr. Xi and Mr. Li have said they want to shift China away from heavy industry and high investment toward a larger service sector and more consumer spending. But recent economic shakiness has fed doubts about whether they can smoothly manage that transition.The annual plenary sessions of the Central Committee are part of the ritualized cycle of Chinese politics, giving top leaders a platform to win elite endorsement for their policies and to settle disagreements. Most famously, a plenum in late 1978 sealed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s re-emergence as a dominant leader and opened the way to market overhauls that transformed the economy over the next decade.Before the latest meeting, party propaganda depicted Mr. Xi, who is also the general secretary of the party, as a visionary in the mold of Deng.\u201cIt is consistent with the broader trend of the C.C.P. general secretary acting as the \u2018chairman of everything\u2019 and ensuring his personal stamp is on every policy,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a researcher on Chinese economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington who has followed the drafting of the new five-year plan.Although China has shed many of the top-down economic controls of the Maoist era, the five-year plan still plays an important role, Mr. Kennedy said. After the National People\u2019s Congress endorses the plan next spring, ministries and agencies will issue more detailed strategies for making changes regarding energy, the environment, trade and other areas.\u201cThe plan serves as the most authoritative statement on the state\u2019s priorities,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said. \u201cThe party, government agencies, financial institutions and companies then spend a great deal of effort aligning themselves with these priorities.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Portugal\u2019s New Premier Takes Office, Facing Financial Balancing Act", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA month later, Mr. Costa joined ranks with erstwhile rivals and more radical left-wing parties \u2014 the Communists and the Left Bloc \u2014 in an unexpected alliance that forced Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s ouster by voting down his government program in Parliament.In the medium term, however, Mr. Costa faces a difficult balancing act between meeting the demands of his new left-wing allies, in terms of unwinding the austerity measures of the previous center-right government, while maintaining the confidence of creditors.Mr. Costa, a former mayor of Lisbon, is leading a Socialist administration that will govern with the backing of Communist and Left Bloc lawmakers who have made their support conditional upon pursuing anti-austerity measures that include raising public wages and unfreezing pensions.On Thursday, Mr. Costa promised to maintain balanced public finances, but also insisted that his government would change tack in terms of economic management, in part \u201cto fight poverty and inequality.\u201dHe excoriated the previous government for neglecting public services and prompting an exodus of Portuguese forced to seek work overseas. \u201cAusterity doesn\u2019t generate prosperity,\u201d Mr. Costa said. \u201cThe spirit that fills this government is another one and very different: We want to build step by step, measure by measure, a new era for Portugal.\u201dMr. Costa, 54, took office after receiving the tepid endorsement this week of Portugal\u2019s conservative president, An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, who had initially decided to allow Mr. Passos Coelho to serve a second term in office.During his first term, Mr. Passos Coelho stuck to the belt-tightening prescriptions demanded by international creditors in return for granting Portugal a bailout of 78 billion euros, about $83 billion, in 2011.As he won plaudits from creditors, however, tax increases and spending cuts helped widen income disparities. Tax breaks for foreign investors under Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s government also revitalized pockets of the economy, while other parts felt left behind.Last month, investors pushed up Portugal\u2019s borrowing costs after it became clear that the October election had left the country without any solid government leadership.But this week \u2014 despite concerns that Mr. Costa would introduce more radical anti-austerity policies \u2014 investors apparently welcomed the conclusion of Portugal\u2019s political crisis. On Wednesday, Portugal managed to auction almost \u20ac1 billion in 10-year bonds.Mr. Costa insisted on Thursday that Portugal would continue to meet the deficit and debt targets agreed with Brussels.He was also forced to make some pledges to Mr. Cavaco Silva to win his recent endorsement, including keeping a tight budget. Such pledges, according to analysts, will make it difficult for Mr. Costa to also meet the expectations of the Communists and other more left-wing supporters.\u201cThe fragility of the alliance between left-wing parties does not bode well for the stability of a Socialist administration,\u201d said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence in London, in a research note issued Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Call to Arms in France Amid Hunt for Belgian Suspect in Paris Attacks", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosPARIS \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France called on Monday for constitutional amendments to fight potential terrorists at home and for an aggressive effort to \u201ceradicate\u201d the Islamic State abroad.His call to arms \u2014 \u201cFrance is at war,\u201d he said at the opening of his remarks to a joint session of Parliament \u2014 came as security forces in France and Belgium zeroed in on a suspect they said was the architect of the assault that killed 129 people Friday night in Paris. The suspect, a 27-year-old Belgian, has fought for the Islamic State in Syria and has been linked to other terrorist attacks.Mr. Hollande spoke after the French police raided homes and other sites across the country in an effort to head off possible further attacks and as the authorities in Belgium hunted for a suspected assailant in Friday\u2019s attacks.Mr. Hollande called for quick action by Parliament on new legislation that would give the government more flexibility to conduct police raids without a warrant and place people under house arrest. He said he would seek court advice on broader surveillance powers. And he called for amendments that would enable the state to take exceptional security measures without having to resort to the most drastic options currently in the Constitution.Mr. Hollande is also seeking to extend the current state of emergency for three months and let the government strip the citizenship of French natives who are convicted of terrorism and hold a second passport.\u201cOur democracy has prevailed over much more formidable opponents than these cowardly assassins,\u201d Mr. Hollande said a day after France conducted airstrikes against the Syrian city of Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State. It was the country\u2019s most intense military strike yet against the radical group, which has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris.\u201cTerrorism will not destroy the republic, because it is the republic that will destroy it,\u201d he said.A French official briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss operational details, said Mr. Abaaoud had mentioned plans to attack \u201ca concert hall\u201d to a French citizen who returned from Syria.Mr. Abaaoud, this official said, had also been in contact with Isma\u00ebl Omar Mostefa\u00ef, one of the Paris attackers. Mr. Abaaoud also knew another attacker, Ibrahim Abdeslam; they were tried together in 2010 in Belgium for a minor offense.Mr. Hollande said the attacks had been \u201cplanned in Syria, organized in Belgium, perpetrated on our soil with French complicity.\u201dThe French authorities said Monday that they had conducted 168 raids across the country in an effort to root out possible terrorist threats. The raids extended from the Paris region to the major cities of Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse, they said. They also said they had arrested 23 people and detained 104 others under house arrest.But a Frenchman believed to be involved in the Paris attacks, Salah Abdeslam, 26, a brother of Ibrahim Abdeslam, remained at large, eluding a series of raids conducted by the authorities in Molenbeek, the working-class Brussels neighborhood where the brothers lived.A third brother, Mohamed, and four other men who had been detained in Belgium were released on Monday. At a news conference in Brussels, Mohamed said he did not know Salah\u2019s whereabouts and added, \u201cMy parents are under shock and have not yet grasped what has happened.\u201dThe man believed to be the architect of the plot, Mr. Abaaoud, who traveled to Syria last year and even persuaded his 13-year-old brother to join him there, is from the same neighborhood, Molenbeek, as the Abdeslam brothers. The cell is believed to be led by Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, who serves as an official spokesman for the Islamic State, a Defense Department official said\u00a0Monday. Mr. Schiff warned that much was still unknown about how much of the plot had been directed from Syria and how much autonomy had been left to conspirators.The attacks in Brussels on Tuesday have refocused attention on the Belgian capital as an incubator of radicalism and center for terrorist plots.As France observed its second of three days of national mourning, the authorities in France and Belgium raced to track down suspects and chase leads.At one house in the Rh\u00f4ne department in the southeast, around Lyon, the police found a Kalashnikov rifle, three pistols, ammunition and bulletproof vests. Officers then obtained a warrant to search the home of the parents of a man who lived in the house, where they found several automatic pistols, ammunition, police armbands, military clothing and a rocket launcher. Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve promised to keep up the search. \u201cWe are using all the possibilities given to us by the state of emergency, that is to say administrative raids, 24 hours a day,\u201d Mr. Valls said. He vowed to keep intense pressure on \u201cradical Islamism, Salafist groups, all those who preach hatred of the Republic.\u201dThe man was identified on his passport \u2014 found at the soccer stadium north of Paris where he blew himself up Friday night \u2014 as Ahmad al-Mohammad, 25, a native of Idlib, Syria. The holder of the passport passed through the Greek island of Leros on Oct. 3 and the Serbian border town of Presovo on Oct. 7, according to Greek and Serbian officials. It remained unclear whether the passport was authentic.All told, at least four French citizens were among the seven attackers: Ibrahim Abdeslam; Mr. Mostefa\u00ef, who met with the man suspected of planning the attacks; and two men identified on Monday as Samy Amimour, 28, a Paris native who lived in the suburb of Drancy, and Bilal Hadfi, 20, who lived in Brussels.Mr. Amimour was known to the French authorities, having been charged in October 2012 with terrorist conspiracy, according to the authorities. He was placed under judicial supervision but violated the terms of that supervision in 2013, prompting the authorities to put out an international arrest warrant.Turkey confirmed on Monday that Mr. Mostefa\u00ef, 29, entered Turkey in 2013, but it said that \u201cthere is no record of him leaving the country.\u201dA Turkish official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the government flagged Mr. Mostefa\u00ef twice \u2014 in December and in June \u2014 but that \u201cwe have, however, not heard back from France on the matter.\u201dHe continued, \u201cIt was only after the Paris attacks that the Turkish authorities received an information request about Isma\u00ebl Omar Mostefa\u00ef from France.\u201d The official added that \u201cthis is not a time to play the blame game,\u201d but that governments needed to do better at sharing intelligence to prevent terrorism.Many of the attacks were just minutes apart.\u201cLet\u2019s assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria,\u201d he said at a gathering of leaders of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market economies in Antalya, Turkey. \u201cWhat happens when there\u2019s a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps?\u201dElsewhere in Europe, the authorities tightened security. Britain announced Monday that it would pay for an additional 1,900 intelligence officers, and review aviation security.In Washington, John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Monday that the Paris attacks and the crash of a Russian jet over the Sinai Peninsula bore the \u201challmarks\u201d of the Islamic State.Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Mr. Brennan called the group an \u201cassociation of murderous sociopaths\u201d that is \u201cnot going to content itself with violence inside the Syrian and Iraqi borders.\u201dWading into the debate over surveillance, privacy and encryption, Mr. Brennan said he hoped the Paris attacks would be a \u201cwake-up call,\u201d adding that \u201chand-wringing\u201d had weakened the ability of Western intelligence services to prevent attacks.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the number of weapons the French police confiscated.

{"Headline": "Promised Bipartisanship, Obama Adviser Found Disappointment", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeven years later and now out of office, Mr. LaHood has concluded that the opposite turned out to be true. Rather than reflecting the bipartisan spirit of the Obama presidency, Mr. LaHood said his appointment as secretary of transportation came to reflect its failure.Despite the glowing words, Mr. Obama abandoned his promise to govern across the aisle, Mr. LaHood said in an interview. The only elected Republican in Mr. Obama\u2019s original cabinet, Mr. LaHood said the president never made a sustained effort to reach out and gave up too easily. As a result, he became isolated and reliant on a group of like-minded advisers.That assessment from a man who served under Mr. Obama for four years punctuates Mr. LaHood\u2019s new memoir, \u201cSeeking Bipartisanship: My Life in Politics,\u201d published last month by Cambria Press. While he expressed warm feelings toward Mr. Obama and approval of many of his policies, Mr. LaHood lamented the partisan fever that characterized his time in office.\u201cI do not believe the White House ever committed fully to a genuine bipartisan approach to policy making, despite the president\u2019s words to the contrary,\u201d Mr. LaHood wrote in the book, which he produced with Frank H. Mackaman.While he said he believed that Mr. Obama was sincere when he said he wanted bipartisanship, the president was hamstrung \u201cby mistakes in judgment and political calculation that prevented cooperation between the political parties and sacrificed vision too easily for short-term gain.\u201dMr. LaHood, however, said Mr. Obama shared responsibility, too. \u201cPresident Obama depended almost exclusively on a handful of folks situated in the White House,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe rarely sought counsel outside that group. He did not, as other presidents have done, place a high value on consulting with members of Congress.\u201d\u201cAs time passed,\u201d he added, \u201cthe president seemed to me to become more isolated, more insulated from those outside the in-group, less engaged with others.\u201dStill, he did not let fellow Republicans off the hook. Mr. LaHood clearly felt disconnected from the \u201cideological rigidity\u201d of his party\u2019s new generation, who \u201cinhabit a different world from mine,\u201d as he put it. \u201cMany of them do not want Congress to pass bills. Any government action is, by their definition, bad for the country.\u201dWhile Mr. Gates was held over from a Republican administration, Mr. LaHood was the only Republican in the first cabinet who had been elected to public office. In his second term, Mr. Obama appointed former Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, as defense secretary, although he did not last long.\u201cI think they felt like they need to push this through quickly to get the economy moving,\u201d Mr. LaHood said in the interview. \u201cAnd, boom, they made a decision that they were going to pass economic stimulus with just Democratic votes. That was the beginning of the end of bipartisanship.\u201dWhen Mr. Emanuel asked him to call 10 to 15 of his former Republican colleagues to lobby for the stimulus, Mr. LaHood said each complained of being shut out by Democrats. As a result, he refused to help anymore.\u201cI called Rahm and said, \u2018This is mission impossible,\u2019\u201d he recounted in the book. \u201cI stopped making calls. I did not expect Republicans to roll over and accept the president\u2019s ambitious economic recovery agenda whole cloth.\u201dMr. LaHood said that set the tone for the rest of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cHouse Republicans deserve a fair amount of blame for the lock-step vote on stimulus,\u201d he wrote, because they would not meet Mr. Obama halfway. But in handing the project over to Mrs. Pelosi, he said, \u201cthe price we paid was incalculable.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe White House had reached this decision without consulting me, the person they had selected to promote bipartisanship.\u201dLikewise, Mr. LaHood noted that cabinet meetings were scripted affairs rather than opportunities for the president to hear from anyone other than his closest aides. Cabinet meetings were held infrequently and mainly to show off what the administration was already doing, not deliberate about what it should do. \u201cIt was all for show,\u201d he said.He said that he did not discuss his critique with the president but that he would send him a copy of the book. \u201cBipartisanship is in his DNA. I\u2019m proof of it,\u201d Mr. LaHood said. \u201cBut time and intervening circumstance didn\u2019t allow him to do it in the way that he would have wanted to.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a lot more conservative than I am, which is O.K.,\u201d the elder Mr. LaHood said. \u201cHe got elected.

{"Headline": "Official Plane for Cameron Has Britons Unimpressed", "Date": "2015-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 When he was Britain\u2019s prime minister, Tony Blair tried to secure his own official aircraft, only to see it nicknamed \u201cBlairforce One\u201d and lampooned as an effort to compete with the American presidential jet.More than seven years after that project failed to get off the ground, the idea is back, with Britain\u2019s current prime minister, David Cameron, announcing plans to join the club of world leaders with an official aircraft.The British government, which is simultaneously making big cuts in public spending, is presenting the decision to buy a plane as a security and money-saving measure rather than an effort to enhance the prime minister\u2019s prestige.While many European countries have jets for government leaders, the subject is a touchy one in Britain, where politicians have been embroiled in several scandals in recent years and public financing for their first-class travel is highly unpopular. Mr. Cameron uses military aircraft for short flights, but the government sometimes charters commercial jets, at considerable expense, for long trips.The government\u2019s money-saving argument has not impressed everyone. Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland and a Scottish National Party lawmaker, said that the announcement should be given \u201cabout one out of 10 for timing\u201d as the government cuts public spending.The motivation, Mr. Salmond told ITV News, seemed to be for Mr. Cameron to avoid the appearance of being \u201coutdone\u201d by other leaders when arriving at international meetings.Under the new plan, Britain will convert a military air-to-air refueling plane so that it can be used by Mr. Cameron and senior ministers for long journeys. The plane, which would retain its refueling capacity, would also be available for members of the royal family.On Thursday, the government said it would convert one of the Royal Air Force\u2019s Voyager aircraft to be used for official trips, enabling the prime minister to travel with secure communications.His jet will also have roughly 50 business-class seats, plus 100 economy-class seats for people accompanying the prime minister, including business leaders and journalists, on big international trips.Mr. Cameron\u2019s aides have declined to say whether the prime minister will have his own room, bed or shower; whether the aircraft will have a name or call sign; or whether civilian or military personnel will serve drinks and food on board. According to British officials, the use of the aircraft will save the government about $1.2 million a year, based on the expenses of recent trips. But the initial cost of converting the plane is expected to be about $15.2 million. That is still considerably cheaper than the \u201cBlairforce One\u201d plan, which was ultimately killed by Mr. Blair\u2019s successor, Gordon Brown, after estimates suggested that it would cost about $152 million. The government also points out that chartering planes, particularly on short notice, can be expensive. Figures released by the government show that it cost more than $152,000 for Mr. Cameron and five officials to take a charter flight to Saudi Arabia in January to \u201cpay condolences following death of King Abdullah.\u201dOn Thursday, the British news media tried hard to find a replacement for the \u201cBlairforce One\u201d tag that could be applied to an aircraft for Mr. Cameron, who leads Britain\u2019s Conservative Party. Among the nicknames suggested were \u201cAir Force Cam,\u201d \u201cCon Air,\u201d \u201cCam Fly With Me\u201d and the \u201cCamcorde.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Student Protesters So Fearful?", "Date": "2015-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionTHE message coming out of recent student protests on college campuses, from Princeton and Yale to the University of Missouri, couldn\u2019t be clearer: Students are rightly pained by the racist and sexual abuse still shockingly common into the 21st century, and for good reason they are indignant that institutions they trust \u2014 or wish to trust \u2014 fail to stop the culprits, or even to acknowledge publicly the harm they do.But rumbling under the surface of some recent protests is something besides indignation: an assumption of grave vulnerability. The victims too often present themselves as weak, in need of protection. Administrators are held, like helicopter parents, wholly responsible. To a veteran of movements of the \u201960s like myself, this is strikingly strange.It is also true that many administrators are caught flat-footed; just consider how long it took the University of Missouri to acknowledge longstanding concerns by minority students about campus racism.And yet, when that recognition came and the president and chancellor resigned, instead of celebrating an extraordinary victory \u2014 with football players as their crucial allies \u2014 demonstrators blocked photographers from taking pictures of their assembly. They apparently believed that public assemblies ought to be \u201csafe spaces,\u201d meaning, safe from photography, which might have been thought to be useful for bringing the news to a larger public. Their starting assumption was that the press had it in for them.At Yale, meanwhile, administrators cautioned students about how to dress properly for Halloween, and when another administrator publicly questioned whether this was an issue the administration needed to take a position on, protesters demanded her resignation.Why such a widespread and bristling feeling of acute vulnerability followed by attacks on those who disagree? Why the lust for \u201csafe spaces\u201d? Why the clamor for \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d? (At my own university, Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphoses\u201d came off the syllabus for a required core course after some students objected to Ovid\u2019s accounts of rape.) Why do so many students see themselves as so vulnerable to the slings and arrows of outrageous texts, arguments, comments? Why so fearful?A pattern is clear: Too many students doubt that their community is, or can be, strong enough to stand up for itself, entertain arguments and strive to persuade opponents. The extremity of their reaction suggests that they lack confidence that reason and values are on their side. They may well resent the fact that, after decades of civil rights reform and feminism, they still have to argue against people who \u201cdon\u2019t get it.\u201dOne can only speculate about the forces that drive this crisis, but odds are that we are witnessing a cultural mood that cannot be reduced to political-economic considerations. There\u2019s a generalized anxiety when one has always been supervised, as this generation has. Moreover, students suffer under mountainous debt loads. Professional work is being destabilized. Careers dissolve into serial jobs, or the insecure \u201cgig economy.\u201dThe prospect of gargantuan, destructive climate change must also have young people rattled. It ought to. There are actual apocalypses in the making.But movements that change the world are the creations of confident people \u2014 confident despite their hurt, confident despite their fear. If they don\u2019t start out confident, they learn how to create strong communities and become more so. As leaders test themselves in action, the better ones rise and the lesser ones fade. The militants suffer, yes, but they find ways to learn a broader repertoire of feelings and skills. They can imagine putting an end to their suffering, at least much of it.Accordingly, they make plans. Excited by the prospect of testing their strength and winning victories, they set out to line up friends, isolate adversaries, change the minds of those they hold responsible or, that failing, throw them off. When they win victories, they celebrate them, and look toward next steps. They are not only, as Dostoyevsky wrote, \u201cthe insulted and injured\u201d; they are also the empowered.Gays and lesbians, despised and abused by the dominant culture, likewise stood up for themselves. They won acknowledgment \u2014 they insisted on naming themselves. Not being \u201cnormal\u201d was fine, they said, and their confidence was a resource with which to stop institutions and individuals from firing them or beating them up for it. Told to wait patiently and die from AIDS, they mobilized to push the federal government to accelerate the process to approve new drugs.When movements lose their belief in a larger community that can prevail, they lose their momentum, dwindle into closed circles, become more suspicious, more indiscriminate in welcoming enmity. Contrary to some recent folklore, victories for racial equality in America came not from a few thousand Black Panthers parading with firearms, but from millions committed to nonviolent action.Radical change is not for the narrow-minded or weak-hearted. In the words of a few dozen revolutionaries in Philadelphia 239 years ago, \u201call experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government.\u201dIt is because they felt that right and duty so strongly, because they claimed \u201ca firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence\u201d \u2014 that is, confidence more than desperation \u2014 that they felt able to \u201cmutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stress Tests for the Greek Prime Minister", "Date": "2015-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyOne stress test is over for Athens, but several more are looming. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras received good news over the weekend when a stress test showed that the top Greek banks needed to raise a lowish 14.4 billion euros, or $15.9 billion, in capital. But Mr. Tsipras has to implement more tough measures before he can get the economy growing. Until then, he faces political risks, which could yet tip Greece back into crisis.An assessment by the European Central Bank found that the four banks \u2014 Alpha Bank, Eurobank, National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank \u2014 had a collective capital shortfall of \u20ac14.4 billion under an \u201cadverse\u201d scenario. This is less than the \u20ac25 billion maximum earmarked for bank recapitalization as part of Greece\u2019s latest bailout program. What\u2019s more, the banks will need to find perhaps around half that amount in state aid. The rest they can probably get by swapping bondholder debt into equity capital, issuing shares to private investors and selling assets.What this means is that Greece\u2019s overall debt may be \u20ac15 billion to \u20ac20 billion lower than earlier projections \u2014 peaking at a still eye-popping level of 190 percent of gross domestic product, rather than 200 percent.The top four banks all stand a pretty good chance of raising the minimum capital required to avoid being effectively nationalized by the Greek state. To avoid that fate, they need to raise the entire capital shortfall identified under a \u201cbase case\u201d stress test: \u20ac4.4 billion in total.Provided the banks can find the necessary base-case capital themselves, the Greek state will provide whatever capital they can\u2019t raise under the adverse scenario on relatively generous terms. It will use money borrowed from its eurozone partners to buy a mix of shares and contingent convertible bonds. The latter will not have votes and will turn into ordinary equity only if the banks\u2019 capital buffers fall below a predetermined level in the future.It is not certain that all four banks will be able to raise base-case capital privately. The biggest question mark hangs over Piraeus Bank, which has the largest base-case shortfall: \u20ac2.2 billion. After taking account of bond swaps and asset sales, it needs about \u20ac1.5 billion from private investors.The main thing that could throw the capital increases off track would be signs that Athens is bogged down on other parts of the bailout program. If the banks then have to rely entirely on state aid, that won\u2019t just increase Greek debt. It may push the whole recapitalization exercise beyond the year-end deadline \u2014 something that could result in uninsured depositors seeing part of their savings forcibly converted into bank shares under new rules that would then kick in.Mr. Tsipras needs to keep running to avoid such a blow to confidence. And there are other reasons he can\u2019t afford to relax.Cash from the latest bailout program will flow only if Greece passes more milestones. The first \u20ac2 billion dollop of aid will be used partly to pay money Athens owes the private sector. Such a cash injection will help counteract the tax increases and spending cuts the government is having to implement.But to get this money, Mr. Tsipras is supposed to implement 49 measures, including liberalization of closed professions and measures to crack down on tax evasion. So far, he is behind schedule and has done only about two-thirds of the work.The biggest prize, though, is debt relief. The eurozone has agreed to consider lightening the load of Athens\u2019s loans \u2014 probably by lengthening the period it has to repay what it owes. But it will start negotiations only when Greece receives a pass mark in the first review of the new bailout program.To receive such a thumbs-up, Mr. Tsipras needs to implement a second raft of overhaul measures as well as agree to budget cuts for the next three years. Although the details haven\u2019t yet been set, these are likely to be politically tough. For example, farmers will need to pay higher taxes, and big pension cuts will be required to compensate for a court ruling that declared previous reductions unconstitutional.Athens is also supposed to strengthen the independence of its tax authority. Last month, Mr. Tsipras fired its boss.The measures the government has pushed through are already causing a backlash. Farmers are threatening to bring their tractors into Athens, and pharmacists have been on strike. As the prime minister pushes through even more unpopular measures, some of his party\u2019s members in Parliament may desert him and he could lose his wafer-thin majority. He might then struggle to put together a new coalition, because the opposition parties distrust him deeply.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s best bet is to move as fast as he can now. That way, the creditors may reward his actions, providing some relief before he faces yet more stress tests of his own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Special Races Do Not Alter Party Tallies in New York Legislature", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn an Election Day in which three of the five State Legislature seats in New York being contested were left vacant by Albany lawmakers who ran afoul of corruption laws, it would seem reasonable to expect their misdeeds \u2014 and the ethical state of the capital they worked in \u2014 to play a large role in the races to replace them.Democrats had originally hoped to pick up a State Senate seat in Binghamton, where the previous occupant, Thomas W. Libous, once the second-highest-ranking Republican senator, was convicted in July of lying to federal investigators in a corruption investigation. But despite a personal pledge of support from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic candidate, Barbara Fiala, a former Broome County executive and state commissioner of motor vehicles, was left a resounding 55 points behind on election night with 84 percent of precincts reporting.She lost to Fred Akshar, a county undersheriff who was little known before the race but quickly came to dominate it, thanks in large part to a heavy dose of financial support from state Republicans.Democratic leaders have suggested voters\u2019 loathing of state government will work to their advantage next year, when they will seek to win a governing majority in the Senate, where Republicans have power. (Though they technically fill less than half of the chamber, Republicans currently hold a de facto majority because one senator was elected as a Democrat but caucuses with Republicans. A breakaway faction of five Democrats often aligns with the Republicans.)But the taint of Albany was an unpredictable factor in the races on Tuesday, with some candidates, like Mr. Akshar, casting themselves as political outsiders and others focusing on local issues.Republican party leaders said voters, especially ones upstate, cared primarily about bread-and-butter issues.\u201cPeople are really concerned about jobs and the economy, and on that, the Republican Party has the high ground,\u201d Edward F. Cox, the party\u2019s state chairman, said in an interview. He added that those issues \u201care going to dominate\u201d next year, \u201cassuming that there are no additional indictments.\u201dDemocrats held on to the Brooklyn Senate seat previously occupied by John L. Sampson, who was convicted on charges relating to an embezzlement investigation in July, and to the Queens Assembly seat of William Scarborough, who was recently sentenced to 13 months in prison for submitting at least $40,000 in false expense vouchers for days he did not travel to Albany.In the Brooklyn race, Roxanne Persaud, the member of the Assembly from the area, beat Jeffrey Ferretti, the Republican, by 77 points with 95 percent of precincts reporting. In southeast Queens, Alicia Hyndman, a former president of the local community educational council, defeated Scherie Murray, the first Republican to run for the seat in nearly 30 years, by 83 points.Two other slots were left vacant when legislators resigned.In an Assembly district covering parts of south Brooklyn, Pamela Harris, a Democrat, won the race to replace Alec Brook-Krasny, a Democrat who stepped down to take a job in the private sector. Ms. Harris, a retired corrections officer who leads a Coney Island nonprofit organization, defeated the Republican candidate, Lucretia Regina-Potter, who had run and lost in several previous elections, by 25 points.In the Assembly district that includes Syracuse, Pamela Hunter, a city councilor and a Democrat, defeated John Sharon, a Republican, by 17 points.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "December Interest Rate Increase Is \u2018a Live Possibility,\u2019 Janet Yellen Says", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy is \u201cperforming well,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, told the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday morning, adding that \u201cit could be appropriate\u201d to raise rates at the Fed\u2019s final policy meeting of the year in mid-December. No decision has been made, she stressed.In effect, that means the Fed is already starting to tighten financial conditions even as officials wrestle over how soon to end a stretch of nearly seven years of near-zero short-term rates.The Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign has encouraged borrowing and risk-taking, which officials say have contributed to economic recovery and job growth. Those benefits will diminish as rates rise.Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed\u2019s timing would rest on the next few rounds of economic data, beginning on Friday with the government\u2019s October employment report.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.While the timing of an increase has captivated markets, Ms. Yellen also emphasized that the path of rate increases over the next several years would be more economically significant. The Fed has said it plans to raise rates more slowly than during previous periods of economic growth because the pace of expansion has been unusually weak.\u201cI know there\u2019s a great deal of focus on the initial move,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cBut markets and the public should be thinking about the entire path of policy rates over time.\u201dThe Fed faces mounting political pressure as the decision approaches. Republicans charge that the Fed has waited too long to raise rates, overstimulating financial markets. Some economists and business leaders argue that the economy would benefit from a rate increase.Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, charged on Tuesday that Ms. Yellen was doing the bidding of the Obama administration by keeping rates low, to delay the onset of \u201ca lot of bad things.\u201dDemocrats say that low rates are still helping create jobs and that the Fed should continue its campaign until it sees evidence of inflationary pressures.Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, went beyond that standard argument on Wednesday, telling Ms. Yellen that God also did not want the Fed to raise rates until next spring, because that was the proper time of year for things to rise from the ground.\u201cIf you want to be good with the Almighty, you might want to delay until May,\u201d Mr. Sherman joked with Ms. Yellen, drawing snickers and disbelieving looks from other committee members.To make sure he was not being taken too seriously, he posted on Twitter, \u201cDon\u2019t actually think God has an opinion on monetary policy, but if She did, She would agree that the FOMC shouldn\u2019t increase rates in winter.\u201dMs. Yellen\u2019s primary concern at the moment, however, is neither God nor President Obama, but wresting a consensus from the members of her own committee, some of whom argue there is no harm in waiting until next year, while others insist the Fed should have moved already.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.She has staked a middle ground, arguing that the Fed should start moving soon because monetary policy acts gradually and inflation will begin to rise as growth continues.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have grown convinced that the tepid pace of growth is not likely to improve much. The Fed has repeatedly reduced its estimates of the postcrisis capacity of the economy, and the latest round of reductions, published last month, has pushed that ceiling almost all the way down to the level of current growth.Fed officials make their own economic forecasts, separate from that staff forecast, but Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments on Wednesday suggested that she broadly agreed. \u201cI see underutilization of labor resources as having diminished significantly since earlier in the year,\u201d she said.Inflation generally increases as unemployment falls. Fed officials have been surprised by the weakness of inflation, but they continue to expect that pattern, known as the Phillips Curve, to reassert itself.\u201cIt\u2019ll be back,\u201d Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said at a separate public appearance Wednesday evening. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll see it. The Phillips Curve will come back.\u201dHowever, in a nod to Fed officials who note the absence of inflationary pressure, Ms. Yellen said that the pace of subsequent rate increases would depend on the reality of future inflation.In her prepared remarks, Ms. Yellen said new regulations after the 2008 financial crisis had made the system, and the largest companies, healthier and stronger.\u201cI hope you will take away from my testimony just how much has changed,\u201d she said.Republicans questioned Ms. Yellen both on the details of individual regulations and on what they said had become, in aggregate, an unnecessarily large and intrusive burden.\u201cIt seems like there are many new regulations, and they\u2019re all driving at the same thing,\u201d said Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas. He and other representatives pressed Ms. Yellen to conduct an analysis of the aggregate costs and benefits of recent regulatory changes.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Republican Debate, Candidates Battle Sharply on Immigration", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the most substantive Republican debate so far, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Bush, who have been fading in polls, presented themselves as experienced chief executives who had practical solutions to deal with national challenges like immigration. Yet Mr. Trump and another candidate, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, inveighed against what they called amnesty and argued that undocumented workers were driving down Americans\u2019 wages.The splintering over immigration, in a campaign dominated so far by the personas, speeches and backgrounds of the candidates, illuminated the brightest dividing line between Republican hopefuls like Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich, who favor a comprehensive immigration overhaul, and the many primary voters who have embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh language about immigrants in the country illegally.While several other candidates, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, received a pass from the moderators on immigration, Mr. Kasich took on the issue directly after Mr. Trump defended his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and to identify and deport some 11 million people.\u201cThink about the families; think about the children,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cCome on, folks, we know you can\u2019t pick them up and ship them across the border. It\u2019s a silly argument. It\u2019s not an adult argument.\u201dMr. Trump, whose counterpunches were a memorable part of his early debate performances, replied coolly at first, citing President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s approach to deporting immigrants in the 1950s.\u201cYou don\u2019t get nicer; you don\u2019t get friendlier,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have no choice.\u201dBut Mr. Kasich stayed on the attack. \u201cLittle false little things, sir, they really don\u2019t work when it comes to the truth,\u201d he said.Mr. Bush then tried to pounce. He twitted Mr. Trump, his longtime rival in the race, for suggesting that Mr. Bush be allowed to speak \u2014 \u201cWhat a generous man you are\u201d \u2014 and warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh proposals would drive Hispanic voters to support the Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201cThey\u2019re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this,\u201d Mr. Bush said.But policy details and disagreements, for the most part, replaced nasty potshots in the early going on Tuesday night, laying bare real fissures within the Republican Party on immigration, national security, trade and the meaning of being a conservative. The candidates used the 90 seconds they were allotted for each answer to promote their tax proposals, to lament what they said were intrusive business regulations and to delve into the country\u2019s monetary policy. Even when Mr. Kasich sought to speak at one point when he was not called on, it was because he wanted to discuss a value-added tax.Mr. Rubio was not only able to avoid being drawn into the contentious immigration debate, but also repeatedly received questions that allowed him to answer with versions of his stump speech. Even he seemed unable to believe his good fortune when he was asked to make his case against Mrs. Clinton. He chuckled for a moment before unspooling a well-rehearsed argument: why he can prosecute a \u201cgenerational\u201d case against her.\u201cIf I am the nominee, they will be the party of the past, and we will be the party of the 21st century,\u201d said Mr. Rubio, 44.Less than three months before Iowa begins the Republican nominating contest, the jostling in Milwaukee reflected the growing urgency the candidates feel to stand out in a sprawling 14-person field. With a pair of political novices, Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, atop the polls, the other candidates appeared determined to remain in the campaign until there is more clarity on who is likely to be the nominee. But the muddled picture is clearly starting to unnerve many in the party.Some of the candidates expressed this frustration and sought to distinguish themselves by speaking more aggressively about their plans to cut taxes or create jobs \u2014 even if they did not deliver many specifics.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, we should vet all candidates,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cI have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about.\u201d He then accused Mrs. Clinton of initially lying about the motives of the terrorists who killed four State Department employees in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, and charged that the news media had not held her accountable. As for himself, he said, \u201cPeople who know me know that I\u2019m an honest person.\u201dMr. Rubio, who delivered the strongest performance in the October debate, has been struggling since then to put to rest questions about his personal finances, with the Bush campaign and Mr. Trump portraying him as irresponsible. But that issue did not surface Tuesday, and Mr. Rubio largely skated above the sharpest clashes in the debate.Mr. Bush, who clashed memorably with Mr. Rubio in the debate last month, strained Tuesday to show skeptical donors and voters that his campaign is still viable, ignoring Mr. Rubio and instead repeatedly attacking Mrs. Clinton on fiscal issues.\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy,\u201d Mr. Bush said.We checked the accuracy of candidates\u2019 remarks in the Republican debate in Milwaukee.Several other candidates also focused more on Mrs. Clinton than on their rivals. Mr. Kasich, who had declined to attack her in the first months of his campaign, joined in, saying, \u201cIt will be a disaster if she got elected.\u201dSome of the most striking moments came as candidates revealed more of themselves than in previous debates.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who had perhaps the best night of his campaign, delivered a sophisticated explanation of his libertarian-leaning views on foreign policy. And he made a forceful case about conservatism, portraying Mr. Rubio as a big spender who would not adhere to small-government values.\u201cMarco, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the government that you\u2019re not paying for?\u201d Mr. Paul asked, citing Mr. Rubio\u2019s proposals for higher military spending.Mr. Rubio responded by calling Mr. Paul \u201ca committed isolationist,\u201d and won one of the loudest ovations of the night by defending American leadership.\u201cI know that the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.Mr. Paul did not relent in the face of the applause, responding, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re any safer from bankruptcy court,\u201d and asking Mr. Rubio how he could be \u201ca conservative and be liberal on military spending.\u201dMr. Trump expounded on views that placed him outside of mainstream thinking for many independent and swing voters, not only on immigration but also in his fierce opposition to increasing the minimum wage; he said that wages were too high.The debate was also a prime opportunity for the Republicans to distinguish themselves as economic thinkers with new ideas to create jobs or lower the national debt, $18 trillion and counting. But few of them left powerful impressions. Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson staked out their opposition to a $15 minimum wage but offered no new proposals to help poor and working-class people. Mr. Rubio agreed with them on the minimum wage but argued that higher education and vocational training must become more accessible and be aimed specifically at increasing wages.Mr. Kasich noted that his state, Ohio, had increased the minimum wage and said that \u201cpeople need help.\u201d He cited his plan to cut personal and corporate taxes and achieve a balanced federal budget by 2024.\u201cHillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cWe have to be careful about what we promise on the tax side.\u201dSensing an opening to appeal to the party\u2019s conservative grass roots after Mr. Kasich and Mr. Bush attacked Mr. Trump for his hard-line stance on immigration, Mr. Cruz uncorked an assault on his party and the news media.Picking up on Mr. Bush\u2019s comment about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign exchanging \u201chigh-fives\u201d over the Republican discussion of immigration, Mr. Cruz said Democrats were actually laughing. \u201cIf the Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose,\u201d he said.Mr. Cruz suggested donors were tone-deaf on the issue because they did not appreciate the economic impact of what he said was illegal immigrants\u2019 pushing down American wages. \u201cThe politics of it would be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande,\u201d he said, adding that the news coverage would also differ if undocumented immigrants were seeking journalism jobs.\u201cThen we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation,\u201d he said.And, citing his own father\u2019s legal emigration from Cuba, Mr. Cruz said the suggestion that opposing an immigration overhaul meant that Republicans were anti-immigrant was \u201coffensive.\u201dAfter the early exchanges on immigration, Mr. Trump seemed to struggle in a debate focused largely on policy substance. He was not helped by an audience that booed him when he criticized Carly Fiorina for trying to cut off Mr. Paul\u2019s answer on a foreign policy question. \u201cWhy does she keep interrupting everybody?\u201d Mr. Trump asked. Moments later, audience members chuckled when he boasted about being \u201cstable mates\u201d with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when they appeared on the same episode of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201dMs. Fiorina, who has slipped after a strong performance in the September debate, sought to revive herself with a story about a woman she met on the campaign trail who expressed concern for her children\u2019s future. She called for upending the political status quo and proposed a series of fiscal overhauls, winning a booming ovation by saying, \u201cWe must take our government back.\u201d\u201cFive major agencies that I would eliminate: the I.R.S., the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, uh, the Department of Commerce and HUD, and then 25 specific programs,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Jonathan Martin reported from Milwaukee, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Canada Ready to Share Again", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorToronto \u2014 The resounding demand for change that saw the Liberal leader Justin Trudeau swept into the Canadian prime minister\u2019s office, and Stephen Harper out of it, also introduced other auspicious changes, setting the country on a different but familiar path. The 338-seat House of Commons now has more female representatives than ever before, and there are 46 members from minority groups (though African-Canadians are still underrepresented). The country\u2019s first lawmaker born in Afghanistan was elected. The 10 members from Canada\u2019s indigenous population of about 1.4 million is also a record.These results are immensely gratifying to a majority of Canadians who understand that Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples \u2014 First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis \u2014 hold a pivotal place in Canada, and that the modern nation-state was founded on the labor of successive tides of immigrants who left behind wars or natural disasters and built new lives here.The election produced other stunning numbers. Participation was up 7 percent from the last election and, at 68 percent, exceeded even the turnout of the recent British election, in which Scottish separatism was such an urgent, motivating issue. The combination of the young Mr. Trudeau\u2019s appeal and a federal initiative to woo normally apathetic student voters spurred a marked rise in the youth vote. And the surge at polls on First Nations reserves was so unexpected that photocopied ballots needed to be used in some places.The enormity of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s victory was unanticipated even by his Liberal Party, though, in retrospect, it had an overwhelming logic. Voters across this vast nation of 36 million were resolutely determined that they would not wake up on Oct. 20 to another day of Stephen Harper and the Conservatives.Within 24 hours of his triumph, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s activities were harbingers of a very different ethos from Mr. Harper\u2019s, in which division was persistently used to advance political causes. Network television followed Mr. Trudeau as he took selfies with hijab-wearing commuters at a Montreal metro station. Pictures of him dancing with Hindus and eating with Muslims circulated on social networks. These are images that mean far more to most Canadians than ones of their good-looking new leader with his chest bared that acolytes of celebrity culture have seized upon with such elation.What Canadians see in these new images is that a better country, a welcoming place of second chances, has not been lost. Canadians know their good fortune is a historical accident, a byproduct of bountiful space and resources, and they feel it is their duty to share it. Canadian foreign policy in the second half of the 20th century \u2014 its traditions of peace operations, humanitarian enterprises and open immigration policies \u2014 was shaped by this idea.So Little Jamaica, a portion of the federal district where I ran for Parliament for the New Democratic Party and lost, is populated with Canadians of Caribbean origin who arrived in the 1960s. The area is emblematic of so many immigrant communities across the country that benefited from Canada\u2019s welcome. My party, which appeared headed for victory just weeks before the vote, faced an almost impossible task there because of the memory of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Justin\u2019s father and the charismatic leader who opened the door for them.\u201cIn Jamaica,\u201d said one potential voter, \u201cwe say, don\u2019t damn the bridge that you cross.\u201d\u201cHe fed me when I was hungry,\u201d said another.Pierre Trudeau became the Liberal Party leader and prime minister on April 20, 1968, the same day that the Conservative lawmaker Enoch Powell warned in London of \u201crivers of blood\u201d should Britain permit Commonwealth immigration. Subsequently, many Caribbean emigrants chose Canada, not Britain, as their new home.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election offers promise in helping to solve one of the world\u2019s most difficult problems. He is well positioned to address the issue of Syrian refugees, much on the minds of Canadian voters keen to expunge the embarrassment Mr. Harper brought on when he equated the country\u2019s tradition of humanitarian work with \u201cdropping aid on dead people.\u201d That line resonated poorly when the body of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi washed up on a Turkish beach three weeks later.Canada, a country founded on the awarding of land grants to refugees (those from the American Revolutionary War among the first), has the will and the resources to do significantly more to alleviate the current European crisis over mass migration.Mr. Trudeau also faces daunting challenges in the crises of Canada\u2019s indigenous population. Too many First Nations reserves are plagued with failing infrastructure. Some reserves have not had access to clean drinking water for more than a decade. The Conservatives\u2019 indifference to the tragedy of some 1,200 aboriginal women and girls murdered or missing since 1980 is an open wound. And too many of Canada\u2019s aboriginal youth feel a dearth of hope.Still, these are the days of greater optimism for Canada\u2019s future. For more than 10 years, Mr. Harper and the Conservatives, intent in their \u201cwar on terror\u201d and constantly warning about threats to security and the economy, worked unrelentingly to eradicate the Canadian consensus that calls for building bridges at home but also abroad.Some Canadians who turned out to vote for the first time to set the country in a new direction were just 4 years old when planes were flown into the World Trade Center\u2019s Twin Towers, ushering in a new reality for so many in the West. Is it possible, at least in Canada, that the long shadow of Sept. 11 is, to some degree, receding? An earlier version of this essay used the phrases \u201cFirst Nations\u201d and \u201caboriginal peoples\u201d interchangeably in some places. First Nations are one of three distinct indigenous groups in Canada, the others being Inuit and M\u00e9tis.Noah Richler is an author and broadcaster.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Scare Tactics of Turkey\u2019s President Erdogan Pay Off", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThough the A.K.P. won about half the vote, it did not gain enough seats in Parliament to enable Mr. Erdogan to change the Constitution to create the strong executive presidency he has sought since he assumed the office last year. But the A.K.P. majority will mean a continuation of 12 years of one-party rule, and most probably a continuation of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian domination of the Turkish government.Mr. Erdogan engineered Sunday\u2019s vote after the last elections, on June 7, not only failed to secure the seats he needed for his presidential scheme, but cost the A.K.P. its majority and allowed a pro-Kurdish coalition, the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, to enter Parliament for the first time. Instead of helping to form a coalition government after that vote, Mr. Erdogan called for new elections.In the intervening time Turkey resumed bombing attacks on Syrian Kurds and violence flared in the country\u2019s volatile southeast. Opposition politicians were assailed and the government\u2019s longstanding harassment of the news media reached new levels. On the eve of the election, the police raided the last television channels critical of Mr. Erdogan, which had belonged to an Islamic movement that had gone from support of Mr. Erdogan to fierce opposition.The worst outcome of the election would be for Mr. Erdogan to use the results to justify further intimidation of critics as he seeks to make the presidency more powerful. Even if he does not achieve that goal, he will continue wielding power from behind the scenes, and there are fears that the pro-Kurdish coalition and others who campaigned against him will become targets of reprisals.In a chilling taste of what may be coming, on the day after the election Turkish police officers raided a weekly magazine charged with \u201cinsulting the Turkish president.\u201d The editor was detained and distribution was halted.Mr. Erdogan was quick to take aim at his foreign critics. The vote, he said, \u201cshould be respected by the whole world, but I have not seen such maturity.\u201d It should be respected; voters have put their trust in him to restore stability. The question now is whether he will use his office to ensure the survival of democracy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Downside of an Up Economy: Employee Turnover", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost employees \u2014 no matter how many years they have been with a company or how much talent and hard work they bring to the table \u2014 feel disposable. And most employers do little to discourage that feeling.But as the economy rights itself, companies are becoming more concerned about retaining good workers for the long haul.\u201cIt\u2019s the No. 1 issue for H.R. professionals,\u201d said Chason Hecht, president of Retensa, an employee retention consulting firm. Mr. Hecht said the problem was \u201cpervasive across industries, but some are hit harder than others \u2014 like health care,\u201d which is scrambling to find and keep people to deal with an aging population.\u201cIn my experience, doing this for 15 years, this is the first time it has scored this high,\u201d said Josh Bersin, founder of the research firm Bersin by Deloitte and one of the report\u2019s authors.As the Deloitte report states, \u201cOrganizations are recognizing the need to focus on culture and dramatically improve employee engagement as they face a looming crisis in engagement and retention.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising that employers should worry about losing their best workers as the economy gets better and job options open up. But a vastly changed work culture and the advent of the consumer Internet have altered the familiar cycle.Benefits are different from what they were 20 years ago. Retirement savings, for instance, have become more portable as 401(k)\u2019s have largely replaced traditional pensions. But the Internet has brought changes that are every bit as radical to job hunting and hiring. LinkedIn profiles advertise workers\u2019 skills and experience to the world. Sites like Glassdoor.com provide insight into a business\u2019s culture that wasn\u2019t available in the past.\u201cWorkers have changed faster than the workplace,\u201d Mr. Bersin said. So companies, especially older ones, are trying to figure out how to hold on to good employees \u2014 if not for the remainder of their working lives, then at least for a healthy part of them.The premium that employers have placed on retention reflects the high cost of turnover: Experts estimate it can cost as much as twice an employee\u2019s salary to recruit, hire and train a new worker.And close friends often follow one another out the door. According to John J. Sullivan, a professor of management at San Francisco State University who specializes in human resource issues, when one person leaves, several often follow suit. \u201cSo it\u2019s not replacing one person, it\u2019s replacing three to five,\u201d he said.In any work force, said Professor Sullivan, there is a percentage of people whom employers \u201cwould go all out to keep, a percentage whom they would regret would leave but would let them go, and the Homer Simpsons\u201d \u2014 or employees who should have already left.\u201cIf you don\u2019t readapt or relearn, it\u2019s time to go,\u201d he said.\u201cEveryone still wants to love and be inspired by their job,\u201d Mr. Hecht said. \u201cWhat has changed is that people have a lower tolerance than ever if they don\u2019t feel fulfilled.\u201dIn the past, managers had to rely on anecdotes to find out why people were walking out the door. But now, the ability to do online surveys, crunch large amounts of data and track trends means \u201cwe have a science behind what works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.But the current obsession among employers is worker engagement. Employees are engaged, experts say, when they feel productive, think they are contributing to their company\u2019s mission, have trust and confidence in their managers and are given the opportunity to grow and advance \u2014 not necessarily by climbing the corporate ladder, but by learning new skills.From Wall Street to Washington and in the towers of academia, people are buzzing about what some say is the pernicious focus in corporate America on short-term profits.And how to make sure staff members are happy and engaged? Ask them \u2014 and not just once a year.\u201cWith annual performance reviews, everyone is alienated, so 50 to 60 percent of companies are completely revamping the way they do them,\u201d Mr. Bersin said.Instead, Mr. Hecht said, companies need to have a continuing conversation with employees to understand their changing needs and expectations.According to Mr. Hecht: \u201cBosses need to say, \u2018You tell me what quality of life looks like to you. You tell me if you\u2019re better off with a gym membership or a dog walker or dry cleaning. I can\u2019t give you all three, but I can give you one.\u2019 \u201dNot all employees are feeling the love. Spherion also surveyed about 2,000 workers as part of its report and found that this year only about one-tenth of employees thought their companies were putting more effort into keeping them. About a quarter thought their companies were putting in less effort.Less effort is not an option for EisnerAmper, an accounting firm with more than 1,300 employees. Richard Fisher, a head of the firm\u2019s human resources department, said his workers received daily phone calls from competitors and recruiters looking to poach them.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an issue, ever since the economy began turning around,\u201d he said. Big accounting firms that laid off workers during the recession now \u201chave to staff up like crazy.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything to keep our people here,\u201d he said.Victoria Ghafoor, 27, a senior-level accountant at EisnerAmper, frequently receives calls and emails from recruiters and competitors.\u201cI get messages to my LinkedIn profile constantly,\u201d she said.Ms. Ghafoor has been at her company for five years \u2014 it was her first job \u2014 and says she has no plans to leave in the near future. She is aware that the company is doing more to keep staff members happy, including parties, a drink cart on Friday afternoons \u2014 Ms. Ghafoor\u2019s own suggestion \u2014 and greater encouragement of workers to feel more ownership of their projects and clients.To comply with company protocol, Ms. Ghafoor lets EisnerAmper\u2019s human resources department know when she has been contacted about other jobs on her work phone number or work email address.\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a better thing for them to know I\u2019m being contacted all the time.\u201dIt is this constant drumbeat that spurs EisnerAmper to try to create a workplace they hope few would want to abandon.One focus is on providing flexible work schedules and allowing more people to work remotely, said Hayes MacArthur, the other head of the firm\u2019s human resource department.The company still does annual reviews, but it is working on offering more feedback in real time, Mr. Fisher said.\u201cOne area we need to improve is face-to-face sit-downs telling people, \u2018You did well in this area, but you need to do better in this area,\u2019 \u201d he said. The company regularly offers classes on how to have difficult conversations.It\u2019s also important to let top talents know how much they are valued before they hand in their notice, he added.\u201cThey have to know where they stand and what we see in their future,\u201d he said. That means spot bonuses, pats on the back and perks like leadership academies that their peers may not receive.Another strategy is to change the old-fashioned exit interview, which most people feel isn\u2019t effective: Employees who don\u2019t want to burn bridges are often less than honest. Instead, Professor Sullivan suggested, do the exit interview six months after the worker has left, when the former employee may have better perspective.Even better, Mr. MacArthur said, would be to follow up a few months after a worker has left and find out if he or she has any interest in coming back.So far, a few employees have decided to \u201cboomerang\u201d to their old jobs, he said. \u201cWhen someone returns, it sends a great message to the rest of the firm.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To meet its goals, analysts say, China must add six to eight reactor units \u2014 a plant usually has several \u2014 every year over the coming decade, most likely including its first in inland provinces like Henan and neighboring Hubei.To the government and many energy experts, China faces a choice: Build more nuclear plants, despite the public opposition and safety risks, or continue to rely on coal and accept the pollution and greenhouse gases that go with it.\u201cA lot is at stake here,\u201d Mr. Hibbs said. \u201cIf the Chinese don\u2019t get it right, their entire plans for shifting the electricity generation system toward noncarbon sources would come under considerable stress.\u201dEven if all goes as planned, coal will continue to dominate the energy supply in China. But proponents of the government\u2019s approach say serious cuts to coal use are possible if enough nuclear plants provide a steady alternate source of electricity.Since starting up its first power reactor in 1991, China has repeatedly wrestled with the pace and scale of its nuclear ambitions. Plans for a nuclear plant in Hubin Village, for example, go back over a decade, part of a rush of proposals for inland plants put forward after 2000.Now, officials and engineers who support nuclear power have been lobbying for construction of inland plants to resume as part of China\u2019s next five-year growth plan, which begins in 2016.Up to now, China has built its reactors close to the coast, where water needed for cooling systems is plentiful and there are big cities nearby hungry for power. But the next phase is almost certain to push inland, and that has become a chief focus for opponents of the nuclear program.They argue that limited water supplies and poor radiation dispersal make the proposed inland sites more dangerous, and that the sites are more densely populated than places where reactors have been built away from the coast in countries like the United States. They worry especially about the risk of radiation leaking into China\u2019s biggest river, the Yangtze.Opponents of nuclear power in China maintain that the country can achieve its clean energy goals without a nuclear building spree, by investing heavily in improving solar and wind power and by upgrading the power grid so it can send electricity more efficiently across vast distances.They point to the deadly explosions in Tianjin, where hazardous chemicals appear to have been stored improperly at a facility close to residential areas, as an example of how of lax regulation, graft and official obfuscation can undo the Chinese government\u2019s promises to put safety first.Ning Li, dean of the School of Energy Research at Xiamen University in China, who supports greater use of atomic energy, said \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d protests were on the rise. \u201cSo far, it hasn\u2019t risen to the level of stopping nuclear, but in some areas it is slowing it down,\u201d he said.In Hubin, the authorities have sought to reassure residents by taking representatives to visit a nuclear plant in Zhejiang Province in eastern China. \u201cWe have to believe that the government is doing this because it must and can keep us safe,\u201d said Mr. Wang, the retired village official.Other villagers expressed a mix of resignation and worry. Residents in Nanyang, a city of 1.5 million about 20 miles to the south, have also voiced alarm on the Internet and called for the project to be scuttled.\u201cHere and around Nanyang, there\u2019s opposition, but that\u2019s futile,\u201d said Li Chaoyong, 50, who builds and repairs homes around Hubin. \u201cBut if there are problems again like in Japan ...\u201d His voice trailed off, and he shook his head.A picture on Sunday with an article about the collision of China\u2019s nuclear goals with the fears of residents in places with plans for atomic energy plants was published in error, using information from Getty Images. It showed a coal-fired power plant near Ninghai, China, not a nuclear plant.Owen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Africa Court Sentences 8 Ex-Policemen in Immigrant\u2019s Murder", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A South African judge on Wednesday sentenced eight former police officers to prison for the murder of a taxi driver from Mozambique who was handcuffed to the back of a police van, dragged about a third of a mile and then placed in a police holding cell, where he was beaten.Judge Bam sentenced each of the former officers to 15 years in prison. He said he decided against the maximum penalty, 25 years, because the killing was not premeditated and because the men did not have records of misconduct. The men were dismissed from the police force in a hearing last year.\u201cWe are happy with the sentence,\u201d the prosecutor, Charles Mnisi, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe can only hope that it sends a message to all other police officers in South Africa, and helps to revive the respect our society used to have for the police.\u201dBenedict Ndaba, a lawyer for the former officers, told reporters that he planned to file an appeal.Mr. Macia\u2019s arrest and death occurred on Feb. 26, 2013, in Daveyton, a township about 25 miles east of Johannesburg. He had been suspected of parking illegally. According to the former police officers, the crowd turned hostile after Mr. Macia resisted arrest; Judge Bam found that the crowd\u2019s anger unnerved the men, but said it did not excuse what followed.\u201cThis was a barbaric act committed by the police, who are there to protect the community, and not to kill the community,\u201d a lawyer for Mr. Macia\u2019s family, Jose Nascimento, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI do understand, and feel very sorry for, policemen in South Africa, who put their lives at risk on a daily basis and are killed at an astronomically high rate. But one cannot accept rogue policemen. This was just madness.\u201dMr. Macia was supporting his parents, two nephews, a girlfriend, Biuda Mazive, and their young son, Sergio, who all live in Mozambique. The family has filed a lawsuit against the South African government, seeking 6.5 million rand, about $457,000. Government officials have said that they intend to settle the case, but that they are negotiating the level of compensation.\u201cIt makes migration a hot political issue and turns migrants into a scapegoat for the lack of transformation, the lack of jobs, the lack of socioeconomic equity that South Africa faces,\u201d she said in a telephone interview, adding, \u201cThis was a landmark case, showing that the law does indeed punish heinous crimes of xenophobic violence.\u201dIn the past, many came for jobs in the mining industry, but today a large number run small businesses, often in the underground economy, or provide basic services like driving a taxi, as Mr. Macia did. It is rare, though not impossible, for the migrants to seek and attain citizenship.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Jeffrey Lacker Is Worried About Inflation", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyMr. Lacker refers to his views as \u201cold-fashioned,\u201d emphasizing he sees little new in the current environment. He does not think that the relationship between employment and inflation has changed; that the Fed should consider other issues, like financial stability, in setting monetary policy; or that the economic health of other countries should play a larger role in the Fed\u2019s deliberations.\u201cA central bank\u2019s ability to influence inflation and how it does so is essentially unchanged,\u201d Mr. Lacker said Thursday in a speech at the Cato Institute.In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. Lacker also talked about being the only Fed president who has raised rates, why the gold standard was a bad idea and how to improve the Fed\u2019s communications. The answers are lightly edited for clarity.It\u2019s looking like you won\u2019t need to dissent again in December. After all these years, the Fed seems poised to raise rates.I can\u2019t predict the meeting and what my colleagues will do, but it does look like the recent data, and particularly the October employment report, has strengthened the case for raising rates. I\u2019ve thought the case was strong for over six months now. I\u2019m hoping I can be more persuasive in December. You and Janet Yellen are the only members of the Federal Open Market Committee who were there the last time the Fed raised rates, way back in 2006. Are you telling the new folks how it works?It\u2019s been a long time. There has been this sort of generational change on the F.O.M.C. since I\u2019ve been there. But I don\u2019t think people forget how. I think it\u2019s pretty clear. You just write the statement and send it to New York.Yeah. You\u2019ve said you were ready to raise rates six months ago. Do you think the Fed will now need to raise rates more quickly?It\u2019s too soon to tell. I think there\u2019s a chance we are behind the curve, but it will be a year or two before we figure that out. With the anticipation that we\u2019re likely to raise rates gradually and the committee having signaled that expectation, I think we have room to accelerate if we find out that we wish we\u2019d started earlier. Ms. Yellen has suggested the Fed is likely to raise rates by about one percentage point per year. Is that fast enough?That\u2019s a plausible pace for me, but if I picked a number it might be a little higher than that, a little more rapid than that. Both Democrats and Republicans have been lashing the Fed lately. Democrats want rates to stay low; Republicans think you\u2019re dragging your feet. Surely you can\u2019t ignore the noise entirely?I think everyone at the Fed reads the paper. But in my experience there\u2019s an extremely strong culture of putting aside nonanalytical considerations and letting the economic analysis lead us to what we think is right for the U.S. economy given our mandates. Everyone is entitled to a view and we welcome the scrutiny, as we should in a democracy, but at the end of the day you have to let the economics of the decision you are facing guide you.You\u2019ve said for months that in your judgment there is no significant slack remaining in the labor market. And we\u2019re hearing widespread reports of wage pressures, and it\u2019s increased notably over the last year or year and a half. And it\u2019s not just the high-skilled areas where you\u2019d expect. Building trades, hotel workers, hospitality sector in some areas where they\u2019re having to pay 4 or 5 or 6 percent more to keep people. So we\u2019re hearing a striking increase in the extent of reports of wage pressures, across occupational categories. It\u2019s not uniform but it\u2019s pretty broad. Are things on fire? Not yet. But there\u2019s definitely a notable increase in the extent of anecdotal reports of wage pressure. So that\u2019s another piece of the puzzle. So why haven\u2019t we seen faster inflation?There\u2019s a couple of things about the relationship between slack and inflation that are important to bear in mind:Second, there\u2019s this confusion about real and nominal that I think infects the discussion, particularly of wages and slack. Real wages have accelerated over the last year because inflation has fallen and the rate of gain in nominal wages hasn\u2019t changed much. The wage pressures we\u2019ve been hearing about, they show up in the macro data as real wage pressures.And the historical evidence suggests that there\u2019s some lag before things accelerate as you reduce slack significantly. In 1966-67, we had unemployment at 5 percent, we pushed it to 4, and it was 1967 and 1968 when inflation took off. So there was a significant lag in the way that relationship seems to have worked in the past. Do you think things might catch fire? Do you see a real upside?Consumer spending is pretty strong right now. We\u2019ve had two years of over 3 percent real spending growth, which is a notable step up. Earlier in the recovery we were doing under 2 percent. This is an important macroeconomic development.Could the overall tenor of conditions change? I think it could. I think the inflation picture has the potential to change relatively quickly. It\u2019s done that in the past where over the course of 6 to 12 months a picture in which inflation looked on the soft side changed to the opposite, and I think we have to be prepared to respond strongly if that takes place. Is there an upside for economic growth, too?It\u2019s a possibility. It\u2019s hard to see. It would take a few things lining up. The sluggishness of productivity growth is going to hold us back, combined with the lower growth of the working-age population. I think those two things are going to tie you to fairly low growth numbers, so I\u2019m not quite sure I can see where growth is going to get to 4 percent without some shift in the productivity numbers. Some of your colleagues see a significant risk that the weakness of the global economy will weigh on domestic growth. How worried are you?One always has to be mindful of economic developments in our trading partners, but we\u2019ve fallen prey to overestimating those risks in the past. 1998-99 is a classic example where we eased three times in response to what we thought were the domestic implications of financial turmoil abroad, difficulties abroad, and ended up behind the curve in \u201999 and too slow to take it back.It\u2019s true that you need to look beyond the direct effect of trade with China. Other emerging markets are weakening as well. But if you look at the fundamentals of U.S. economic growth, they seem tied closely to growth in real income here and growth in consumer spending here. Manufacturing and our export trade is kind of a small part of our economy. It\u2019s not the major chunk of activity. You got to take a balanced view, but I think what we\u2019ve seen since September is the downside risks seem to have moderated substantially. Senator Ted Cruz called for a resumption of the gold standard during the Republican presidential debate Tuesday night. Defend the Fed.The historical record on the gold standard is pretty clear, that the automatic adjustment mechanism that it provides for rectifying monetary imbalances is blunt and crude and involves relatively costly adjustments. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t really promise price stability, because the relative price of gold can vary over time.What I sense is motivating proponents of the gold standard is a desire for a more predictable, less discretionary central bank. And that\u2019s fair. That\u2019s perfectly fair. But that\u2019s difficult for any central bank to provide because the future is uncertain and appropriate policy is going to vary with future circumstances, and providing clarity about the way in which future circumstances are likely to affect policy is very difficult. What central banks are limited to is committing to certain principles and a commitment to exercise discretion in a way that is consistent with those principles. That\u2019s in between an algebraic rule and pure discretion. And the closer we can get to being predictable the better, I think. And I think that\u2019s where central banks have focused: to try and make themselves more accountable and predictable.But I think abolishing central banks is a nonstarter. I take the historical evolution of central banks to be an adaptation to the way that market economies work. The need for some conscious management of the supply of monetary assets, because the demand for those assets fluctuates with a wide variety of factors, and a gold standard or other schemes just don\u2019t look as if they provide the right flexibility of adapting supply to changes in demand. I assume for the same reasons you do not favor the House bill requiring the Fed to publish a policy rule and justify any subsequent deviations?When we discuss policy, we make reference to algebraic rules and what they recommend because those rules summarize in a convenient form the past pattern of our reactions to economic data. They\u2019re a benchmark against which we can gauge whether we\u2019re departing in substantial ways. It shouldn\u2019t determine what we do, but they embody past behavior in a way we need to keep in mind. I think we could probably do more to share the rules we do consult and to discuss the relationship between our current policy settings and the predictions of those rules. Several Republican candidates also suggested the government has not done enough to address the risk of large bank failures during a future crisis. This is a view shared by a fair number of Democrats, too.I think our preparations for another crisis are incomplete. We\u2019ve done a substantial amount of work. We\u2019re a long way down the road toward where we need to be, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.I\u2019ve said before that I think the living wills \u2013 the resolution planning process \u2014 is the linchpin. Without credible plans \u2013 credible to us and credible to markets and credible to investors \u2013 we\u2019re going to be in a box again, we\u2019re going to be in a bind should one of these companies experience financial distress that requires contemplating a rescue or resolution. The plans are getting more robust with each submission, but there\u2019s still work that remains to be done.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Auto Enthusiasts, the Right to Tinker With Cars\u2019 Software", "Date": "2015-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast month, officials gave auto enthusiasts who want to beef up their car\u2019s performance the right to tinker with vehicle software without incurring the legal wrath of carmakers. The decision was one of many changes to a federal copyright law, including allowing people to \u201cjailbreak\u201d their mobile phones and reprogram older video games.Digital-rights activists have applauded the changes, which are scheduled to take effect next year. But environmental regulators and carmakers have warned that the decision opens a new front in a cat-and-mouse game with car lovers who soup up their engines \u2014 perhaps violating emissions standards.Volkswagen has admitted using deceptive software on a corporate scale to evade emissions limits on some of its diesel cars. But long before the VW scandal, individual car owners turned to aftermarket components or software fixes to increase engine performance in ways that could produce more pollution.\u201cIt has been going on forever,\u201d said Mike Norris, who runs a company near Indianapolis that legally customizes cars. \u201cHot rod guys don\u2019t want to be known as tree-huggers.\u201d To avoid detection, experts say, tinkerers reprogram car software settings or use \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to try to fool emissions testing equipment.The practice was so widespread nearly a decade ago that the Environmental Protection Agency outlawed a defeat device known as an oxygen sensor simulator. Such units made it look as if a car\u2019s catalytic converter was working properly, even if it was disconnected.More recently, Edge Products, a maker of auto components in Ogden, Utah, agreed to pay a $500,000 fine in 2013 for selling devices that let owners of diesel pickup trucks to disconnect an emissions-control component without activating a warning light. The environmental impact of the devices, which were sold under the Edge Racing brand name, was significant. Federal regulators said the more than 9,000 pickup trucks equipped with the unit emitted excess pollution equal to the amount generated by 422 new long-haul trucks operating for 29 years.Practices like these can be taken to extremes. For instance, there is \u201ccoal rolling\u201d \u2014 the practice of modifying diesel pickup trucks to intentionally belch clouds of black smoke, often from upright exhaust pipes that look like chrome-plated smokestacks. An employee of Parleys Diesel Performance, a company in St. George, Utah, that makes the towering, customized exhaust pipes, said, \u201cIt is not the goal of our company to help people blast out black smoke.\u201dThe pipes themselves are perfectly legal. The smoke is created by modifying the car to increase the amount of fuel going to a vehicle\u2019s engine without increasing air intake.Today\u2019s cars contain sophisticated engine control software that determines how a vehicle\u2019s engine operates, including fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions. In Volkswagen\u2019s case, software could detect when a car was being tested for emissions and activate its pollution controls, then deactivate them when the car was being driven normally.Carmakers and companies that supply emissions-testing equipment have long been on the lookout for tinkerers. Mr. Norris, the Indiana car customizer, said that auto companies began using special techniques about a decade ago to detect if a car\u2019s factory-installed software had been altered. Altered software, he said, could give the carmakers a reason to void the warranty.One emissions-testing company, Opus Systems, uses a patented method to identify cars equipped with devices built to fool state inspection equipment. \u201cOur method is meant to catch fraud by individual car owners,\u201d said Lothar Geilen, the chief executive of Opus, which supplies emissions-testing equipment to 22 states.The latest avenue for engine tinkering was opened last month when the Library of Congress, which oversees the United States Copyright Office, approved several new exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a far-reaching 1998 statute that was meant to bring copyright law into the digital era. Every three years, federal officials review potential exemptions to the rule.As part of the latest three-year review, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group based in San Francisco, filed petitions seeking changes to parts of the laws that prohibited consumers from unlocking software \u201caccess controls\u201d on certain products. Two of the petitions dealt directly with vehicle software, including software used to control a car\u2019s engine and emissions-control units.Kit Walsh, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the group believed that researchers and car owners needed access to vehicle software not only to make repairs or to adjust a car\u2019s performance, but also to improve security. To demonstrate security vulnerabilities in automotive software, two security experts, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, recently performed an experiment in which they remotely hacked into a Jeep Cherokee and took control from the driver.Mr. Walsh said many companies that make auto components supported the changes to the law. One such company, Derive Systems of Sanford, Fla., reprograms engine computers in ways that it says improve fuel efficiency while reducing emissions.The E.P.A. also warned that the exemption could result in more pollution. \u201cBased on the information E.P.A. has obtained in the context of enforcement activities, the majority of modifications to engine software are being performed to increase power and/or boost fuel economy,\u201d the agency said in a letter to the Copyright Office opposing the change. \u201cThese kinds of modifications will often increase emissions.\u201dThe auto industry, including Volkswagen, also opposed the change, saying it could compromise vehicle safety, given the increasingly complex software systems being used to control cars and alert drivers to hazards.Mr. Walsh said that independent researchers might well have detected Volkswagen\u2019s fraud earlier if they had had access to its software. He also said he did not believe that car owners would abuse their new rights. \u201cPeople have tinkered with cars in ways that is both good and bad for the environment,\u201d he said.Despite the change to the copyright law, it remains illegal to alter engine performance in any way that evades emissions standards. Violators can face fines of up to $3,750 for each defeat device and up to $37,500 for each noncompliant vehicle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax-Cutting Move That Pfizer Can Hardly Resist", "Date": "2015-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesGive Pfizer, the giant drug maker, points for boldness and persistence: The company has bravely put \u201ctax inversions\u201d back in the headlines.Pfizer, which already holds roughly $140 billion overseas and is quite skillful at minimizing its taxes, is considering a deal that could move its legal tax headquarters from New York to Dublin, where it could save bundles more.The core problem is that, from a purely financial viewpoint, tax inversions make sense for companies like Pfizer. While rarely, if ever, paid in full, the 35 percent statutory corporate tax rate in the United States is higher than in other countries. Most important, the United States taxes the worldwide income of its domestic companies, while many major countries do not. Even though there are ways around that requirement, it is tempting for American companies to move their tax homes elsewhere.Edward Kleinbard, former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, says the American tax code should be revamped so that inversions are no longer sensible. But that change won\u2019t happen overnight. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that Congress imposes a two-year timeout on tax inversions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t act, tax inversions will be very appealing for many American corporations.\u201dThey still appeal to Pfizer. Last month, the company revealed that it was engaged in merger talks with Allergan, a smaller pharmaceutical company that operates in New Jersey but has already shifted its own tax domicile to Ireland through a tax-inversion merger.Mr. Read is an accountant, and Pfizer represents a textbook case of complex global accounting. What is fascinating about the company\u2019s accounting achievements \u2014 if you can conceive of accounting as fascinating \u2014 is that Pfizer has been deftly exploiting tax anomalies for years, yet it is evidently convinced that it can do even better with a foreign tax address.As a matter of fact, Pfizer\u2019s adroit tax accounting is featured in a textbook \u2014 \u201cFinancial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods and Uses,\u201d now in its 14th edition. Roman L. Weil, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is one of the book\u2019s authors. He said he had chosen Pfizer because its work was both elaborate and \u201cunexceptionable.\u201d\u201cIt illustrates a phenomenon common to large, multinational U.S. corporations,\u201d he said. Much of their revenue is earned and taxed abroad \u2014 and companies have considerable leeway in allocating that revenue and costs to cut taxes. When multinationals based in the United States want to \u201cbring those after-tax dollars home, they will have to pay further taxes to the U.S., maybe 25 percent of every dollar. It\u2019s not surprising that companies like Pfizer and G.E. want to keep those dollars abroad so they don\u2019t have to pay those taxes.\u201dOn top of that $74 billion, Pfizer keeps an additional, unspecified amount abroad that it says it does intend to repatriate, so it makes a \u201cprovision for taxes on income\u201d for that sum. A note in its 2014 financial statement also says it has accrued a total of $21 billion in \u201cdeferred tax liabilities\u201d over many years. That implies that it\u2019s holding a big chunk of cash overseas that it expects to bring home one day. How much, exactly? Based on information in Pfizer\u2019s financial statements, I calculated that this second stash also amounts to more than $70 billion. I sent Pfizer my calculations.\u201cAlthough I can\u2019t provide you with an exact dollar amount, your assumption about grossing up the $21 billion is correct,\u201d Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman, said in an email. In other words, Pfizer keeps $74 billion abroad \u201cindefinitely\u201d and a further $70 billion or so that it says it will bring to the United States as needed. \u201cWe already repatriate funds in the normal course of business to help meet our domestic cash requirements,\u201d Ms. Campion said.By moving its tax headquarters to Ireland, Pfizer could radically simplify its tax planning. Although tax inversions are hardly ideal for the American tax base, Professor Weil said, a wave of them might actually be better for the economy than the situation we have now. Under the current alignment, he said, American multinational corporations like Pfizer might invest more money in the United States, not less, if they had their tax domiciles abroad. They might be more inclined to do so, he said, because they could book earnings abroad and bring the money back to America \u201cwithout incurring that additional United States tax.\u201dMr. Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at the University of Southern California, said the morality of tax inversions was not an issue that C.E.O.s should even be expected to address. \u201cThere is a moral imperative here, but it falls on the shoulders of Congress, not on corporations,\u201d he said.C.E.O.s can be expected to act in their corporations\u2019 self-interest under the economic model in place now, he said. \u201cIf the results are plainly inconsistent with the national interest, Congress has to fix things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t expect the corporate community to hold itself to values higher than the marketplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall St. Ties Linger as Image Issue for Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2015-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cPeople knew what they were doing back then, because of greed, and it caused me harm,\u201d said Mr. Wittneben, the Democratic chairman in Emmet County, Iowa. \u201cWe were raised a certain way here. Fairness is a big deal.\u201dThe next day he endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the presidential race.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s windfalls from Wall Street banks and other financial services firms \u2014 $3 million in paid speeches and $17 million in campaign contributions over the years \u2014 have become a major vulnerability in states with early nomination contests. Some party officials who remain undecided in the 2016 presidential race see her as overly cozy with big banks and other special interests. At a time when liberals are ascendant in the party, many Democrats believe her merely having \u201crepresented Wall Street as a senator from New York,\u201d as Mrs. Clinton reminded viewers in an October debate, is bad enough.It is an image problem that she cannot seem to shake.Mr. Sanders zeros in on Wall Street donations to Mrs. Clinton in an aggressive new television commercial that started running in Iowa and New Hampshire on Saturday: \u201cThe truth is, you can\u2019t change a corrupt system by taking its money,\u201d he warns.One of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most prominent supporters in Ohio, former State Senator Nina Turner, defected to Mr. Sanders this month in part, she said, because she felt he would be tougher on special interests. And some Democratic superdelegates, whose backing is crucial, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to big banks, and her invocation of 9/11 to defend her ties to Wall Street at the Nov. 14 debate, only made them further question her independence from the financial industry.\u201cMy parents had a saying in Spanish \u2014 \u2018Dime con qui\u00e9n andas y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres\u2019 \u2014 which means, \u2018Tell me who you\u2019re hanging with and I\u2019ll tell you who you are,\u2019\u201d said Alma R. Gonzalez, an uncommitted superdelegate from Florida. \u201cA lot of my Democratic friends feel that way about Hillary and Wall Street.\u201cAre the working people in this country going to be able to count on hard decisions being made by President Hillary Clinton with regard to her Wall Street chums?\u201d Ms. Gonzalez continued. \u201cWill she be another President Clinton who appoints a Treasury secretary from Wall Street? These are major concerns.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Clinton\u2019s close relationships with Wall Street executives like Robert E. Rubin of Goldman Sachs, whom he named his Treasury secretary, and his support for undoing parts of Glass-Steagall have contributed to misgivings about Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton has proposed imposing risk fees on unwieldy big banks and empowering regulators to break them up if necessary \u2014 though this is not the wholesale breakup that Mr. Sanders favors under a return of Glass-Steagall. She also proposes to make sure fines for corporate wrongdoing hit executive bonuses, and to pursue criminal prosecutions when justified.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton discussed her plans for regulating the financial industry, at a Democratic rally in North Charleston, S.C., where she spoke after Mr. Sanders and another candidate, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland. \u201cI have the toughest, most comprehensive proposals for dealing with Wall Street,\u201d she began, and a voter holding a \u201cBernie\u201d sign interrupted, \u201cBy taking their money!\u201d Mrs. Clinton continued, saying her plan would address not just Wall Street banks, but also insurance companies and the \u201cshadow banking\u201d industry of hedge funds and private equity firms. \u201cI am willing to break up the big banks, if they need to be broken up,\u201d she added. Yet even though she has taken tough stands in the past, such as chastising banks for widespread foreclosures in 2007 and 2008, some Democrats are skeptical that she would ever crack down hard on the executives in her social circles in Manhattan, the Hamptons and Washington. Jake Quinn, an uncommitted superdelegate from North Carolina, said he was concerned about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s willingness to clamp down on Wall Street malfeasance. \u201cThe financial sector\u2019s ongoing relative lack of accountability makes me suspicious of any candidate who sources it for significant support,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers say that any political harm resulting from her Wall Street ties will be minimal because she never took action in exchange for donations and that her proposals discredit claims that she would protect banks as president. The advisers also play down the possibility that Mrs. Clinton will face problems with voter enthusiasm and turnout if she is nominated.While Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley have argued that big donors inevitably had influence with her, her campaign has pushed back against suggestions that the financial services industry has bankrolled her campaign. Her aides also said ads by a new group, Future 45, attacking Mrs. Clinton would underscore her independence, because the group\u2019s major donors include Wall Street magnates like Paul Singer.\"When billionaire hedge fund managers are forming super PACs to run ads attacking her, it\u2019s clear they fear she will take action as president to crack down on the industry\u2019s abuses,\" said Brian Fallon, a Clinton campaign spokesman.Bashing Wall Street is not an automatic win for Mr. Sanders, however. Ms. Gonzalez, the Florida superdelegate, and some other undecided Democrats said they viewed Mr. Sanders as too hostile to banks and corporations and too divisive in his remarks about American wealth.But others said they were more concerned that Mrs. Clinton had not broken with Wall Street in a clear way, noting the lengths she went to at the debate to explain the relationship.\u201cShe was waving the bloody shirt of 9/11 to defend herself, which we\u2019re accustomed to seeing with demagogues on the right, and it just didn\u2019t feel quite right,\u201d said Kurt Meyer, a co-chairman of the Mitchell County Democrats in Iowa, who has not endorsed a candidate. \u201cShe connected two things, 9/11 and her ties to Wall Street, that I didn\u2019t like her sewing together.\u201dMs. Turner, the former Ohio lawmaker, said the blocks of foreclosed homes in Cleveland were a painful reminder that banks prioritize their own corporate interests. Mr. Sanders has been criticizing \u201cthe corrupt economy symbolized by Wall Street greed\u201d for decades, she said. \u201cHe shows righteous indignation and speaks for the common woman and man in saying they have a right to be outraged at Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Turner said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t just talk the talk. He walks the talk.\u201dAnd Mrs. Clinton? \u201cHer ties are her ties,\u201d Ms. Turner said. Amy Chozick contributed reporting from North Charleston, S.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gaps in Egyptian Airport Security Face Scrutiny After Crash", "Date": "2015-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt \u2014 The airport is surrounded by a wall topped with barbed wire. Armed sentries are stationed at its entrance, and passengers pass through two security screenings before reaching departure gates; before a recent flight, there were no fewer than eight uniformed guards standing around the checkpoint.\u201cWe can say that an in-flight breakup took place,\u201d Mr. Muqaddam said. \u201cSaying more than this would be entering the space of inference.\u201d He avoided even uttering the word \u201cbomb.\u201d Pressed about alternative theories under consideration, he mentioned the possibility of a lithium battery in luggage, a spark in a fuel tank, metal fatigue in the plane\u2019s fuselage or \u201cthe explosion of anything,\u201d and then hurried away from reporters.Airport officials have been trying to reassure travelers by letting foreign reporters tour and film the airport, including its baggage scanning facility. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said in London last week that Egyptian airport security authorities had willingly complied with specific requests the British government made 10 months ago about improving procedures at Sharm el Sheikh, a popular Red Sea resort on the Sinai Peninsula. \u201cWe have cooperated with them,\u201d Mr. Sisi said. \u201cAnd they checked the security actions; they were happy with that.\u201dOfficials from several European countries have raised concerns about Sharm el Sheikh and other Egyptian airports over the years, diplomats and other officials said last week. They have repeatedly complained that X-ray and explosive-detection equipment used to scan baggage is out of date, poorly maintained or poorly operated by inadequately trained staff members, officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the airport assessments were not public.Britain, which sends tens of thousands of tourists to Egypt each year, has provided the nation with more advanced detection equipment, and has insisted on precautions like special security checks at the boarding gate for Britain-bound flights. It requested further precautions after a specific threat arose around the Cairo airport this year. \u201cWe have been working for some considerable time with the Egyptians on Sharm,\u201d said a British official, adding that the Egyptian authorities had been responsive. \u201cWe set out a number of measures that we thought would be helpful and that should be put in place, and the Egyptians worked very closely with us on those.\u201dBefore the Russian-operated Airbus jetliner crashed in the Sinai Desert, killing all 224 people on board, the concerns about the Egyptian airports were never considered serious enough to warrant suspending flights there. But after the crash, the British took another look at Sharm el Sheikh, and found problems with the way checked baggage was screened and safeguarded afterward, according to officials briefed on the matter. Britain suspended flights for more than a day last week to put in place additional safeguards, including transporting passengers and luggage in separate planes. Several other countries have followed suit, including Russia, which sends by far the most tourists to Sharm el Sheikh. Russian officials said Saturday that more than 70,000 of their citizens were in Egypt awaiting the arrival of jets being sent to carry them home. British officials said on Saturday that there were about 19,000 Britons at Sharm el Sheikh and that it would take 10 days to get them all home. The exodus from Sharm el Sheikh has dealt a devastating blow to\u00a0Egypt\u2019s already sputtering tourism industry. The loss of foreign currency from tourists is likely to greatly increase downward pressure on the value of the Egyptian pound, compounding the damage to the broader economy.A Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane.Only a small number of Western European airlines operated direct flights to Sharm el Sheikh before the crash, flying from Britain, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Airlines from some countries, including France and the Netherlands, stopped offering direct service in recent years, in part out of security concerns, European officials said.Yasser Jahin, the deputy director of the Sharm el Sheikh airport, said that staff members were \u201cfollowing international standards, with a precise and high level of security.\u201d Since the crash, he added, the number of military and police patrols outside the perimeter of the airport has increased. He noted that several airlines were still showing confidence in the airport, with five German charter flights arriving on Saturday, bringing in more than 800 tourists and departing with passengers and their luggage. German security specialists were on hand at the airport, Mr. Jahin said.As Egypt has faced growing pressure to explain its theories of the crash, government officials have lashed out at allies, including the United States and Britain, saying they had leaked intelligence about the disaster to news outlets without sharing it with the Egyptians.\u201cWe expected that we would have been informed of any available information on the technical level, instead of it being released so widely in the media,\u201d the foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, complained in a news conference on Saturday.Mr. Shoukry said he understood the \u201cworries of some states\u201d regarding the crash. Officials are working \u201cto reassure these states that the procedures being taken in Egypt are up to international standards,\u201d he said.In Sharm el Sheikh, a cluster of soldiers and security guards stood at the entrance to the airport on Saturday in a show of increased vigilance, screening drivers and passengers arriving in cars and buses as the airport filled with anxious passengers trying to fly home. The Egyptian military also took control of registering stranded Russian passengers, according to Arkady Dvorkovich, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of efforts to repatriate Russians from Egypt. Egyptian officials told Reuters that they were checking airport security-camera video from the day of the crash to see whether someone might have sneaked past security officials, or if there was \u201cany unusual activity among policemen or airport staff\u201d at Sharm el Sheikh.But the security officers at the airport entrance also barred several journalists from entering the airport on Saturday, a sign that the government may be growing wary of the heightened international attention to the airport and its operations.Russia has asked the F.B.I. to help analyze forensic evidence from the crash to pinpoint its cause, American officials said. The F.B.I. and its Russian counterpart, the Federal Security Service, often collaborate against common enemies like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, but the request for help on the plane crash was seen as unusual. Kareem Fahim reported from Sharm el Sheikh, David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo, and Nicola Clark from Paris. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow, Michael S. Schmidt from Washington, and Stephen Castle and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lady and the Election", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorYANGON, Myanmar \u2014 By any estimate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy \u2014 a long-suffering movement of civilians fighting for their rights against a relentless junta \u2014 should have died years ago. And yet, a quarter century after a landslide electoral victory the party was never allowed to assert, it is the undisputed favorite in Sunday\u2019s general election, expected to wrest a popular mandate from the Union Solidarity and Development Party of President Thein Sein, the former military government\u2019s unavowed successor. Supporters perched on tamarind trees and rooftops to fly the N.L.D.\u2019s red flag, or flocked by the thousands to catch a glimpse of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as she campaigned across the country. Their fervor leaves little doubt about the enduring popularity of a party that has stood for freedom through many cycles of arrests since its birth from a mass uprising in 1988.Although a quasi-civilian government has significantly loosened the state\u2019s controls since 2011, the military remains omnipotent under the 2008 Constitution, which was drafted by the junta. The Constitution bars Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi from the presidency. Massive errors mar voter lists. Thousands of ballots may be dismissed because many voters do not know how to stamp them. The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, have been disenfranchised. In the face of such obstacles, the N.L.D., a party of wizened dissidents and greenhorn politicians, offers Myanmar its least bad chance at democracy \u2014 thanks to its tried-and-tested stand against military rule, its candidates\u2019 grit and the trust that people place in Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s redoubtable, often imperious, leadership. For her final campaign speech last Sunday, officials forbade Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi from speaking in People\u2019s Park near Shwedagon Pagoda, the site of her inaugural address as head of the democracy movement in 1988, and a mythologized rallying point for protests past. Relegated to a suburban field, she spoke before a flag-bearing ocean of thousands of people. \u201cIf they offer you incentives, by all means take them,\u201d she said, referring to the U.S.D.P., which allegedly has been buying votes. \u201cThen vote for the N.L.D.\u201d Only 75 percent of seats in regional and national parliaments will be contested in Sunday\u2019s election; the Constitution assigns the remaining 25 percent to the military. Short of the N.L.D. winning more than two-thirds of available seats \u2014 and being allowed to take them \u2014 the decks are stacked against any sweeping or sudden changes. No matter which party secures a majority of the vote, the president\u2019s ultimate selection requires agreement on an appointee from the upper and lower houses of Parliament and the military, which will likely take weeks of horse-trading. Some have expressed skepticism about the N.L.D. candidates\u2019 qualifications for parliamentary politics. Yet everyone is a novice in a country where legislatures only emerged in 2011, after the junta\u2019s dissolution. N.L.D. executives tout the fact that 75 percent of their 1,130 candidates are university graduates \u2014 an army of potential technocrats ready for the urgent tasks of reforming education, law, health care and an economy still dominated by military-linked conglomerates. The N.L.D. hasn\u2019t bothered to count the number of former political prisoners among its candidates. Partly that\u2019s because calling attention to them threatens a military wary of one day being held accountable for its past abuses. But mainly the party hasn\u2019t needed to, because the presence of dissidents within the ranks is a given \u2014 and the risks they took for truth and justice during the dark days of the junta are a chief point of trust among N.L.D. supporters.\u201cI understand the language of people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Pyone Cho, a N.L.D. candidate running in the city\u2019s former dumping grounds of Dawbon. At 49, his resume includes 20 years in prison as a chief instigator of the 1988 student uprising and co-founding a major civil-society organization when he was freed. His campaign speeches convey the ease and confidence of someone used to mobilizing people; he has had little difficulty putting his experience in the service of formal political campaigning.Years spent \u2014 on pain of torture and prison \u2014 teaching people about their rights, doing social work or coordinating clandestine networks while creatively evading the junta\u2019s thick network of spies and informers offer arguably more gritty and granular qualification for tackling Myanmar\u2019s many problems than the experience of candidates from the U.S.D.P. or other parties who pushed paper and took orders from military officers in a corrupt civil service. The N.L.D. won 43 of the 44 seats it contested in the 2012 by-election, but that amounted to just 7 percent of Parliament. With the military\u2019s de facto veto, and the U.S.D.P.\u2019s control over an absolute majority of the remaining seats, the N.L.D. can point to few great legislative successes since then. Yet people have little trouble understanding that with no more than a toehold in power, the N.L.D. could scarcely have made revolutionary changes. And the N.L.D. has made progress locally, building schools and digging wells, say, or refurbishing the derelict Yangon General Hospital. Arguably the party\u2019s most delicate task, and greatest achievement to date, has been to build a measure of trust across the old military-civilian divide, notably with Thura Shwe Mann, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament (whom President Thein Sein purged as head of the U.S.D.P. in August, reportedly because of his rapprochement with the N.L.D.).The N.L.D. has been criticized abroad for failing to speak out on behalf of the persecuted Rohingya Muslim minority, and for not fielding a single Muslim candidate. In Myanmar, it has had less trouble maintaining its stance as the party of inclusion. Earlier this year its 43 members of Parliament voted against four bills on marriage and religious conversions that targeted Muslims. The laws, which passed nonetheless, were the initiative of Ma Ba Tha, an ultra-nationalist Buddhist network. The group\u2019s virulence is such that, according to N.L.D. executives, Muslim citizens asked the N.L.D. to exclude them as candidates: They worried that their presence on the party\u2019s ticket would cost it precious votes, but trusted the N.L.D. to protect minority rights once in power.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whom the world has held up as an icon of interfaith moral virtue, demonstrates a hardnosed mixture of democratic values and high-handedness. At a press conference on Thursday, she said five times that she would rule above the president in any N.L.D.-led government: \u201cWe have someone who is prepared to represent the N.L.D. as a president, but I will make all the proper and important decisions with regard to government.\u201d Even those N.L.D. executives who concede that this approach deviates from democratic ideals say it is a necessary step in a military-dominated system with a flawed Constitution that denies the people their clear choice for president. The N.L.D. never professed to replace military rule overnight. And driving Myanmar toward democracy within the generals\u2019 legal parameters means making some strange compromises along the way.Advertisement"}

It had only one guest \u2014 an activist who volunteered to hold a ritual for a person he had never met.The activist, Park Jin-ok, placed a table of fruit, dried fish and artificial flowers before the refrigerated unit that held Mr. Song\u2019s remains in the morgue of Sungae Hospital in Seoul. He burned incense and bowed, before the impatient mortuary director asked him to pack up and leave.Mr. Song, 47, died in July; his body was found three days after his death, decomposing in his rented room. He was lucky to get even a makeshift funeral. A growing number of South Koreans are dying alone, with no relative willing to claim their remains and perform a ritual Koreans believe is essential to easing the deceased\u2019s passage to the other world.The surge in so-called lonely deaths \u2014 to 1,008 last year from 682 in 2011, according to government statistics \u2014 provides a small but poignant glimpse of how South Korea\u2019s long-cherished traditional family structure is changing. Though South Koreans have mostly benefited from a strong economy in recent decades, families have come under strain from economic and demographic upheaval.\u201cThose falling behind get increasingly lonely because, unlike the poor of the old days, they see their communities destroyed for urban redevelopment,\u201d said the Rev. Kim Keun-ho, a Christian pastor who has been working among Seoul\u2019s dwindling hilltop slum neighborhoods, known as \u201cmoon towns.\u201d \u201cThe poor and old have nowhere to go.\u201dMr. Kim and other observers trace the problem to the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, when lifetime employment, once a given in South Korea, evaporated. Many who lost jobs then never recovered, as an already fast-paced society got even more competitive.Now in their late 40s or older, some of these unfortunates are found sleeping in cardboard boxes in Seoul\u2019s subway stations or underpasses \u2014 scenes reminiscent of the desperate years after the Korean War.Their fall symbolizes the crumbling of a Confucian social contract Koreans have lived by for ages. Parents spent all their earnings for their children\u2019s success, and in return counted on their support in old age. Now, many older Koreans find themselves without retirement savings or children capable of supporting them.\u201cA society that lets its poor and abandoned die alone and leave without a funeral is itself dying at its heart,\u201d said Mr. Park, whose organization Nanum & Nanum is one of a handful of civic groups that hold simple funerals for those who die alone. \u201cThey spend their last days fearing their remains will be treated like trash.\u201dThe activists say that one of the greatest fears of the poor is to die without being given a proper funeral \u2014 the ultimate sign of life on the margins.In South Korea, a family\u2019s standing in the community is measured and flaunted during a loved one\u2019s funeral, by how many guests honor the invitation and how long they stay. Hundreds of relatives, friends and former colleagues may show up at a funeral hall, bowing before the deceased\u2019s portrait, nestled in a bed of freshly cut white chrysanthemums.Guests often sit on the floor, chatting \u2014 some lingering overnight \u2014 while the family plies them with food and drink. Long lines of wreaths with silky ribbons bearing their senders\u2019 names spill out of funeral halls, and guests often bring cash in envelopes to help the family with expenses. The government tries to limit how much public servants can accept or donate, fearing corruption.But for poor South Koreans, such an event is out of reach. Some cannot even retrieve their relative\u2019s body.For the past six years, Choi Jeong-woong, 71, a divorced Vietnam War veteran, has lived alone in a $220-a-month flophouse \u2014 in the words of Mr. Kim, the pastor, \u201cthe loneliest place in South Korea.\u201d Many of the residents there spend their last days in rooms so small they can fit only a narrow bed. Mr. Choi said he had no relatives to hold a funeral for him.\u201cI used to catch up with friends from my Vietnam days,\u201d said Mr. Choi, whose hands shook badly. \u201cI don\u2019t anymore because I don\u2019t like spilling food in public.\u201dSouth Korea has one of the fastest aging societies in the world, with those 65 or older now accounting for 13.1 percent of the population, up from 3.8 percent in 1980.Caught off-guard, the government is scrambling to strengthen the social safety net, but benefits remain paltry.About 30 percent of older South Korean families have a monthly income below the absolute poverty level. But they can get welfare only when they can prove that their family is unwilling or unable to support them. Many reject that option because they find it too embarrassing to reach out to relatives they have not contacted for many years.And one out of every four elderly people in South Korea has depression, according to a study published by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs in September. As a group, their suicide rate is double the national suicide rate.When people die alone, the police try to locate relatives and determine whether they will claim the remains \u2014 a process that can take months, as it did in Mr. Song\u2019s case \u2014 before cremation. In the same mortuary was the body of a man discovered in his room two and a half years after he hanged himself.Fear of such a fate bothered Ham Hak-joon, 87, whose small bus company went bust during the financial crisis of 1997-98. He lives alone in a $130-a-month rented room in a rundown neighborhood.His burden was recently lifted when Nanum & Nanum agreed to hold his funeral.\u201cI am prepared now, ready to die,\u201d he said, his eyes fixed on a small portable TV, one of his last connections to the broader world, especially after his arthritic legs made it increasingly difficult for him to venture out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hope for Nefertiti\u2019s Tomb, and Egypt\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLUXOR, Egypt \u2014 For weeks, a group of explorers have scanned the walls of a tomb in the Valley of the Kings, using radar and infrared devices, in the hopes that science might confirm one Egyptologist\u2019s theory: that hidden behind a wall of King Tutankhamen\u2019s burial chamber sits the long-sought tomb of Queen Nefertiti.The prospect of such a discovery is beyond tantalizing, and would be as momentous a find as any here for almost a century, antiquities officials say. It would also come at a time when Egypt\u2019s tourism industry, frozen by years of political unrest and fears of militant attacks, is in urgent need of good news.For the noted Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves, the tests could vindicate his arguments that two of the walls in the tomb of Tutankhamen, also known as King Tut, are likely to mask hidden rooms, and that the tomb itself was in fact an antechamber to a larger burial complex that belonged to Nefertiti, Pharaoh Akhenaten\u2019s powerful queen who according to some theories, succeeded him as ruler of Egypt.Dr. Reeves acknowledges that Egyptian officials, including some of his colleagues in the search, do not share the conviction that Nefertiti is waiting to be found in any undiscovered chambers.With that gathering sense of urgency, the explorers emerged from Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb this weekend, plainly exhausted by the work but carrying what they said was promising news: Radar scans had provided strong evidence of hollow chambers behind the walls. Mamdouh Eldamaty, Egypt\u2019s antiquities minister, said at a news conference announcing the findings that there was an \u201capproximately 90 percent\u201d chance that something \u2014 \u201canother chamber, another tomb\u201d \u2014 was waiting beyond Tutankhamen\u2019s burial chamber.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very good result,\u201d he said, adding that more analysis would be carried out over the coming weeks on the radar data to try to determine more precisely what is beyond the walls. After that, researchers may drill into the walls to get an even better look, though there is no set timetable for that step.Hours after the news conference on Saturday, the explorers returned to Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb, where Hirokatsu Watanabe, the Japanese specialist carrying out the radar scans, surveyed an area outside the entrance to the burial chamber. Mr. Watanabe dragged his silver, battered-looking device back and forth across the dirt, as journalists followed his every move and another member of the team took notes.Among those watching was Mustafa Waziry, the director of antiquities of Luxor. \u201cI\u2019m an archaeologist, I don\u2019t know what it means,\u201d Mr. Waziry said, speaking of the results of the radar tests. But the implications were clear.\u201cIf we discover something, it will turn the world inside out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they will come.\u201dHe can only hope. Mr. Waziry and his colleagues have watched in anguish over the last four years as tourism in Egypt collapsed since the uprising against President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.The year before the uprising, he said, 12,000 people stood in long lines each day to visit the attractions in Luxor. By 2012, the number had plummeted to as few as 300 a day, mirroring a broader disappearance across the country of treasured cultural tourists who spent generously on extended tours of Egypt\u2019s temples and museums.The numbers had recently started to inch upward, until the crash of the Russian plane, which increased security concerns at Egypt\u2019s airports and caused several countries to either sever or restrict air travel to Egypt.\u201cWe are plowing in the ocean,\u201d Mr. Waziry said, as Mr. Watanabe packed up his equipment. \u201cWe need something like this.\u201d\u201cCautious evaluation of the Factum Arte scans over the course of several months has yielded results which are beyond intriguing: indications of two previously unknown doorways,\u201d he wrote. One was probably a storeroom, he said, and the other, on the tomb\u2019s north wall, was likely a continuation of the tomb containing an \u201cearlier royal interment \u2014 that of Nefertiti herself, celebrated consort, co-regent, and eventual successor of Pharaoh Akhenaten.\u201dDr. Reeves cited other supporting evidence, positing that what is regarded as Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb, which was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, had in fact \u201cbeen both initiated and employed for the burial of Nefertiti.\u201dWhen Tutankhamen died unexpectedly at the age of 19 \u2014 about a decade after Nefertiti\u2019s death \u2014 her tomb was reopened, and a portion of it reconfigured to accommodate the young king, according to Dr. Reeves.At least one prominent Egyptologist believes that the entire project will turn up nothing. Dr. Zahi Hawass, a former Egyptian antiquities minister, who for years was the swaggering, public face of the country\u2019s archaeological discoveries and a rainmaker for tourism, ticked off a list of reasons there might be nothing hidden behind the walls \u2014 and certainly, he said, not Nefertiti.\u201cI am an archaeologist for 40 years,\u201d Dr. Hawass said. \u201cI can smell a discovery, and this is no discovery at all.\u201dBut despite his criticisms, Dr. Hawass acknowledged that \u201call of us are desperate for good news.\u201d Whether a discovery was looming, or not, the search itself had begun to stir hope among the proprietors of Luxor\u2019s empty travel agencies and markets.Bahaa Youssef, who works as a travel manager at Sunrise Tours in the city, said the company was running out of inventive ways to make money. \u201cEgypt needs big events, to make people look at us again,\u201d Mr. Youssef said.With their camera crews trailing, Dr. Reeves and his colleagues were at the very least creating a buzz, perhaps taking a page from Dr. Hawass, with his showmanship and grand pronouncements.\u201cIf we find what I think is there,\u201d Dr. Reeves said, \u201cit will be bigger than Tutankhamen.\u201dAn article on Nov. 30 about the potential discovery of the long-sought burial chamber of Queen Nefertiti, which would boost Egypt\u2019s struggling tourism industry, quoted incorrectly from the paper \u201cThe Burial of Nefertiti?\u201d by Nicholas Reeves, a noted Egyptologist. The paper referred to an \u201cearlier royal interment,\u201d not \u201cinternment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Erdogan Should Listen to the Voters", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe Turkish military is again bombing Kurdish separatists; opposition parties have trouble holding rallies or getting airtime; rivals are branded as terrorists; opposition media is intimidated or muzzled. The economy, which grew an impressive 9.2 percent in 2010, is now expected to grow by 3 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.But Mr. Erdogan is directly responsible for much of the climate of insecurity that has settled over Turkey. Though as president he is expected to be a unifying figure above the political fray, he has focused increasingly on winning the three-fifths majority in Parliament he needs to rewrite the Constitution in a way that would concentrate power in the presidency. In anticipation of such an outcome, he has even had a vast presidential palace built in Ankara, disregarding court orders against the construction on protected land.Turkish voters rebuffed his bid in June: his A.K.P. actually lost seats while a pro-Kurdish bloc, the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (H.D.P.) entered Parliament for the first time. But instead of helping arrange a coalition government, as the president is expected to do, Mr. Erdogan called new elections for Nov. 1. In the meantime, the government loudly assailed Kurdish politicians as a front for Kurdish terrorists and launched a bombing campaign against Syrian Kurds who had been critically important in the fight against the Islamic State.Meanwhile, in a fierce crackdown on the media orchestrated by Mr. Erdogan, opposition newspaper offices have been trashed by mobs, journalists have been arrested and papers have been closed down. On Wednesday, police officers firing tear gas raided the Istanbul premises of the last television channels critical of Mr. Erdogan. The channels belonged to a company linked to Fethullah Gulen, the head of an Islamic movement that once supported Mr. Erdogan but has become his fierce critic (Mr. Gulen lives in the United States).Yet despite all of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s efforts to frighten voters, the latest polls suggest that Sunday\u2019s voting will not greatly change the June results. At that point, Mr. Erdogan would be well advised to abandon his dreams of an imperial presidency and allow A.K.P. to form a coalition government. That is not a direction he is likely to choose on his own, but it is one his allies in the United States and Europe should strongly push him toward.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let Refugees Settle Italy\u2019s Empty Spaces", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMilan \u2014 AS Europe frets over what to do about the hundreds of thousands of refugees pouring onto the Continent, it occurs to me that the ancient Romans, as they so often do, might offer a solution.The ancient Romans used to reward their legionnaires with plots of land, through a system known as \u201ccenturiation.\u201d The Romans adopted the system in the fourth century B.C., when Rome was still a vibrant republic. But it lasted for hundreds of years, involving former servicemen from all over the empire.Centuriation had several advantages. The first was, obviously, strategic, as it created a permanent military presence. The second was economic: Veterans would farm uncultivated areas, produce wealth that went back into the community, and take care of themselves. The third was demographic: Those early pioneers and their families populated vast tracts of Italy and the lands beyond.One particularly aggressive proponent of centuriation was Emperor Septimius Severus, who ruled from A.D. 192 to 211 and whose 400,000-man army was spread across an empire of 70 million people, from the Atlantic to the eastern shores of the Black Sea and from northern England to southern Egypt. Severus didn\u2019t want to leave his veterans idle, and when they retired he gave them plots of uncultivated or abandoned land, either free or for a very low price.Traces of Roman centuriation are still to be found in southern France and parts of Spain, but most of those soldiers-turned-pioneers developed vast, underpopulated parts of Italy. The typical Roman layout of a square grid, appearing in the form of roads, canals and agricultural plots, can still be spotted in Lombardy, near Bergamo; in Tuscany, around Florence; in Romagna and in Campania. Around Padua, in the Veneto region, a large area is still known as \u201cGraticolato Romano,\u201d the Roman Gridiron.So why don\u2019t we try something similar with modern migrants?True, they haven\u2019t fought any wars for Italy; they\u2019re running away from wars, in places like Syria, or escaping sub-Saharan poverty and authoritarian regimes. But they have the right skills. While well-educated migrants aim for Germany and Northern Europe, those who stay in Italy tend to be farmers, builders and artisans. Most of them are young and used to hard work. And parts of our country, from the rural south to the hilltop villages of central Italy, are depopulating fast. Italy is aging. It needs new people.Sure, there may be a few devils in the details. Would the Italians who remain in these regions welcome them? Would the migrants even want to go there in the first place? Who would pay for their accommodation and equipment, and provide an initial income to get them started? But there are also obvious advantages.For the newcomers, to start with. Living in a peaceful Italian village, with no one harassing or shooting them, is a good way to restart their lives.Modern-day centuriation would bring a third advantage. The growing number of Italians worried about immigration, and those leaning toward xenophobia, would see the newcomers in a different light. People initially in need of help, of course \u2014 but also offering something in return. Not foreigners claiming benefits, but workers contributing their own skills to help make and fix things in their new homeland.Yes, there would be cultural differences to iron out. But Italy is more diverse than we think: Albanian and Greek linguistic minorities are still to be found across the south of the country. French is spoken in the northwest, German in South Tyrol and Slavic languages in the northeast. Arabic can be heard in southern Sicily.Ancient centuriation to manage modern immigration, then \u2014 could it work? History, geography, economy and common sense all point in the same direction. But obviously it\u2019s not enough. What\u2019s also needed is farsighted political leadership. The ancient Romans had it. What about the modern ones?Beppe Severgnini is a columnist at Corriere della Sera, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Texas, concerns a November 2014 executive action by Mr. Obama that allowed parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and allowing them to work.\u201cWithout work authorization,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote of the people eligible for the program, \u201cthey are more likely to work for employers who will hire them illegally, often at below-market wages, thereby hurting American workers and giving unscrupulous employers an unfair advantage.\u201dThe first anniversary of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement of the executive actions was Friday. To mark it, immigrant and Latino groups vented their frustration with the appeals court\u2019s ruling in marches and rallies at more than two dozen places around the country, including Phoenix; Raleigh, N.C.; and Miami.One group protested at the offices of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, in Racine, Wis.Judge Smith said Texas would suffer a similarly direct and concrete injury in having to spend millions to provide driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants under the federal program.Mr. Verrilli told the justices that Texas\u2019 injury, such as it was, was self-inflicted, a product of its own decision to offer driver\u2019s licenses to people lawfully in the United States. Decisions about driver\u2019s licenses and related fees are generally up to individual states. He added that the appeals court\u2019s standing theory would allow states to sue over all sorts of federal policy judgments.\u201cThe consequences of the majority\u2019s theory are particularly acute in a case, like this one,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhere a state seeks to leverage its own policy choices to insert itself \u2014 and the federal courts \u2014 into discretionary immigration policy decisions that Congress and the Constitution have committed exclusively to the national government.\u201dOfficials in Texas on Friday said they were confident that their winning streak in the courts would continue. \u201cThe president said himself more than 20 times that he didn\u2019t have the authority to unilaterally rewrite immigration law,\u201d said Cynthia Meyer, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Ken Paxton.Judge Hanen grounded his injunction on the Obama administration\u2019s failure to give notice and seek public comments on its new program. He found that notice and comment were required because the program was categorical notwithstanding the administration\u2019s assertion that it required case-by-case determinations.The appeals court affirmed that ruling and added a broader one. The program, it said, also exceeded Mr. Obama\u2019s statutory authorization.In dissent, Judge Carolyn Dineen King said the majority\u2019s decision to reach and rule on that issue was at odds with \u201cprudence and judicial economy.\u201dThe administration told the justices that the injunction has had a \u201cfar-reaching and irreparable humanitarian impact.\u201d\u201cIt bars,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote, \u201capproximately four million parents \u2014 who have lived in this country for years, would pass a background check, are not priorities for removal, and have a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident \u2014 from requesting deferred action under\u201d the program \u201cand receiving authorization to work lawfully.\u201dJulia Preston contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Several Fed Officials Say They Are Ready to Raise Rates", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the first senior Fed policy maker to signal in late August that the Fed wasn\u2019t quite ready to raise rates, said on Thursday that his reasons for hesitation have receded. Now, he said, he sees a stronger case for moving ahead.The remarks by Mr. Dudley, an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, reflected the tentative consensus among Fed officials that the time has come to raise the benchmark rate when the Federal Open Market Committee meets in Washington on Dec. 15 and 16.Investors and analysts now regard a December increase as all but certain, barring unexpected developments.The Fed has held interest rates near zero since December 2008 to encourage risk-taking by investors and borrowing by businesses and consumers, in hopes of stimulating economic activity. Raising rates will begin to reduce that effect. Indeed, as investors anticipate liftoff, borrowing costs already have started to rise. The average rate on a prime mortgage loan reached 3.98 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, the highest level since summer, when investors last expected the Fed to act.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.The question now is when the Fed will raise rates for a second time, and a third.\u201cIt is critically important to me that when we first raise rates, the F.O.M.C. also strongly and effectively communicates its plan for a gradual path for future rate increases,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cIf we do not, then market participants might construe an early liftoff as a signal that the committee is less inclined to provide the degree of accommodation that I think is appropriate for the timely achievement of our dual mandate objectives. I would view this as an important policy error.\u201dMr. Lacker said it was \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d whether the Fed had waited so long to raise rates that it would now need to act even more quickly in order to control inflation.\u201cI think there\u2019s a chance we are behind the curve, but it will be a year or two before we figure that out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have room to accelerate if we find out that we wish we\u2019d started earlier.\u201dMr. Dudley\u2019s speech on Thursday was noteworthy because in recent months he had expressed misgivings about raising rates, noting in particular that the late summer volatility of financial markets might signal emerging weakness, particularly given the struggles of the global economy.\u201cThe fundamentals supporting domestic demand look quite sturdy,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. \u201cAlso, the international outlook appears less problematic than it did just a few months ago.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.In a speech Thursday evening, Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said the Fed\u2019s decision to delay liftoff in September was an appropriate response to the appreciation of the dollar, which weakened domestic growth. But he suggested there was no reason to keep waiting.\u201cWhile the dollar\u2019s appreciation and foreign weakness have been a sizable shock, the U.S. economy appears to be weathering them reasonably well,\u201d he said. \u201cMonetary policy has played a key role in achieving these outcomes through deferring liftoff relative to what was expected a little over a year ago.\u201dMr. Dudley, for his part, said he still viewed the decision to raise rates as a close call.In particular, he noted that inflation remained weak, and he became the first senior Fed official to acknowledge a recent downturn in certain measures of inflation expectations.Market-based measures have fallen sharply in recent years, a trend Mr. Dudley and other officials have played down, saying those measures reflect a variety of factors. But Mr. Dudley said on Thursday that survey-based measures, which the Fed has emphasized, were also slipping.\u201cThere is some evidence that suggests that inflation expectations are under downward pressure,\u201d he said, although he hastened to add that the declines were \u201cvery modest in magnitude.\u201dA strengthening of that downward trend would concern Fed officials because they view the stability of inflation expectations as one of the Fed\u2019s most important and valuable achievements.\u201cAvoiding a Japan-like experience, in which inflation expectations have become unanchored to the downside, should be an important consideration in the conduct of monetary policy,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.He added, however, that if growth remained strong, he expects this problem, too, would go away.Advertisement"}

But it is rival Barclays that really ought to consider a domicile switch.Barclays already prides itself on dual American-British nationality, cemented when it snapped up Lehman Brothers during the financial crisis. And there are more grounds for it to leave Britain than its peer.Even if it started rethinking its locale today, Barclays is a long way behind HSBC, whose board hopes to make a decision on its domicile by the end of 2015. Barclays would need to create a separate United States legal structure before it could even think seriously about moving. That could take two years, since the bank would have to pass exacting American stress tests.But the arguments for Barclays to shift its headquarters across the Atlantic are pretty compelling. There\u2019s relative regulatory warmth: Britain\u2019s government charges a hefty levy on bank assets, even if it has lately adopted a more conciliatory tone. A mostly Republican Congress should mean less banker-bashing. Barclays\u2019 new chief executive, Jes Staley, is American.The larger United States economy also should be better able to absorb a bank of Barclays\u2019 size than Britain. HSBC has considered re-domiciling to the United States for that very reason. And staying in Britain looks ever less enticing, given ring-fencing rules that will soon formally separate its retail and investment banks.The best reason may be that a move could allow Barclays to dodge European rules that limit bonuses to two times salary. If Barclays had its head office outside Europe and its London operations in a branch rather than a subsidiary, it might be able to compete better in the race to recruit American rainmakers.Mr. Staley, in the process of moving his family to London, shouldn\u2019t rush to unpack his bags.Advertisement"}

As a resident dramatist, he ascended the food chain of British theater: from disputatious bouts at the Royal Court to the Nottingham Playhouse during Richard Eyre\u2019s brilliant regime and all the way up to the National Theater, where by 1984 he was an associate director, co-creating the influential Joint Stock Company along the way.While the first wave of the British ren\u00adaissance (John Osborne, Harold Pinter, Arnold Wesker) had explored the psyche, the second took on the injustices of society and the political economy. Along with Trevor Griffiths, Howard Barker, Caryl Churchill and Howard Brenton, David Hare was the leader of that second wave\u2019s firebrands. Their target was not the failures of the self but those of capitalism and social democracy. In the rambunctious, rancorous cultural steeplechase that was Britain in the \u201970s, Hare had pole position. His memoir, \u201cThe Blue Touch Paper\u201d (a reference to the instructions on British fireworks), makes one nostalgic for a time when artists had the luxury of being unironically earnest and politically self-righteous. (Even Hare\u2019s agent Clive Goodwin had co-founded a revolutionary newspaper, Black Dwarf.) It\u2019s easy to forget \u2014 now that it\u2019s taken for granted as a cultural treasure \u2014 that in the mid-70s the National Thea\u00adter\u2019s new South Bank complex was furiously resented by drama purists and the press for eating up public money deemed better spent on provincial and experimental theater. Peter Hall, South Bank\u2019s controversial impresario, was under siege.Nevertheless, among the many isms Hare embraced at the time, it was pragmatism that seemed paramount. He saw the National\u2019s three stages and guaranteed audiences as his opportunity to move into the mainstream. He seized this brass ring with both hands. He directed Trevor Griffiths\u2019s \u201cThe Party,\u201d which debated the future of Marxism in a capitalist society (yes, really). In 1978 he provided the National with \u201cPlenty,\u201d a big hit and one of his best plays, whose juicy central character, Susan, has been interpreted by three of the world\u2019s best actresses: Kate Nelligan, Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett. Down the decades, as Hare became the darling of the boulevard, his own high estimate of his prodigious achievements has never been quite matched by the public response. There are episodes in his theatrical chronicle that recall an epigram of Oscar Wilde\u2019s: \u201cMy play was a complete success. The audience was a failure.\u201d For this lack of enthusiasm Hare cannot forgive the critics, or Britain, or, for that matter, even his own agent. Hare is an expert at umbrage, and Clive Goodwin, who had the temerity to call \u201cKnuckle\u201d \u201can aberration, a mistake,\u201d is just one of many who get pimp-slapped. Hare quickly dumped Goodwin in favor of Peggy Ramsay, the legendary playwright\u2019s moll and tastemaker, whose cooing letters attesting to his genius are lovingly quoted.When Hare is venting about the small furies of process \u2014 the people who believed versus the people who didn\u2019t; the false starts and cranky collaborations; the vagaries of audience reaction \u2014 \u201cThe Blue Touch Paper\u201d is wonderfully entertaining. \u201cTeeth \u2019n\u2019 Smiles\u201d (1975), for instance, his play starring Helen Mirren as the lead singer of a failing rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band, was a triumph when it opened but laid an egg when Mirren reluctantly reprised it at Wyndham\u2019s Theater a year later. (The Who\u2019s drug-addled drummer, Keith Moon, showed up at the original production and tried to join the cast onstage, which was probably helpful to the initial buzz.) Hare has a playwright\u2019s memory for other people\u2019s good lines. One I especially liked appears in a letter to him from his friend Wallace Shawn: \u201cThey warn you life\u2019s short. They don\u2019t warn you it\u2019s \u00adsimultaneous.\u201dYou have to admire Hare\u2019s appetite to engage with his times with such savage gusto. Fascinated by the pathetic British smallness of how little it took to bribe local politicians into throwing their careers away, Hare and Howard Brenton cranked out \u201cBrassneck\u201d (1973), a satirical attack on capitalism based on the John Poulson scandal, about a corrupt civic architect who paid off a ring of civil servants to hand over development contracts. The two of them later took on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s brand of newspapering in \u00ad\u201cPravda\u201d (1985).I say \u201cyou have to admire\u201d because Hare makes it hard to. He tells the reader constantly that people don\u2019t like him \u2014 and you can understand why. Perhaps his desire for attention was shaped by his absent merchant seaman father\u2019s lack of interest in him. He is relentlessly disdainful about his own origins in lower-\u00admiddle-class \u00adBexhill-on-Sea, from which he escaped by way of a breezily won scholarship to the elite Lancing school and then a glide into Cambridge. He does have the grace, though, to admit that he was lucky. The state contributed to the cost of a superior education for him, and the British Arts Council subsidized his artistic freedom to a degree that\u2019s much rarer today. Still, he\u2019s always on his high horse admonishing his peers, his critics and his audience for their moral and intellectual limitations, or nobly wresting control of productions that otherwise would have sunk into \u00admediocrity.But all credit to Hare for giving us his shabbiness as well as his triumphs. By the time he brought down the curtain I had come to understand what a vibrant force he has been for wringing excellence out of people, including himself. \u201cThe Blue Touch Paper\u201d is an engrossing dive into the passions, the disappointments, the quarrels and the elation of a great professional trying to get something done.THE BLUE TOUCH PAPERA MemoirBy David HareIllustrated. 347 pp. W.W.

{"Headline": "Artur Mas Loses Bid to Remain Leader in Catalonia", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Catalonia\u2019s three-year drive for independence was thrown into turmoil on Thursday when Catalan lawmakers voted against reinstating Artur Mas \u2014 the politician who has led the push to secede from Spain \u2014 as head of the regional government.The vote, 73 to 62, was the second time this week that Mr. Mas had failed to persuade lawmakers to back his leadership, which has been troubled by corruption scandals, and it revealed deep divisions within the separatist movement.But one of the separatist parties, known by its Catalan acronym of CUP, which has not joined the alliance, has insisted on replacing Mr. Mas and his Convergence party because of scandals that have enveloped them.Even though the CUP still voted against Mr. Mas, the party\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, Antonio Ba\u00f1os, insisted that its opposition to Mr. Mas should not be interpreted as evidence that the movement for Catalan separatism was falling apart.He also left the door open for an 11th-hour deal with the embattled Catalan leader. \u201cThe debate doesn\u2019t end this morning,\u201d Mr. Ba\u00f1os said.Mr. Mas was a late convert to the secessionist cause. Three years ago, after failing to win tax concessions from Madrid, he essentially turned a fiscal dispute with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy into a full-blown challenge to Spanish sovereignty, also amid a growing Catalan civic movement that has been coordinating huge pro-independence rallies.While Thursday\u2019s vote highlighted political divisions within Catalonia \u2014 a region that accounts for a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy \u2014 Spain\u2019s monarch also waded into the debate, warning against any attempt to flout the Spanish Constitution and law.\u201cThe Constitution will prevail, nobody should doubt it,\u201d King Felipe VI said in a speech at a ceremony in Madrid. \u201cThe king, as head of state, will always stand by the side of all Spaniards.\u201dBut it is arguably Mr. Rajoy who has recently sought to gain the most as the standard-bearer of Spanish unity, ahead of general elections on Dec. 20. He has also recently urged Spain\u2019s main opposition parties to back his efforts to block the Catalan challenge \u2014 even as they hope to oust him from office next month.The elections could result in a rare coalition government, as neither Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party nor any other is expected to gain a parliamentary majority, according to the polls.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Americans View Paris Attacks With Empathy, Fear and Resolve", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 It made parents worry for their children studying abroad. It sent a shiver of fear into plans for vacations to France. Cafes and nightclubs in Miami and Los Angeles felt newly vulnerable, not so different from the bloody scenes unfolding on people\u2019s phones and televisions. For Americans accustomed to tuning out foreign conflicts, it brought the world crashing in.Few terrorist attacks in foreign lands have seized the attention of this country like the carnage in the streets of Paris, a city an ocean away but glittering in the memories of countless American honeymoons, junior years abroad and bucket-list vacations.In the last week, the attacks have pushed global terrorism and the Islamic State to the front lines of worry for many Americans who have taken to social media in record numbers to track wall-to-wall coverage of a cosmopolitan city transformed into a war zone.It all felt so familiar, people said in more than three dozen interviews across America \u2014 as though it could easily have been a restaurant or bar in their neighborhood.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly scary,\u201d said Katy Neusteter, who works for an environmental advocacy group in Boulder, Colo., and is flying to Paris next week for a climate conference. She said each new email exchange or videoconference with colleagues now began with a somber mention of the latest unsettling news.Dorcas Guest-Nelson, a part-time nurse in Phoenix, said that her eldest son, Jay, 20, had just been to Paris and that she had cousins who lived in London.\u201cI feel France is more similar to us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I think about Africa, I think about coups and genocide, about crazy dictators and who\u2019s in charge. I\u2019m not saying that I wasn\u2019t affected by what happened in Kenya \u2014 those were innocent people, too,\u201d she said, referring to the attack in April by Shabab militants that killed 147 people at a Kenyan university. \u201cBut France was different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was, like, I could have been there. My son could have been there. I could be the one sitting outside on a cafe and getting sprayed by bullets.\u201dThe attacks shook Americans who know France intimately as well as those who had only seen pictures of the Eiffel Tower.Across the country, people attended solidarity marches for France, bathed public buildings in the French tricolor and pondered whether they should cancel their travel plans.In Mississippi, Baptist congregants altered their morning rituals to pray for victims in a place many had never visited. In Utah, public safety officials released a video about how to recognize the eight signs of terrorism.The attacks are already reshaping debate over immigration and border security, vaulting foreign conflicts to the center of the presidential race. In a poll by Bloomberg Politics taken just after the attacks, Americans said that terrorism and the Islamic State were now the most pressing issues facing the country, replacing their concern about jobs and the economy. People said they were paying attention now because the Islamic State\u2019s rampage in Paris felt scarier, somehow closer to home, than the yearslong slaughter of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis, the recent suicide bombings in Beirut or the bombing of a Russian passenger jet.In Raleigh, Miss., Randy Clayton, 51, said the Paris attacks showed the Islamic State to be \u201creally aggressive.\u201d He added, \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think you can say anywhere that you are safe, with the climate of the world the way it is.\u201dMr. Clayton, the pastor of students and family life at the First Baptist Church in Raleigh, was watching the news in an effort to understand how it might affect his family. He said his oldest son was in an honors program at Mississippi State University in Starkville, Miss., and had been considering signing up for a semester or year of study abroad. \u201cBefore, I was really encouraging him to,\u201d said Mr. Clayton. \u201cBut my wife and I last night, we were talking about it, and are really not too excited about it.\u201dSeveral church members, including the interim pastor, Gerald Gordon, said they were watching the news from Paris intently. They knew that a place like Raleigh would not be on anyone\u2019s list of targets for terrorism. But they did not reject the possibility that other, more populated places in Mississippi might be. Some mentioned the arrest, in August, of two Mississippi State students who authorities said had been trying to join the Islamic State.\u201cWe are very concerned,\u201d said Ann Butler, 58, a fourth-grade science teacher. \u201cBecause we just feel like it\u2019s a matter of time before it\u2019s going to happen here. We believe our borders are not secure enough.\u201dBeth Crumpton, 76, a retired schoolteacher, said that she supported the effort by Gov. Phil Bryant and other governors around the country to block the resettlement of Syrian refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m a raving rebel from the South,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because we don\u2019t have time to check them out.\u201dPeople had other questions. Where would the Islamic State strike next? Could any American cities be targeted? American officials have said there is no credible intelligence that the Islamic State or any other group is plotting an attack inside the country. Would the attacks lead the United States military deeper into another conflict in the Middle East?\u201cIt will get much worse before it gets better,\u201d said Douglas Whitcomb, the owner of a food service business from Long Island who was visiting his son in Massachusetts. \u201cBecause the free world has not adequately come up with a strategy to deal with this. You cannot placate madness.\u201dAmong posts by major Internet and media companies, Paris has been the only news event to register among the year\u2019s Top 20 stories, as measured by likes, shares, and other actions on Facebook and Twitter, according to data from TrackMaven, a marketing analytics tool, that was analyzed by The New York Times. The rest of the top stories of the year were entertainment-related, memes or viral stories. Similarly, viewership of television news spiked the first night of the attacks and stayed high through the week.Not everyone expressed worry, or was even paying special attention. They had been spectators to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the marathon bombing in Boston, bombings in London and Madrid and too many mass shootings in the United States to list.In Seattle, Robb Crowe, 54, a social worker, said he was more worried about a rise in muggings and assaults in his Capitol Hill neighborhood. He had avoided learning too much about Paris.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like, \u2018not again,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been so many incidents over the last year, I\u2019m just kind of overwhelmed by it.\u201dThe attacks also stirred anger and hatred. In Englewood, Colo., vandals threw a rock through the sign of Isis Books & Gifts, a 35-year-old business named for the Egyptian god. Muslim groups said they had tallied a rash of threats and vandalism in the days after the attacks, including an Eiffel Tower symbol spray-painted onto the side of a Nebraska mosque.When members of the Islamic Center of Pflugerville, outside of Austin, Tex., arrived for morning prayers on Monday, they saw pages of the Quran covered with feces littering the entrance. It was the first vandalism there since the mosque opened in a strip mall three years ago.\u201cWe had our guard down,\u201d said Faisal Naeem, a board member at the mosque. \u201cWe were like, \u2018It\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019 But that concept of an oasis is no longer there.\u201dMany of the people who felt the most shaken by news of the attacks had European connections. French expatriates said they watched the aftermath of the attacks on French channels on cable TV and scoured social media to see if friends and family were safe. Janet Poth, an owner of a French bistro in Denver, raised three sons in Paris and planned to fly back in two weeks. She said the attacks would not deter her.\u201cIt is a city that I absolutely love,\u201d she said. She had been in France when 12 people were killed in an attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical newspaper. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking, \u2018Is there going to be a third? Is it going to continue?\u2019\u00a0\u201dJulie Curtiss, 33, a painter from Paris who now lives in Brooklyn, said the killings deeply unsettled her because the victims were her peers. Last Friday, she anxiously scrolled through Facebook as her friends in the neighborhood of the attack all checked in as safe, except for one classmate. He had gone to the Bataclan concert hall, and died there.\u201cIt feels like the beginning of something bigger, a war that doesn\u2019t have frontiers, something that doesn\u2019t have barriers,\u201d she said.While travel businesses expressed concern about a decline in tourism, not one person in interviews intended to cancel travel plans to Europe or steer clear of Paris. Richard and Diana Newton, a retired couple who live part of the year in Seattle and part of the year in Spain, and said they were not going to change plans to fly to Spain in February for a three-month stay in Valencia.\u201cYou can\u2019t say to yourself, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to sit in my chair and watch TV,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Newton said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t stop walking the street because you might get mugged.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to George Gordon of the First Baptist Church in Raleigh, Miss. He is the interim pastor, not the pastor.Jack Healy reported from Denver, and Richard Fausset from Raleigh, Miss.

{"Headline": "In Iceland, a Literary Tour Explores Rich History", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStanding in the dark outside the Reykjavik public library in the relentless damp chill that comes with a light rain at 40 degrees, I kept trying to zip up my jacket. The charcoal sky was a shade lighter than the inky ocean a few blocks away, but it was noon, not twilight. I had a few minutes to bundle up before an outdoor walking tour on literary Iceland began. As if on cue, the zipper snapped off in my hand.I could write here, I thought. There is a constant struggle in this place, often larger than a failed zipper, a theme that inspired the 1,000-year-old Icelandic sagas that touch on the nation\u2019s Norwegian and Irish roots and the mythic tales of elves and trolls.These days, the country is best known as the backdrop for the myths of our day: films like \u201cThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\u201d \u201cInterstellar,\u201d \u201cNoah\u201d and \u201cPrometheus.\u201d (Not to mention the TV series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d)But as I talked to people in Reykjavik, the culture of storytelling seemed to be the source of their greatest national pride. The country has a nearly 100 percent literacy rate. Halldor Laxness won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1955, and Unesco declared Reykjavik a City of Literature in 2011, only the fifth in the world. Researchers show that at least 90 percent of Icelanders age 16 or older read at least one book a year just for pleasure, and that the gift most requested by children at Christmas time is a book.With a population of about 320,000, the country has more books published and more books read per person than anywhere else in the world, according to a BBC report. One in 10 will publish at least one book, the report said.\u201cIn Iceland there are no ruins, no Viking ships to prove how we got here, so people think we evolved from cod,\u201d said Andri Snaer Magnason, one of Iceland\u2019s more noteworthy novelists, in a conversation after I took the tour. \u201cBut Icelanders have always presented themselves as a nation of storytellers. Stories had been the only contribution to the world culture before Bjork started having real influence.\u201dIceland\u2019s pop-cultural exports have got the word out about its appeal. Tourism is an increasingly important part of Iceland\u2019s economy. Hot springs, sport fishing, glacier hiking, snowmobiling and bicycling are all part of the draw, as are visits to waterfalls and private flights over volcanoes. It has a natural beauty unlike any I\u2019ve ever seen. But going off the beaten path here means exploring its overlooked literary scene.I dipped my toe in by taking the tour of Reykjavik that the library conducts by appointment much of the year. One guide, Ulfhildur Dagsdottir, is a literary scholar, and the other, Maria Bordardottir, is an actress. By the time the tour began, about 10 of us had gathered in the drizzle. At each site Ms. Dagsdottir gave us the historic and literary background of the location, and Ms. Bordardottir read an excerpt from a novel, an ancient saga or a poem that involved that specific place.On the street outside the library, Ms. Bordardottir read from \u201cSkoffin,\u201d a folktale from \u201cMeeting With Monsters: An Illustrated Guide to the Beasts of Iceland.\u201d We walked a few blocks to the old government house and heard an excerpt from a 1929 novel \u201cThe Black Cliffs.\u201d At the National Theater Building we heard a section of \u201cThe Man From Manitoba,\u201d which featured a scene in the alley behind the theater. At the former hospital and morgue (now a music school for children), we heard \u201cThe Fleeting Face of Autumn,\u201d a folktale from \u201cPeculiar Passengers.\u201d We stopped in front of a rusted metal shack being used as a public art display and heard from the \u201cSaga of Grettir,\u201d which is about a bad-tempered fellow from around the ninth century. Some of the stories were reminiscent of tales by Edgar Allan Poe. Perhaps extended periods of dark, cold and rain had drawn out the darkness of the heart.\u201cIcelandic literature, like literature everywhere, is a reflection of our society, and, for those who are interested to learn a little about Icelandic society, literature offers a way to learn and understand,\u201d Ms. Dagsdottir told me. \u201cIn this way, literature is important, both in itself as a cultural product, and as a way of gaining insight into our nationality and society. The tours are intended to provide a glimpse into Icelandic culture and the history of the city.\u201dThey accomplished that goal. Hearing the words of writers spoken in front of places they wrote about takes travelers past the beautiful scenery. It offers a peek at the country\u2019s literary soul.Our last stop was at the former home of Hannes Hafstein, a poet and the first minister for Iceland in the early 1900s. Hafstein was a reformer who urged the people of Iceland to reclaim the glory of the saga years. He also helped women achieve the right to vote in 1911. The house has been transformed into a cafe, with a library, museum and space for literary events. In the cafe I met Mr. Magnason and another novelist, Yrsa Sigurdardottir, who writes both children\u2019s books and horror novels. Both are best-selling authors in their country. Ms. Siggurdardottir read from \u201cI Remember You,\u201d a crime novel/ghost story, and Mr. Magnason read from \u201cLove Star,\u201d a biting novel rich with social commentary.Iceland\u2019s stories stay alive for many reasons, not the least because of its singular language and its tradition of keeping written records. While most of the nation\u2019s citizens live in and around Reykjavik, small farming communities dot the outer reaches of the country. Each village has documents of who owned what farm, who lived where, who died and how they died. Churches also have logs of membership and baptism.\u201cWe have few paintings or sculptures older than 100 years, compared to the stories we have,\u201d Mr. Magnason said. \u201cBut we have archives with stories throughout the 1,000 years of Iceland.\u201dMr. Magnason started his own company, which has published more than 25 books by young authors.Today throughout Reykjavik, individuals can sit on public benches that have a code on them, scan it with their smartphones and hear readings from Icelandic literature. Its literary scene is not entirely insular. Every two years since 1985, the city hosts an international literary festival that has included writers like Kurt Vonnegut (a major influence on Mr. Magnason), G\u00fcnter Grass, J. M. Coetzee, Paul Auster, A. S. Byatt, Isabel Allende, Haruki Murakami, Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, Seamus Heaney, Taslima Nasrin and others.Still, the country\u2019s voice is distinct, partly because of the language. \u201cThere is a thread of storytelling in the psyche,\u201d Mr. Magnason said. \u201cI think the magic of Reykjav\u00edk is the culture in general and how we have an infrastructure to do quite a lot. Big books, plays, film. And then there is the language. If Icelanders spoke another language, our talent would be drawn to the capital of the language. To Copenhagen, Paris, London or New York. The Icelandic language creates a microcosm and a strange universe in some ways. It is self-sufficient and self-contained, but still very open for influence.\u201dLike the glaciers that cover much of the country, Iceland is covered with thick layers of stories. And like the volcanoes that roil beneath that icy crust, more stories are forming, ready to create a new geography.I pulled the collar of my jacket around my neck as I walked toward a bookstore. Yes. Definitely. I could write here. And I did.An article last Sunday about a literary tour of Iceland misspelled the surname of an Icelandic novelist. She is Yrsa Sigurdardottir, not Siggurdardottir. And the article misidentified the literary event the writer Barbara Kingsolver attended. She was on the faculty of the Iceland Writers Retreat; she did not attend the country\u2019s international literary festival.Advertisement"}

But the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary D. Cohn, insists that the company will adapt and survive.\u201cThe whole model is evolving, and that\u2019s what life\u2019s about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Goldman Sachs of 20 and 30 years ago is not what it is today.\u201dResponding to a question about whether technology would ever remove the need for a financial intermediary to step in between the buyers and sellers of a financial security, Mr. Cohn defended the role of Goldman. Buyers and sellers will always need a middleman to help make compromises on the price, quantity and terms of any given transaction, be it a bond trade or a merger.\u201cIf producers and consumers wanted to meet at the same time in the market, you\u2019re right, intermediation would be a lost art,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality of it is, no one can ever really agree on price or terms. We as a financial intermediary are willing to mediate on price, terms and quantity.\u201dAs for one of Goldman\u2019s signature businesses, advising on mergers, Mr. Cohn remained optimistic. Companies are still looking to combine with or buy businesses to cut costs and improve profitability.When pressed on corporate tax inversions, in which American companies buy foreign businesses to move their headquarters abroad and pay lower taxes, the Goldman executive was coy about whether such deals are good for the country as a whole.\u201cIf I were a policy maker, I would make sure that we have a competitive environment for corporations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next step? I would make sure that we have a really competitive environment for corporations.\u201dQuestions also arose about whether the culture of Wall Street \u2014 one where junior workers pull all-nighters several days in a row \u2014 would change and become less stifling for the well-being of workers. Mr. Cohn, who said he was speaking at the conference in between meetings to figure out promotions at his company, insisted that his bank was striving to find the optimal balance for work-life matters.\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a cultural problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I know we don\u2019t have a cultural problem.\u201dAsked about recruiting \u2014 an issue that was also raised with James P. Gorman of Morgan Stanley earlier in the day \u2014 Mr. Cohn said that Goldman was still a place where some of the best and brightest graduates would want to work. The bigger issue, he said, is how corporate America as a whole can improve ways to create jobs.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about what we\u2019re doing at Goldman Sachs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the rest of the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maybe You\u2019ll Be Able to Retire After All", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMillions of people moved closer to a secure retirement last week when the Labor Department issued guidelines to help states establish savings plans for private-sector employees who do not have retirement benefits through their jobs.Currently, about half the states are developing plans. The most robust plans, in California and Illinois, rely on payroll deductions that are pooled and professionally managed, an approach that reduces costs and investing mistakes. Costs will also be controlled by a fee cap of about 0.75 percent of the money invested. That is not cheap, but it is intended as an upper limit, not the typical cost.Such plans make saving easy. Employers need only arrange for the payroll deductions. Employees can withdraw their contributions under rules that apply to any I.R.A. Employees don\u2019t have to take part if they choose not to. Taxpayers are not at risk because the participating employees pay for the plans. State officials would appoint the plan trustees.Not surprisingly, some financial industry groups oppose state-sponsored retirement plans, arguing that the new rules will give the states an unfair competitive edge over private sector providers of retirement plans.That is an exaggeration. If financial firms had suitable offerings for the small-business employees who are the most likely participants in state-based plans, millions of people would not be without coverage today. The industry\u2019s real worry is that the plans\u2019 transparent, lower fees will drive down fees industrywide.Some states like Washington are trying to accommodate industry concerns. Rather than sponsor its own plan, Washington is creating a marketplace where small businesses can shop for retirement benefits from financial firms that cap their fees at around 1 percent.That might be better than no retirement coverage. But a marketplace approach forfeits the broad participation and economies of scale that make state-sponsored plans appealing.Other states, including New York, have been in wait-and-see mode. Now that the Labor Department has weighed in, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and governors elsewhere should establish plans for their states, ideally modeled on those of California or Illinois.Advertisement"}

But you have to be cautious about removing the label of terrorist organization. Some go in the direction of arguing that it\u2019s a state. It\u2019s not.\u201cOperation capability is easier to deal with than motivation, physically, through targeted killings or the arrest of leaders and operatives, striking infrastructure and weapons stocks, drying up monetary sources, striking at their ability to recruit \u2014 all those things together will reduce operational capability.\u201cThere is a need to fight more effectively against the organization\u2019s sources of income. Why do we not see flames over the oil facilities that ISIS sits on? ISIS is not on the coast. It is reasonable to assume that it is selling oil through Turkey. How has that not been stopped?\u201cI understand the American reluctance to put boots on the ground, after Iraq and Afghanistan. But a hybrid organization cannot be defeated only with airstrikes.\u201dFight Against Religious Extremism\u201cThe American and Western approach is not to relate to the religious element behind ISIS, to refer only to violent extremism.\u201cThat\u2019s a grave mistake, in my view. One of the greatest enemies of the war on terror is political correctness. In this war, we need to agree on who is the enemy, on the instrumental causes, on what goals they are trying to achieve.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that Islam is the problem. We are talking about a small group within Islam \u2014 the Salafi jihadists \u2014 who are seeking to hijack the religion.\u201cBut to deal with ISIS, you cannot disconnect from the religious aspect. It cannot be done with winks and hints.\u201cSo the Muslims themselves have to come out against the jihadis. We, the Western world, are here to help. But it is the Muslims\u2019 problem first and foremost.\u201dDefine Terrorism\u201cAnother basic requirement that I have been fighting to advance for 30 years is to come to an international consensus on the definition of terrorism.\u201cIn my definition, it is the targeting of civilians to achieve political goals. That\u2019s it. Instead, all sorts of politics gets mixed in. This one\u2019s a freedom fighter, and so on. Even if a group has a legitimate cause, it should be agreed that using that tool of targeting civilians is not legitimate.\u201cNothing justifies terrorism. This is an embryonic concept that the international community must adopt. Without it, Mossad and the C.I.A. can work well together, but they won\u2019t get to the required level of cooperation. How can you fight terrorism or track the sources of funding if you don\u2019t agree on what terrorism is and who the terrorist organizations are?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Searching for Richard Nixon", "Date": "2015-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s also a truth universally accepted that nobody ever, ever wants to be Richard Nixon.But there are times, and this might be one of them, when the country needs a little Nixon. The country and maybe especially the Republican Party, which has been trying to forget its debt to Tricky Dick ever since the helicopter carried him away.Rather, it\u2019s the gifts that made Nixon successful before his flaws caught up with him that seem well-suited to the current moment.In this year\u2019s Republican primary, the non-Trump candidates have struggled mightily to make that kind of nuanced case. And they\u2019ve struggled, in part, because they lack a second Nixonian gift: An instinct for the non-ideological character of many American voters, primary voters included.Nixon was a conservative and an opportunist in equal measure: leftward of Barry Goldwater, rightward of Nelson Rockefeller, and basically wherever the voters he was courting needed him to be. Whereas today\u2019s Republican politicians are used to campaigning on a list of Reaganite commandments, and often seem baffled when the conversation leaves their comfort zone.Then on foreign policy, too, a dose of Nixon\u2019s cold-eyed view of world affairs would dramatically improve what Republicans are currently promising. Obama\u2019s foreign policy is, put charitably, a stumbling mess. But the Republican pretense that all we need to do is name our enemies and crush them misses the deep complexity of America\u2019s challenges.The odd truth is that the most Nixon-like candidate in 2016 \u2014 in the sense of being ideologically protean and personally ruthless, at least \u2014 might be the one waiting for Republicans in the fall.But the unfortunate reality for the country is that Hillary Clinton might offer Nixon\u2019s weaknesses without his strengths: All the seaminess and paranoia, but none of the actual achievements. (Neither the Russian \u201creset\u201d not the Libya victory-turned-fiasco was exactly the equivalent of the opening to China.)Which makes her vulnerable. But only if her Republican rivals realize that there\u2019s a better way to be Nixonian, and that in 2016, it might be the winning way as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Glut of Coal-Fired Plants Casts Doubts on China\u2019s Energy Priorities", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONGXIANPO, China \u2014 Just outside the southwest border of Beijing, a new coal-fired power and heating plant is rising in Dongxianpo, a rural town in Hebei Province. Cement mixers roll onto the site. Cranes tower above a landscape of metal girders.That is because the plant is scheduled to come online in three years amid a glut of coal-fired power plants \u2014 an astounding 155 planned projects received a permit this year alone, with total capacity equal to nearly 40 percent of operational coal power plants in the United States.China\u2019s state-controlled economy creates strong incentives for provinces to manage their own energy sources to generate jobs and revenue. Coal plants have long been the easiest, fastest way for provinces to meet their own energy needs and stimulate local economic growth.That system has created what appears to be a disconnect between the provincial building boom and the country\u2019s overall energy requirements, making it harder for China to convert to a system that is not dominated by dirty fuel.\u201cChina already has more coal capacity than it will ever need,\u201d Zhang Boting, vice chairman of the China Society for Hydropower Engineering, said in an interview. \u201cA few years down the road, we\u2019ll see what a waste the plants are. We have seen this happen to the steel and cement industries.\u201dThe construction boom \u2014 with capital costs estimated by Greenpeace at $74 billion \u2014 is a clear sign that China remains entrenched in investment-driven growth, despite promises by leaders to transform the economic model to one based on consumer spending.Conflict within the system is rising. Renewable-energy interests \u2014 wind, solar and hydropower \u2014 are pushing back against coal-fired power plants, which have 40-year life spans. They say the rising number of coal plants prevents other energy sources from selling electricity on the grid and attracting more investment. They want the government to move faster with its promised \u201cgreen dispatch,\u201d giving priority to low-carbon electricity sources.\u201cWhy do we see so much discarded water, wind and solar resources everywhere?\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cBecause all those coal plants need market share. Local governments need to maintain stability and employment, and to do so they need to give all the coal plants just enough market share to survive.\u201dThe State Grid Corporation of China, the country\u2019s largest power distributor, did not respond to a request for comment. It is also one of China\u2019s biggest owners of coal-fired power plants.Qin Haiyan, secretary general of the Chinese Wind Energy Association, told the China Electric Power News, an official industry newspaper, that if the country\u2019s appetite for new coal plants was not curbed, \u201cthe conflict between coal and wind will become even more fierce in the next few years.\u201dMr. Zhang said the dominance of coal power had led to \u201ca sharp decline in investments in renewable energy.\u201dNevertheless, China is building more renewable and nuclear energy capacity. The government has said that by 2020, 15 percent of energy consumption will be met by sources beyond fossil fuel. The growth in renewables and nuclear power is expected to meet an estimated 3 to 4 percent annual growth in electricity demand in the coming years, which makes new coal-fired plants unnecessary, said Lauri Myllyvirta, a main author of the Greenpeace East Asia report.\u201cYou\u2019re wasting a massive amount of capital that could be spent on renewable energy to generate green power that is needed,\u201d Mr. Myllyvirta said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a longer-term question of whether you will keep investing in renewables when you have all these coal plants lying around.\u201dCoal plants now operate well below full capacity, with the average number of operating hours on the decline, the Greenpeace report said. Last year, thermal power plants, mostly coal-fired, operated 4,706 hours on average, 314 hours less than in 2013, according to the National Energy Administration. \u201cAt any given moment, more than half of capacity is idle,\u201d Mr. Myllyvirta said.The report recommended that officials cancel many projects and that the central government \u201curgently institute a ban on issuing new permits for coal-fired power plants.\u201dThough the total amount of coal-fired power capacity has grown annually, China is shutting down some older and smaller plants, especially in more populated eastern regions. By 2020, the central government aims to have coal-fired power generated mainly in western provinces and transmitted to the east via ultra-high-voltage lines. But Greenpeace researchers found that eastern provinces were still handing out large numbers of permits to build new coal plants.Jiangsu Province has issued permits for 17 plants this year, while Shandong Province has issued permits for 16 \u2014 the second and third most plant approvals in the country, behind Shanxi Province. That goes against central policy, since regulations require those provinces to curb coal use.Mr. Myllyvirta said that even the western provinces did not need so many new coal-fired plants because the current overcapacity and planned expansion of renewable and nuclear energy sources could meet the expected rise in demand for transmitted electricity.Greenpeace estimated that if the 155 plants operated at typical levels for new projects, they would emit 560 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, equal to Brazil\u2019s total energy emissions. They would also spew huge amounts of toxic pollutants, and 60 percent would operate in arid areas or ones with chronic water shortages, exacerbating those problems.The increase in permit approvals followed the enactment of a policy in March that allows provincial environmental officials rather than the central Ministry of Environmental Protection to approve projects, in the interest of streamlining bureaucracy.Provinces have an economic interest in keeping coal-fired power generation close to home, despite concerns over air pollution. Provincial state-owned enterprises running the plants have a guaranteed source of revenue. Also, officials can tax coal power plants but not renewable-energy projects. And plant construction improves economic growth, an important measure in evaluations of provincial officials.Mia Li and Kiki Zhao contributed research.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Am Paying for Your Expensive Medicine", "Date": "2015-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYOU may not know it, but you could be on the hook to pay at least $124 this year for a drug you probably don\u2019t take.The drug is a new class of cholesterol-lowering agents called PCSK9 inhibitors. Its cost and how we are paying for it illustrate why we all need to care about not only our own health care bills but also those of our neighbors. And it helps focus the debate about drug prices on two questions: What is the value delivered by the drug, and can that be linked to its price? And how should such value-based prices be implemented?To protect patients, many policy makers and academics are proposing various changes in drug benefit arrangements such as separating out deductible limits for drugs from deductibles for other health benefits and limiting co-pays for these drugs to $100 to $250.These proposals are a good start and necessary, especially for low-income Americans who struggle the most to pay out-of-pocket medical costs. But they will not solve the systemic problem of super-high drug costs. Someone \u2014 even if it\u2019s a less than sympathetic insurance company \u2014 still has to pay the full bill. A growing chorus is arguing that we should start paying for value in health care. Paying for value is the common-sense idea that prices should be linked to benefits; high prices would have to be justified by high health benefits.What would paying for value look like in the case of PCSK9 inhibitors? We have estimates of the benefits in terms of lowering risks from cardiovascular disease. At what price would those benefits be a good value?In the rest of the economy we let individuals determine value. They decide whether a new gadget is worth the expense when they spend their own money on a television, a car or a smartphone. And in health care many want only patients to determine value.But as these PCSK9 inhibitors make clear, it is not just patients\u2019 perspectives we need to take into account. Patients get the benefits, but all of us are paying the bill. As Dr. Schulman and his colleagues show, the nature of the way we pay for health care \u2014 through private and public health insurance pools, which spread financial risk and costs among large populations \u2014 means we all pay for an exorbitantly priced high cholesterol drug even if we don\u2019t have high cholesterol and we don\u2019t take the drug. The high costs are hidden in our ever-increasing insurance premiums and taxes. Because we all pay, all Americans have to have a voice in determining value.As the PCSK9 story is making clear, the drug cost debate is now beginning to focus on two questions that are currently unresolved: First, how do we determine value so the perspectives of all Americans are considered? Second, how do we implement and enforce that determination of value?The traditional answer to the first question is to determine the cost-effectiveness of the new drugs by assessing how much they improve the lives of patients measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALY). This is certainly an important measure for patients. The controversy centers on how much we should pay for each additional year of life. Is it $50,000? $100,000? More? In England they have a flexible target, wherein above $45,000 per QALY drugs require an increasingly stronger case for coverage. But even if we use a much higher target in the United States \u2014 say, $150,000, which is about three times the median household income \u2014 it turns out these PCSK9 inhibitors still fail the value test. The drugs would cost patients as much as $300,000 for every quality-adjusted life year they add. Their price would have to shrink by more than half, to roughly $5,000 per patient per year, to make the $150,000 level.The answer to the second question is just as unsettled. Many people hope that the drug industry will self-regulate, using value-based pricing of its new drugs. But if past experience is any indication of future behavior, self-regulation may be a pipe dream. Recent price increases for generic drugs long off patent and patented drugs in which there is no additional research aren\u2019t encouraging signs.In the United States, government regulation is usually a solution of last resort when industry self-regulation fails. But if insurance premiums keep going up $124 per person because of a single drug, Americans may find it more appealing.Ezekiel J. Emanuel is an oncologist and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Faces Major Spending Cuts and Regulatory Deadlines", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVolkswagen also faces a Friday deadline to inform regulators in the United States of how it plans to bring its diesel cars there into compliance with air-quality standards. The company admitted in September that it had installed software in the cars that was meant to enable the vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.That scandal, which involves about 11 million vehicles worldwide \u2014 most of them in Europe \u2014 is a big reason Volkswagen is now forced to cut costs. The company must pay to modify the cars and could face billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements.Volkswagen is also under pressure to demonstrate to United States authorities that it is serious about identifying the people responsible for installing the software. Of the vehicles affected worldwide, about 500,000 are in the United States. In addition, Volkswagen has admitted making exaggerated claims about the carbon dioxide output and fuel economy for 800,000 more cars in Europe.The Friday deadline was set by the California Air Resources Board, which helped to expose Volkswagen\u2019s use of the so-called defeat software in its diesel vehicles. CARB, as it is known, is a particularly influential regulator in part because of the size of the California car market and also because it sets some of the most stringent emissions standards in the United States.A spokesman for the agency, David Clegern, said it expected Volkswagen to submit its plan to modify its cars and to describe how it intends to proceed with a recall. He said he did not know whether the company would propose a definitive fix by Friday, or only an initial version of such a plan. He declined to say whether the company might face penalties if it failed to deliver by the 45-day deadline.Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board, which will meet on Friday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, is scheduled to discuss how to cover billions of euros in expenditures necessary to retrofit vehicles so that they comply with emissions regulations.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.It may be difficult to find savings without undercutting Volkswagen\u2019s ability to compete in a fast-changing automobile market \u2014 and even more difficult to do so without alienating its workers council, which effectively controls the supervisory board and is likely to oppose any plan that involves major job cuts.\u201cIt\u2019s a very important signal whether management can emancipate themselves from the guys who have been running the business \u2014 the works council,\u201d said Arndt Ellinghorst, head of global automotive research at Evercore ISI, an investment advisory firm.The supervisory board always meets at the end of the year to discuss investment and spending for the year ahead and beyond. Until this year, it was almost always the case that the board could announce spending increases. The emissions scandal has changed that.In addition to the cost of modifying vehicles so that they are not polluting more than allowed, Volkswagen also faces dozens of lawsuits from shareholders and vehicle owners. It is also likely to face large fines from the authorities in the United States and other countries for violating clean-air rules.Volkswagen said on Wednesday that 120,000 diesel car owners in the United States will get $500 cash cards and $500 toward vehicle repairs under a program it announced last week. Jeannine Ginivan, a VW spokeswoman, said about one quarter of the 482,000 vehicle owners covered by the emissions scandal had applied to the program, which would cost at least $120 million in benefits to the participating owners.Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen since late September, is seen as more willing to challenge Volkswagen\u2019s labor representatives than was his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in September after the cheating became known.But Mr. M\u00fcller answers to the supervisory board, and his powers are limited. As is the case at all large German companies, labor representatives have half the seats on the supervisory board, with the chairman casting a tiebreaking vote if necessary.Labor is even more influential at Volkswagen, though, because the state of Lower Saxony owns 20 percent of the voting shares and has two board seats. The Lower Saxony representatives typically vote with labor, but might be open to compromise because of Volkswagen\u2019s urgent need to save money while continuing to invest in new technologies like self-driving and battery-powered cars.\u201cI think Lower Saxony increasingly understands that VW urgently needs to be turned into a more efficiency-driven company and not just pursuing world domination,\u201d Mr. Ellinghorst said.Volkswagen has about 45 percent more workers than Toyota, one of its main rivals, while producing slightly fewer cars. Mr. Ellinghorst said the company also spent far more on research and development than its rivals, without necessarily being more innovative.Bernd Osterloh, the head of the Volkswagen works council, caused a stir this month when he complained publicly that Mr. M\u00fcller had not been consulting with labor representatives about cost-cutting plans. It was a rare breach of collegiality between Volkswagen management and labor.Volkswagen employees have become increasingly nervous about job cuts, according to several employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. There is also widespread anger at managers whose misconduct is seen as threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers who had nothing to do with the cheating, the employees said.The Nov. 20 deadline was set last month by the California air-quality regulators. It represents a period of 45 days following the announcement of Volkswagen\u2019s wide-scale violation of emissions on Sept. 18.Both the E.P.A. and California regulators are investigating Volkswagen\u2019s emissions-cheating devices, and have together been conducting road testing of all diesel car models.E.P.A. officials have said that they expected Volkswagen to submit detailed plans for how it will modify the affected diesel cars before ordering any recall. Regulators expect to test Volkswagen\u2019s fix in their own labs before signing off on it.It is unclear whether Volkswagen will be presenting regulators with technical blueprints, or whether the carmaker has engineered a test car to demonstrate its technical fix. Any solution is likely to be costly and difficult, perhaps requiring installation of additional equipment such as tanks to store chemicals used to neutralize harmful nitrogen oxide emissions. Finding space in the car for additional hardware is a major technical challenge.The United States authorities will also be expecting an update on the progress of Volkswagen\u2019s internal investigation into who was responsible for the cheating. The company last week announced an amnesty for employees who come forward with information, in what was seen as an indication that the internal inquiry is making slow progress.German prosecutors are also investigating possible fraud and other charges in the case, and have said they are focusing on six suspects. The prosecutors, citing German disclosure laws, have not said if the six suspects are the same six managers that Volkswagen has suspended in connection with the case.Prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters, have told legislators in Lower Saxony that they have not found sufficient evidence to identify Mr. Winterkorn, the former chief executive, as a suspect.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Jad Mouawad from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: New Kia Optima Arrives, Sleek and Stylish", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenBEFORE the Nike Air Jordan, there was the Converse Chuck Taylor \u2014 a classic design that stood the test of time. But even the classics evolve. Chucks were recently tweaked to be more cushioned and comfortable.The Kia Optima may not be a classic, but, like Chuck Taylors, it\u2019s among the most stylish cars, regardless of price. Now, the designers of the sleek new-generation Optima have been careful not to mess with a good thing.Still, cars must be more than just good-looking. Affordability, comfort, safety, fuel economy and reliability are all important. The departing third-generation Kia was a solid effort, with road noise and the lack of steering feel being its biggest foibles.A few miles in, the new Optima proves those shortcomings have been addressed. The more mature driving dynamics have risen closer to the expectations set by the svelte exterior lines. Think Air Jordans, not Chuck Taylors. And the Optima is more hushed now.A cleaner \u2014 I\u2019ll argue less emotional \u2014 cabin replaces the cockpit vibe of the previous generation. Eyes and fingers will appreciate the materials in the SX model tested, save for the fake molded-in stitching on the instrument panel. Real thread can be had on the highest SX Limited trim level.Room and comfort are not an issue. In back, three average adults will be fine. Outboard passengers get rump roasters with 12-volt and USB ports for charging phones. There are even side sunshades.Starting at $22,665, Kia has abandoned the bargain-basement pricing for a bang-for-the-buck approach. As tested, the SX at $33,215 is stuffed with a panoramic glass roof, heated steering wheel, heated and vented front seats and an iPad-like interface. Many of these features are not offered on the Altima, Accord, Camry, Fusion and Mazda 6. Spend more and the Optima can be had with auto emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and a surround-view camera system.There are several 4-cylinder engine choices. SX gets the most powerful \u2014 a 2-liter turbo making 245 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque with regular-grade gas. This engine and the 2.4-liter nonturbo motor are bolted to a 6-speed automatic that turns the front wheels. Optima\u2019s 1.6-liter turbo engine gets a 7-speed dual clutch. Drive modes adjust throttle response and steering weight.It takes about seven seconds to nail 60 miles an hour from a standstill. Turbo lag and torque steer (that tugging of the steering wheel under hard acceleration) are all but eliminated. Optima closes the handling gap on the Accord and Mazda 6. Know that the SX uses a different steering rack setup than lower models.The SX scores 24 miles a gallon in the city and 35 on the highway, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Go with the 1.6-liter turbo engine and that rises to 28 and 39. I saw 24 in heavy city driving.Some will grumble that Kia played it too safe with the new Optima\u2019s design. On the other hand, its sister car, the Hyundai Sonata, took a strikingly conservative turn and was criticized for it. Kia kept Optima\u2019s strengths and eliminated the weaknesses. That\u2019s a good-looking strategy for taking on the competition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despair, American Style", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA couple of weeks ago President Obama mocked Republicans who are \u201cdown on America,\u201d and reinforced his message by doing a pretty good Grumpy Cat impression. He had a point: With job growth at rates not seen since the 1990s, with the percentage of Americans covered by health insurance hitting record highs, the doom-and-gloom predictions of his political enemies look ever more at odds with reality.Yet there is a darkness spreading over part of our society. And we don\u2019t really understand why.There has been a lot of comment, and rightly so, over a new paper by the economists Angus Deaton (who just won a Nobel) and Anne Case, showing that mortality among middle-aged white Americans has been rising since 1999. This deterioration took place while death rates were falling steadily both in other countries and among other groups in our own nation.Even more striking are the proximate causes of rising mortality. Basically, white Americans are, in increasing numbers, killing themselves, directly or indirectly. Suicide is way up, and so are deaths from drug poisoning and the chronic liver disease that excessive drinking can cause. We\u2019ve seen this kind of thing in other times and places \u2013 for example, in the plunging life expectancy that afflicted Russia after the fall of Communism. But it\u2019s a shock to see it, even in an attenuated form, in America.Yet the Deaton-Case findings fit into a well-established pattern. There have been a number of studies showing that life expectancy for less-educated whites is falling across much of the nation. Rising suicides and overuse of opioids are known problems. And while popular culture may focus more on meth than on prescription painkillers or good old alcohol, it\u2019s not really news that there\u2019s a drug problem in the heartland.But what\u2019s causing this epidemic of self-destructive behavior?If you believe the usual suspects on the right, it\u2019s all the fault of liberals. Generous social programs, they insist, have created a culture of dependency and despair, while secular humanists have undermined traditional values. But (surprise!) this view is very much at odds with the evidence.For one thing, rising mortality is a uniquely American phenomenon \u2013 yet America has both a much weaker welfare state and a much stronger role for traditional religion and values than any other advanced country. Sweden gives its poor far more aid than we do, and a majority of Swedish children are now born out of wedlock, yet Sweden\u2019s middle-aged mortality rate is only half of white America\u2019s.You see a somewhat similar pattern across regions within the United States. Life expectancy is high and rising in the Northeast and California, where social benefits are highest and traditional values weakest. Meanwhile, low and stagnant or declining life expectancy is concentrated in the Bible Belt.What about a materialist explanation? Is rising mortality a consequence of rising inequality and the hollowing out of the middle class?Well, it\u2019s not that simple. We are, after all, talking about the consequences of behavior, and culture clearly matters a great deal. Most notably, Hispanic Americans are considerably poorer than whites, but have much lower mortality. It\u2019s probably worth noting, in this context, that international comparisons consistently find that Latin Americans have higher subjective well-being than you would expect, given their incomes.So what is going on? In a recent interview Mr. Deaton suggested that middle-aged whites have \u201clost the narrative of their lives.\u201d That is, their economic setbacks have hit hard because they expected better. Or to put it a bit differently, we\u2019re looking at people who were raised to believe in the American Dream, and are coping badly with its failure to come true.That sounds like a plausible hypothesis to me, but the truth is that we don\u2019t really know why despair appears to be spreading across Middle America. But it clearly is, with troubling consequences for our society as a whole.In particular, I know I\u2019m not the only observer who sees a link between the despair reflected in those mortality numbers and the volatility of right-wing politics. Some people who feel left behind by the American story turn self-destructive; others turn on the elites they feel have betrayed them. No, deporting immigrants and wearing baseball caps bearing slogans won\u2019t solve their problems, but neither will cutting taxes on capital gains. So you can understand why some voters have rallied around politicians who at least seem to feel their pain.At this point you probably expect me to offer a solution. But while universal health care, higher minimum wages, aid to education, and so on would do a lot to help Americans in trouble, I\u2019m not sure whether they\u2019re enough to cure existential despair.Advertisement"}

And it knows that the mere suggestion that someone belongs to the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 regardless of any evidence \u2014 means a loss of public sympathy. But Ms. Taweel\u2019s ordeal is different.I have been writing a version of this for years now: While Egypt\u2019s regime is brutal and unjust, its ruthlessness is rewarded by other governments with aid, weapons and business deals. All in the name of that euphemism, stability.Mr. Sisi\u2019s regime wages war not just on political opponents but, as I have reported, against atheists, gay men, belly dancers, even pop stars. Ms. Taweel is but one of many young people dragged into jail by a regime tenacious in its cruelty. Why blindfold a woman who walks with a crutch?Sometimes, it feels as though nothing changes; the only details I have to update are the names of the new detainees and, every so often, the name of the dictator du jour (until five years ago, it was Hosni Mubarak).Meanwhile, other countries have rolled out the red carpet for Mr. Sisi. In recent weeks alone, he was welcomed on state visits to India and Britain. The parliamentary elections, whose first round was held in October, were merely a fig leaf to placate these global allies with the comfortable lie that Egypt is progressing along the path of democracy.With a regime as paranoid and brittle as this, it is not hard to anticipate its actions. A recent Sunday this month was typical: An investigative journalist was detained and interrogated by military prosecutors, a businessman and his son were arrested, and a TV anchorwoman was suspended from her job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fearing Fear Itself", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike millions of people, I\u2019ve been obsessively following the news from Paris, putting aside other things to focus on the horror. It\u2019s the natural human reaction. But let\u2019s be clear: it\u2019s also the reaction the terrorists want. And that\u2019s something not everyone seems to understand.Think, for a moment, about what France is and what it represents. It has its problems \u2014 what nation doesn\u2019t? \u2014 but it\u2019s a robust democracy with a deep well of popular legitimacy. Its defense budget is small compared with ours, but it nonetheless retains a powerful military, and has the resources to make that military much stronger if it chooses. (France\u2019s economy is around 20 times the size of Syria\u2019s.) France is not going to be conquered by ISIS, now or ever. Destroy Western civilization? Not a chance.So what was Friday\u2019s attack about? Killing random people in restaurants and at concerts is a strategy that reflects its perpetrators\u2019 fundamental weakness. It isn\u2019t going to establish a caliphate in Paris. What it can do, however, is inspire fear \u2014 which is why we call it terrorism, and shouldn\u2019t dignify it with the name of war.The point is not to minimize the horror. It is, instead, to emphasize that the biggest danger terrorism poses to our society comes not from the direct harm inflicted, but from the wrong-headed responses it can inspire. And it\u2019s crucial to realize that there are multiple ways the response can go wrong.It would certainly be a very bad thing if France or other democracies responded to terrorism with appeasement \u2014 if, for example, the French were to withdraw from the international effort against ISIS in the vain hope that jihadists would leave them alone. And I won\u2019t say that there are no would-be appeasers out there; there are indeed some people determined to believe that Western imperialism is the root of all evil, and all would be well if we stopped meddling.But real-world examples of mainstream politicians, let alone governments, knuckling under to terrorist demands are hard to find. Most accusations of appeasement in America seem to be aimed at liberals who don\u2019t use what conservatives consider tough enough language.And let\u2019s be clear: this wasn\u2019t just a matter of bad judgment. Yes, Virginia, people can and do exploit terrorism for political gain, including using it to justify what they imagine will be a splendid, politically beneficial little war.Finally, terrorism is just one of many dangers in the world, and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to divert our attention from other issues. Sorry, conservatives: when President Obama describes climate change as the greatest threat we face, he\u2019s exactly right. Terrorism can\u2019t and won\u2019t destroy our civilization, but global warming could and might.So what can we say about how to respond to terrorism? Before the atrocities in Paris, the West\u2019s general response involved a mix of policing, precaution, and military action. All involved difficult tradeoffs: surveillance versus privacy, protection versus freedom of movement, denying terrorists safe havens versus the costs and dangers of waging war abroad. And it was always obvious that sometimes a terrorist attack would slip through.Paris may have changed that calculus a bit, especially when it comes to Europe\u2019s handling of refugees, an agonizing issue that has now gotten even more fraught. And there will have to be a post-mortem on why such an elaborate plot wasn\u2019t spotted. But do you remember all the pronouncements that 9/11 would change everything? Well, it didn\u2019t \u2014 and neither will this atrocity.Again, the goal of terrorists is to inspire terror, because that\u2019s all they\u2019re capable of. And the most important thing our societies can do in response is to refuse to give in to fear.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Wealthy Governor and His Friends Are Remaking Illinois", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "Buying PowerUnprecedented political spending helped elect a fresh-faced financier. But his ideological vision has unsettled many in the state.Supported byThe richest man in Illinois does not often give speeches. But on a warm spring day two years ago, Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire founder of one of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds, rose before a black-tie dinner of the Economic Club of Chicago to deliver an urgent plea to the city\u2019s elite.Their response came quickly. In the months since, Mr. Griffin and a small group of rich supporters \u2014 not just from Chicago, but also from New York City and Los Angeles, southern Florida and Texas \u2014 have poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, a concentration of political money without precedent in Illinois history.Their wealth has forcefully shifted the state\u2019s balance of power. Last year, the families helped elect as governor Bruce Rauner, a Griffin friend and former private equity executive from the Chicago suburbs, who estimates his own fortune at more than $500 million. Now they are rallying behind Mr. Rauner\u2019s agenda: to cut spending and overhaul the state\u2019s pension system, impose term limits and weaken public employee unions.\u201cIt was clear that they wanted to change the power structure, change the way business was conducted and change the status quo,\u201d said Andy Shaw, an acquaintance of Mr. Rauner\u2019s and the president of the Better Government Association, a nonpartisan state watchdog group that received donations from Mr. Rauner before he ran.Many of those giving, like Mr. Griffin, come from the world of finance, an industry that has yielded more of the new political wealth than any other. The Florida-based leveraged-buyout pioneer John Childs, the private equity investor Sam Zell and Paul Singer, a prominent New York hedge fund manager, all helped elect Mr. Rauner, as did Richard Uihlein, a conservative businessman from the Chicago suburbs.Most of them lean Republican; some are Democrats. But to a remarkable degree, their philosophies are becoming part of a widely adopted blueprint for public officials around the country: Critical of the power of unions, many are also determined to reduce spending and taxation, and are skeptical of government-led efforts to mitigate the growing gap between the rich and everyone else.\u201cThere was never so much money behind these efforts,\u201d said Iris J. Lav, formerly a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning economic think tank in Washington.\u201cIt has gotten much stronger in the last five or six years,\u201d Ms. Lav continued. \u201cThere\u2019s the sense of an opening, of a discontent with the old model. It\u2019s about social insurance, the social compact \u2014 who\u2019s responsible for whom?\u201dIllinois was fertile ground for the movement. Four of the state\u2019s last 10 governors have gone to jail. Decades of mismanagement by state officials of both parties have left Illinois with more than $100 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, among the most of any state. Public employee unions, assured that the state\u2019s Constitution made their retirement benefits untouchable, focused on lobbying for other spending. By last year, the state owed billions more in unpaid bills.And tax increases are particularly difficult in Illinois, where other state constitutional provisions ban raising taxes solely on the rich. A temporary income tax boost presided over by the state\u2019s last Democratic governor, Pat Quinn, was resented by many voters.The future governor was among those fuming. Around Chicago, Mr. Rauner, a Republican, was known for dashing off angry, blind-copied emails about the state\u2019s fiscal woes to a long list of fellow businessmen and political leaders. Some of those who coalesced around his campaign, like Mr. Griffin, had also backed Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a Democrat, in his battles with teachers\u2019 unions. Others had collaborated on endeavors including Chicago\u2019s Olympic bid, or the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago, a group of wealthy and politically active business leaders. (Mr. Rauner, Mr. Griffin and other supporters declined requests for interviews.)\u201cThey\u2019re not what you would call the traditional corporate world,\u201d said William M. Daley, a Chicago hedge fund executive and former chief of staff to President Obama, who served on Mr. Rauner\u2019s transition team. \u201cThey come with a very political and philosophical bent.\u201dMr. Daley added, \u201cI think they believe philosophically in that business mentality and that strong public unions are a root of all evil in governing places like Illinois or Chicago and New York and California.\u201dTo bring about a revolution in the Illinois Capitol, in Springfield, Mr. Rauner and his allies have created what amounts to a new campaign economy, in which union money has long been the financial lifeblood of both parties. Contributing millions to his own campaign, Mr. Rauner triggered a state law that removes limits on campaign contributions when a wealthy candidate spends heavily on his or her own race.The law, intended to limit the influence of the wealthy by providing a level playing field, had the opposite effect: Freed of the restraints, supporters of Mr. Rauner poured millions more into his campaign, breaking state records. About half of the $65 million he spent through last year\u2019s election came from himself and nine other individuals, families or companies they control. Mr. Quinn, the incumbent, spent about $32 million, with many unions making mid-six-figure contributions.Mr. Rauner\u2019s biggest donor was Mr. Griffin, who gave $5.5 million and put his private plane at Mr. Rauner\u2019s disposal. Mr. Rauner\u2019s allies spent millions on political advocacy groups, research organizations and party committees. The Chicago Sun-Times reversed its no-endorsement policy to back Mr. Rauner, who was a part-owner of the paper before he ran for governor.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to play by the same rules as other candidates,\u201d said Bill Hyers, the chief strategist to Mr. Quinn. \u201cHe just kept on spending.\u201dLocal Republican organizations found themselves flush with cash. Mr. Rauner blanketed the state with ads promising, vaguely, to \u201cshake up Springfield\u201d and slammed Mr. Quinn as an insider beholden to special interests.Attacks on Mr. Rauner\u2019s wealth fell flat, even as he splashed around money in flamboyant ways: Late in the campaign, he drove up to a credit union on Chicago\u2019s predominantly black South Side, depositing $1 million to support small-business loans.\u201cIt had never happened before,\u201d said Otis Monroe, a community activist in Chicago. \u201cWe said, \u2018If you want black votes, you should invest in African-American-owned initiatives.\u2019 Rauner was the only one who responded.\u201dOn Election Day, Mr. Rauner won every county except Cook County, which encompasses Chicago. That evening, he giddily declared to his supporters: \u201cThis is our time. This is a transformational period. We will not accept the status quo. We are going in a new direction \u2014 the voters have spoken.\u201dThe eye-popping sums continued to flow in the weeks that followed. On the last day of December, shortly before inauguration, Mr. Rauner, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Uihlein poured an additional $20 million into Mr. Rauner\u2019s campaign committee. The money was intended to help Mr. Rauner beat back union pressure on state lawmakers during the legislative session ahead.All told, the Griffin family\u2019s contributions to Mr. Rauner through the end of 2014 came to $13.6 million \u2014 more than the combined sum donated to Mr. Quinn by 244 labor unions.For Mr. Rauner, the election results affirmed his agenda to shrink government and make the state more friendly to business.But voters seemed torn. Along with electing Mr. Rauner, they gave Democrats a supermajority in both houses of the legislature.Mr. Rauner was undeterred. Immediately after taking office, he unveiled a strikingly ambitious policy agenda, one with a more ideological tinge than even some Republicans had expected.Along with expected cuts to spending and property taxes, he proposed tort reform; local \u201cright-to-work zones,\u201d where union membership and dues would be voluntary; and a half-dozen constitutional amendments. He sought to bar public unions from making contributions to state lawmakers \u2014 state contractors are already barred \u2014 and in February issued an executive order prohibiting public employee unions from collecting mandatory fees from state workers who are not members.Mr. Rauner and his supporters believed such changes were necessary to fix Illinois: Only by disempowering the unions and making the state more hospitable to business, they have argued, can revenue grow fast enough to fix its financial problems.Mr. Rauner has since signaled he will discuss new revenues as part of a budget deal, but only if the legislature includes some of his union restrictions or other policy changes as part of the deal.\u201cI\u2019ve been one who thought he misread his mandate,\u201d said David Yepsen, the director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute. \u201cPeople were ready for a change, but the emphasis on attacking the labor movement, that really poisoned the water here.\u201dThe unexpected rift between Mr. Rauner and his constituents echoes a greater divide between the political views of the very wealthy and those of the broader public, one that has taken on new significance as the rich invest more time and money in politics.Their replies were striking. Where merely affluent Americans are more likely to identify as Democrats than as Republicans, the ultrawealthy overwhelmingly leaned right. They are far more likely to raise money for politicians and to have access to them; nearly half had personally contacted one of Illinois\u2019s two United States senators.Where the general public overwhelmingly supports a high minimum wage, the one percent are broadly opposed. A majority of Americans supported expanding safety-net and retirement programs, while most of the very wealthy opposed them. And while Americans are not enthusiastic about higher taxes generally, they feel strongly that the rich should pay more than they do, and more than everyone else pays.\u201cProbably the biggest single area of disconnect has to do with social welfare programs,\u201d said Benjamin I. Page, a political scientist at Northwestern University and a co-author of the study. \u201cThe other big area has to do with paying for those programs, particularly taxes on high-income and wealthy people.\u201dIllinois, Mr. Page added, is \u201ca case study of the disconnect in action \u2014 between what average citizens want the government to do and what it does.\u201dTo encourage Republican lawmakers to stick with him on tough votes, the governor has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to them. In April, ex-Rauner aides set up Turnaround Illinois, a super PAC designed to support state lawmakers who backed his agenda and \u201coppose those who stand in the way,\u201d according to state filings. The group\u2019s main contributor is Mr. Zell, the Chicago investor and Republican donor, who gave $4 million.In June, after Mr. Rauner and lawmakers failed to reach a budget deal, Turnaround Illinois spent close to $1 million on television ads assailing Democrats.The true impact of their financial muscle may not be felt until the legislative elections next fall, in which Mr. Rauner\u2019s allies could again exploit an opening in the campaign finance law to spend unprecedented sums. (The same provision that removed the caps on Mr. Rauner\u2019s campaign lifts them in any legislative race in which a \u201csuper PAC\u201d spends more than $100,000. Mr. Rauner\u2019s group has enough money to trigger the law in more than two dozen races.)Mr. Rauner\u2019s closest supporters hope to elect more Republicans. But some wealthy families, mindful that Democrats are likely to control the legislature for the foreseeable future, have financed an even more ambitious goal: to carve out a new faction of Democrats more willing to reach a compromise with the governor.That effort has raised more than $14 million, in donations that rival the largest contributions in the presidential campaign. One million dollars came from Helen Zell, Mr. Zell\u2019s wife, and $2 million from the head of a financial firm in which Mr. Rauner is an investor. The largest disclosed contribution came from hundreds of miles beyond Illinois: The former Texas energy trader John Arnold and his wife, Laura, gave $5 million.\u201cOne might ask why Laura and I should be able to influence policy decisions just because we have money,\u201d Mr. Arnold wrote. \u201cWere government immune from lobbyists and money, I would agree on the premise of the question. However, government is deeply influenced by special interests.\u201dHis goal, Mr. Arnold wrote, was \u201cto counterbalance these entrenched forces, on the right and the left, by providing policy solutions rooted in objectivity and solid analysis.\u201dFor the moment, Illinois is creaking along, polarized and deeply discontent with its leaders. Five months into the fiscal year, the state has no budget. A combination of court orders and partial appropriations bills has kept the government in operation, but at a level of spending that exceeds the state\u2019s current revenue.Now, every month, Illinois falls even further behind on its bills. Illinois politicians, on the other hand, are flush as never before.As of early November, Mr. Rauner and the state\u2019s new super PACs had a combined $36 million available to spend. The state\u2019s 15 best-funded labor union PACs, along with campaign committees controlled by Democratic legislative leaders, had slightly more than half that, but are likely to put in millions more in the months ahead.Next year\u2019s legislative races promise to be the most expensive in history. And Mr. Rauner, those who know him say, is just getting started.Said Mr. Shaw, of the Better Government Association, \u201cI think he views this as a very long, long term war.\u2019\u2019Sarah Cohen contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Split on Tapping Fed or Banks to Fund Roads", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The banking industry scored a surprise victory on Thursday when the House voted to pay for part of a new highway bill by draining a rainy-day fund at the Federal Reserve rather than cutting federal payments to some of the nation\u2019s largest banks.The Senate, scrounging for road-building money, voted earlier this year to reduce the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual dividend payments to large commercial banks, saving about $17.1 billion over the next decade. The House was to follow suit, but after loud protests from the big banks, its final version of the highway bill preserves those dividends and instead requires the Fed to provide $59.5 billion over 10 years instead of putting the money into an account intended to cover potential losses.Now congressional negotiators must decide which to hit, the Fed or the banks.The House vote, by a margin of 354 to 72, is a triumph for banking industry lobbyists who bitterly opposed the Senate\u2019s plan, warning of terrible but unspecified consequences. But some independent experts criticized both measures for picking on a pair of popular villains rather than raising infrastructure funds in more logical ways, for example, by raising the federal gas tax.Even the author of the House plan sounded apologetic. \u201cThis is not perfect policy, but it is much better than the alternative,\u201d Representative Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican, said on the House floor early Thursday. Mr. Neugebauer said he hoped that future transportation funding \u201ccomes from transportation users and not completely unrelated sectors of our economy.\u201dThe Senate plan rewrites a deal with the banking industry that dates to 1913, when Congress created a Federal Reserve System of 12 regional institutions to pool the reserves of commercial banks, freeing up money for lending in good times, providing a backstop in bad times and creating a clearinghouse to improve the flow of financial transactions. Membership is voluntary for most banks; those that join must buy shares in the local reserve bank and get a 6 percent annual dividend.The Senate plan would cut that dividend to 1.5 percent for banks with at least $1 billion in assets. Proponents describe the current arrangement as a sweetheart deal that has outlived its purpose.\u201cHow many of my colleagues or their constituents have a safe investment that pays this well?\u201d Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, asked on the House floor Thursday morning. \u201cMost of my constituents are lucky to earn a penny a month on their bank accounts.\u201dThe banking industry and its allies, however, see the changes as a breach of faith. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, warned of \u201cunintended consequences\u201d at a July Senate hearing, including the possibility that some smaller banks might leave the Fed system. Most of all, opponents have seized on the argument that the federal government should not penalize banks to build roads.They rallied support in two crucial ways. First, they also proposed to strike a measure from the Senate plan that raised $1.9 billion by increasing the fee that mortgage borrowers must pay on loans guaranteed by the government-owned housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This drew support from Democrats opposed to what one termed a \u201ctax on homeownership.\u201dSecond, they identified an even more lucrative source of funding: the Fed itself.The Fed transfers most of its profits to the Treasury Department each year \u2014 it has contributed about $500 billion since 2008 \u2014 but it stashes some in a \u201csurplus\u201d account as a bulwark against the possibility of a bad year. That account held $28.6 billion at the end of last year.The Fed, however, has not incurred an annual loss since 1915. Furthermore, while there is a chance it could lose money in the next decade, as it unwinds its economic stimulus campaign, the surplus is a second line of defense. The Fed also has the capital it raises by selling shares.And the size of the surplus is unrelated to any estimate of the Fed\u2019s potential losses. It grows in proportion to the banking industry. The Government Accountability Office accordingly concluded in a 1996 report that the amount \u201ccould be safely reduced or returned to the Treasury.\u201dThe Fed, already opposed to the Senate plan, said in a statement Thursday it did not much like the House plan either. \u201cUsing the resources of the Federal Reserve to finance fiscal spending sets a bad precedent,\u201d it said. \u201cIt infringes on the independence of the central bank and weakens fiscal discipline.\u201dBut Congress has a long history of tapping the surplus, beginning in 1933 when it took half of the money to fill the coffers of the new Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.More recently, after the 1996 accountability office report, Congress skimmed off about $100 million in 1997 and again in 1998, and $3.7 billion in 2000.The new measure, however, is considerably more aggressive. For the first time, it would drain the entirety of the surplus and prevent the Fed from refilling it.By doing so, the House plan would provide about $40 billion more over the next decade than the Senate\u2019s plan. Adam Rice, a spokesman for Mr. Neugebauer, said the congressman did not have a strong view about what should be done with the extra billions. \u201cWe would want to use it to pay down the debt and deficit, but that\u2019s up to leadership,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Koch Brothers Woo Hispanic Voters With Turkeys and Questionnaires", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 The crowd that lined up around a megachurch here last week \u2014 largely Hispanic and mostly poor \u2014 came for the Saturday services, but also for the free flu shots that were being offered in the church, and for the Thanksgiving turkeys being given away just outside.But before they received their turkeys, those in line were asked to answer a few questions: Were they more likely to vote for a Republican or a Democrat in the 2016 presidential election? And did they feel that the government should increase or decrease federal spending in order to improve the economy?Volunteers, holding clipboards and speaking mainly in Spanish, collected the names, telephone numbers and email addresses of everyone who showed up.The approach \u2014 a free Thanksgiving turkey in exchange for some personal information \u2014 captures the mission of Libre, a multimillion-dollar effort financed by the conservative billionaire Kochs and devoted to winning over Hispanics, with the message that economic freedom and smaller-government principles will yield opportunity and prosperity.With an increased emphasis on Hispanic outreach, the Kochs are hoping to step in where the Republican Party has, by many accounts, failed. After the 2012 presidential election \u2014 Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote \u2014 a report by the party concluded that it would have to make significant inroads with Hispanic voters to retake the White House.\u201cThey\u2019ve been just terribly disappointing,\u201d said Daniel Garza, 47, the son of migrant farm workers who is now the executive director of the Libre Initiative, during an interview at a candidates forum with Jeb Bush last month in Las Vegas. \u201cI wish they would ramp up their efforts and do a lot more on the policy side, but again we\u2019re not going to wait around for them.\u201dThe group declined to say precisely how much it would spend during this election cycle, but the sum is expected to surpass the $9 million it spent from 2013 to 2014. Representatives for the Kochs also declined to make them available for comment.Such efforts could prove especially important to Republicans in a presidential election cycle in which immigration has returned as a wedge issue and the rhetoric from many Republican candidates has become increasingly vitriolic.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Libre, reflecting the Koch\u2019s views, supports a broad overhaul of the immigration system, including a path to citizenship. It waged a campaign in support of the Senate\u2019s 2013 immigration effort, including airing in excess of $1 million in television ads. Those positions have put the group at odds with many of the party\u2019s grass-roots conservative voters.But the group has also drawn the ire of some Hispanic and immigration advocacy groups by raising concerns about some of President Obama\u2019s more sweeping executive actions on immigration, and by pouring money into House races to help defeat two Hispanic lawmakers \u2014 Pete P. Gallego of Texas and Joe Garcia of Florida, both Democrats \u2014 because they supported the president\u2019s health care plan, among other issues Libre opposes.Craig Hughes, a Democratic strategist who managed Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns in Colorado along with Senator Michael Bennet\u2019s 2010 race there, said that while the group\u2019s \u201cpotentially unlimited funds\u201d from the Koch network were a source of worry for him, he thought the group would still have a tough time making its pitch to Hispanic voters.\u201cThe question is, does an aggressive outreach and relationship-building program help them when their candidates are at such odds with the population?\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cI am highly doubtful, but I never underestimate the impact of a massive amount of money in politics.\u201dLibre, which was created in June 2011, now has between 65 and 70 full-time employees in nine states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Freedom Partners, an umbrella organization for Koch network donors, has provided the group with $15.8 million in funding, according to federal tax records, and Libre now has more than 1,000 donors of its own.The initiative is based on a model used successfully by Democratic-leaning groups in Hispanic-outreach efforts, consisting of both an education component (the Libre Institute, a nonprofit) and an advocacy arm (the Libre Initiative).The group says that it genuinely wants to make a difference in the community, and offers its services to everyone, including undocumented immigrants. Libre has helped Hispanics get driver\u2019s licenses in Nevada, provided English lessons in Florida and held seminars on how to start a business in Virginia.These community services speak to what the group says is its core mission \u2014 to provide Hispanics with the tools to lift themselves toward the American dream of economic freedom and success, while also showing them that they do not need to rely on the government to succeed.At same time, Libre\u2019s advocacy arm engages deeply in the political process. Since the group\u2019s inception, Libre volunteers have made 4.7 million phone calls and knocked on 160,000 doors; their goal is to make three million calls this cycle.Even at community-focused events, every attendee is typically asked for some bit of information \u2014 email, phone number, and perhaps an issue of concern \u2014 which is then provided to both Libre and i360, the Koch network\u2019s voter data operation. And every event usually has some tie-in with Libre\u2019s economic policy agenda.\u201cWithout question, with apologies to nobody, we want to influence the policy agenda,\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cIt should come with some type of messaging, everything we do, and we don\u2019t apologize for that. We are an advocacy organization.\u201dDemocrats are taking notice. Crist\u00f3bal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, said that after being \u201ccaught by surprise in 2014,\u201d his group is working with other Hispanic organizations across the nation to counter Libre\u2019s influence.\u201cThey\u2019re a threat in the sense that their focus is very much aligned with the Tea Party, and the type of work that they do, in our view, is really about advancing their donors\u2019 prerogatives, the Koch brothers\u2019 prerogatives,\u201d Mr. Alex said. \u201cThat\u2019s the threat. They\u2019re pouring significant resources into our communities to get Latinos to vote against their own best interests.\u201dThe challenge of turning credibility with Hispanic communities into votes was illustrated by the Saturday church event where most of the attendees \u2014 who cooled themselves with Libre-emblazoned cardboard fans and clutched blue and yellow Libre balloons \u2014 had never heard of the group before and mostly leaned Democratic or were apolitical.Haydee Colina, 52, came to the United States from Panama, and is not yet eligible to vote. With her daughter helping to translate, Ms. Colina said she appreciated the work Libre was doing. \u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d she said.\u201cBut,\u201d her daughter added, \u201cof course she would still vote Democratic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Congressional Budget Office calculates the cost of each individual tax break, yet it doesn\u2019t extrapolate the costs beyond the overall package\u2019s one- or two-year extension. This gives the public the false impression that the cost will be both temporary and smaller than a long-term extension.Washington should just abandon this ill-conceived tradition. There are better ways to amend the tax code to improve the economy and give taxpayers relief. Members of both parties claim they support tax reform that would lower both corporate and individual tax rates.

It is a strategy her campaign believes will be effective in a general election contest after having a dry run before the primaries.\u201cThey are running on the same economic policies that have failed us before,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in Memphis on Friday. She did not mention Mr. Sanders, but his stances on wealth and income have seemed to influence his rival\u2019s populist tone. \u201cTrickledown economics, cut taxes on the wealthy, get out of the way of big corporations,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, we know how that story ends, don\u2019t we?\u201dAt a town-hall-style event in Grinnell, Iowa, this month, Mrs. Clinton, talking about the importance of voter participation, even seemed to forget, albeit briefly, that the short-term goal was to win the Iowa caucuses. \u201cIf not me, I hope you caucus for somebody,\u201d she said. She paused. \u201cI hope more of you caucus for me.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s obsession with the Republican Party is a tactic to diminish her main Democratic primary opponent, whose economic message has attracted enormous crowds and enthusiasm.As Mr. Sanders delivered his standard speech about inequality here on Saturday, Mr. Weaver closely watched the voters in the front row who wore blue \u201cH\u201d T-shirts, indicating their support for Mrs. Clinton, as they cheered for Mr. Sanders several times.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\u201cWe are much closer to Secretary Clinton today than Senator Obama was in 2008,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they think this is locked up.\u201d\u201cThere are forces no candidate can control, and they can be detrimental,\u201d Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, said when asked about the newfound focus on defeating the Islamic State. \u201cI believe in this case third-party forces are working in her favor.\u201d\u201cBy turning up the heat on Republicans, going after Trump, that\u2019s all part of the essence of saying, \u2018I am the leader of the Democratic Party,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Robert Shrum, a strategist for Democratic presidential candidates including John Kerry and Al Gore.Even as Mrs. Clinton focuses firmly on the Republicans, her campaign is increasing its indirect, if aggressive, moves to squeeze Mr. Sanders.In recent days, she has unveiled a plan to give Americans with unexpected medical costs a tax credit of $2,500 for an individual or $5,000 for a family. On Sunday in Iowa, she introduced another tax credit to cover up to $6,000 of medical expenses for middle-class families caring for ailing parents or grandparents. \u201cI believe you deserve a raise, not a tax increase,\u201d she said in Memphis.The Sanders campaign said that his plan would save the average family $5,000 a year through the elimination of premiums, deductibles and co-payments, and it called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan \u201cRepublican-lite\u201d because it proposed short-term tax cuts over long-term benefits.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s opponents point out that there is no more precarious place for her to be than when she seems inevitable, as she did in the early months of the 2008 Democratic primary before she finished third in the Iowa caucuses behind Senators Barack Obama and John Edwards.This month, just after Mrs. Clinton had officially put her name on the ballot in New Hampshire, she took some questions from local reporters at the State House in Concord. The first question: \u201cHow does it feel to once again be inevitable?\u201dMrs. Clinton said she had put her name on the ballot in that very room in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m back again,\u201d she said. \u201cI intend to do everything I can to work as hard as possible to be successful this time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Lives Lengthen, Costs Mount", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "Some elderly New Yorkers receive too much income to be eligible for assistance, but not enough to pay for the services they need.Supported byFrederick Jones and Ping Wong are both over 85; both live on fixed incomes; and both have health problems that limit their mobility. From there, their lives diverge in ways that illuminate the uneven challenges facing New York\u2019s oldest old.Mr. Jones, 88, did everything he could to secure a comfortable retirement. He worked for nearly 35 years for the City of New York, retiring with substantial savings and a union pension and Social Security benefits adding up to $3,000 a month. Ms. Wong, 90, never had the opportunity to save for her old age. She worked part time for below the minimum wage at a doctor\u2019s office in Chinatown, earning $500 to $700 a month. Her retirement income, including food stamps, comes to about a third of Mr. Jones\u2019s.Yet the differences in their lives are not what one might expect. Because her income is so low, Ms. Wong qualified for a subsidized apartment in an elevator building near Gramercy Park, where she pays roughly $200 a month in rent and spends her days playing mah-jongg with friends in the downstairs activity room. A home attendant comes for seven hours a day, cleaning and cooking and running errands, at no charge to Ms. Wong. Until recently, when Ms. Wong decided she did not like the food, she received food seven days a week from CityMeals-on-Wheels, which asks only for a voluntary donation. She never worries about money, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s very cheap for low-income people,\u201d she said.Mr. Jones, in contrast, falls into what has been called a doughnut hole: He earns too much money to be eligible for most government subsidies, but not enough to pay for the services that would make his old age comfortable. Though he pays only $300 a month for a rent-controlled apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the building has no elevator and the low rent has become a trap. Mr. Jones had parts of two toes amputated this summer, making the 36 stairs to his third-floor apartment a grueling test. Cleaning and cooking are almost beyond him; on my last visit, I changed two light bulbs for him because he could not get up on a ladder.\u201cEvery time they come out with a new benefit for the elderly, it\u2019s for people who make less than me, so that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d Mr. Jones said.\u201cThey built a new building for the elderly about two blocks from where my daughter lives, so that was great. She said, please take that apartment.\u201dBut Mr. Jones said the building was only for people with incomes below $15,000 a year. \u201cAnd thank God I got a little more than that,\u201d he said.Mr. Jones and Ms. Wong are among the six New Yorkers over age 85 whom I have been following since the beginning of the year. They represent one of the fastest-growing age groups in New York, nearly doubling in number since 1980 \u2014 healthier, better educated and more independent than any like cohort before them. Many never planned to live this long, or to navigate a financial landscape as confounding as the one they are in now.In their lifetimes they have seen Social Security and Medicare greatly reduce poverty among older people. But in New York today, they face a challenge of prosperity. The boom in housing prices has left many of them vulnerable, often clinging to apartments that are no longer suitable for their aging bodies.\u201cPeople end up as prisoners in their own home,\u201d said Donna M. Corrado, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department for the Aging. Even the real estate winners \u2014 those who bought cheaply, before the market took off \u2014 now face rising property taxes that may overwhelm their fixed incomes. And older tenants with low rents are prime targets for unscrupulous landlords, who want them to move out so they can raise the apartments to market rates. \u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle, and greater in New York than anywhere else,\u201d Ms. Corrado said.One result has been to drive relatively healthy people into nursing homes, where Medicaid picks up the tab for eligible seniors, said Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive of the nonprofit RiverSpring Health, which operates the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx.\u201cYou have people in our facility, you say, why are they here?\u201d Mr. Reingold said. \u201cThey seem to be in good shape. They lived in a three-story walk-up, or they outlived their money. They\u2019re coming to a nursing home because they can\u2019t afford their housing or there is no available housing.\u201dMayor Bill de Blasio has promised to build or preserve 10,000 units of affordable housing for the elderly and 1,000 units for homeless seniors. Mr. de Blasio also expanded a rent freeze for eligible people age 62 and over.But there is a lot of catching up to do. Of the 165,000 units of affordable housing created or preserved in the last decade of the Bloomberg administration, only about 3,600 were earmarked for low-income older people, mostly under a federal program that was vastly curtailed in 2010, according to LiveOn.At Ms. Wong\u2019s building near Gramercy Park, where rents are set at 30 percent of a tenant\u2019s income, the waiting list for apartments has been closed almost since the building opened 10 years ago, because so many people applied for the 70 apartments, said Philip Deans, the housing manager for Cabrini Apartments, a part of the nonprofit Cabrini Elder Care.\u201cI\u2019m still working from that original list,\u201d Mr. Deans said. \u201cEvery week I receive walk-ins or phone calls from children in crisis mode: \u2018What can I do? Where can I go?\u2019\u201dA comparable subsidized building that opened in Queens three years ago received more than 2,700 applications for 66 units.Mr. Jones was not dismayed. He never is. \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t have any money worries, thank God,\u201d he said. \u201cI have none. My only money worries are, keep the ladies away from it.\u201dHe opened a folder of photos from his younger days: sporting a double-breasted suit and flared pocket handkerchief, or in a boxer\u2019s stance, with a bushy mustache curling rakishly down around his upper lip. They are portraits of a player in full plumage.I asked him when in his life he was happiest.Articles in this series looked at the lives of a group of New Yorkers age 85 and older, and how they navigate life at the upper end of old age in this city.\u201cRight now,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cI have health problems, but it\u2019s been going on a long time, so it\u2019s secondary. But I think happiness really is what\u2019s going on at a particular time. I used to think happiness was something that somebody brought to you. But happiness, as opposed to enjoyment, is when you are doing something and you are elated.\u201dMr. Jones was born in 1927, two years before the start of the Great Depression, and lost his father, to a burst appendix, before his third birthday. His mother supported the family in Norfolk, Va., as a seamstress.\u201cMy mother took care of my grandmother, my brother, myself and herself, and she was making $25 a week,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cI say, man, money is worth nothing these days.\u201d He said he never knew he was poor until he was 16 or 17, when he read about how other people lived.After serving overseas during World War II, he attended Virginia State University for free on the G.I. Bill, and when he got to New York, an older man steered him toward the civil service. \u201cHe said, \u2018If you don\u2019t want to ever be on the unemployment line, work for the city, state or federal government, don\u2019t steal anything, and you got it made.\u2019 And that was true.\u201dOn his couch, Mr. Jones smiled at the memories. An old bicycle, unused since 1967, stood between the couch and a metal window gate. A working television rested atop a nonworking one that Mr. Jones would like to sell. He does not have cable.The apartment\u2019s intercom has not worked for close to a year, so if any visitors come, Mr. Jones has to either walk downstairs or hope they\u2019ll wait until someone opens the front door. Last year he successfully sued his landlord to get handrails on the staircase. Mr. Jones said the landlord had no incentive to make him comfortable.He often skips meals because it is too much trouble to shop and cook, he said. If there are services available to him, he is not aware of them, and as more public information migrates to the Internet, it might as well be on Mars.And the building has its advantages, Mr. Jones said. Neighbors check in on him or help carry things up the stairs.\u201cWhen I retired, my purpose was to make friends, get all the retirement money that I could and move from where I am now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I never did it. When you get hung up between cheap rent in a bad place and expensive rent in a better place, you say, this is not that good, but I\u2019ve been here for certain years, and I keep talking myself into staying here. When people say they\u2019re paying a thousand dollars a month rent, I don\u2019t raise an eyebrow, \u2019cause that\u2019s what\u2019s going on now.\u201dIn the activity room at Cabrini Apartments, Ping Wong expounded on her good fortune, with one complaint. Ms. Wong walks stiffly after replacement surgery on both hips and has arthritis pain in her arms and legs. One of her neighbors, who is two years younger than she is, receives more hours from her home attendant.\u201cI need more hours, not just seven hours,\u201d Ms. Wong said. \u201cI\u2019m older than her, so I should have more time. My home attendant comes at 11 o\u2019clock and leaves at 6. I have too many things to do myself in the morning.\u201dMr. Deans, the housing manager, said Ms. Wong was \u201cabout average\u201d at taking advantage of available public services. \u201cShe\u2019s aware of it but doesn\u2019t know how to tap into it,\u201d he said. But she is very sociable and seeks out the building\u2019s social workers, he said.Ms. Wong grew up in Hong Kong, one of five sisters born to a successful home builder. When she finished high school, she said, her father wanted help working with English-speaking clients, so he sent her to London for a year to learn the language.But when she immigrated to the United States in 1982, her limited English skills kept her in low-wage jobs, and her husband died before earning more than minimal Social Security survivor benefits. She worked until she was nearly 80, commuting from Staten Island to Chinatown in Manhattan, until she began to fear she would be knocked down in the crowded city buses.These days, Ms. Wong economizes by not buying clothing, and stretches her $200 monthly food stamps by sending her home attendant to Chinatown to shop. She gets cheap prescription drug coverage through AARP, and uses a cellphone provided by her daughter. With her meager savings, she managed to buy a $20,000 burial insurance policy, so she would not burden her daughter.A few years ago her daughter gave her a laptop so she could communicate with her grandchildren in China, but the machine was too heavy for Ms. Wong to move around the apartment, and when they tried a tablet, Ms. Wong\u2019s hands shook too much to work the touchscreen.Ms. Wong thinks often about money, and what she thinks is: People should spend it while they\u2019re young \u2014 travel the world, enjoy life. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use keeping money in the bank?\u201d she said. \u201cNot to keep it for descendants. They have their own salary. I need not take care of them. They should take care of me.\u201dShe added: \u201cI\u2019m not the elderly person keeping the money in the quilt or the refrigerator. I like to spend.\u201dHer daughter, Elaine Gin, who lives in New Jersey, handles her Social Security checks and bills, and allots her $200 each month in spending money, as well as occasional sums from her own accounts. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to the bank to withdraw money,\u201d Ms. Wong said. \u201cShe tells me how much I spend, how much is left. If I need money to give to people here, she gives it to me.\u201d Ms. Wong thinks a bigger tip to her home attendant\u2019s agency this Christmas will get her approved for more hours.Toward the other end of the economic spectrum are New Yorkers like Ruth Willig, 92, who pays more than $5,000 a month to live in an assisted living center in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Ms. Willig, who worked as a microbiologist, never handled her investments until her husband died 20 years ago, leaving her with a broker whose conversation she says she does not always understand. \u201cBut he\u2019s done well for me,\u201d she said.Yet Ms. Willig, too, has been buffeted by the economy. Last year she had to leave her assisted living home in Park Slope, Brooklyn, when the owner abruptly announced plans to close it. (A few residents are still living there, under degraded conditions.)Reared in Brownsville during the Depression, Ms. Willig was always cautious with money. She and her husband took the family on vacations, but in tent trailers rather than hotels. They sent their four children to college, but to state schools. \u201cThere were times when to write the check we had to wait for the next income,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think I was worrying that much about it. He tried to keep me informed, but I really didn\u2019t pay that much attention.\u201dWhen her friends from the Park Slope center moved to a comparable building in Lower Manhattan, she chose Sheepshead Bay instead, in part because it was less expensive. She misses her friends.On a recent morning in her tidy one-bedroom apartment, Ms. Willig talked about something she called \u201cmy dilemma.\u201d She wore a neat T-shirt that she had put off ironing because it hurts her to bend to plug in the iron, the sort of small task that is getting harder every year. Her dilemma was whether to endure the pain or hire an attendant, which can grow increasingly expensive. She did not want to outlive her savings.\u201cThen I think, what do I need all this money for?\u201d she said. \u201cMy daughter says, Ma, you never know what\u2019s going to take place in your life, which is true. So I force myself to take care of the apartment. And I\u2019m able to, thank God. It\u2019s not as neat as I\u2019d like it to be.\u201dFor now, she was secure, she said.Sun poured into the apartment, and the bay shimmered outside. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so comfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shocks me.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Oil-Soaked Globe as Production Keeps Climbing and Demand Falls", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe renewed collapse in crude prices is helping to again drive down gasoline prices for American drivers, to a national average of $2.19 a gallon for regular gasoline on Friday, according to the AAA motor club. That is 9 cents below the price a month ago and 73 cents below the price a year ago.The slide in oil companies\u2019 fortunes has been significant because of expanded production in Russia, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, as well as a slowdown in demand growth in China and the expectation by commodity traders that the Iran nuclear deal will introduce large quantities of oil to the glutted market.The surge in production has led to a global stockpile of three billion barrels of crude, roughly the equivalent of a month of world oil production. The global market has not been this saturated since 2009, when demand for fuel plummeted.\u201cThis massive cushion,\u201d the International Energy Agency, based in Paris, noted in a report on Friday, has produced \u201can unprecedented buffer against geopolitical shocks or unexpected supply disruptions.\u201dThe report helped to decrease the price of West Texas Intermediate, an American benchmark in oil pricing, by more than a dollar at one point on Friday. It almost reached $40 a barrel, its lowest level since last summer and before that in 2009. Oil prices were above $100 a barrel as recently as the summer of 2014.But energy experts say that despite the huge stockpiles, the oil market could easily be shaken by a crisis in the Middle East, like a major terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia or a collapse in Iraq, and prices could soar again.\u201cThe market is myopic,\u201d said Steven Wood, a managing director at Moody\u2019s Corporate Finance Group. \u201cThere is no spare capacity in the world. The market isn\u2019t pricing in any risk, geopolitical risk, for oil.\u201dStill, Moody\u2019s projects that oil prices will rise slowly, to an average for West Texas Intermediate crude of $48 a barrel in 2016 and $55 in 2017. The global Brent benchmark, now just under $44 a barrel, will rise to $53 in 2016 and to $60 in 2017, Moody\u2019s projects.Behind the low price projections is a sluggish world economy, experts say. The I.E.A. report on Friday suggested that world demand growth for oil would slow in 2016 to 1.2 million barrels a day after reaching a five-year high of 1.8 million barrels a day in 2015.Low commodity prices and tight financing have forced oil companies in the United States to decommission more than half of their rigs, leading to tens of thousands of layoffs in oil states like Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma. To keep their leases, and unwilling to pay while drilling rigs already under contract stand idle, many operators are drilling wells without completing them \u2014 meaning that as soon as prices begin to revive, they can quickly complete the wells and begin production, thus forcing prices down again.Investments in new exploration are down about 20 percent this year, and more cuts are expected in 2016.Many in the industry expect large cash-rich companies like Exxon Mobil to buy small operators with strong shale positions that should be profitable when prices rebound.Last week, Anadarko Petroleum, in a move to build a giant position in Texas\u2019 shale fields, made a failed bid to buy Apache Corporation. Also, Concho Resources, a major West Texas producer, is reportedly making a quiet bid for Clayton Williams Energy, another Texas oil company.\u201cIf the price is lower for longer, I do see more consolidation next year,\u201d Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas producer, said in a recent interview. He added that \u201c2016 is going to be another tough year.\u201dIn a recent report, Citi Research said that the shale operators were \u201cnow being financially stress-tested by low prices, exposing shale\u2019s dirty secret: Many shale producers outspend cash flow and thus depend on capital market injections to fund ongoing activity.\u201dCapital markets are responding by making lending practices tighter and loans more expensive. With many smaller producers borrowing on the high-yield markets, bond yields on energy issues have increased substantially in recent months. There have already been as many as eight company defaults this year.But not everyone associated with the oil industry is losing these days. As the enormous ships sail in figure eights around the globe, the tanker companies are reaping the rewards, making as much as $70,000 a day, if not more, for their services.An article on Saturday about a worldwide glut of oil misstated, in some copies, the growth of inventories of American crude last week. American crude inventories grew last week to a total of 487 million barrels; inventories did not grow by that much during the week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Changes From E.U., David Cameron Outlines Conditions for Britain to Stay", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a speech here and a written letter of proposals for reform, Mr. Cameron called on fellow European leaders to grant him a series of concessions to help persuade wavering Britons to remain in a bloc that critics say has become a vast bureaucracy impinging on their national sovereignty and way of life. Mr. Cameron has promised to put the issue to a referendum by the end of 2017, and his aides suggest that he might do so as early as next June.In his speech, Mr. Cameron told British voters that their decision would be crucial and the final say on the issue \u2014 a \u201conce-in-a-generation choice.\u201d He said, \u201cYou will hold this country\u2019s destiny in your hands; this is a huge decision for our country, perhaps the biggest we will make in our lifetimes.\u201dThe negotiation over Britain\u2019s demands will also be a crucial test for nations, starting with Germany and France, that are struggling to maintain cohesion and a sense of progress within the bloc after years in which economic stagnation, rising populism and assertive nationalism have undercut their plans to bind the Continent\u2019s governments and people more closely together.After months of quiet talks with European leaders, who generally want Britain to stay but are resistant to any changes to the bloc\u2019s main principles, Mr. Cameron is hoping to get the basics of a deal done at the next European Union summit meeting in mid-December, or failing that, at an emergency summit meeting early next year. His aides say he does not want to drag out the referendum, with some suggesting that he would prefer to have it before what could be another chaotic summer of migrant flows to Europe. The handling of that issue has already undermined the reputation of the European Union in British eyes.Crucially, he said that Britain should have the right to restrict welfare entitlements, including benefits for low-income workers, for four years for migrants arriving from other European countries. That is widely regarded as his most difficult demand because it would be a departure from current European rules stipulating that citizens of all countries in the bloc should be treated equally \u2014 a point made by European officials on Tuesday.Mr. Cameron has made clear that he wants a deal that will allow Britain to stay, but in an effort to retain negotiating leverage and credibility with the anti-European right wing of his Conservative Party, he has also signaled that he is willing to walk away if necessary and that he believes that Britain could do just fine on its own if the union does not grant him what he wants. The British public remains roughly split on the merits of membership in the bloc, according to opinion polls.Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research institute, said Mr. Cameron was striking a tricky balance.\u201cThe speech has both pro-European elements \u2014 preparing the case to keep Britain in the European Union \u2014 and language that is much more aggressive,\u201d he said.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to show that he\u2019s not a pushover,\u201d Mr. Leonard added. \u201cHe has at least to keep up the appearance that he is willing to walk away because that is the logic in which the whole renegotiation is founded.\u201dNigel Lawson, a prominent Conservative and former chancellor who is campaigning for Britain to leave the union, described Mr. Cameron\u2019s goals as \u201cdisappointingly unambitious.\u201d Dominic Cummings, director of the Vote Leave campaign, said he expected Mr. Cameron \u201cto get what he\u2019s asking for \u2014 but what he\u2019s asking for is trivial.\u201dThe most difficult aspect of the negotiation is likely to be over the demand for changes to the rules regarding social welfare payments to migrants. Mr. Cameron is seeking the step as a way of reducing immigration at a time when high joblessness on the Continent is leading many Europeans to seek work in Britain\u2019s relatively strong economy.Other European governments have made clear that they will not alter what they view as a foundation of the European Union \u2014 the principle of freedom of movement and labor within the bloc \u2014 to accommodate Britain.That has threatened Mr. Cameron\u2019s plan to try to temporarily limit benefits to new European migrants, thereby reducing the incentive for them to come to Britain. But because his partners will not accept discrimination, he will have to apply those limits to new British employees, too \u2014 unless he can win an exemption from the rules from other European leaders.Margaritis Schinas, a spokesman for the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, underlined the sensitivity of the issue, saying that some of Mr. Cameron\u2019s proposals \u201care highly problematic, as they touch upon the fundamental freedoms of our internal market.\u201d He added, \u201cDirect discrimination between E.U. citizens clearly falls into this last category.\u201d\u201cI understand how difficult some of these issues are for other member states, and I look forward to discussing these proposals further so we can find a solution that deals with this issue,\u201d Mr. Cameron wrote in the letter to Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, a country with hundreds of thousands of citizens working in Britain.Mr. Cameron promised a plebiscite nearly three years ago to calm anti-European sentiment in his Conservative Party, a decision that now leaves him with one of the most difficult political challenges of his tenure.Mr. Cameron\u2019s demand that Britain be exempted from Europe\u2019s commitment to an \u201cever closer union\u201d is indicative of his efforts to assuage some of the criticism in Britain of European aims. The phrase, which dates to the founding documents of one of the current union\u2019s precursors, is important to anti-Europeans because it suggests to them a continual ceding of authority to Brussels. But the phrase actually talks of \u201can ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\u201d \u2014 not necessarily among its governments \u2014 and in any case it is more aspirational than prescriptive.In a passage welcomed by pro-Europeans, Mr. Cameron said that while Britain could survive outside the bloc, leaving it would not lead the nation automatically to a \u201cland of milk and honey,\u201d and that any decision to quit should be made \u201cwith our eyes open.\u201dBut he also warned that if he failed to reach his negotiating objectives and his requests fell on \u201cdeaf ears,\u201d Britain \u201cwould have to think again\u201d about membership.Mr. Leonard argued that Mr. Cameron\u2019s concerns were significant but not important enough to outweigh the benefits of membership in the bloc.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like threatening to walk out on a marriage of four decades because your husband doesn\u2019t put the top on the toothpaste tube,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter From Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Saudi Arabia is a country that is easier to write about from afar, where you can just tee off on the place as a source of the most austere, antipluralistic version of Islam \u2014 the most extreme versions of which have been embraced by the Islamic State, or ISIS. What messes me up is when I go there and meet people I really like and I see intriguing countertrends.Last week I came here looking for clues about the roots of ISIS, which has drawn some 1,000 Saudi youth to its ranks. I won\u2019t pretend to have penetrated the mosques of bearded young men, steeped in Salafist/Wahhabi Islam, who don\u2019t speak English and whence ISIS draws recruits. I know, though, that the conservative clergy is still part of the ruling bargain here \u2014 some of the most popular Twitter voices are religious firebrands \u2014 and those religious leaders still run the justice system and sentence liberal bloggers to flogging, and they\u2019re still in denial about how frustrated the world is with the ideology they\u2019ve exported.But I also ran into something I didn\u2019t know: Something is stirring in this society. This is not your grandfather\u2019s Saudi Arabia. \u201cActually, it\u2019s not even my father\u2019s Saudi Arabia anymore \u2014 it is not even my generation\u2019s Saudi Arabia anymore,\u201d the country\u2019s 52-year-old foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said to me.For instance, I was hosted by the King Salman Youth Center, an impressive education foundation that, among other things, has been translating Khan Academy videos into Arabic. It invited me to give a lecture on how big technological forces are affecting the workplace. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but more than 500 people showed up, filling the hall, roughly half of them women who sat in their own sections garbed in traditional black robes. There was blowback on Twitter as to why a columnist who\u2019s been critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s export of Salafist ideology should be given any platform. But the reception to my talk (I was not paid) was warm, and the questions from the audience were probing and insightful about how to prepare their kids for the 21st century.It appears that conservatives here have a lot more competition now for the future identity of this country, thanks to several converging trends. First, most of Saudi Arabia is younger than 30. Second, a decade ago, King Abdullah said he\u2019d pay the cost for any Saudi who wanted to study abroad. That\u2019s resulted in 200,000 Saudis studying overseas today (including 100,000 in America), and now 30,000 a year are coming back with Western degrees and joining the labor force. You now see women in offices everywhere, and several senior officials whispered to me how often the same conservatives who decry women in the workplace quietly lobby them to get their daughters into good schools or jobs.Finally, just as this youth bulge exploded here, so did Twitter and YouTube \u2014 a godsend for a closed society. Young Saudis are using Twitter to talk back to the government and to converse with one another on the issues of the day, producing more than 50 million tweets per month.What\u2019s been missing was a leadership ready to channel this energy into reform. Enter the new King Salman\u2019s son, Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old deputy crown prince, who, along with the moderate crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, has embarked on a mission to transform how Saudi Arabia is governed.I spent an evening with Mohammed bin Salman at his office, and he wore me out. With staccato energy bursts, he laid out in detail his plans. His main projects are an online government dashboard that will transparently display the goals of each ministry, with monthly K.P.I.s \u2014 key performance indicators \u2014 for which each minister will be held accountable. His idea is to get the whole country engaged in government performance. Ministers tell you: Since Mohammed arrived, big decisions that took two years to make now happen in two weeks.\u201cThe key challenges are our overdependence on oil and the way we prepare and spend our budgets,\u201d Mohammed explained. His plan is to reduce subsidies to wealthy Saudis, who won\u2019t get cheap gas, electricity or water anymore, possibly establish a value-added tax and sin taxes on cigarettes and sugary drinks, and both privatize and tax mines and undeveloped lands in ways that can unlock billions \u2014 so even if oil falls to $30 a barrel, Riyadh will have enough revenues to keep building the country without exhausting its savings. He\u2019s also creating incentives for Saudis to leave government and join the private sector.\u201cSeventy percent of Saudis are under age 30, and their perspective is different from the other 30 percent,\u201d said Mohammed. \u201cI am working to create for them the country they want to be living in in the future.\u201dIs this a mirage or the oasis? I don\u2019t know. Will it produce a more open Saudi Arabia or a more efficient conservative Saudi Arabia? I don\u2019t know. It definitely bears watching, though. \u201c \u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic,\u201d Mohammed Abdullah Aljadaan, chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority, told me. \u201cWe have a pulse that we\u2019ve never seen before, and we have a [role] model in government we thought we\u2019d never see.\u201dBottom line: There are still dark corners here exporting intolerant ideas. But they seem to now have real competition from both the grass roots and a leadership looking to build its legitimacy around performance, not just piety or family name. As one Saudi educator said to me, \u201cThere is still resistance to change,\u201d but there is now much more \u201cresistance to the resistance.\u201dMohammed has had the important backing of his father, King Salman, who has replaced both the key health and housing ministers with nonroyal business executives as part of a broader shift to professionalize the government and stimulate the private sector to take a bigger role in the economy. The new health minister was the most important C.E.O. in the country, Khalid al-Falih, who was running the national oil company, Aramco.Streamlining government, Mohammed said, is vital to \u201chelp us fight corruption,\u201d which \u201cis one of our main challenges.\u201d Moreover, only by phasing out subsidies and raising domestic energy prices, he added, can Saudi Arabia one day install \u201cnuclear power generation or solar power generation\u201d and make them competitive in the local market. That is badly needed so that more Saudi oil can be exported rather than consumed at home, he said.But this will all be tricky. Saudi workers pay no income tax. \u201cOur society does not accept taxes; [citizens] are not used to them,\u201d said Mohammed. So the fact that the government may be increasing taxes in some way, shape or form could have political ramifications: Will the leaders hear declarations of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d?How far things will go in that direction \u2014 Saudi Arabia already has municipal elections where women can run and vote \u2014 is unclear. But the new government does seem to intuit that to the extent that its welfare state has to be shrunk, because of the falling price of oil, its performance and responsiveness have to rise.\u201cA government that is not a part of the society and not representing them, it is impossible that it will remain,\u201d said Mohammed. \u201cWe saw that in the Arab Spring. The governments that survived are only those that are connected to their people. People misunderstand our monarchy. It is not like Europe. It is a tribal form of monarchy, with many tribes and subtribes and regions connecting to the top.\u201d Their wishes and interests have to be taken into account. \u201cThe king cannot just wake up and decide to do something.\u201dThere were other little things that caught my eye on this visit \u2014 like the Western symphony orchestra playing on Saudi state-run television one afternoon and the collection of contemporary paintings by Saudi artists, including one of a Saudi woman by a Saudi woman, on display in the Ministry of Information.As for ISIS, Mohammed disputed that it is a product of Saudi religious thinking, arguing that it was in fact a counterreaction to the brutalization of Iraqi Sunnis by the Iranian-directed Shiite-led government in Baghdad of Nouri al-Maliki and to the crushing of Syrian Sunnis by the Iranian-backed government in Damascus. \u201cThere was no [ISIS] before America departed from Iraq. And then America leaves and Iran enters, and then ISIS appears,\u201d he said.He complained that at a time when ISIS is blowing up mosques in Saudi Arabia in an effort to destabilize the regime, the world is accusing Saudi Arabia of inspiring ISIS: \u201cThe [ISIS] terrorists are telling me that I am not a Muslim. And the world is telling me I am a terrorist.\u201dThis is the legacy, though, of decades of one part of the Saudi government and society promoting Salafist Islam and the other part working with the West to curb jihadists. As I said, the world has been frustrated with that dichotomy.Mohammed argued that the ISIS narrative is beamed directly to Saudi youth via Twitter, and that the message is: \u201cThe West is trying to enforce its agenda on you \u2014 and the Saudi government is helping them \u2014 and Iran is trying to colonize the Arab world. So we \u2014 ISIS \u2014 are defending Islam.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t blame the West for misreading us. It is partly our fault. We don\u2019t explain our situation. The world is changing rapidly, and we need to reprioritize to be with the world. Today the world is different. You cannot be isolated from the world. The world must know what is going on in your neighborhood, and we must know what is going on in the world \u2014 [it\u2019s] a global village.\u201dIn Yemen, a Saudi-led Gulf coalition has been fighting a coalition of Houthi militants and rebels loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who are backed by Iran. The rebels pushed the official Yemeni government out of the capital, Sana, in March and the Saudi coalition is trying to restore it to power. So far, the U.N. reports, some 5,700 people have been killed, many of them civilians. Saudi officials made clear to me that they are ready for a negotiated solution, and don\u2019t want to be stuck in a quagmire there, but that the Houthis will get serious only if they keep losing ground, as they have been.\u201cThe other side has trouble reaching a political consensus,\u201d said Mohammed, who is also defense minister. \u201cBut whenever they sustain loses on the ground and international pressure, they get serious [about negotiating]. We are trying to bring this to an end.\u201dLike just about every official I spoke with on this trip to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Mohammed voiced a desire for America not to abandon the region. \u201cThere are times when there is a leader and not a leader [in the world], and when there are no leaders, chaos will ensue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Candidates, Lagging, Rely on New Hampshire to Get Close", "Date": "2015-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Jeb Bush rolled across this state last week in a bus, chomping on turkey jerky and ducking into diners, general stores and town halls to plead his case to voters.Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, was not far behind, mingling with beer-sipping students at a pub near Dartmouth College and chatting with a 3-year-old in the State Capitol about what he wanted for Christmas. And Gov. John Kasich of Ohio swung a golf club at a driving range in Portsmouth after fielding questions from Rotary Club members on topics ranging from climate change to whether deceased people are somehow casting ballots in some states.\u201cYou don\u2019t win here, in my opinion, by just running television ads,\u201d Mr. Kasich said in an interview before meeting with editors at The Portsmouth Herald. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be here; you\u2019ve got to be on the ground. People want to see you. And they want to know who you are.\u201dAll three men are staking their Republican candidacies on an idea that seems increasingly quaint: that campaigning one on one in this small state can set you on the path to becoming president.It is a notion that is facing a rigorous test this election cycle, as the large Republican field, social media and televised debates that attract massive audiences have reshaped the race like never before.With just three months remaining before the first votes are cast, two candidates who have spent little time here, Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson, are leading in most national and New Hampshire Republican polls. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is gaining, in large part because of his debate performance last month. Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich, who are languishing in the same surveys, are trying to climb their way back by winning over voters in small towns, schools and senior centers in New Hampshire, a state each of them has cast as crucial to his candidacy.The outcome here will echo beyond this election and reveal much about how the country chooses presidents, and whether the 64-year-old tradition of direct voting in the first-in-the-nation primary matters anymore. Its possible diminishment is already unsettling residents, who view their role of scrutinizing and winnowing the field of candidates as a solemn duty.\u201cI\u2019m really ticked,\u201d said Alan Glassman, the chairman of the Belknap County Republican Party, referring to the outsize role that cable TV debates have taken on in narrowing the race. \u201cThe New Hampshire process is the right way. What they\u2019re doing is the wrong way.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching the New Hampshire primary for over 100 years,\u201d Mr. Christie said as he strode out of the Capitol in Concord after filing his papers to gain a spot on the primary ballot. \u201cI don\u2019t think that history is going to be changed now. This is the way these folks decide.\u201dMr. Christie acknowledged that the debates had been \u201cinfluential,\u201d but used the example of Carly Fiorina to suggest that their impact is fleeting: Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s standing rose after a strong performance in the second debate, but has fallen since.\u201cThese debates are a bit like a sugar high: For a few days afterward, it really rises up, but what matters now is what happens from there,\u201d he said.Even as they offer odes to New Hampshire\u2019s up-close campaigning, the candidates who submit themselves to it have to endure certain indignities and awkward moments. When Mr. Bush arrived at the Hollis Pharmacy and General Store near the Massachusetts border, a landmark where photographs of past candidates like Rudolph W. Giuliani line the wall, a man castigated him on the economic policies of his brother George W. Bush. Mr. Bush told him to \u201clighten up.\u201dThen there are the odd gifts candidates receive from enthusiastic residents: Mr. Bush graciously accepted matching blue and pink snow shovels and prisoner-made ashtrays emblazoned with \u201cLive Free or Die,\u201d the state motto.Like Mr. Christie, Mr. Bush believes that more frequent personal contact here will shape voters\u2019 impressions as they consider which candidates could serve as president.\u201cI\u2019ve seen people in these crowds I\u2019ve already seen six times,\u201d Mr. Bush told reporters as his bus sped from Manchester to Hollis, past glorious stretches of gold and yellow trees. \u201cI walk up and say, \u2018How am I doing?\u2019 They say, \u2018You\u2019re in the top three.\u2019 \u201dSo far, however, polls in New Hampshire have done little to reward the candidates who are lavishing the most attention on the state.Mr. Bush, a former Florida governor, argued that his recent campaign turmoil \u2014 he slashed salaries and cut staff members \u2014 would matter little once the autumnal hues gave way to the white blanket of February.\u201cForty percent of those people are going to decide who they\u2019re going to vote for, make up their mind in the last week,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re dating right now. They\u2019re speed dating.\u201dMr. Bush did his best to project an upbeat attitude. When he arrived at the Miss Wakefield Diner, he bought a T-shirt proclaiming it to be \u201cthe only diner in the world with a moose moon booth,\u201d a reference to the posterior of a stuffed moose sticking out at one table.Mr. Bush\u2019s style, which can be droll and understated, has not played well in the debates, which have rewarded bluster and snappiness. And that, along with stumbles early on in the campaign, has solidified the impression that he is ill suited for a more unforgiving, Twitter-driven election era.\u201cThere\u2019s another new thing in life,\u201d he said, unable for a moment to mask his frustration about the climate. \u201cIrony doesn\u2019t work in the world of digitized campaigning.\u201dMr. Bush\u2019s supporters are already on edge. After greeting the governor at the Hollis Pharmacy, Jim Adams expressed exasperation with the attention to celebrity candidates like Mr. Trump.\u201cWhen the tent comes down and the circus leaves town, maybe we\u2019ll elect a president,\u201d said Mr. Adams, who lives in Pittsfield and supports Mr. Bush.New Hampshire has played a powerful role in vaulting Republicans to their party\u2019s presidential nomination in recent years. Senator John McCain began his improbable comeback with a decisive victory here in 2008, and Mitt Romney recovered from a lackluster performance in Iowa in 2012 by capturing New Hampshire.Democrats, too, have benefited from strong performances here. Bill Clinton called himself \u201cThe Comeback Kid\u201d in 1992 after being staggered by scandal and still finishing strong in the New Hampshire primary, and John Kerry effectively ended Howard Dean\u2019s campaign by winning here in 2004.The primary is crucial not only to the state\u2019s identity, but also to its economy: The campaigns generate about $231 million in direct and indirect spending in presidential election cycles.With this month comes the deadline for candidates to arrive in New Hampshire, pay $1,000 and file papers to gain a spot on the ballot. The process has become its own local ritual, with reporters turning out to take the measure of the would-be presidents who appear at the secretary of state\u2019s cramped, second-floor office in Concord.Mr. Rubio, whose campaign has been propelled upward in recent weeks even though he has not paid as much attention to New Hampshire as some of his rivals have, appeared last week. His visit, after he attracted high-profile donors and praise from pundits, revealed much about the anxieties rippling through the state.Local reporters quizzed Mr. Rubio after he submitted his papers of candidacy on Thursday. One asked how much time he intended to spend here before the primary. Another with roots here wanted to know if the senator would support the state\u2019s retaining its lead role in the nominating process.Mr. Rubio assured them that he would. The question that seemed to give him pause was this: What is your most memorable New Hampshire moment? Mr. Rubio smiled and thought for a second.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for one still,\u201d he responded.Advertisement"}

And Marcela Sapone, the company\u2019s chief executive, has made two trips to Capitol Hill to urge lawmakers, research organizations and the political press to rethink labor laws for the digital age.\u201cWe have old rules about how you act as an employer,\u201d said Ms. Sapone, 29, who started Hello Alfred with a Harvard Business School classmate. \u201cWe are a young company but we also have to make decisions early that are ethical and business-oriented, and that means engaging in Washington early.\u201dThe efforts by Hello Alfred underscore how today\u2019s tech companies \u2014 even the youngest ones \u2014 have accepted lobbying as an essential part of doing business. In addition to knowing the language of computer code, founders are speaking the language of Washington, keenly aware of the potential regulatory battles that could be on the horizon.The examples are suddenly legion. Magic Leap, an augmented reality start-up, does not have a product on the market \u2014 but its lobbyists are promoting what the company may eventually do. Zenefits, an online benefits manager, is only two years old but is a member of two trade groups and has hired lobbyists and public relations strategists from the Obama administration. The chief executive of Handy, an on-demand household chores service, was recently in Washington on his third charm offensive with lawmakers.It is a sharp shift from past generations of tech companies, whose founders almost made it a point of pride to be distanced from, or above, politics and politicians. The antitrust troubles and headaches encountered by the older companies, including Microsoft and Google, play some role in the new thinking. The real change, though, came after Uber, the ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-sharing site \u2014 two of the largest start-ups \u2014 started facing a barrage of questions about their operations.\u201cFor these new companies, the scale of innovation is so big and impactful they necessitate interacting with Washington writ large,\u201d said Kenneth Baer, a former spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget who now advises Zenefits. \u201cThere are huge amounts of questions that society has to grapple with that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201dIt is difficult to say whether all the early lobbying is delivering results. So far, it has at least allowed Uber and Airbnb to continue growing. But the arrival of money from tech companies so early in their life cycles has definitely shaken up K Street, the capital\u2019s thoroughfare for lobbyists.Much of that money is still from the biggest tech companies; Google and Facebook, for example, spend millions each. But in a sign of how many new companies have come to town, one trade group, the Internet Association, has tripled its membership in the last three years. And a cottage industry has emerged of boutique Internet lobbying; crisis public relations; and niche trade associations for drones, digital health services and financial technology.The companies\u2019 reach extends beyond Washington, too, with Uber and Airbnb placing lobbyists in hundreds of cities around the world. They are also putting their weight behind city and state lobbying efforts to overturn transportation, insurance and hospitality regulations that stand in their way.For many start-ups, though, the immediate goal of lobbying is simply to create good will.Coinbase, a digital currency platform based in San Francisco, is one of a number of financial start-ups that have looked for help in Washington, knowing that finance is highly regulated. Last year, it hired John Collins, a former senior adviser to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as employee No. 50.As the head of government affairs for Coinbase, Mr. Collins regularly prepares talking points about the Bitcoin virtual wallet and meets with officials at the Treasury Department, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission and multiple congressional committees. Nearly every month, he escorts the company\u2019s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, to meetings with government officials.\u201cSo much of what I do day in and day out is not even advocating for anything necessarily but talking to folks about the technology,\u201d Mr. Collins said.The standard mantra of tech companies is that they are a boon to the economy and improve the lives of consumers. The underlying message is that any changes by regulators could cast painful ripples across the economy.The Internet Association has taken that message straight to the congressional districts of key lawmakers. Last year, the group hosted Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a talking tour in downtown Kalamazoo to meet shop owners who had been primed to extol the virtues of the Internet.A jewelry store owner talked about her ability to connect inexpensively with suppliers online. Bridgett Blough, the owner of a food truck, talked about how she used the web to connect with customers, and warned that regulations would make it harder to run her business.\u201cThese businesses may not have been businesses without the Internet,\u201d Mr. Upton said in a video on the trade group\u2019s website. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to regulate the Internet. It\u2019s not a problem as long as it\u2019s not regulated.\u201dAnother selling tactic is welcoming government leaders to Silicon Valley, in the hope that whimsical office spaces and over-the-top employee perks will impress Washington bureaucrats. In just the last six months, Andreessen Horowitz, a leading investor in start-ups, has hosted Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, dozens of members of Congress, state attorneys general, and leaders from the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cFor our start-ups, the advice we give is to get in early,\u201d said Ted Ullyot, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, who is now at Andreessen Horowitz, \u201cbecause the idea is not to stop regulation at a later date but to make sure they were aware and thoughtful about regulation early on.\u201dPerhaps no issue has become more of a focal point than the working conditions at so-called on-demand companies \u2014 businesses like Uber and Alfred, which enable customers to request a service at the touch of a button.Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has been one of the more vocal lawmakers on the issue and has expressed concern that freelance workers lack benefits that ensure long-term economic stability. Senator Warner has said his main concern is about whether contract workers, some of whom work dozens of hours a week, will have basic protections without classic employment contracts.In the last six months, his office in Washington has had a steady stream of visitors, including the chief executive of Airbnb, Brian Chesky; venture capitalists; and more than 100 lobbyists for start-ups. Many of them have argued against such a classification change, saying that the costs of providing full employee benefits are too high and that their workers mostly clock part-time hours.Unlike Uber and Instacart, Hello Alfred from the beginning categorized its workers as employees; they complete W-2 income tax forms and are entitled to benefits, training and job security.But most of its 250 employees hold their butlering jobs to supplement other income. And Ms. Sapone says she wants lawmakers to consider new regulations that would relieve companies from providing some costly benefits.\u201cWhy are we engaging so early? Mostly because we had to,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no choice but to get into these conversations.\u201dAn article on Monday about lobbying by technology companies misstated part of the name of the organization that employs Sheila Krumholz, who commented on the issue, and also misstated her title. It is the Center for Responsive Politics, not the Center for Responsible Politics, and she is its executive director, not its executive editor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW\u2019s Emissions-Test Trickery May Not Be Illegal in Europe", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Four years ago, European auto regulators identified and debated a loophole in their pollution testing rules that could render vehicle emissions tests ineffectual, but it was ultimately left in place, internal documents show.The loophole lets carmakers change the performance settings of their engines before a pollution test. \u201cA manufacturer could specify a special setting that is not normally used for everyday driving,\u201d British regulators warned, according to minutes of a 2011 meeting in Geneva of officials across the region.And Lucia Caudet, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive branch, said in an email that the commission had \u201cno formal view on whether\u201d the vehicles sold in the United States were \u201cequipped with a \u2018defeat device\u2019 in the E.U. legal sense or not.\u201d She added that investigations of vehicles sold in Europe \u201care still ongoing, so we cannot provide an assessment on the nature of the devices used at this stage.\u201dThe Volkswagen scandal has put Europe\u2019s permissive testing practices in the spotlight, and has raised questions about the compatibility of American and European auto regulations. Trans-Atlantic trade talks are underway, and the objectives include fostering mutual recognition of auto regulations.Regulations that apply in Europe say \u201cthe settings of the engine and of the vehicle\u2019s controls shall be those prescribed by the manufacturer.\u201dIf manufacturers have the discretion to determine their own engine settings during emissions tests in Europe, it remains unclear if using software to alter engine settings would violate European rules.Most of the roughly 11 million vehicles that Volkswagen has said carry the software are in Europe. About 500,000 vehicles are in the United States, and others are scattered across the globe.Billions of dollars could hinge on whether the company\u2019s emissions software was technically a defeat device in Europe. Penalties for use of the devices are left to member states, though enforcement by auto regulators in Europe is rare.The answer could also weigh on litigation. David Standard, a spokesman for Leigh Day, a product liability law firm based in London, said the firm had taken in more than 8,000 potential Volkswagen-related claims and VW \u201ccould be looking at the largest-ever consumer legal action in U.K. history.\u201dVolkswagen has committed itself to fixing the vehicles. In Britain, one of the company\u2019s largest markets, VW says it will fix all of the affected vehicles by the end of 2016. Some may require modifications beyond rewriting software code.Many regulators and public officials in Europe were hesitant to discuss how the system worked in Europe, and offered conflicting accounts of what happened after the British proposed to tighten the engine-settings regulations in 2011.Different engine configurations can produce substantially different tailpipe emissions. A \u201csports\u201d setting can emphasize more power and less fuel and pollution efficiency. An \u201ceco\u201d setting can do the opposite. Or a car can default to an in-between setting for everyday driving.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Britain\u2019s proposal would have required that tests be performed on the default setting or the setting with the worst emissions. While it was supported by most of the national regulators, the proposal ultimately languished and was dropped from the agenda of regulators at their meetings by last year.Britain\u2019s transport ministry said its own certifications required automakers to test vehicles on the default or worst emissions setting. In a statement, the ministry said the proposal \u201cwas supported and agreed\u201d to by other European regulators, \u201censuring a consistent approach to the laboratory testing.\u201dMs. Caudet was a bit less definitive, saying that \u201cEuropean legislation implies that a vehicle must use the same engine setting during the regulatory emission test and in real driving.\u201dAnd Sinead O\u2019Donnell, a spokeswoman for Ireland\u2019s auto testing agency, said her country had supported Britain\u2019s position, but she added that \u201cany change must await a decision of the legislative body\u201d and current regulation \u201ccontains the same provision unchanged.\u201dThe Volkswagen investigation continues to reveal divergences in American and European regulations.Volkswagen, whose brands include Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, has disputed that it intentionally sought to evade United States regulations in the latest finding. Mr. Willis, Volkswagen\u2019s top official in Britain, wrote in a letter to the British Parliament that German regulators had concluded that the software used in these larger vehicles did not constitute a violation in Europe.But allowing manufacturers to determine engine settings is more fundamental to testing for pollution emissions.The Volkswagen scandal has made clear how fundamentally different the systems are, at least as related to emissions rules.Car regulation in Europe lacks central oversight. Automakers are permitted to have their vehicle fleets\u2019 emissions certified by regulators in any of the 28 member states, and then they must be recognized by all the others. Policy makers in Brussels are also undercut by powerful member states like Germany protecting domestic automakers, critics say.While Europe plans to begin road testing of car pollution in 2017, those tests as now designed will have many of the same pitfalls as the lab tests. Among other things, manufacturers and their contractors will perform the tests with little regulatory oversight.The road tests are still subject to approval in the European Parliament, where frustration has been building. Volkswagen\u2019s recent admission that it understated carbon dioxide emissions and overstated the fuel economy of 800,000 vehicles sold in Europe has added to that frustration.Mr. Gerbrandy is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a centrist bloc that assailed a recent move by the European government to make its forthcoming road emission tests easier to pass.\u201cWe have veto power here, and I would be surprised if we don\u2019t use that,\u201d Mr. Gerbrandy said. \u201cChances are high that Parliament will vote this down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Debates Fail to Give Voters Basic Details", "Date": "2015-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican presidential candidates\u2019 three debates have been sometimes compelling, often contentious and always amusing.We have learned a lot less about how any of the candidates would govern. They have chiefly relied on clich\u00e9s, buzzwords and attempts to prove who is the most contemptuous of President Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton. There is a similar weakness in the smaller Democratic field, which has had only one debate; subsequent forums may provide more meat.The Republican void was on display in the debate on Wednesday focusing on the party\u2019s favorite issue: taxes. All the candidates would cut extensively, though most would add trillions to the debt. The proposals from the two front-runners, Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson, would create the largest budget shortfalls.They also tried to camouflage their plans\u2019 heavy tilt in favor of the more affluent. Mr. Trump stresses that he would end the carried interest tax loophole benefiting private-equity and hedge fund executives. He would also eliminate the estate tax, which is paid by only 0.2 percent of all families. Killing carried interest would raise $2 billion a year; killing the estate tax would cost $20 billion.The much-maligned moderator at last week\u2019s debate was essentially correct that Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s tax cuts would give almost twice as much to the rich as to the middle class, though the candidate denied it. An analysis by the Tax Foundation of Mr. Rubio\u2019s initial proposal \u2014 which has been slightly modified \u2014 showed that it would give the biggest benefits to the poorest, but that the top 1 percent would get about twice as much, on a percentage basis, as the middle and working class.To understand why candidates avoid budget specifics, look at the one realistic proposal, that of John Kasich, the governor of Ohio. He would cut taxes and offer a balanced budget in eight years. Some of the entitlement changes he advocates would be tough; but the real problem is that he would freeze nondefense discretionary spending for eight years, bringing it far below levels in the Eisenhower administration as a percentage of the economy. These cutbacks would affect big-ticket items such as veterans\u2019 health care, the Border Patrol and health research, and would be politically impossible.The Affordable Care Act, long the b\u00eate noire of Republicans, was mentioned only twice in passing at the debate. Demanding repeal is easy; a replacement is much harder to come up with. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has tried. His initiative would lower some costs and lessen regulation, but it would also provide fewer benefits, weaken a ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and limit tax-free insurance offered by employers.The immigration discussion has been dominated by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cbeautiful\u201d wall along the southern border that he insists Mexico would pay for. Climate change was barely mentioned, other than condemnations of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.Similarly, all the candidates attacked what they consider the president\u2019s weakness on foreign policy and national security. With the exception of Senator Lindsey Graham, who does not register sufficiently in polls to get on the main stage, they offered few specifics on how they would fight terrorists, or counter Russian incursions and China\u2019s assertive territorial claims.\u201cThe only Republican with a defined national security policy is Lindsey Graham,\u201d says John Nagl, formerly a top adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus and now the headmaster at the Haverford School. \u201cThey certainly aren\u2019t willing to give defense the resources it needs, to impose a gasoline tax to fund national security needs, or to do anything serious.\u201dTo be sure, there have been deceptive debates in past campaigns. Mr. Obama presented himself as a protectionist, vowing to renegotiate trade pacts. George W. Bush promised a \u201chumble\u201d foreign policy.Still, campaigns and debates matter. The candidates and the news media have yet to meet that standard this time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greeks Move to Meet Bailout Demands, but May Need to Do More", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greek lawmakers late on Thursday approved some of the economic changes that international creditors have demanded in order to unlock the first loan installment from the country\u2019s bailout program. But the legislation pointedly lacks some of the main measures demanded by lenders.On a visit to Athens on Wednesday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, indicated that more might need to be done before the money would be released. Eurozone finance ministers are to meet on Monday to decide whether to sign off on the first 2 billion euros, or $2.2 billion, in loan money from the \u20ac86 billion bailout program.Last month, Greek legislators agreed to further pension cuts and to some tax increases, but deferred politically difficult measures that included placing stricter criteria for the protection of struggling mortgage-holders and revoking tax breaks for Greek farmers. The bill that was approved by a majority vote late on Thursday included the revoked privileges for farmers and a tighter framework for tax collection.Approving the bill on Thursday was just one of a series of tasks ahead for Greek officials, who are wrangling with creditors over demands for the stricter treatment of delinquent homeowners as hundreds of thousands of Greeks struggle to make mortgage payments.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The government is also under pressure from creditors to prepare legislation this month overhauling the dysfunctional pension system, a hugely controversial measure after the barrage of fresh cuts.Social discontent over austerity continues to grow. Farmers, mariners and pharmacists are among those who have staged protests in recent weeks, and the country\u2019s two main labor unions have called a general strike for Nov. 12. It will be the first such walkout under the left-wing Syriza party, which, while in opposition, had a constant presence at anti-austerity protests and strikes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Lust for Gold", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy main answer would be that the Friedman compromise \u2014 trash-talking government activism in general, but asserting that monetary policy is different \u2014 has proved politically unsustainable. You can\u2019t, in the long run, keep telling your base that government bureaucrats are invariably incompetent, evil or both, then say that the Fed, which is, when all is said and done, basically a government agency run by bureaucrats, should be left free to print money as it sees fit.Politicians who lump it all together, who warn darkly that the Fed is inflating away your hard-earned wealth and enabling giveaways to Those People, are always going to have the advantage in intraparty struggles.You might think that the overwhelming empirical evidence against the hard-money view would count for something. But you\u2019d only think that if you were paying no attention to any other policy debate.Leading political figures insist that climate change is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a vast international scientific conspiracy. Do you really think that their party will be persuaded to change its economic views by inconvenient macroeconomic data?The interesting question is what will happen to monetary policy if a Republican wins next year\u2019s election. As best as I can tell, most economists believe that it\u2019s all talk, that once in the White House someone like Mr. Rubio or even Mr. Cruz would return to Bush-style monetary pragmatism. Financial markets seem to believe the same. At any rate, there\u2019s no sign in current asset prices that investors see a significant chance of the catastrophe that would follow a return to gold.But I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. True, a new president who looked at the evidence and listened to the experts wouldn\u2019t go down that path. But evidence and expertise have a well-known liberal bias.Advertisement"}

He accused Republicans in the United States of cowardice for seeking to block Syrian children and families who are fleeing the violent civil war in their country.\u201cApparently, they\u2019re scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Wednesday, adding a moment later: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very tough to me.\u201dIn the president\u2019s weekly radio address, taped by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and released on Saturday morning, Mr. Biden insisted that refugees from Syria face \u201cthe most rigorous screening\u201d of anybody entering the United States.\u201cFirst they are fingerprinted, then they undergo a thorough background check, then they are interviewed by the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd after that, the F.B.I., the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Defense and the Department of State, they all have to sign off on access.\u201dBut the White House efforts have done little to quell the anxiety back home. The House bill increasing security for the refugee program passed by a vote of 289 to 137, with nearly 50 Democrats supporting it. That is a margin that might allow lawmakers to override Mr. Obama\u2019s promised veto if the bill also passes in the Senate.At the Dignity for Children Foundation in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, Mr. Obama knelt to talk to several children as photographers and television cameras captured the broad smiles on their faces.\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite subject?\u201d he asked, squatting beside a girl seated on a gray shag rug. \u201cDo you know what you want to be when you grow up?\u201dThe girl said she liked math and wanted to be an engineer when she grew up, prompting Mr. Obama to say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be an excellent engineer.\u201dMost of the children at the center were members of the Rohingya minority who have fled persecution, discrimination and ethnic violence in Myanmar, officials said. White House aides said the United Nations had documented more than 153,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia, but they said the images of Mr. Obama in the center were designed to highlight the plight of refugees across the globe.More broadly, he said, the United States should not turn its back on children from all over the world. He said America\u2019s role as a global leader was defined by its willingness to help people who have been discriminated against, tortured or subjected to violence.\u201cThat\u2019s American leadership,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019re the shining light on the hill. Not when we respond on the basis of fear.\u201dMr. Obama is scheduled to return to the United States on Monday, when he is likely to face more debate about the refugee issue. He is also scheduled to meet on Tuesday with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France to discuss the terror attacks in Paris.Before leaving Asia, Mr. Obama spent some time on Saturday telling business leaders that the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal negotiated by 12 nations, including the United States, will improve the economy and security of Southeast Asia.Speaking to a business group before heading to the humanitarian center, Mr. Obama said he remained confident that Congress would approve the deal. And he said that nations in Asia should quickly do the same.\u201cT.P.P. is more than just a trade pact; it also has important strategic and geopolitical benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cT.P.P. is a long-term investment in our shared security and in universal human rights.\u201d\u201cWith T.P.P., we\u2019re not only writing the rules for trade in the Asia Pacific, we also have an historic opportunity to shape the future of the global economy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt says that America\u2019s foreign policy rebalance to the Asia Pacific will continue on every front.\u201dAdvertisement"}

During his 2012 re-election campaign, he barely mentioned global warming, but the issue has become a hallmark of his second term. And on Sunday night he arrives in Paris, hoping to make climate policy the signature environmental achievement of his, and perhaps any, presidency.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\u201cHe comes to Paris with a moral authority that no other president has had on the issue of climate change,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University who noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic climate efforts already stand alone in American history. \u201cNo other president has had a climate change policy. It makes him unique.\u201dIn Paris, Mr. Obama will join more than 120 world leaders to kick off two weeks of negotiations aimed at forging a new climate change accord that would, for the first time, commit almost every country on Earth to lowering its greenhouse gas pollution. All year, Mr. Obama\u2019s negotiators have worked behind the scenes to fashion a Paris deal.\u201cOur constituents are worried that the pledges you are committing the United States to will strengthen foreign economies at the expense of American workers,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cThey are also skeptical about sending billions of their hard-earned dollars to government officials from developing nations.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Obama is pushing forward. He unveiled the rules on curbing heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions with a tight timeline, ensuring that they would be finalized before he leaves office. He has raised the issue of climate change in dozens of speeches and with every recent visiting foreign leader. In Washington, a team of environmental lawyers is preparing to defend the rules in court, while at the State Department, climate envoys are in constant contact with their counterparts around the world.If his domestic regulations and a Paris accord withstand efforts to gut them, \u201cclimate change will become the heart and soul of his presidency,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said.Mr. Obama is an improbable environmental champion. Unlike former Vice President Al Gore, fighting climate change was never the driving force of Mr. Obama\u2019s political career.Mr. Obama did enact some environmental policies in his first term, including $80 billion for clean-energy projects and rules curtailing tailpipe emissions.Yet during the 2012 campaign, advisers urged him not to talk about climate change. \u201cIt didn\u2019t poll well,\u201d said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief strategist in 2008 and 2012.The candidate cared about the issue, Mr. Axelrod said, but voters cared more about the economy. \u201cHe felt bridled in his ability to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. \u201cIt was no secret to anyone that this was an issue of continuing and big concern to him. But the reality is that you can\u2019t do anything about climate change if you lose an election.\u201d\u201cThat inaugural address was the turning point,\u201d said Heather Zichal, Mr. Obama\u2019s former top climate change adviser. \u201cThat was his expectation, and we had to deliver.\u201dOther events helped elevate the climate issue. The economy was gradually improving, while oil prices were falling. Polls showed that a growing number of Americans, including many Republicans, would support climate policies. And Mr. Obama, free from running for office again, wanted to build a legacy.\u201cHe spends a lot of time thinking about his daughters, and he does not want to be the guy who was in a position of doing something about a major global threat and did not do enough,\u201d Ms. Zichal said.The fate of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate legacy will rest in the hands of his successor and the courts. Even if a deal unfolds in Paris, the next president could opt not to follow its provisions. And another body entirely will rule on the fate of his new regulations: They are expected to end up before the Supreme Court by 2017.Advertisement"}

Eskisehir (pronounced Es-ki-SHARE) itself has a large sugar refinery, using sugar beets from nearby fields as its raw material; the city exports about $30 million worth of cookies, cakes, crackers and other foods to Russia, according to the local chamber of commerce.Turkey had been stepping up food exports to Russia in recent months as political frictions between Russia and the West led to a reduction in Russian food imports from the European Union.Russia had also been one of Turkey\u2019s biggest sources of tourists until the past year, when the combination of the fall of the ruble and Western sanctions on Russia for its support of Ukrainian insurgents began steeply eroding the number of Russians who could afford to travel. The decline in tourism was a worry for economists here even before the Russian jet was shot down.\u201cThe trade deficit is out of hand, exports cannot meet the import bill, so tourism revenues are a major item in our balance sheet,\u201d said Erinc Yeldan, the dean of the economics faculty at Bilkent University near Ankara.Still, Cengiz Kamil Firat, the deputy director general of general and bilateral economic affairs at Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry, said that the nation\u2019s economy was in better shape than it might seem.Russia\u2019s decision to discourage tourism, for example, comes at the start of a quiet season for visitors to Turkey. The country is mainly a summer destination and would not expect another big influx until next June. \u201cThings will probably de-escalate well before that,\u201d Mr. Firat said.Russia\u2019s main export to Turkey, however, is natural gas, supplying 60 percent of Turkey\u2019s needs. Russia has not tried to limit that arrangement, which supplies Moscow with valuable foreign revenue at a time of Western sanctions. Nor has President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia yet interfered with Turkey\u2019s biggest category of exports to his country, manufactured goods.Turkey\u2019s exports to Russia totaled 0.8 percent of its economic output last year. But Mr. Yeldan said that more important than the dollar value of trade sanctions would be whether the dispute with Russia affects the international confidence that Turkey needs to continue attracting enough foreign investment to offset its chronic trade deficits.Economic difficulties in Turkey are a potential worry for the West. The European Union and the United States have been seeking more help from Turkey in stemming the number of Europeans who use Turkey to travel to and from areas in Syria and Iraq controlled by the Islamic State.Many here in Eskisehir say that an influx of refugees from Syria and others without Turkish work papers is making the economy worse \u2014 even though Eskisehir is 400 miles from the Syrian border. \u201cThat\u2019s a major problem,\u201d Mayor Buyukersen said. \u201cThe number of Syrian refugees is increasing day by day and they are adding to our unemployment problem.\u201dUnemployed workers wait all day in hopes of meeting employers in front of Eskisehir\u2019s central mosque, a smaller version of Istanbul\u2019s famed Hagia Sophia. Osman Boyaci, 50, who has two children, said that he and his fellow workers would normally expect to earn $20 for a day\u2019s labor on a construction site, but were losing work to truckloads of Syrian immigrants who would accept $6 a day.Mr. Firat at the foreign ministry said that the Syrian refugees had caused resentment in some places, but also made cheap labor available that might help some businesses stay competitive.Eskisehir\u2019s economic difficulties, and Turkey\u2019s, go beyond coping with migrants or an interruption in tourism. Many emerging markets are facing difficulties with the slowdown in global trade, Turkey among them.Turkey has long depended on exporting manufactured goods to Europe and the Middle East, two regions where demand is weak right now. That is partly because of geopolitics and partly because Chinese industries with overcapacity at home have been exporting at low prices to Turkey\u2019s longtime markets in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.Wars in Syria and Iraq have devastated demand for Turkish manufactures while sending more than two million refugees to Turkey.Iraq has traditionally been Turkey\u2019s second-largest export market after Germany, but years of war have depressed sales there. Syria, another big market, has collapsed into civil war, and shipping goods by truck south through Syria or Iraq to Turkey\u2019s longtime markets in the Persian Gulf has become risky and difficult.\u201cThey\u2019re not closed \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of smuggling, people have to live\u201d in Syria, said Savas M. Ozaydemir, a leading Eskisehir industrialist with holdings in roofing tile manufacturing, wiring manufacture and real estate. \u201cBut of course, it might be 30 percent of what it was.\u201dOne of the few democracies in the Middle East, Turkey has also upset the military-led government in Egypt by criticizing it. In response, the Egyptians barred many of the Turkish trucks that used to arrive on ferries at Port Said to carry cargo to markets on the Arabian Peninsula, further constraining Egyptian exports.Turkey has also depended on exporting construction materials to China, but a real estate downturn there has crippled housing starts and the need for Turkish imports.China has been the world\u2019s largest market by far in recent years for marble, installed on a huge scale in hotels, apartment buildings, office towers and even swimming pool decks, despite the use of inexpensive finishes that can leave the marble almost as slippery as glass.Turkey has 40 percent of the world\u2019s commercial marble reserves and has been by far the dominant supplier to China, where domestic marble tends to be heavily cracked and often an unattractive yellow. But the value and tonnage of China\u2019s marble imports have plunged by nearly a third just in the past year, paralleling a steep drop in housing starts there.For Cekicler Marble in Eskisehir, that has meant closing three of the company\u2019s nine marble quarries and laying off a third of the 450 workers. The company had designed for sale to China an automated production line that costs $550,000 and helps turn 25-ton blocks of Turkish marble into slim tiles. But after expecting to sell 10 a year, the company actually sold one last year and none this year, with leads for the sale of two next year.\u201cWe did not want to sell blocks, just finished products,\u201d said Yavuz Cekic, the company\u2019s marketing director. \u201dBut we couldn\u2019t compete with other companies that just opened quarries and shipped the blocks.\u201dThere have been a few bright spots for Turkish industry, and they are predicted to keep the nation\u2019s economic growth rate around 3 percent over the next several years \u2014 weaker than the 5 percent growth that Turkey became accustomed to during the last decade, but still stronger than that of many countries.One area of strength is construction at home. Fearing further political instability in the Arab world, families across the Middle East have been buying apartments in Turkey. Together with low interest rates, that has touched off a building boom in Ankara and Istanbul.Here in Eskisehir, the new high-speed rail service and Mayor Buyukersen\u2019s rezoning of an old downtown factory district for high-rise apartment towers have produced a series of new building projects.But for now, many business owners are worried. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Eskisehir for 15 years,\u201d said Sinan Atinar, the owner of a sliced meat sandwich shop on a downtown city square. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it as slow as this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Seizes Chance to Shake Off Summit Meeting Constraints", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 The young man vaulted to his feet as the end of the town hall approached, and yelled out for President Obama\u2019s attention.Mr. Obama had skipped over him for a question a year ago, he said, and now he had another chance. His question was a tough one: He called the president\u2019s new trade deal for the region elitist, and he wanted to hear Mr. Obama\u2019s response.It was a rare moment of friction during more than an hour Friday in which the president fielded mostly friendly questions from a group of young people from Malaysia, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and elsewhere, shortly after landing here.It was also one of the few times on Mr. Obama\u2019s three-country trip that the president has moved out of the formal setting of a global summit meeting and the grim discussions about terrorism that have dominated the trip.\u201cI meet with all these leaders and we take pictures and we talk about all kinds of things,\u201d Mr. Obama told the 500 young people gathered at a college here. But what he really enjoys, he said, is \u201cyour energy and your idealism and your optimism.\u201dAides to Mr. Obama say the pageantry of summit meetings can evoke an eye-rolling response from him, given his preference for the directness of one-on-one diplomacy, or exploring the world\u2019s wonders in a way that only a president can.By the end of his 10-day trek through Turkey, the Philippines and Malaysia, Mr. Obama will have logged his 51st summit meeting, according to an informal count by Mark Knoller, a CBS Radio reporter who tracks presidential trivia of all kinds.\u201cYou are the busiest man in the world,\u201d Tommy Vietor, the president\u2019s former national security spokesman, said of the president. Then he recalled the summit tradition that requires world leaders to pose for a picture wearing clothing that represents the host nation. \u201cBut now someone comes to you and says, \u2018It\u2019s time to take the funny-shirt photo,\u2019 and you have to grin and bear it.\u201dHaving won the presidency in part by advocating a renewed focus on global partnerships, Mr. Obama has embraced the power of summit meetings as a central tool of his foreign policy apparatus.In Asia, in particular, the Obama administration has been aggressive in calling together the region\u2019s leaders several times each year as part of an effort to display a new commitment to the economy and security of its allies there.\u201cWe want the United States to be at the table at the Asia-Pacific in shaping the future of the region, and signaling that we\u2019re going to be present,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said.\u201cWhen we\u2019re not at the table, we\u2019re on the menu,\u201d he joked. \u201cAnd when we\u2019re there, we can actually shape this agenda.\u201dBut it\u2019s no secret that the president enjoys the more informal parts of his trips more. Among the items that have been on his bucket list: the Roman Coliseum, the Great Wall in China, the Petra ruins in Jordan, the Egyptian pyramids, the Arctic glaciers.In 2009, just six months into his presidency, Mr. Obama lamented the frequent gatherings, saying at the end of one in L\u2019Aquila, Italy: \u201cThe one thing I will be looking forward to is fewer summit meetings.\u201dThat was clear from the wide grin on Mr. Obama\u2019s face throughout the town-hall-style meeting here. The president took questions \u2014 boy, girl, boy, girl, as he tells the audience \u2014 on subjects ranging from climate change to public accountability, to the most influential person in his life. (His mother, he said.)\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Mr. Obama told the young man, \u201cI admit I was going to do it anyway, but now that I hear it from you, I\u2019m definitely going to do it.\u201d\u201cThe United States has to have some humility because there have been times when we did the wrong thing,\u201d Mr. Obama said. But he added: \u201cI do believe there are basic values that we all share. One of those values is that countries work best when everybody has a voice that can be respected, and the press can report on what is happening with current affairs and people can organize peacefully.\u201dMr. Obama had advice for the young people in the audience, some of whom were members of the White House\u2019s Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, which has brought 55,000 young people together in the region to confront global issues.He urged them to take on climate change, saying, \u201cThis has to be one of our highest priorities.\u201d And for those going into politics, he pressed them not to allow racial, ethnic or religious difference to dominate the conversation.\u201cWhen you start doing that, it\u2019s very easy for people to start thinking that whoever\u2019s not part of my group is somehow less than me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how violence happens. That\u2019s how discrimination happens.\u201dOne young man he called on said that other questioners had focused on \u201chigh issues\u201d and that he wanted to go low.\u201cHow low are you going to go?\u201d a somewhat alarmed president asked.The young man started off by noting Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cvery senior\u201d time in life.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty low,\u201d Mr. Obama said, laughing.\u201cSorry, president,\u201d the young man said.Advertisement"}

General Kiszczak was subsequently tried for the killings, but avoided prison. (As recently as this year, a court meted out a two-year suspended sentence for his role in imposing martial law.)\u201cI saved the country from terrible troubles,\u201d General Kiszczak said years later.Czeslaw Kiszczak (pronounced CHESS-wahff KEESH-chahk) was born on Oct. 19, 1925, in the Silesian coal country town of Roczyny, the son of a struggling farmer who was fired as a steelworker apparently because of his Communist affiliation. As a teenager during World War II, Czeslaw was recruited to mine coal for the occupying Germans, then arrested and forced to work in Vienna, where he joined a Communist militia.After the war he entered the Polish Army, where he fought guerrilla groups that were resisting the Communist takeover. Guerrillas beat his father and spared his life only after his mother intervened.He later explained that those struggles had shaped his response to the pro-democracy upheaval decades later.\u201cExperiences linked with that drama, that fratricidal struggle, are among the major reasons that shaped my role in the complicated years of 1980-82,\u201d General Kiszczak said. \u201cI did not want that tragic history to repeat itself.\u201dHe later attended the state military academy. He married and had two children. Information on survivors was not immediately available.He also weeded out secret police cadres that had remained loyal to a hard-line party faction, which had enjoyed the patronage of the Soviet K.G.B. before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union.Within a few weeks, to avert further labor unrest ignited by soaring food prices, he resigned and joined a Solidarity-dominated coalition as deputy prime minister and interior minister.

{"Headline": "Embracing French Art and Fashion as a Counterattack", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedA glitzy celebration for Cartier diamonds planned for Monday evening at the Baccarat hotel was canceled and a \u201cbreakfast open house\u201d a few days later was substituted in its stead. (But Chanel went ahead with its sponsorship of a film premiere on Monday at the Museum of Modern Art.)There\u2019s a temptation, when confronted with fear, sadness and human loss, to turn away from luxury; a natural instinct to dismiss frivolous subjects as inappropriate at such a serious time. Some may assert that gatherings honoring how we adorn our bodies have no place in the current conversation, that such discussions should occur only in abashed whispers, that anything smacking of aesthetics is somehow disrespectful of the horror attached to current events.But while there were many reasons we postponed our conference \u2014 safety; our understanding that, right now, everyone wants to take care of their own; the need for individual healing \u2014 the supposed frivolity of fashion was not on that list.It is easy to forget, when you hear words like \u201cluxury\u201d and \u201cfashion,\u201d that these industries do not simply represent gold-chain handbags and elaborately embroidered silk dresses.Rather, they represent jobs, heritage, taxes and national identity.Those jobs include seamstresses who have worked for more than three decades at the Dior couture atelier, which has been on the Avenue Montaigne since 1946. They include the employees at Chanel, which has been based on the Rue Cambon since 1910.Fashion and luxury companies power the French economy and will be integral to helping the nation recover. According to Euromonitor, the French luxury goods industry had sales of $25 billion in 2014. The taxes on that can fund a lot of roadwork.A report commissioned by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de la Couture, du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter des Couturiers et des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Mode (a.k.a. the French fashion trade body) on the economic impact of its member companies and released last year noted that products from said brands were sold in 1,500 single-brand boutiques worldwide and 5,000 multibrand stores, making them the first experience of \u201cFrance\u201d for many consumers, and transforming them, the Federation wrote, into \u201cambassadors for French products.\u201d The most avid consumers of French luxury are the Chinese.Indeed, names like Dior and Chanel and Saint Laurent are probably more familiar to most tourists than Marianne, the official symbol of the country. (It\u2019s no coincidence that In\u00e8s de la Fressange, the face of Chanel from 1983 to 1989, was also the model for Marianne from 1989 to 2000, when Laetitia Casta, one of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s favorite models, took her place.) Fashion is woven into the very fabric of the country.As Steven Fischer, a former professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the founder of the Image, Style & Design Studio consultancy, wrote in an industry newsletter: \u201cPut aside the investors. Put aside the star C.E.O.s. And what do we have? For product-centric Luxury, fine artisans who ply their craft. For hospitality-centric Luxury, countless people devoting their lives to providing comfort to travelers.\u201dThe shopping streets of Avenue Montaigne and Rue St.-Honor\u00e9, lined with fashion flagships like so many agate and steel showcases, are tourist destinations akin to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre \u2014 and not just because visitors want to gawk at Peter Marino-designed boutiques or exotic skins. It\u2019s because when they buy, say, a Balenciaga bag or an Herm\u00e8s tie, they are buying in part a memory of France they can carry with them. (Frankly, if they just wanted the product, they could probably get it closer to home.)This is not to deny that there are enormous issues of national security and emotional trauma that need discussion, nor to suggest that all of our problems can be solved through haute couture. Safety, security and freedom from the kinds of hatred that compelled last week\u2019s attacks are the greatest luxuries of all.But if we turn away from the luxury and fashion industries at a time like this because they are not \u201cserious,\u201d then we contribute to the goals of those who attacked France. When the terrorists opened fire on restaurants and nightclubs, they were not simply sowing fear. They were assaulting a certain kind of lifestyle, one that values conversation, self-expression, art and beauty, of which fashion is a part. To embrace those values is, now, a political statement.This is why, though the conference has been moved to next spring, there was no question that it should remain in the same place.And as it happens, Dior is underwriting the restoration of the Queen\u2019s House in Marie Antoinette\u2019s estate at Versailles. As a result, on the Pavillon Dufour, the wing of the chateau that borders one side of the main entrance courtyard, is an enormous canvas by the artist Pierre Delavie. It features women in Dior dresses strolling through a trompe l\u2019oeil interior garden of the palace, and as France\u2019s legislators gathered to discuss the nation\u2019s response to terror, it could not be missed.History, luxury, crisis. An ironic juxtaposition? No. In this case, a meaningful one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Friday Falters as Consumer Behaviors Change", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe holiday might be a time-honored tradition, but wouldn\u2019t Mr. Roosevelt consider moving the day up by a week?Seven decades later, Black Friday has lost its distinctive edge. Tens of millions of Americans will still hit the malls this Friday. But the relentless race for holiday dollars has blunted the day\u2019s oomph, as stores offer deep discounts weeks before Thanksgiving and year-round deals in stores and online are causing sales fatigue. Some fed-up shoppers cheered this year when the outdoors retailer, REI, declared it was opting out of Black Friday sales altogether.On the eve of yet another Thanksgiving weekend, retail experts and economists are asking the question: Is Black Friday over?\u201cIt definitely matters so much less than it\u2019s mattered in the past,\u201d said John J. Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Research. \u201cThe last couple of years, \u2018Black Friday disappoints\u2019 has been the usual story.\u201dBut contrary to doom-and-gloom predictions this holiday season, dwindling sales for the long Thanksgiving weekend (which now begins Thursday afternoon) do not necessarily signal a cautious consumer. Americans are generally spending just as much of their hard-earned dollars as in the past.Overall consumer spending since the beginning of 2014 has risen at a rate of 3 percent after lackluster gains in 2012 and 2013, and most stores achieve decent profits, on an earnings per share basis, during their holiday quarter.The decline of Black Friday instead points to a shift in the way consumers spend their money.\u201cThey\u2019re online,\u201d Mr. Canally said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re spending more on experiences. A day at the spa, a baseball game, the ballet \u2014 rather than a sweater or a pair of socks that no one wants.\u201dThe history of Black Friday tracks the history of modern American retailing, and of personal consumption in the United States, which makes up a bigger part of the economy than in almost any other industrialized country.Holiday sales begin earlier and earlier. A Sears ad from 1983 advertises an 8 a.m. Friday opening. By the late 1980s, national retailers were offering dawn \u201cdoorbuster\u201d deals.But Paul Arnhold is not interested. On Black Friday, he plans to spend the morning solo cycling \u2014 followed by time with his wife, Shana Arnhold, and their 3-year-old son. Several Black Fridays ago, he trekked with his wife to a packed furniture store for a deal on a digital photo frame \u2014 only to find the store had long sold out of the item.This year, the Arnholds, who live in Lenexa, Kan., in the Kansas City metropolitan area, are spreading out their Christmas shopping, grabbing Royals commemorative gear in post-World Series sales, and scouring e-commerce sites like Etsy for handmade gifts.A lot of their spending has also gone into their new home, which they bought in May. They have refinished the hardwood floors, and hired a carpenter to build cabinets and shelves and touch up their fireplace.\u201cWaiting in lines forever and other crazy things just makes you think: Is it worth it?\u201d said Mr. Arnhold, 35, who works in customer marketing at Lexmark, the software and printer company. \u201cThe last place I want to be this weekend is in a store.\u201dShifts in spending and behavior have kept many stores discounting heavily to pique shoppers\u2019 interest, hurting retailers\u2019 profit margins. And this year, there were fresh worries among fashion retailers and department stores as unseasonably warm weather hurt sales of winter coats and boots.But even as some individual chains suffer, economists and investment strategists insist the overall outlook for the holiday season remains robust.Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, said he saw enormous pent-up demand, for example, for home furnishings at retailers like Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s.These days, with the Great Recession finally starting to become a distant memory, younger consumers, Mr. Orlando said, have \u201cfinally gotten jobs, they\u2019re getting their first homes and they want to fix it up rather than buying sweaters.\u201d\u201cWe fully respect the fact that Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom put out atrocious numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to see a better Christmas than these missed numbers suggest. This doesn\u2019t sound the death knell for the consumer.\u201dChris G. Christopher Jr., an economist at IHS, a research firm which tracks the economy, said he was looking for retail sales this holiday season to be up by about 3.5 percent from last year\u2019s levels. While that isn\u2019t as strong as the 4.1 percent gain recorded in 2014, it is still well above the 2.7 percent advance seen in 2012 and 2013.Mr. Christopher also estimates that digital shopping will rise by 11.7 percent this year, lifting the overall proportion of online sales to 14.7 percent of total retail activity, or $1 out of every $7 that consumers lay out this holiday season.That\u2019s not great news for brick-and-mortar retailers (though more and more are expanding their presence online), and could make lining up for Black Friday sales feel pointless, even quaint. But online sales also drive economic growth.While wages have stagnated and the recovery over the last six years has fallen short of past trends, consumer spending still represents nearly 70 percent of economic activity.And with businesses hesitant to invest heavily in new capacity, federal spending delayed, and sectors like construction and home building flattened after the recession, shoppers picked up much of the slack in the last few years.Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, cites the drop in energy prices this year, along with solid hiring and healthier household balance sheets, to explain why consumers not only have more to spend, but will feel more confident doing so.\u201cIt would be a surprise if retail sales during the holiday season were soft,\u201d he said.And even traditional retailers aren\u2019t giving up hope. Gerald L. Storch, chief executive of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, struck a positive tone on the evolving consumer. The shifts in spending were cyclical, he said.\u201cCars instead of clothes, the Internet suddenly reaching a tipping point \u2014 I\u2019ve heard every theory imaginable,\u201d Mr. Storch said. \u201cBut Christmas always comes, and people have to shop. They will be back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Mr. Obama expressed confidence that it would be approved.\u201cThe fact that everyone here has stepped up and made some hard decisions that are going to pay off for decades to come I think is testimony to the vision that was reflected,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama also used the summit meeting to push for his climate change agenda, telling a group of chief executives that the world must face the \u201curgent and growing threat of climate change\u201d before time runs out.He said the economic and social threats from climate change should be of particular concern to the people of Southeast Asia, where many low-lying islands could face disaster as sea levels rise.\u201cFew regions have more at stake in meeting this challenge than the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama is scheduled to travel to Paris at the end of the month for a climate change summit meeting that aims to reach an accord dedicating many nations to reducing their carbon emissions to slow global warming.The president hosted a discussion of climate change at the chief executives\u2019 forum along with Jack Ma, founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, and Aisa Mijeno, a Filipino entrepreneur who invented a lamp that runs on saltwater.In response to a question from Mr. Obama about her lamp, Ms. Mijeno said that it provided about eight hours of light, as well as power to a USB port for charging a phone.\u201cAnd all you need to do is you just have to replenish the saltwater solution,\u201d she said, \u201cand then you have another eight hours of lighting.\u201dMr. Ma offered the president the perspective of a very large company that, he said, spends 0.3 percent of its revenue to encourage young people to find creative ways to help the environment. He said that when he was 12, he almost drowned in a lake, and that now that lake was dry.\u201cIf we do not care about this earth, we do not care about the water, food, environment, I think nobody can survive, whether you\u2019re big or small,\u201d Mr. Ma said. \u201cSo this is the concern. This is the worry I have.\u201dMr. Obama was scheduled to end the day with a working dinner to further discuss economic issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should My Rich Friends Apply for Financial Aid?", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistClose friends of mine are raising four young children in a city with an extremely high cost of living. Not a small feat. They are not millionaires, but they are not poor either. Because of the school zone in which they live, they prefer to send their children to a private school, where tuition is upward of $27,000 per year per child. They made the situation work when only two children were of school age, but in the next academic year, there will be three children enrolled, and four not long after.The friends recently confided that they have applied for need-\u00adbased scholarships for the three children, as they believethat their combined income is within the accepted range. I am taken aback. The wife wears the latest fashions and favors expensive jewelry and handbags. They regularly eat at top restaurants and go on costly vacations, and the husband drives a car that is not family-\u00adfriendly. I am close enough with the wife to know that she pays retail for all her expensive purchases. In the moment when they confided this, I didn\u2019t know how to respond. So I joked that perhaps the wife shouldn\u2019t take her $7,000 designer bag or wear the shoes and jewelry she had on to the interview. She laughed and said she would \u2018\u2018dress down\u2019\u2019 for the meeting. But when costly private schools provide financial aid, it\u2019s up to them to decide how a family\u2019s ability to pay determines what breaks it gets. Are the friends in question planning to fill in the forms truthfully? Then there\u2019s no reason they shouldn\u2019t apply, whatever their quotient of bling. Eligibility requirements, properly designed, don\u2019t shut out poorer families by allowances made to better-\u00adoff applicants. (In cases where many or even most parents don\u2019t pay full fees, the sticker price can be thought of as a surcharge on the wealthy.) Besides, with those four children they\u2019re intending to send to private school, I see less Fendi in your friends\u2019 future.I have been working as a freelance editor for more than 15 years. I have a steady group of local and regional clients, who keep me quite busy with work most of the time, and I make a decent hourly wage for this profession. This year, I began working for an online \u2018\u2018crowdsourcing\u2019\u2019 enterprise that employs hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of people around the world. Here\u2019s how it works: Once you pass the qualifying tests, you see tasks appear online, and you compete with everyone else to click on a particular task. If you click first, you get to perform the task. Each task pays between 1 cent and several dollars, depending on its complexity and the expertise it requires. I enjoy doing these tasks because they are short and quickly finished, and they offer a change of pace from my other work. Every morning, the company deposits the previous day\u2019s earnings into my PayPal account. I do these tasks during my down time between projects, viewing the money I earn as a supplement. I\u2019ll most likely use this money for holiday shopping. It\u2019s thoughtful of you to raise this question. But what would happen if you pulled out of the competition? In some cases, surely, you would be handing the task to someone who needed it less than you. (And we would need some interesting theory to figure out how to measure greater need.) Let\u2019s assume, though, that you would marginally raise the probability that someone who needed the money more would get it. That\u2019s still not a reason to opt out. A well-\u00addesigned site will tend to allocate tasks to those who have the strongest desire to do them, because those people are likelier to be hovering over the site to see what turns up. Your opting out isn\u2019t going to have much impact on any one person.And notice that you don\u2019t ask yourself the same question about your main editing jobs \u2014 which are also, in effect, part of the gig economy. You don\u2019t know whether your need for a particular assignment is greater than that of those you compete with, and you\u2019re not obliged to find out. If you suspected that your crowdsourcing enterprise \u2014 or the market for freelance editorial jobs \u2014 was somehow rigged against the underemployed, you would have a reason to campaign for reform. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Click away!I was surprised recently when I received an email from a friend (\u2018\u2018M.J.\u2019\u2019) at work that came with an attachment of M.J.\u2019s child\u2019s college essay to M.J.\u2019s alma mater. I didn\u2019t know how to respond. I\u2019m pretty sure (based on something said in the email) that the child doesn\u2019t know M.J. sent the essay. I don\u2019t know why my friend sent the essay, other than maybe out of honest pride. No feedback was requested. If the child didn\u2019t know, then, as my daughter pointed out, my reading the essay certainly qualifies as an ethics fail, but at least I didn\u2019t send the thing out.A proud parent shows a friend the child\u2019s handiwork. What could be more commonplace? You suspect that M.J. may have been violating the privacy of his or her child. I wonder. Your conclusion depends a good deal on the nature of their relationship. Absent any reason to think that M.J. wasn\u2019t entitled to share the essay, you did nothing wrong in reading it. Even if M.J.\u2019s child hadn\u2019t been asked, I don\u2019t know that it was all that serious an offense. No doubt circulating stuff that makes family members look good can embarrass them. But at least in my family, it\u2019s mostly fast forgiven. If kvelling were a crime, most parents would be in the hoosegow.Still, the general issue you raise is a good one. The ease of hitting the forwarding button means that people are distributing all kinds of things without reflecting about whether they\u2019re violating the privacy of others or failing obligations of confidentiality. Think before you send.Given your concerns, I wouldn\u2019t rule out talking to your manicurist, discreetly.

{"Headline": "VW Reveals It Misstated Emissions of Gas Cars", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA limited number of gasoline-powered cars are affected, said Eric Felber, a company spokesman, expanding the focus of Volkswagen\u2019s crisis beyond its diesel engines.It is the latest in a series of emissions revelations shaking the company, raising questions about the quality of its internal corporate controls and its reputation for engineering prowess, and undermining a carefully crafted image as a maker of efficient and environmentally friendly cars. The latest problem will force the company to incur an estimated 2 billion euros, or about $2.2 billion, in possible financial penalties, a spokesman said, because of tax breaks granted in Europe on cars with low carbon dioxide emissions.Those costs would be on top of the \u20ac6.7 billion the company has already set aside to address its central emissions crisis, revealed in September when Volkswagen admitted that it had installed deceptive software in 11 million diesel vehicles to make it appear as if they met air-quality standards for nitrogen oxide, which poses a threat to human health. Volkswagen\u2019s troubles have led to lawsuits from investors and car owners that are likely to cost the company billions of dollars beyond the money already set aside.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. Felber said the company was still investigating what led to the false emissions data but that it had wanted to make the new information public as soon as possible. Volkswagen said it was most likely not a software issue. An official with the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States said the agency was still studying the Volkswagen statement.Volkswagen said that most of the 800,000 vehicles affected by the carbon dioxide issue were diesels as well and that it discovered the problem while investigating the earlier software deception. It said a recall would not be necessary to fix the carbon dioxide issue.Most of the cars with the carbon dioxide problem are equipped with an engine line known as the EA 288, of which there are 1.4-liter, 1.6-liter and 2-liter versions. A small number of cars with gasoline engines are also affected, Mr. Felber said.Volkswagen said it had made erroneous carbon dioxide and fuel-economy claims in Europe for cars beginning with the 2012 model years, as well as the 2015 and 2016 models currently on sale. The affected cars are the Volkswagen Polo, Golf and Passat and the Audi A1 and A3. Some SEAT and Skoda cars were also involved.Volkswagen disputed the accusation. In a carefully worded statement on Monday, the company said, in part, \u201cthat no software has been installed in the 3-liter V6 diesel power units to alter emissions characteristics in a forbidden manner.\u201dCrisis management experts said that the Monday statement by Volkswagen, which seemed to deny the E.P.A.\u2019s accusations but not clearly rebut them, might not help in any negotiations with the regulatory agency. \u201cIt is not obvious the company has really realized what a big deal this is,\u201d said David Bach, a senior lecturer in global business and politics at the Yale School of Management.Richard Barker, a professor at Sa\u00efd Business School at Oxford University, said that Volkswagen\u2019s strategy so far to deal with the crisis could backfire. \u201cThe risk is that they spread out the bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it damages their credibility. That could come back to haunt them.\u201dAn E.P.A. official, Christopher Grundler, declined on Tuesday to comment on the Volkswagen statement. Mr. Grundler, director of the agency\u2019s office of transportation and air quality, said the E.P.A. was confident about its findings.He said the tests were performed by three separate labs \u2014 the E.P.A.\u2019s, and by researchers at the California Air Resources Board and Environment Canada. All found the same results, he said. \u201cOur conclusion that we announced yesterday is that we have sufficient evidence that we found defeat devices,\u201d Mr. Grundler said, using a term to describe mechanisms that allow cars to cheat on emissions tests.Volkswagen admitted on Sept. 3 that it had installed special software to trick emissions-testing machinery, but it had spent more than a year telling the E.P.A. and California regulators that there was no problem with its diesels and arguing that the regulators\u2019 evidence was mistaken.The revelations also mean that the E.P.A. remains ahead of European regulators in finding and disclosing the broader use of cheating devices by Volkswagen. The automaker has hired Jones Day, an American law firm with offices in Germany, to conduct an internal inquiry into how the illegal software was installed in 11 million vehicles, including about 500,000 in the United States, with most of the rest in Europe.So far, Volkswagen has not explained who was responsible for installing the software or what process led to the decision. A spokesman for Jones Day declined to comment on Tuesday.Jad Mouawad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Russia, Doping Accusations Are Taken in Stride", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The sweeping accusations that a Kremlin-backed program facilitated doping by elite Russian track-and-field athletes in the Olympics and other top sports events earned a collective shrug Tuesday from the Russian public and even, to some extent, from the officials who oversaw the debacle.Choked by low oil prices and Western sanctions imposed after the invasions of Crimea and Ukraine, the economy is shrinking. The ruble has lost more than half its value, inflation is at 11.2 percent, and a much-vaunted national project to create local substitutes for banned Western imports seems to have produced mostly stuff like dubious cheese made from palm oil.And last week, a Russian charter flight plummeted into the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, killing all 224 people on board, in what British and American intelligence agencies suspect was a terrorist attack in response to the Kremlin\u2019s military intervention in Syria.Yet the basic reaction is to shrug and point a finger elsewhere, preferably at the West.\u201cThe West is envious that our athletes achieve good results, so they pushed forward the doping claims,\u201d Boris Ivanov, a rail-thin retired construction engineer, said without a trace of irony. \u201cEverybody takes dope! Americans and other nations, all of them!\u201dRussia was singled out, he said, because the Americans run most such organizations and \u201cthey want to attack Russia.\u201dAs in Soviet times, sports remains a government affair and another facet of global prestige, so any blow to the image of the athletes is also a blow to the Kremlin. Mr. Putin announced that he would meet with senior athletic officials on Wednesday.After initial outrage over the accusations, the official Russian reaction was somewhat more circumspect, with officials promising to investigate and to take steps to correct the situation (something they promised back in 2013, before the Sochi Olympics, where the Russian antidoping agency was the lead tester).Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of the Moscow lab accused of malfeasance, whom the report suggested be replaced, resigned. But Russian officials still minimized the import of what experts call one of the most damning public reports in the history of sports \u2014 \u201cworse than we thought,\u201d said a co-author and doping expert, Dick Pound.\u201cBelieve me, there are many similar doping scandals all over the world,\u201d Vitaly Mutko, Russia\u2019s sports minister, said in his initial public reaction, arguing that doping should be considered an international issue, since elite Russian athletes spend 10 months of the year abroad competing. \u201cDoping is not a problem of Russia.\u201dA number of factors contribute to Russians\u2019 readiness to accept such explanations, the primary being the survival instinct. Most of the 140 million Russians struggle just to get by, and do not involve themselves too deeply in larger issues.Traditionally, though, the first line of defense against any problem is stoicism. This is especially true since Mr. Putin has painted any current problems as the side effects of a national effort to \u201cpull Russia off its knees,\u201d where the West is said to have shoved it in the first place.\u201cWe have had more difficult times before,\u201d said Viktoria Troschanskaya, a middle-aged Russian lawyer wandering through a Moscow park.\u201cRussia is a country that is ready to tolerate pain for the sake of national greatness,\u201d said Natalya V. Zubarevich, a professor who specializes in Russian demographics. \u201cThe simple rational explanation \u2014 the economy went down, people must be angry \u2014 does not work in Russia.\u201dSecond, when they look for answers, state-run television tells them exactly what to think. Ever since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea, the mantra has been that Mr. Putin seeks to restore Russia as a great power, a goal the West is determined to thwart. It is a circular argument that magnifies any gains and explains away any setbacks.Given that 90 percent of Russians rely on state-run television as their primary news source, and that for at least 18 months there has been a steady drumbeat of anti-Americanism across all news programs, many people react automatically.\u201cWe are in a kind of competition, not to say a war with the West,\u201d said Mr. Babitsky, explaining the general reaction, not endorsing it. \u201cEverybody knows that everybody cheats, and if we were caught red-handed, it just means that they cheat better than we do.\u201dFinally, Russian officials face little accountability, and Mr. Putin in particular has sought to insulate his loyalists from any public rebuke. There is a dark historical precedent at play. Since czarist times, Russians have been told that their leader will always protect their best interests and they have been conditioned across centuries never to question that fact.As with doping, so with the catastrophic crash of the charter jet.Russian officials, starting with Mr. Putin, expressed dismay that Western governments were quick to point to a terrorist bomb as the likely cause. When Britain canceled all flights to and from Sharm el Sheikh, the Egyptian departure point, and began an emergency airlift home, the initial Russian reaction was that the West was trying to put pressure on Russia over its policy of deploying warplanes in Syria since the end of September to bolster the fortunes of its ally \u2014 and Western b\u00eate noire \u2014 President Bashar al-Assad.No Russian officials acknowledged that Prime Minister David Cameron might face domestic political problems if British citizens were harmed just months after 30 were shot dead in a terrorist attack on a Tunisian beach. Instead, Dmitry Kiselyov, the television anchor who uses his Sunday night news show to set the agenda for the Kremlin, questioned whether the United States and other Western nations might have bought off the terrorist groups so they would attack a Russian jet.\u201cIt is well known that the Americans easily agree with terrorists about their security,\u201d he said. \u201cThey pay or they bargain: We close our eyes on something and you don\u2019t touch us. This is a common practice with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Why wouldn\u2019t this practice be replicated with the Islamic State?\u201dCalling it \u201cjust a theory,\u201d he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t the explosion on our plane that the Egyptians say is 90 percent certain a product of an agreement not to touch civilian planes of the Western coalition?\u201dThe Russian reaction to moral questions is complicated by their association of national greatness with Stalin, who oversaw Russia\u2019s industrialization and victory in World War II, but also the death of millions in prisons, forced collectivization, purges and mass deportations.Russia tends to avoid confronting the crimes committed in tandem with its 20th-century climb to greatness, analysts said, especially since it is trying to regain the same stature. In defending Russian history, given that the government plays down what Stalin did, a doping scandal appears fairly minor in comparison.At the deepest levels, analysts say, the idea of morality in public policy died out decades ago, if not centuries, under the weight of government repression.\u201cIt is not that Russian people are bad,\u201d Mr. Babitsky said. \u201cIt is just that for 100 years they have not seen a politician who lives by any moral standards. When you bring up a moral argument, everybody looks at you as a kind of crazy person, like those people on Times Square shouting about the end of the world.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about the lack of public outrage in Russia over accusations that a Kremlin-backed program facilitated doping by Russian track-and-field athletes in the Olympics and other top sports events referred incorrectly to Andrey Babitsky, who said the doping would probably \u201cbe stretched to be understood as something done for the public good.\u201d He is a former editor of Russian Esquire and new editor in chief of InLiberty.ru, a libertarian website, not its founder.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Move to Label Israeli Settlement Goods Strains Ties", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor example, Israeli banks that provide mortgages to homeowners in the West Bank could become vulnerable to divestment from Europe, retail chains with outlets in settlements could be barred from the Continent and manufacturers that use parts made in factories there could face labeling or sanctions.Some have even suggested that settlement residents could lose the privilege that allows Israeli citizens to travel to Europe without a visa.\u201cThe Israeli pushback is about trying to intimidate Europeans from not going further down this path,\u201d said Daniel Levy, Middle East director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe Israelis want this process to move as slowly as possible, because at a minimum it\u2019s a headache, and at a maximum, ultimately, it could be devastating.\u201dIsrael summoned the European Union ambassador, Lars Faaborg-Andersen, to the foreign ministry and informed him that Israel was suspending diplomatic talks scheduled for various forums in the coming weeks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a host of other Israeli leaders denounced the move as hypocritical because no such labels were proposed for products from occupied territories elsewhere in the world, and they said it was particularly painful after weeks of Palestinian attacks against Israeli Jews.\u201cThe E.U. should be ashamed,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cThe E.U. has decided to label Israel, and we are not prepared to accept the fact that Europe is labeling the side that is being attacked by terrorism.\u201dThe labeling rules apply to fresh fruit and vegetables, wine, honey, olive oil, eggs, poultry, organic products and cosmetics coming from Israeli-owned businesses and farms outside the state\u2019s original borders.Rather than \u201cproduct of Israel,\u201d these goods must be labeled with the term \u201csettlement,\u201d or \u201cits equivalent,\u201d the rules say, as in \u201cproduct of West Bank (Israeli settlement).\u201d Goods from Palestinian-owned businesses can say \u201cproduct of Palestine\u201d or \u201cproduct of West Bank (Palestinian product).\u201dThe producer, exporter and importer are responsible for complying with the regulations, but it is up to member countries to ensure that the rules are followed, officials in Brussels said. The new standard is optional, not mandatory, for packaged foods and industrial products.The Israeli leader\u2019s settlement policy resembles his predecessors\u2019, but it is a march toward permanence at a time when prospects for peace are few.The guidelines from the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive body, come after foreign ministers from some member nations, first in 2013 and again this April, urged Brussels to take action. Some nations \u2014 Britain in 2009, Denmark in 2013 and Belgium in 2014 \u2014 had already issued their own labeling guidelines.Palestinian leaders welcomed the initiative, but said it did not go far enough.Settlement-based businesses \u201cmake products with stolen natural resources on the land of the Palestinian people,\u201d Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement. \u201cThose products should not only be labeled, but should be banned.\u201dThere are about 1,000 Israeli companies operating in more than a dozen industrial zones in West Bank settlements, and roughly 23,000 acres of Jewish-run farms. The Golan Heights has many wineries whose wares have won international accolades.\u201cWe believe that economic and political pressure is needed to challenge Israel\u2019s ability to deny us our basic rights,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPeople who are genuinely concerned about Palestinian workers should take action to end Israel\u2019s deliberate destruction of the Palestinian economy and its exploitation and oppression of our people.\u201dIsraeli politicians aligned with Mr. Netanyahu and those very much opposed to him seemed to be competing in their condemnations on Wednesday.Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said the move \u201cdiscriminates against Israel and encourages terror.\u201dFor Vered Ben-Sadon, it was personal. She is co-owner of the Tura Winery in the West Bank settlement of Rechalim, which exports 40 percent of its 56,000 bottles annually with labels that say \u201cwine from the Land of Israel.\u201d She is also the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor.\u201cIn the past Jews were marked with a yellow patch, and today they are looking to mark our products,\u201d Ms. Ben-Sadon, 38, said on Israel Radio. \u201cEurope, rather than atoning for what it did 70 years ago, is repeating the same ideas.\u201dBut Yariv Oppenheimer, director of the Israeli group Peace Now, said that anyone who likened labeling to a boycott \u2014 which he opposes \u2014 was \u201cgetting confused.\u201d\u201cThis decision can strengthen Israel because it says there is a difference, and what is produced in Israel is legitimate \u2014 buy it, invest and continue the ties,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer said in a radio interview. \u201cIt is the right of every person and every country to say we don\u2019t want to be part of this thing you are doing in the territories.\u201dJodi Rudoren reported from Jerusalem, and Sewell Chan from London.

We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters.\u201d\u201cThat is why the outcome in Paris so important.\u201dMr. Modi has insisted that emissions reductions in his country must be paired with billions of dollars of investment by the developed world into helping poor countries make the transition from fossil fuel to cleaner forms of energy. On Monday, he announced, with Mr. Hollande, an international alliance to promote greater use of solar energy in the 121 solar-rich nations.Most countries have pledged their greenhouse gas emissions goals. The pledges are the biggest cut ever achieved, but are still not enough.Canadians have demonstrated \u201ca strong desire\u201d to take action on climate change, Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Paris.Even Mr. Putin, who has in the past expressed skepticism about the established science of climate change, reflected the tone of the day. Russia, a petrostate that relies heavily on the production of fossil fuels, had previously been viewed as a likely obstacle to a final deal.\u201cClimate change has become one of the gravest challenges humanity is facing,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia has been contributing actively to addressing global warming.\u201dBesides the officials from all over the world, the event is expected to get a lift from prominent business leaders and philanthropists. Some of them are using the talks to announce substantial donations to help the cause of reducing emissions, developing alternative energy sources, conservation, and aiding poor and low-lying countries expected to be most affected by climate change.It is hoped that the pledge, along with one by 19 countries, including the United States, to double their investments in energy technologies to $20 billion by 2020, will help convince poor countries that they will be given significant help in making a transition to a new economic model that relies less on the use of carbon.In one of many such expected announcements, the State Department pledged $248 million to help the world\u2019s least-developed countries move toward a future that is less reliant on carbon.However, such efforts \u2014 as well as Mr. Obama\u2019s pledges \u2014 will continue to meet opposition in Congress. Republicans have vowed to block or overturn much of Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts here, and the House is scheduled to vote later this week on two bills that would halt Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic climate change policies.The president is hoping that the international pact will outlive any future leader, although fervent opposition in the Senate means that any agreement here will not be a formal treaty, which would need approval from lawmakers.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Winemakers Seek Their Own Napa Valley", "Date": "2015-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYINCHUAN, China \u2014 On a fall evening in a fluorescent-lit classroom at Tsinghua University in Beijing, a dozen students listened intently. The speaker, Emma Gao, held a glass to the light and asked them to study the swirling liquid inside. Tsinghua is known as the \u201cM.I.T. of China,\u201d but this was no freshman seminar in fluid mechanics. It was a gathering of the student wine club.Ms. Gao, a diminutive woman with a quick smile, was conducting a tasting of recent vintages from her family-run winery in Ningxia, a remote Chinese region on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Behind desktops lined with glasses, the students sniffed and sipped, comparing a fruity red with a richer, oakier French-style wine.Since her winery has begun to win international acclaim, Ms. Gao, who is 38, has emerged as the unlikely new star of an even more unlikely new Chinese industry. The winery, Silver Heights, has been a pioneer in China, bringing sophisticated Western winemaking techniques to what had been an industry focused on bulk production.Taking a cue from that boutique-winery model, Ningxia has ambitions to become the Napa Valley of China. Local winemakers have won prestigious awards, and plans are underway to double the region\u2019s vineyards and create a wine tourism hub. Foreign investors have also taken notice. The French Champagne maker M\u00f6et & Chandon makes sparkling wines there, while the spirits giant Pernod Ricard is spending heavily to modernize its local winery.\u201cPeople know Napa makes the best wines in America and Bordeaux makes the best wines in France,\u201d says Hao Linhai, a top regional official who oversees the industry. \u201cWhen they think of Chinese wines, we want them to think of Ningxia.\u201dWhile China is better known for fiery, 100-proof baijiu than prized vintages, its fast-growing middle class is increasingly demanding Western delights. And that includes fine wine.Chinese drinkers quaffed more than 1.5 billion bottles of red wine in 2014, double the level of 2008, according to IWSR, a research firm based in London. Over all, China ranks fourth in red wine consumption, behind France, the United States and Italy. Wine production in the country has surged to meet that demand. From virtually nothing in the early 1980s, it is now the world\u2019s seventh-largest winemaker.Aided by the same long-range planning and government support that have brought success in everything from textiles to high-end electronics, China made 120 million cases of wine in 2014. That\u2019s a bit less than a third of what is produced in the United States, and just behind the export powerhouses Australia and Argentina.But Chinese wine is made almost exclusively for the domestic market, says Ma Huiqin, a professor at China Agricultural University in Beijing who works closely with Ningxia\u2019s wine industry. And until recently, most of it was barely drinkable by Western standards, produced by giant industrial winemakers.Now a new generation of Chinese winemakers is trying to upgrade quality in an effort to win over local wine drinkers as their tastes become more discerning, as well as capture the aficionados who drink mostly imports from France, America and elsewhere. And eventually, as with many other Chinese industries, the most successful will look to sell their wines overseas.\u201cThey\u2019ve got all the money in the world, they\u2019ve got all the ambition in the world, and they\u2019ve hired all the top consultants,\u201d says Steven Spurrier, the British wine merchant who organized the \u201cJudgment of Paris,\u201d the 1976 blind tasting that stunned the wine world when California wines beat the French. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable the Chinese are going to make better and better wines.\u201dSitting in the courtyard of her family\u2019s ramshackle compound outside the regional capital of Yinchuan, Ms. Gao of Silver Heights looked out over the vineyard her father planted nearly 20 years ago. Among the first in the region to plant grapes, he suggested she go to France to study winemaking in 1999. \u201cI was 21. I said, sure, why not?\u201d she said. \u201cIt was France that interested me, not winemaking.\u201dAfter earning a degree in oenology, she did a stint at the highly regarded Ch\u00e2teau Calon-S\u00e9gur, where she met, and eventually married, the winemaker. French attitudes made a deep impression. \u201cI learned to focus on quality, to make the best wine you can with the material you have,\u201d she said.After Ms. Gao returned to China, the first vintage she and her father produced in 2007 was just 10 barrels, or 3,000 bottles. Today, Ms. Gao makes four wines, with total production of 60,000 bottles. A 2013 bottle of her Summit label sells for around $75.\u201cShe\u2019s considered the best winemaker, with practically the best wine, in all of China,\u201d says G\u00e9rard Colin, a French consultant who helped Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild develop a winery in China. \u201cEmma put Ningxia on the map.\u201dA poor coal region wedged below Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, with its hilly, arid scrubland, is ill suited for most agriculture. It\u2019s dry and hot in the summer, with long, freezing winters. But its sandy, rocky soil proved ideal for growing grapes. The Helan Mountains to the west protect the vineyards from harsh desert winds, while cool nights keep the grapes from ripening too fast.Eager to create a new industry, the regional government built extensive irrigation systems starting in the late 1990s and put winemaking at the center of development plans. In 2005, the government helped start the area\u2019s first \u201cdemonstration\u201d winery, Helan Qingxue.A major turning point came in 2011 when Helan Qingxue won a gold medal in a prestigious international competition by the British wine publication Decanter. A 2009 bottle of its Jia Bei Lan was named best red Bordeaux varietal over \u00a310, beating out rivals from Napa, Australia and Bordeaux.Suddenly, what had been a slow buildup turned into a stampede. The award \u201cmade people realize that wine could be a great business,\u201d said Guo Xiaoheng, a native of the region who trained as a sommelier in France before returning to sell winemaking equipment. Demand \u2014 and prices \u2014 for Ningxia\u2019s wines began to take off.A decade ago, Ningxia had just a handful of wineries. Today, there are more than 70, with 40 more under construction, and the government plans to reach 200 by 2020. As elsewhere in China, red wines dominate, mostly the Bordeaux blends \u2014 principally mixtures of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc \u2014 popular in China.Jancis Robinson, a British wine journalist, judged a blind tasting of Chinese wines in Shanghai last year. \u201cNingxia really did shine. They produced most of the top wines,\u201d she said. They are now \u201cvery acceptable commercial quality wines.\u201dFor Ms. Gao, that\u2019s not good enough. Early one morning in May, she drove an hour out to the Helan Mountain foothills, where she is building a winery with more advanced equipment. The expanded vineyards will allow Silver Heights to grow to 200,000 bottles per year.Surveying the waist-high vines jutting from the rocky soil, she said it takes five years or more before they produce the quality she requires. In a nearby plot, she has begun to experiment with pinot noir, chardonnay and other varietals.\u201cWe want to try the land, to see what\u2019s suitable,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not investing for one or two years; we\u2019re investing for the next 100 years. Those will be wines for future generations to make.\u201dM\u00f6et & Chandon\u2019s new sparkling wine facility \u2014 with its clean modern lines and state-of-the-art equipment \u2014 has become one of the area\u2019s biggest standouts since it opened two years ago.Pointing out the giant tanks used to produce 50,000 cases last year, the estate director, Shen Yang, says Chandon is in the first phase of a long-term investment aimed at getting China\u2019s white-collar professionals to drink more sparkling wine.\u201cOur mission in China is to create a new market for this wine,\u201d Mr. Shen said.Today, Chinese demand for sparkling wines is tiny \u2014 roughly 2 percent of total wine consumption, he says, compared with 9 percent for mature markets. But M\u00f6et & Chandon decided that with imports rising, it was time to start producing locally.\u201cChina\u2019s market has enormous potential,\u201d he added. \u201cThe interest in wine now is a reflection of its stage of economic development.\u201dNingxia\u2019s growing reputation has attracted investment, as domestic and international players alike look at China\u2019s market. The region\u2019s wineries produced 270 million bottles in 2014, nearly triple the level of three years earlier.The resulting boom has reshaped Yinchuan. Signs of prosperity are everywhere, from the five-star Kempinski Hotel to the office towers and apartment complexes popping up all across the city. On the city\u2019s outskirts, a constant flow of tractors and trucks race along winding two-lane roadways rutted with potholes. A new highway to speed visitors to the wineries is under construction.Changyu Pioneer Wine, China\u2019s oldest domestic wine producer \u2014 and one of the three giants that dominate the market \u2014 has spent over $100 million creating a Disneyesque, nearly 140,000-square-foot \u201cchateau,\u201d complete with fountains, turrets and two suits of medieval armor guarding the gates. Run in partnership with the Austrian winemaker Lenz Moser, it is the latest of six castles that Changyu has built around China to draw middle-class Chinese who have begun to enjoy Western-style vacations. The general manager, Ruan Shi Li, says he expects 80,000 visitors this year, more than double its first year.But some are starting to worry about whether the breakneck growth is sustainable, as the new wealth has prompted something of a speculative land rush. Chen Deqi was among Ningxia\u2019s earliest investors, buying 25,000 acres in 2007. Now he\u2019s dividing it into 100 parcels to create \u201cmini chateaus\u201d for the wealthy.Mr. Chen says he already has buyers willing to pay 1 million renminbi \u2014 roughly $160,000 \u2014 for the first two. He says the land is now worth 20 times what he paid for it.Others are concerned that quality could suffer. Xie Donjiang, a Ningxia native who developed a wine property south of Beijing and also owns the Ektimo winery in Sebastopol, Calif., returned to check out Ningxia last fall. He was disappointed.He argues that Ningxia officials have encouraged the willy-nilly planting of grapes without understanding which varietals are best suited to its terroir \u2014 the combination of soil, exposure and climate that makes each vineyard unique.\u201cNingxia is pushing too hard,\u201d Mr. Xie said. \u201cThis is basic analysis for wine, but the government is not doing it.\u201dZhou Jianyu is a businessman from Hunan. Like many younger Chinese, Mr. Zhou acquired a taste for wine while studying abroad. At first, he favored European wines \u2014 mostly French and Italian. But three years ago, he began drinking only Chinese wines. \u201cThey were excellent, so I began to drink more,\u201d he said.On a tour of Legacy Peak, one of Ningxia\u2019s best new wineries, Mr. Zhou and his friends had a lunch of fish, crabs, chicken and vegetables. While they ate, the winemaker, Zhou Shu Zhen, discussed the local climate and explained how a longer barrel aging added depth to her reds.\u201cFor many people, California or French wines have their own flavor,\u201d said Mr. Zhou, who is not related to the winemaker. \u201cBut I\u2019ve discovered that Ningxia\u2019s wines have their own flavor and character too.\u201dAs Ningxia races to expand, cultivating customers like Mr. Zhou will be critical. Much of the explosion in wine consumption was driven by government officials and executives at state-owned companies buying expensive vintages for banquets and gifts. In the last two years, the government has been on a tough anticorruption campaign, and one consequence was a 12 percent drop-off in red wine consumption last year. The stock market crash and slowing economy this year are not helping.The shakeout is forcing winemakers to focus on \u201creal buyers,\u201d says Fongyee Walker, the managing director of Dragon Phoenix, a wine education consultancy based in Beijing. That is the middle- and upper-class Chinese who drink wine because they like it, not because of the status or favors it brings.To build that customer base, Ningxia\u2019s producers say they are concentrating on getting their wines into shops and restaurants in Beijing and other major cities. Few Ningxia wines are available outside the region, and prices are high.\u201cEven if people love our wines, they cannot find us,\u201d says Wang Fang of Kanaan Winery. Both Kanaan and Legacy Peak have recently signed deals with top wine distributors.Many are also envisioning a time when top Chinese wines will be a common sight on the shelves of American or European stores.Mike Insley, a New Zealander who recently arrived to upgrade Pernod Ricard\u2019s vineyards, says the area reminds him of Marlborough \u2014 the center of his country\u2019s wine industry \u2014 in the late 1980s. Back then, New Zealand\u2019s wines had no international recognition and its vintners were only beginning to understand the wines they produced.Today, wine is New Zealand\u2019s No. 6 export, with sales of more than $940 million. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when a country gets this right,\u201d Mr. Insley said.Chinese vintages are starting to pique overseas interest. Bruno Paumard, a French winemaker who exports to Britain, Australia and Hong Kong from a large estate in nearby Inner Mongolia, has begun to ship his Ningxia wines as well. And Changyu Moser XV, which now sells about 170,000 bottles a year in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, is gearing up for a big expansion. Mr. Moser says it aims to hit roughly five million bottles across the Continent within a few years; he will also soon begin talks with American distributors. Thanks to a strong 2015 vintage, he adds, \u201cwe have a chance to make China a real player in the international arena.\u201dSilver Heights has also had interest from Europe. But Ms. Gao worries that Chinese wines are still too expensive to compete in international markets. For now, expanding her vineyards and improving her winemaking are more important than exporting.\u201cWe do not have time for that now,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe next year.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about winemaking in China misidentified a winery in Ningxia, China. It is Ch\u00e2teau Changyu Moser XV, not Ch\u00e2teau Moser.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guinea, Last Nation With Ebola, May Soon Be Declared Free of Virus", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe countdown began after a 3-week-old girl, Nubia Soumah, the last known patient in active treatment in the world, tested negative for the virus twice in a row.\u201cShe could be the last patient of this epidemic,\u201d said Laurence Sailly, a Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator for Ebola in Guinea.Some Soumah family members had been taken to the Doctors Without Borders treatment center for observation, a quarantine of sorts. But they did not contract Ebola, and after the incubation period passed late last week, they were released. Their return home was met with great fanfare, as they were accompanied by Prime Minister Mohamed Said Fofana.The coming days in Guinea will be stressful for the country, which awaits a declaration of being Ebola-free so it can begin to repair the damage the virus has done to its economy and society.Aid workers are still monitoring anyone who may have come in contact with Ebola victims in the villages. One woman who fled last month after being in close contact with a patient has not been found, Dr. Diallo said.Guinea and other countries also run the risk of new cases generated from survivors who still harbor the virus in semen or body tissues.A Scottish nurse became critically ill last month after having recovered from Ebola, which she contracted doing charity work in Sierra Leone nearly a year ago. She has recovered again and was released last week from a specialized infectious disease treatment center in London, but her health is being closely monitored.Doctors Without Borders officials in Guinea said Nubia\u2019s case was an important medical milestone: She became the only baby born to an infected mother known to have survived Ebola.Infants and children who have contracted Ebola during this outbreak have fared the worst of any age group, according to the W.H.O.Health care officials from around the world have been closely tracking Nubia\u2019s care, checking in frequently with doctors in Conakry.\u201cShe\u2019s broken all records, this little girl,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Harris, a W.H.O. spokeswoman. \u201cShe is really something special.\u201dNubia has spent her life so far inside a treatment center where she was born, being coddled only by workers suited in head-to-toe protective gear. Two weeks ago, an aunt, Fatoumata Cisse, became her first family member allowed to view her at the treatment center.\u201cYou O.K.?\u201d cooed Ms. Cisse, from several feet away, blocked off by two sets of makeshift fencing to prevent any spread of infection.

{"Headline": "Lew Vows to Resist Congressional Maneuvers to Weaken Dodd-Frank", "Date": "2015-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs an important deadline looms in Congress, the Obama administration signaled on Tuesday that it would push back hard against any legislation that substantially loosens the sweeping 2010 overhaul of the financial system.Republicans in Congress are backing legislation that would soften certain parts of the reforms, which were accomplished through the Dodd-Frank Act five years ago. They are now seeking to insert the changes into a spending bill that has to be passed by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown.Last year, Congress attached a provision to a wider spending bill that ended up gutting an important part of the law regulating instruments known as swaps. The victory for Wall Street indicated that big banks still had sway in Washington, but it also helped reinvigorate the campaigns of those who want to do more to rein in large financial institutions.On Tuesday, Jacob J. Lew, the secretary of the Treasury, sought to underscore the administration\u2019s opposition to any meaningful concessions on Dodd-Frank.\u201cI have publicly made clear that my recommendation to the president would be that if there are legislative measures that will roll back the clock, that would take us back toward where we were before the financial crisis, I would recommend a veto,\u201d Mr. Lew said via email.While they may achieve smaller concessions this year, the critics of Dodd-Frank may also hope to establish a track record of chipping away at the overhaul each year. Their cause may also be helped by the relatively complex nature of the changes they want to make. Their victory last year was over a regulation that governed swaps, financial instruments that Wall Street uses to hedge risks and speculate.But Mr. Lew said attaching financial regulation amendments to spending bills was a stealthy effort to erode important parts of Dodd-Frank.\u201cThe idea that something that amends Wall Street reform at the last minute on a must-pass bill is unacceptable,\u201d he said in another email. \u201cWe have said that we\u2019re open to conversations about technical changes or improvements in Dodd-Frank, but frankly, there are a lot of things masquerading as technical changes that are not.\u201dIn response, Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Committee on Appropriations, which is helping put together the spending bill, said in an email, \u201cThe committee does not comment or speculate on funding levels or policy items that may or may not be included in future legislation.\u201dDodd-Frank\u2019s critics in Congress are homing in on new rules that aim to bolster the ability of regulators to spot risks in the financial system. In the lead-up to the financial crisis, regulators failed to properly appreciate the weaknesses of financial firms and to foresee where crippling losses might occur.To help address that failing, Dodd-Frank said that banks had to be subjected to annual regulatory tests that would assess their ability to withstand extreme stress in the markets and the wider economy. If financial firms fail the test, regulators can place restrictions on them. Legislation introduced by Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, could effectively exempt many large banks from such tests.Right now, banks with assets worth $50 billion or more are automatically subject to the so-called stress tests. Mr. Shelby\u2019s legislation could raise that threshold to $500 billion, which could exclude a midsize bank like Capital One, for example. Defenders of this legislation say that it still gives regulators the opportunity to designate banks that are smaller than $500 billion as \u201csystemically important,\u201d and thus subject to stress tests.But critics of Mr. Shelby\u2019s idea assert that firms that are far smaller than $500 billion, and carry out relatively simple activities, can still cause big problems for the wider system. For instance, Countrywide Financial, whose mortgage portfolio suffered enormous losses during the housing crash, had assets of about $200 billion heading into the financial crisis.Still, there might yet be room for a compromise on the threshold. Daniel K. Tarullo, a governor of the Federal Reserve who has helped devise relatively stringent new regulations, suggested in March that he might support raising the threshold to $100 billion. Before the crisis, certain regulators missed problems that were amassing under their noses. To help keep that from happening again, the council was established to give a range of financial regulators the ability to come together to assess whether dangerous risks were building up in the system. The council can take steps to designate financial firms that are not traditional banks as being important to the financial system \u2014 and then subject them to new regulations. Such a process might have stopped the American International Group from making the gargantuan loss-making bets that prompted a taxpayer bailout in 2008.But some members of Congress assert that the council lacks accountability and transparency when designating nonbanks as important to the financial system. As a result, they have introduced legislation that would require the council to apply a raft of new procedures early in the process of deciding if a firm is important to the system.Critics of this effort contend that the designation process already gives firms opportunities to respond to the council during the process. And they assert that the legislation would double the length of the designation process to as long as four years, noting that A.I.G.\u2019s bets swelled to a dangerous level within less than four years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ISIS Ally in Egypt Emerges as Key Suspect in Russian Jet Crash", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Within months of the military takeover here two years ago, a little-known group calling itself Ansar Beit al-Maqdis managed to penetrate rings of checkpoints and heavy security to carry out a string of startling attacks, assassinating a senior police official at his home near here and blowing up a security headquarters here and in Mansoura, Egypt.They were inside jobs. The Egyptian authorities concluded that the group had received crucial advice from two policemen, Lt. Mohamed Eweis and Col. Sameh el-Azizi, who were among a series of military and security officers the group eventually recruited.Now the same group, operating as the Sinai Province of the Islamic State, is the prime suspect in yet another inside job: The bombing of the Russian charter jet that exploded last week in midair over the desert north of Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, which killed all 224 people aboard. British and American officials say they believe it increasingly likely that the group planted the bomb before takeoff.The parent group, based in Raqqa, Syria, has much to lose by approving or even embracing the apparent bombing, he argued. Although supporters of the Islamic State are calling the jet\u2019s crash retribution against Russia for its intervention in Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, Mr. McCants noted that the Russians had mostly attacked Western-backed rebel groups that were foes of the Islamic State.\u201cRussia has been hitting their enemies for them,\u201d Mr. McCants argued. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the guys in Raqqa want Russia to go all in against them.\u201dMore than a dozen countries have had attacks since the Islamic State, or ISIS, began to pursue a global strategy in the summer of 2014.Until now, the Islamic State has focused mainly on local sectarian battles. It has started wars against two nations, Syria and Iraq. It has linked up with local groups in Libya, Afghanistan, Nigeria and elsewhere. It has encouraged its far-flung affiliates and lone individuals inspired by its example to improvise their own attacks of all kinds against Westerners and their interests.But its priority on taking and governing territory has until now distinguished the Islamic State from older groups like Al Qaeda, whose primary strategy was inflicting enormous casualties on the civilians of a distant foreign power. No group acting in the Islamic State\u2019s name has ever bombed a civilian airplane, the archetypical terrorist attack of an earlier era.\u201cThis brings to reality our worst fears,\u201d said Mokhtar Awad, a researcher at the Center for American Progress who tracks the Egyptian militants, \u201cthat this group that has the most territory and the most resources and the most power in jihadist history is now a launching pad for terrorist attacks.\u201d\u201cThis is their way of retaliating,\u201d he said. \u201cTerrorism used as a tool of war \u2014 to try to deter attacks by a foreign power.\u201dFor much of its history, the Sinai Province has focused on local targets, particularly Egyptian military and security personnel. Its roots date back to early in the last decade, when a handful of Bedouin returning from universities on the Egyptian mainland sought to form an ultraconservative Islamist militant group. Capitalizing on resentment of the Egyptian government, they organized mainly among their own Sinai tribes and called their movement Monotheism and Jihad.But their group formed at the tail end of a broader Islamist insurgency that had resorted to massacring tourists, an obvious tactic for militants seeking to cripple the Egyptian economy. The militants carried out a mass shooting in Luxor in 1997 that killed 64 people and then a series of bombings at Red Sea resorts, including Sharm el Sheikh, that killed more than 145 people between 2004 and 2006.The strategy backfired because it alienated millions of Egyptians, particularly those working in tourism. With the public on their side, the Egyptian security forces finally crushed the militants, including the group in Sinai.A Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane.This time the militants took aim at Israel, repeatedly destroying pipelines that shipped Egyptian natural gas across the border. When President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led the military ouster of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, the group shifted the focus of its attacks to the Egyptian security forces.Ansar Beit al-Maqdis quickly demonstrated proficiency at making bombs, blowing up a security headquarters in Mansoura, a city in the Nile Delta, in December 2013. Its attacks killed hundreds of soldiers and police officers. Its numbers expanded to as many as a few thousand members, with cells operating in the Nile Valley and in the Western desert as well as Sinai, according to Western diplomats briefed on intelligence reports.But, apparently mindful of the experience of earlier militants, the group seemed to try hard to minimize civilian casualties. It often took pains to detonate its bombs in the middle of the night or on days when buildings were empty.That began to change last fall, when a faction of the group based in Sinai decided to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State.The Sinai group began beheading suspected informants, imitating the Islamic State\u2019s trademark punishment. Its attacks became noticeably more sophisticated and coordinated, with simultaneous strikes at many locations. Its online media took on some of the slick polish of its Syrian parent.With the bombing of the Russian charter jet, the Sinai Province stands to vault ahead in jihadi prestige and recruitment.

{"Headline": "Stronger Dollar Emboldens More Americans to Seek European Dream Home", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth Special SectionBARCELONA \u2014 With the exchange rate against the euro persistently not in his favor and his retirement still 20 years away, Dr. Kenneth Bermudez had decided to delay his dream of owning a villa in Tuscany, Italy.\u201cI originally thought I was going to look much later, but now with the strong dollar and drop in property prices, I couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity,\u201d he said.Dr. Bermudez, a plastic surgeon based in San Francisco, spent three weeks house hunting in Tuscany, visiting 30 properties before choosing a villa in the Chianti region near the town of Gaiole, 45 minutes from Florence. The purchase is in escrow and expected to clear by January.\u201cBetween the strong dollar and the price \u2014 about 20 percent lower than the original listed price \u2014 I think I saved about 35 to 40 percent,\u201d he said, adding that he had spent \u201cless than $1 million\u201d for a home of 8,000 square feet on nine acres.The dollar\u2019s climb in value against the euro \u2014 it remains near the recent peak reached in March \u2014 and languishing prices in some European markets have emboldened many Americans to consider buying a second home in Europe after more than a decade of near inactivity.\u201cIf we compared data through the end of the third quarter of 2015 with the same period the prior year, the growth of U.S. home buyer interest in Europe is up 180 percent,\u201d said Erin Koops, executive vice president for member services at Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, a company based in Chicago that represents 500 broker firms in 50 countries.Ms. Koops said the measure was based on requests by Americans at broker companies in the United States for introductions to Europe agents.The countries that received the most inquiries were those that traditionally appealed to Americans: France, Italy, Spain and, in a virtual tie for fourth, England and Germany, Ms. Koops said.The market conditions in each of those markets vary, but the common denominator is the stronger dollar.According to Daragh Maher, a currency strategist at HSBC in New York, the rise in the dollar began last year when the Federal Reserve stopped injecting money into the American economy, a policy known as quantitative easing, and the European Central Bank did the opposite, pumping in money, which weakened the euro.\u201cThe consensus expectation is that the dollar will be at $1.06 to the euro at the end of 2016\u201d \u2014 it now hovers around $1.10 \u2014 \u201cbut will remain broadly stable until then,\u201d Mr. Maher said. \u201cIf you believe that outlook, the exchange rate is less of a factor to consider.\u201dMost buyers consulted had not postponed decisions to buy in the hopes of getting an even better rate. In fact, the current environment is actually more favorable to American buyers, Mr. Maher said.\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is that the market is not as pessimistic about the euro now, but that has created a helpful combination,\u201d he said. \u201cAffordability has improved, but stability in the euro means you\u2019re not so worried about where you\u2019ll be in 12 months\u2019 time with a euro asset.\u201dWhen it comes to the gold-plated addresses of Paris and London, however, affordability is a relative term. In the French capital, the average price for a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in St.-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s is more than $4,600 a square foot. In Mayfair in London, the same size apartment can be more than $7,500 a square foot.By contrast, the average price a square foot in the Mitte neighborhood of Berlin, the city\u2019s most popular property destination for international buyers, is roughly $1,600 a square foot; in the Eixample district in Barcelona, Spain, it is just under $1,300.London\u2019s expensive prices stand out for another reason: It is one of the few, if any, cities in Europe where buyers in dollars would still pay more today for the same apartment in a prime location than they would have in July 2008, when the dollar hit its all-time low, worth just 0.62 euro.This is partly because Britain uses the pound, not the euro, so it is largely shielded from the economic uncertainty in the eurozone that is caused by Greece and other factors; also, the London market is buoyed by the city\u2019s status as a global financial center.Largely as a result, a 1,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bath apartment in Mayfair that cost around $4 million in 2008 would cost $4.6 million today. (The Knightsbridge and Holland Park areas are also in the same price category.)In Paris and Barcelona, however, Americans can get better value today. In the case of the Spanish city, the distressed property market combined with the stronger dollar can yield extraordinary value.In Paris, buyers are still able to benefit from a downturn in prices after the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s election as president in 2012. In anticipation of higher taxes, some wealthy Parisians left France, which increased high-end inventory by 40 percent, according to Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lundgreen, director at Belles Demeures de France, a company that represents luxury real estate brokers in France.\u201cIt\u2019s a very good market now for Americans and dollar-based buyers,\u201d Ms. Lundgreen said, adding that inventory has already dropped 25 percent, partly because of increased American buying. \u201cIf the trend continues, it will be a sellers\u2019 market again.\u201dKathryn Brown of the Paris Property Group said American buyers had been coming on strong since September. \u201cThe official indicators are trailing what\u2019s going on here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually had a bidding war on a property. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened in recent memory.\u201dThe prices of prime property in central London flattened before Britain\u2019s general elections in May, but with the conservative victory, they have resumed climbing.\u201cWe expect prices to increase 2.5 percent in 2015 and 6 percent year on year for the next three years,\u201d said Giles Hannah, a senior vice president at Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in London. He said there had been a 22 percent increase in American buyers over last year.In Barcelona, inquiries from Americans have remained steady over the last year, but those that have resulted in sales have increased, according to Lucas Fox International Properties, a real estate agency with a focus on Spain\u2019s luxury market. \u201cPrices dropped 30 percent to 40 percent in late 2006 and only stopped dropping in the last quarter of 2014,\u201d said Alexander Vaughan, a partner in the firm. \u201cCombine that with the dollar, and it\u2019s crazy good value.\u201dMost American buyers in Europe are absentee owners much of the time, so a property\u2019s appeal to renters is crucial to make the most out of their investment.Lindsay Webster, a community volunteer in Spartanburg, S.C., said she spent a sabbatical year in Barcelona a decade ago with her family and fell in love with the city. Now she is looking to buy an apartment in the upscale neighborhood of Sarri\u00e0, near the city\u2019s American school, and rent it out to another American family on sabbatical.\u201cI need something sunny and attractive that will rent easily,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing is good because of the dollar, and my hope is to spend summers there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economic Growth for 3rd Quarter Revised Up to 2.1%", "Date": "2015-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy turned in a better performance last quarter than first thought, expanding at a 2.1 percent rate, the government said on Tuesday.Nearly all of the improvement was because of revised data on inventories, which showed businesses restocking shelves at a faster pace than the government first estimated. The improvement in inventory levels was offset by a slight downward revision in consumer spending last quarter.For all of 2015, the rate of economic growth is expected to be about 2.5 percent, not much different from the 2.4 percent rate in 2014.The tepid pace prompted Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, to call this the \u201ctortoise recovery\u201d in a recent note to clients. But that sobriquet does not mean the economy has been uniformly lackluster.\u201cWhile this expansion may go uncelebrated, growth in fact has been good enough to achieve a great deal of cumulative progress in the labor market,\u201d he added. \u201cWe now expect that the U.S. economy will reach full employment within the next 12 months \u2014 the \u2018tortoise recovery\u2019 looks to be approaching the finishing line.\u201dAs for the third quarter, the more refined inventory numbers provided a lift to growth, but they are likely to slow down reported economic activity in the current fourth quarter as manufacturers and retailers cut back on restocking of warehouses and backroom stores.\u201cThe inventory revision was even bigger than we expected,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.One mildly downbeat note on Tuesday was an unexpected drop in consumer sentiment this month, with the Conference Board reporting that its index for consumer confidence fell to 90.4 from 99.1 in October. Despite a strong advance in hiring last month, consumers expressed more caution about the job market and future economic conditions in the most recent survey.Consumer attitudes in the United States should rebound. \u201cU.S. consumers are cash-rich and increasingly secure in their jobs,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cConfidence won\u2019t remain at the soft November level.\u201dNothing in the latest data is expected to derail plans by Federal Reserve policy makers to raise their benchmark interest rate at their meeting next month. The Fed\u2019s key lever for influencing the economy has been stuck at close to zero since December 2008.With the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent in October and employers bolstering payrolls by 271,000, Fed officials are likely to conclude when they meet next month that the economy is strong enough to handle the first increase in interest rates in nearly a decade.Since the October jobs report, several Fed officials have signaled they see a rate increase coming very soon. On Saturday, the president of the San Francisco Fed, John Williams, echoed that view.\u201cThe data, I think, have been overall encouraging, especially on the labor market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that continues to happen, there\u2019s a strong case to be made in December to raise rates.\u201dIn a separate report on Tuesday, the release of the Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September showed a seasonally adjusted gain of 0.6 percent in home prices around the country, double the 0.3 percent increase economists were expecting and the biggest monthly gain since March.Of the 20 cities surveyed in the index, prices were up in 19 in September; the Detroit area was unchanged. On a yearly basis, home prices in 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index are up 5.5 percent.Some cities, especially tech hot spots, are posting even larger gains. Home prices in San Francisco are up 11.2 percent over the last 12 months, and Portland registered a 10.1 percent jump.Most economists expect the pace of interest rate increases by the Fed to be gradual and predict steady gains to continue for the housing market in the next 12 months, especially if the recent uptick in wages gathers strength and the stock market remains buoyant.As the unemployment rate has fallen, there are signs that wages are finally beginning to pick up as well. That should help overall economic growth next year, especially if consumers who did not see gains earlier in the recovery finally have more disposable income.While still relatively modest, the pace of growth last quarter was in some ways better than the numbers might suggest. Revised down to 3 percent from 3.2 percent in the initial estimate for the third quarter, consumer spending remained healthy, with an especially strong performance from the auto sector.Consumption during the current fourth quarter, including the holiday shopping season, is expected to increase at an annualized rate of about 3 percent. But the overall economic growth rate for the months of October, November and December is forecast by many analysts to be closer to the third-quarter figure.The final big economic clue before the Fed meets on Dec. 15 and 16 is scheduled for Friday, Dec. 4, when the Labor Department reports data on unemployment and hiring in November.On Tuesday, Barclays predicted November\u2019s data would show a healthy gain of 200,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent, breaking the 5 percent threshold that many economists consider close to full employment.\u201cAlthough a far weaker-than-expected outcome for this employment report could still cause the Fed to push rate hikes past year-end,\u201d Barclays said in a note to clients, \u201cwe view such a scenario as a low probability event.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Hires Expert in Self-Driving Cars From Apple", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeparately, the company has reached an agreement to largely complete its release of records sought by 47 American state attorneys general by year\u2019s end, people with knowledge of the investigations said. Investigators are examining violations of state law on two fronts for Volkswagen, which in September admitted to installing so-called defeat device software in 11 million diesel cars worldwide that was designed to detect when cars were in laboratory tests and cause the vehicles to lower their emissions of pollutants.While defeat devices are banned in the United States and Europe, the company said this week that it was still determining \u201cwhether the software in question officially constituted a defeat device\u201d under European Union regulations.Germany\u2019s motor vehicle regulatory agency said on Tuesday that it had ordered Volkswagen to retest 800,000 vehicles in Europe after the company admitted to making false claims about carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy.By hiring the former Apple executive Johann Jungwirth, 42, Volkswagen is signaling that the emissions crisis will not prevent the company from trying to keep pace with new developments in the industry. Mr. Jungwirth will lead a newly created Digitalization Strategy Department and report directly to Matthias M\u00fcller, the Volkswagen chief executive, the company said.At Apple, Mr. Jungwirth, a former executive at the German carmaker Daimler, was formally director of Mac systems engineering. But he is widely believed to have been a member of a team working on a secretive car project for Apple.The Apple car project has provoked nervousness among traditional automakers mindful of how the company upended the mobile phone market after it introduced the iPhone. Google has also been researching self-driving cars.Volkswagen is under severe financial pressure after admitting that it deceived regulators and customers for years about how much harmful emissions its vehicles produced. In addition to lost sales, Volkswagen faces billions of euros in costs to make vehicles compliant with regulations and to pay fines and legal judgments.Mr. Jungwirth, who was born in Romania, holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Cooperative State University in Stuttgart, Germany, Volkswagen said. He also studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Before joining Apple last year, Mr. Jungwirth was head of a research and development center in Sunnyvale, Calif., operated by Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler. The center\u2019s projects included research on self-driving vehicles and battery-powered cars.Last week, Volkswagen admitted to understating emissions of carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming, and overstating fuel economy for 800,000 vehicles in Europe. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, which regulates motor vehicles in Germany, said on Tuesday that it would supervise retesting of the vehicles and also investigate the process that led to the false emissions claims.The erroneous carbon dioxide claims came to light after Volkswagen\u2019s September admission that it had installed defeat devices designed to deceive regulators about nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines.The emissions-cheating investigations by 47 American states and the District of Columbia are being led by the attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington. The lead states issued a joint statement Monday evening after Volkswagen announced a plan to make payments of up to $1,000 to diesel owners in the United States, calling it \u201ca good-will gesture and nothing more.\u201d\u201cIt in no way diminishes the seriousness of the deceptive practices and environmental harms that are the subject of the states\u2019 investigation, or the determination of the attorneys general of 48 jurisdictions to hold Volkswagen to account for its conduct,\u201d the statement said.Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said Tuesday, \u201cWe are cooperating with all agencies, but are unable to comment on active or pending litigation.\u201dThe attorney general\u2019s office in California, which has stringent environmental laws, is conducting its own investigation, as are attorneys general in Texas and West Virginia.The Volkswagen case has little precedent, particularly because the company has already admitted wrongdoing. It is facing state civil investigations across the country, a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, a flurry of civil lawsuits and investigations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.VW is also facing other investigations across the world, from the state prosecutor\u2019s office in Germany to regulators in South Korea. Last month, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office raided Volkswagen\u2019s French offices and seized computers. Regulators in India recently said that several of the company\u2019s models did not meet its emissions standards.Jones Day, an American law firm, is also conducting an internal investigation on Volkswagen\u2019s behalf.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regulators Propose New Rules to Ease Strain of Bank Failures", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 A group of financial policy makers has outlined a new framework intended to keep banks around the world from becoming \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and requiring government bailouts in a future financial crisis.The proposed rules would require the world\u2019s biggest banks to maintain capital buffers that could absorb potential losses when a bank is failing and prevent further pressure on the financial system. Regulators are seeking to shift the costs of a failing bank to its investors, rather than on taxpayers in a future financial upheaval.The new recommendations were outlined on Monday by the Financial Stability Board, a Switzerland-based group of central bankers and financial regulators from the world\u2019s largest economies.\u201cBut these proposals will help change the system so that individual banks as well as their investors and creditors beat the costs of their own actions, and the consequences of the risks they take,\u201d he added.Under the new rules, lenders that have been deemed \u201csystematically important\u201d by regulators would be required by 2019 to maintain a capital buffer equal to 16 percent of their so-called risk-weighted assets in debt that can be used to cover losses in the future. By 2022, the threshold would be increased to 18 percent of assets weighted by risk.The proposals cover 30 of the world\u2019s biggest banks, including Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase.The Financial Stability Board estimated that those 30 banks would collectively need to raise as much as 1.1 trillion euros, or about $1.2 trillion, by 2022, depending on what debt was considered appropriate by regulators.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Classical Japanese Art Hangs On", "Date": "2015-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the financial crash that started in 2008, contemporary art has pretty much been the only game in town for well-off Westerners thinking about becoming collectors.Brand-name works from the past 60 years, instantly recognizable and giving off a sense of being in the cultural moment, have become the status symbol of choice for the investment-conscious art buyer.But as the money flows toward auctions, galleries and fairs like Art Basel Miami Beach (opening on Thursday), which specialize in those works, more traditional collecting areas have been neglected.Prices of once-coveted but now unfashionable objects like old master paintings or 18th-century French furniture have stagnated or even fallen.One notable example is the classical art of Japan\u2019s Edo period from 1615 to 1868, which is often cited as a revolutionary and seminal influence on the more recent Western art that is bringing new highs at auction.But what of Edo landmarks like the \u201cUkiyo-e\u201d (Pictures of the Floating World) wood block prints, which the art historians Hugh Honour and John Fleming have described as \u201cmore influential than photography\u201d on the development of Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and, by extension, modernism? Or the superbly concentrated netsuke carvings that were the subject of Edmund de Waal\u2019s 2010 best seller \u201cThe Hare With Amber Eyes\u201d? Or the 17th-century landscape screens that can make David Hockney\u2019s latest iPad paintings seem old-fashioned?The market in Japan for works by Edo masters like Hokusai, Hiroshige and Utamaro was profoundly affected by the so-called lost decade that followed the collapse of the country\u2019s asset bubble in 1990. At the same time in the West, contemporary art was gaining increasing market share, leaving fewer discerning collectors to buy Japanese prints.The current high prices at auction (not adjusted for inflation) for Hokusai and Hiroshige of $1.5 million and about $792,000 respectively were set way back in 2002. Demand became so moribund that Sotheby\u2019s closed its Japanese department in 2007.\u201cPrices have been depressed for some time,\u201d said Sebastian Izzard, a dealer in New York who specializes in Japanese prints. \u201cBut at least the market is solid, and there\u2019s no bubble. You get a lot more bang for your buck with Japanese art.\u201dMr. Izzard said that auction results were no longer an accurate barometer of the trade in prints. \u201cA lot of prints went back to Japan in the 1980s and ended up in museums,\u201d he said, which took many of them off the market.The few high-quality examples that do become available for sale in the West tend to be traded privately by specialist dealers. Mr. Izzard said that last year he sold a rare Hokusai print for about $1 million, but he would not divulge the subject.Nonetheless, museum-quality Japanese prints occasionally turn up at auction and can bring eye-catching prices. An exceptionally well-preserved print from 1794 of a female impersonator by Toshusai Sharaku sold for 275,000 euros with fees, about $290,000, at the Paris auctioneers Beaussant Lef\u00e8vre on Nov. 18. It carried a presale estimate of \u20ac30,000 to \u20ac40,000.Another factor that has kept a lid on the value of classical Japanese art, at least in the West, has been a preference for later, Meiji-period objects exported in shiploads to satisfy foreigners\u2019 taste for \u201cJaponisme.\u201dThe most recent manifestation is the heat in the market for works by the lacquer master Shibata Zeshin (1807-1891), who represented Japan at exhibitions in Philadelphia in 1876 and Paris in 1878. In November 2014, a Zeshin panel showing a farmhouse in the snow at Sano sold for 842,500 pounds, about $1.3 million \u2014 an astounding 10 times its estimate \u2014 at Bonhams\u2019 sale of lacquer and paintings from the Misumi Collection.Zeshin\u2019s virtuosic black lacquer wares in the \u201ciki,\u201d or Edo chic, style are frowned on by some Japanese connoisseurs, but they are a personal favorite of ultra-wealthy international collectors like David Khalili and members of Qatar\u2019s royal family.\u201cSince the 1980s, people have focused on the Meiji art the Japanese made to appease the Westerners,\u201d said Gregg Baker, a dealer in London. \u201cBecause the auction houses have been able to get Meiji, they\u2019ve pushed Meiji. But that isn\u2019t real Japanese art.\u201dMr. Baker, whose gallery specializes in early Buddhist art and 17th- and 18th-century painted screens, with the latter priced at \u00a315,000 to \u00a350,000, has fond memories of the 1981-1982 blockbuster at the Royal Academy of Arts, \u201cThe Great Japan Exhibition,\u201d devoted to classical art of the Edo Period.Despite a relative lack of both supply and demand for classical Japanese art, there have been a few recent attention-grabbing prices at auction. In 2011, a late 18th-century ivory netsuke of a \u201cshishi\u201d (a Chinese guardian lion-dog) sold for a category-high \u00a3265,500 at Bonhams in London, and in May, Christies sold a 17th-century six-panel screen of the arrival of a Portuguese trading ship for \u00a3818,500, also an auction high for the category.But these pale compared with the eight- and even nine-figure prices paid in recent years for 20th- and 21st-century Western art and imperial Chinese porcelain.\u201cThere are areas of the Japanese market that have remained stable, but there hasn\u2019t been the influx of money from East Asia we\u2019ve seen in the Chinese market,\u201d said Jonathan Stone, Christie\u2019s international business director of Asian art. \u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been a new generation of buyers in Japan to create this kind of exponential growth.\u201dGiven the systemic thinness of Japan\u2019s collector base, then, the country\u2019s historic art is likely to remain a niche market. Whether it represents a better long-term investment than Chinese art or Western contemporary art is open to question.So maybe the thing to do is simply buy it and enjoy it. Japanese wood block prints, being flat and made in colorful multiples, are particularly suitable for web commerce.These unnumbered prints were produced by the tens of thousands, and examples offered at this level will be less than perfect.But they nonetheless represent an entry-level opportunity to own and enjoy one of the great moments in art for less than half the price of a Damien Hirst butterfly print. Just don\u2019t worry about return on investment.Buy simply to enjoy? Maybe Japan is still giving something revolutionary to the art world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Creditors Signal Potential Support for Overhauling Puerto Rico Debt", "Date": "2015-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of Puerto Rico\u2019s most influential creditors are for the first time signaling support for the broad outline of a government proposal to overhaul the island\u2019s crushing debts.The San Juan government, squeezed by $72 billion in debt and a stagnant local economy, has been weighing whether to keep paying bondholders or defaulting, a move that could trigger dozens of lawsuits by creditors and drag out Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal problems for years. A $354 million payment is due on Dec. 1.Seeking to avoid protracted legal skirmishes, Puerto Rico officials have been trying to engage various creditors in deals that would avert default.In meetings with advisers to creditor groups on Friday, the government\u2019s chief adviser, Jim Millstein, presented a proposal to exchange the island\u2019s existing bonds for new debt that would be less burdensome to Puerto Rico.The proposal \u2014 at least in theory \u2014 was met favorably by holders of billions of dollars of general obligation bonds, according to people with direct knowledge of the group\u2019s position who were not authorized to speak publicly. However, the government still needs to win over many other creditors, making a deal far from certain.General obligation bonds carry a guarantee in the Puerto Rico constitution stipulating that debt must be repaid before just about any other expense. Given that guarantee, general obligation holders have been expected to be among the creditors least likely to agree to a restructuring that might reduce the value of their bonds.But over the weekend, a group of about half a dozen hedge funds and other investment firms that own general obligation bonds signaled support for the concept of the government\u2019s debt exchange, these people said. Among that group are Monarch Alternative Capital, Fundamental Credit Opportunities and Autonomy Capital.Leading up to Friday\u2019s meeting, hedge fund managers had complained privately that Puerto Rico officials have been talking tough about a possible default, while not doing enough to cut government spending.One of the people briefed on the hedge funds\u2019 position said the group collectively felt the proposed debt exchange was a \u201ca constructive first step toward forging a solution.\u201d This person said that the two sides had not started to discuss many of the financial details of the exchange.But broadly speaking, the exchange would involve rolling up most of the island\u2019s current debt and restructuring it into a new \u201csuperbond,\u201d according to people briefed on the plan. As part of that new bond, general obligation holders would have the first claim on government revenues, giving them the highest priority in the superbond structure. Holders of other forms of the government\u2019s debt would have lower priority. It is not clear whether bondholders, in return, would be asked to buy into the superbond at a discount, rendering their investments less valuable than their current holdings.The commonwealth does not have access to the federal bankruptcy courts to restructure its debts, forcing the government and creditors to work out a deal outside court.Republican leaders in Congress have expressed reservations about giving Puerto Rico or its public entities access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections, while some Democrats have publicly supported the idea, with Obama administration officials warning that the island faces a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d in the coming months.The person briefed on the hedge funds\u2019 position said that leaders of both parties in Washington should take note of Friday\u2019s discussions as the start of a \u201cprivate sector solution\u201d to the debt crisis. The hedge funds hope that Washington will avoid taking any measures that might undermine that process.For months, Puerto Rico has failed to persuade Congress to pass legislation that would give the island\u2019s public corporations, like its sewer and water authorities, access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Some officials have said that would address only a portion of the debt problems, though.A crucial test comes on Dec. 1, when the island\u2019s Government Development Bank must make the $354 million debt payment. This month, analysts at Moody\u2019s Investors Service predicted that the government would skip some of those payments because of the worsening liquidity situation.Officials have stayed publicly vague about whether they intend to make the Dec. 1 payment. In an interview last week, Melba Acosta, the president of the Government Development Bank, said the government had yet to make up its mind on whether to make the debt payment next month or another large payment coming due in January.In some circles, advisers have been pushing for Gov.

Short-termism is exactly what it sounds like: companies managed for the short term, with decisions driven by the need to meet shareholder expectations about quarterly earnings and stock prices.This year it has spilled into the presidential campaign, with Hillary Rodham Clinton recently decrying \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d and proposing some changes in the tax code to encourage more long-term investments by companies and individuals. She and others have criticized practices that put a priority on share buybacks and dividend payments over sources of long-term growth like wage increases, investment in research and employee development.This strategy, Mr. Sonnenfeld added, destroys brand value and causes companies to sell valuable assets \u201cat fire sale prices during cyclical economic downturns.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld and other academics, as well as legal and financial experts, have repeatedly warned of the perils of short-term management. So why does it persist?Kevin Laverty, a retired associate professor of business strategy at University of Washington in Bothell, wrote one of the first academic research papers to use the phrase \u201cshort-termism\u201d and examine the phenomenon. The paper was published in 1996, but Mr. Laverty began researching it in 1991. \u201cWall Street was asking the same questions back then,\u201d he said.In the 1980s, many companies expressed concern that stock market pressure for short-term profits and the threat of hostile takeovers were forcing them to abandon long-term projects. Many observers at the time blamed what they called management \u201cmyopia\u201d\u2014 decisions that enable companies to pursue short\u2010term gains at the expense of long-term strategies \u2014 for managerial incentives based on quarterly profits and stock prices. Mr. Laverty said the debate continued because there had not been any agreement on whether short-termism was a problem. \u201cI think it goes back to human nature,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do people seek immediate gratification rather than looking to the long term?\u201dWhat do we do about short-termism then, if it is a problem?Mr. Pozen of M.I.T. said the corporate world needs to rethink how it compensates executives, specifically the period of time against which performance bonuses are given. \u201cIf you look at most companies, it\u2019s one year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you pay people based on one year\u2019s compensation, they will manage for a one-year horizon.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said what was needed were \u201cboards with stronger backbones\u201d against activist hedge funds. He again pointed to DuPont. \u201cEven though they had just won a proxy battle the board panicked, all because of a highly vocal activist investor,\u201d he said.Mr. Pozen recalled many institutional investors complaining at an investment conference in March about being long-term investors in a world of short-term returns. \u201cThese people own 60 to 70 percent of the stock in most public companies. They ought to be able to get those companies to be long-term oriented,\u201d he said. Activist investors, Mr. Pozen pointed out, cannot win proxy fights without the support of institutional investors. Institutional investors talk the talk, he said, \u201cbut they need to walk the walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript: G.O.P. Presidential Undercard Featuring Jindal and Huckabee", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing is a transcript of the undercard Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.(MUSIC)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Good evening, and welcome to the historic Milwaukee Theater. Tonight, you\u2019ll hear from 12 Republican candidates vying to become the next President of the United States. I\u2019m Trish Regan, along with my co-moderators, Sandra Smith, and from the Wall Street Journal, Jerry Seib.SEIB: This evening Fox Business is partnering with the Wall Street Journal to bring you the fourth republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. For the next hour, four of the candidates will be here answering the question voters want answered.REGAN: Let\u2019s introduce them. New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)REGAN: Former Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)REGAN: Former Pennsylvania Senator, Rick Santorum.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: And, Louisiana Governor, Bobby Jindal.(APPLAUSE)JINDAL: ...Thank you.SMITH: Alright, this debate will last one hour. Each candidate will have up to 90 seconds to respond to each question. One minute for each follow up. When your time is up, you\u2019re going to hear this bell.(BELL SOUND)SMITH: Alright, that\u2019s it, so let\u2019s begin with Governor Christie. Governor, economically, our country is struggling with some of the anemic (ph) growth we have seen on record. More than 90 million Americans are unemployed, or they are not in the workforce altogether.The number of people now willing, able, and wanting to go to work is at a level that has fallen to a level we have not been since the 1970\u2019s. For those that are working, wages aren\u2019t budging while other things, costs, like housing, remain high.As President, what concrete steps will you take to get America back to work.CHRISTIE: Well, first I want to share a story with you that relates to your question. I was in New Hampshire last week, and a woman approached me after the town hall meeting and she said to me, \u201cGovernor, I\u2019m really concerned.\u201dI said, \u201cWhat are your concerns?\u201dAnd, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t quite how to describe it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, every month when my bills come in, I feel this awful anxiety in the pit of my stomach that I\u2019m not going to have enough to pay them that month.\u201dThere are tens of millions of Americans living that way after the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II. And, let\u2019s be clear, if we do not change course, if we follow the President\u2019s lead, and that\u2019s exactly what Secretary Clinton will do, we\u2019re going to be in the same circumstance \u2014 with government picking the winners and losers.So, let me be clear about what we\u2019ll do. First, Make the tax code fairer, flatter, and simplier. Get rid of all the special interest deductions. You know, the American people feel like the tax code is rigged for the rich, and you know why they feel that way? Because it is.We\u2019ll get rid of all those special interest deductions except for the home mortgage interest deduction, and the charitable contribution deduction. Everyone will get lower rates, keep more of their own money, be able to file their tax returns in 15 minutes, and, by the way, the good thing, I\u2019ll be able to fire a whole bunch of IRS agents once we do that.(APPLAUSE)And, in addition, we need to get the government off of our backs. Dodd-Frank, all the different regulations, 81,000 pages of new regulation by this administration just last year \u2014 it is suffocating small business, it is suffocating the folks who are trying to make a living. I will do what I did in New Jersey...(BELL RINGING)...lift if off their backs.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you. Governor Huckabee, we\u2019re here Wisconsin, a state that has seen the biggest decline in middle-class households of any American state. With more than 120,000 manufacturing jobs being lost in the last 15 years. As we move away from a manufacturing economy to a services based, technological economy, how are you going to help the millions of Americans that are stuck in this transition? HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, Trish, I don\u2019t know why we have to move away from manufacturing. The only reason we have is because...(APPLAUSE)...we have a tax code that has punished manufacturing. I hear a lot of people talk about the plans to simplify the tax code. I\u2019ve got one better than any of the simplifications, it\u2019s called a, \u201cFair Tax\u201d, and it eliminates all of the taxes on our productivity.Here\u2019s what would happen. We\u2019d get rid of taxes on people\u2019s work, so, we wouldn\u2019t punish people for working anymore. Yeah, we\u2019ve lost five million manufacturing jobs just since the year 2000 \u2014 160,000 manufacturing plants have close in this country, which means a lot of people \u2014 that the governors talking about, he\u2019s exactly right. They don\u2019t have jobs anymore.HUCKABEE: And the reason they don\u2019t have jobs is because their jobs are in Mexico, they\u2019re in China, they\u2019re in Indonesia.Bring the jobs back. And with the fair tax, you do that, because you don\u2019t tax capital and labor and you bring a real sense of equity to the opportunity so that people will not only make it easier to function, they\u2019ll get the manufacturing jobs back.And here\u2019s the best part. We don\u2019t reduce the IRS, we get rid of the IRS. We completely eliminate them...(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: \u2014 because the government has no business knowing how much money we make and how we made it. It\u2019s none of their business. And that\u2019s why I believe that manufacturing is critical. If we can\u2019t feed ourselves, fuel ourselves and fight for ourselves, we can\u2019t be free.And by the way, fighting for ourselves means manufacturing our own weapons of self-defense.REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Senator Santorum, you\u2019re all obviously highly critical of President Obama\u2019s economic record. But federal statistics show that payrolls have expanded by 8.7 million new jobs so far during his time in office. All the jobs lost in the recession were recovered by last year. And in October, the economy added jobs at the fastest rate since 2009.So what\u2019s wrong with the Obama jobs record?SANTORUM: The middle of America is hollowing out. All you have to do is listen to the last Democratic debate and you would think there was a Republican president in office the way they complained about how bad things are in America and how the middle \u2014 the middle of America is hollowing out.I agree with Mike Huckabee. I spent this morning in Chicago at Fabtech, which is a sheet manufac \u2014 a sheet metal fabricators conference. Thousands of people there explained the latest and newest technologies.You know what I was told?I was told when I went to booth after booth that there are 250,000 welder jobs open in America \u2014 250,000 welder jobs paying anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 a year, and if you want to weld pipe on a, you know, for oil and gas pipelines, you can make $100,000 a year.Every manufacturer \u2014 I go to one every single week. In fact, I have with me in the \u2014 in the crowd here today a gentleman who is a supporter of mine from Rockwall, Texas, Ed Grand-Lienard. He runs Special Products.And he tells me he has jobs open in every skill that he \u2014 he \u2014 he could possibly hire for in Rockwall, Texas, but he can\u2019t find people.So the issue is, yes, we need a tax code. I \u2014 I propose a 20 percent flat tax \u2014 20 percent on corporations, 20 percent on \u2014 on individuals, full expensing, which will be powerful for manufacturing, a 0 percent rate, initially, for manufacturers.We\u2019re going to have a very powerful tax code. We\u2019re going to do something about regulation. We\u2019re going to suspected every single ObamaCare regu \u2014 Obama regulation that cost over $100,000 to the economy.But we have to start doing something about training and employing people who are sitting on the sidelines because they don\u2019t see a path. And we have a \u2014 a bureaucracy in Washington and a president in Washington \u2014 and even among Republicans who think everybody has to go to college. People need to go to work and we need to provide...(BUZZER NOISE)SANTORUM: \u2014 opportunities for them to go to work out of high school.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: All right, Governor Jindal, you have pushed Louisiana\u2019s energy resources as a means to grow jobs in your state. But as oil prices have plunged in recent months, so has jobs growth.Louisiana now has an unemployment rate above the national average.Will your energy-focused jobs plan for the country be subject to the same market ups and downs?JINDAL: A couple of things.In Louisiana, we\u2019re actually a top 10 state for job growth. As we sit here today, we have more people working in Louisiana than ever before, earning a higher income than ever before. We\u2019ve had 60 months in a row of consecutive job growth in our state. So the reality is, we have diversified our economy. Yes, I\u2019ve got an interview plan that says all of the above, that creates good manufacturing jobs in America. We\u2019ve also got one of the fastest growing IT sectors by percentage. We are growing Louisiana\u2019s economy.But let me get to the point that is, I think, the most important issue here tonight. You\u2019re going to have several hours of debate on the economy and we\u2019re going to have a great discussion about energy plans and tax rates. And that\u2019s all great.The most important thing we have to do, we have a fundamental choice to make, folks.Are we willing to cut the government economy so we can grow the American economy?That is the most fundamental question we\u2019ve got to answer.We are on the path to socialism right now.(APPLAUSE)JINDAL: These are mutually exclusive. The hour is late, but it is not too late for America.Though under President Obama, you asked about his economy. We\u2019ve got record dependents, a record number of Americans on food stamps, record low participation rate in the work force.This is a fundamental choice. Sending a big government Republican to DC is not enough to fix this problem. It\u2019s not enough just to beat Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve got to change the direction of our country.What that means is let\u2019s shrink the government, not slow its growth rate, but actually shrink the government so we can grow the American economy. That is the fundamental issue we should be debating here tonight.REGAN: All right, Governor Jindal, thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Christie, you have said that the Democrats\u2019 message is one of, quote, \u201cfree stuff.\u201d In contrast, Republicans want to reduce spending. How do you win a national election when the Democrats are offering free health care, a free or subsidized college education, and you\u2019re the party that is seemingly offering nothing in the way of immediate tangible benefits?CHRISTIE: Yes, sure.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: If anybody believes the stuff they heard from that Democratic debate a few weeks ago, there\u2019s nothing for free. What they forgot to tell was that they\u2019re going to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent in order to provide all of that stuff.But let me ask the folks at home one very simple question, do you want to give Washington more control over your life? Do you think they\u2019re doing such a great job that now let\u2019s have them control what our corporations pay their employees? Let\u2019s have them control every aspect of our economy?Is Washington doing that good a job for you right now? And the fact is that if you listen to Hillary Clinton, she has made it very clear, she believes that she can make decisions for you better than you can make them for yourself.She believes that Washington, D.C., should pick the winners and losers in our economy, and in our life. And here\u2019s what I believe as a Republican, I believe the greatness of America is not in its government.The greatness of America is in the American people. And what we need to do is get the government the hell out of the way and let the American people win once again.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, a single mom with no job and two kids in New Hampshire, home of the first in the nation primary, is eligible for more than $30,000 a year in benefits. Even if she could find a job, she would need to find child care. And in many cases may conclude it\u2019s better for her to live off government benefits.Senator, how do you help and incentivize her to go to work? And if you\u2019re the one that\u2019s going to cut her benefits, why should she vote for you?SANTORUM: Well, the answer is first that we need to do something about a tax code that doesn\u2019t penalize. One thing that I\u2019m excited about our tax code, proposed changes, is it\u2019s very pro-family.You have a $2,700 tax credit, period, for every person in that family, so that family, you know, would have about an $8,000 tax credit, which would be refundable. So every dollar she works, she\u2019s still only losing 20 cents.The problem with the tax code today, because of all the different provisions, you\u2019re right, you go back to work, you lose welfare benefits, you\u2019re losing money. Throw on top of that the \u2014 even a bigger problem, over 50 percent of children being raised in a home today of a single mom are raised in a home where the father is born \u2014 father is (sic) living at the child \u2014 the time the child is born.Now what does that mean? That means we have incentivized people not to marry. We\u2019ve incentivized people to cohabitate instead of not marry, why? Because mom will lose welfare benefits if she marries father.It\u2019s not just mom going back to work, but it\u2019s mother and father marrying to form a more stable family for that child to be raised in a two-parent family.So we\u2019ve got all sorts of really corrupt incentives that were put in place, well meaning by the left. But we need to remove those. We need to remove those incentives. We need to adopt a tax code that says we\u2019re going to be pro-family and pro-work. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Thank you, Senator.Governor Huckabee, you have characterized entitlement reform as both political and economic suicide. Taxpayers currently spend more than $600 billion per year on social welfare programs, with the intended goal of getting people back on their feet and working again.Today a record number of Americans aren\u2019t even looking for work. Are our social welfare programs, while well-intended, creating a culture of dependency? If so, how will you fix it?HUCKABEE: Well, Sandra, first of all, let me mention the fact that I think there\u2019s a big difference between welfare programs and what some people call entitlements. Namely, Social Security and Medicare.I just want to remind everybody out there who has ever had a paycheck, the government didn\u2019t ask you if you wanted them to take money out of your check for Social Security and Medicare. They did that involuntarily.Those are not entitlements and that\u2019s not welfare. That\u2019s an earned benefit. And by gosh, you paid for it. And if the government screwed it up, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay the penalty because of an incompetent government.That\u2019s different than the social programs that we\u2019ve spent $2 trillion on since the War on Poverty began exactly 50 years ago this year.HUCKABEE: Now the reason we still have so much poverty is because it was never designed to get people out of poverty. It was designed to make sure that there was an industry of poverty, so that the people in the poverty industry would have a lot of jobs. But the people who are poor haven\u2019t been benefited. Having grown up poor, I know a little something about it. Nobody who is poor wants to be. That\u2019s a nonsense statement and I hear it all the time. Well, poor people ought to work harder. They\u2019re working as hard as they can, for gosh sake.But the problem is the system keeps pushing them down because, if they work, then they get punished. They lose all the benefits. When we did welfare reform in the \u201990s, you know what we did? We said you\u2019re not going to lose everything at once. There\u2019s not an arbitrary threshold. So as you move up the ladder from work and training, you\u2019ll actually always be better off than you were before. That\u2019s the American way.SMITH: Thank you, Governor.SEIB: Governor Jindal, Republicans have now 32 of the nation\u2019s 50 governor seats. But, even while you\u2019re doing very well at the state level, you keep falling short nationally. You\u2019ve lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. Are Democrats simply putting forward a better national economic message than the one Republicans are offering? And what should Republicans do about it.JINDAL: No, I think right now there\u2019s not much difference between the two parties. The reason we keep losing nationally is we try to be cheaper versions of the Democratic party. What if the Republicans, what if Republicans actually embraced our own principles? So I earlier said if you want bigger paychecks, you want more jobs, you want less government dependence, you\u2019re going to have to cut government spending. Here\u2019s the dirty little secret.You\u2019re going to hear a lot of Republicans tonight in this debate and the next one talk about cutting government spending. It\u2019s going to sound great. There\u2019s only one of us that\u2019s actually cut government spending. Not two, there\u2019s one, and you\u2019re looking at him. We\u2019ve got four senators running. They\u2019ve never cut anything in D.C. They give these long speeches called filibusters, they pat themselves on the back, nothing changes. When they go to relieve themselves their cause and the toilet get flushed at the same time, and the American people lose. We\u2019ve got a bunch of governors running, we\u2019ve got seven current former governors running. I\u2019m the only one that has cut government spending. Everybody else can talk about it. If they haven\u2019t done it in their state capitals, what makes them thank that \u2014 what makes us think they\u2019ll do it if we send them to D.C. Look, when politicians talk, we need to look at what they have done, not what they have said. Otherwise, it\u2019s a bunch of hot air. We\u2019ve cut our budget 26 percent. Record number of Louisianans working.If Republicans want to win national elections, let\u2019s be conservatives, let\u2019s be Republicans, let\u2019s not be a second version of the liberal party, let\u2019s cut government spending and grow the American economy.SMITH: Do you have something to add, Governor?HUCKABEE: Well, I\u2019d just like to respond, with all due respect to, to the Governor, to the state just south of me, I would say that a lot of us have cut things. And during the recession of 2001 to 2003, when 91 percent of our state budget was basically three things, educate, medicate and incarcerate, we ended up cutting 11 percent out of the state budget through that recession so we didn\u2019t have to go in and raise a bunch of taxes, and there were people who thought we should.So it\u2019s just not accurate to say that nobody else up here has ever cut. I believe every governor has probably had to make tough decisions. I\u2019m, I\u2019m guessing my colleague Governor Christie has, as I\u2019m tossing him the ball like Arkansas did to Ol\u2019 Miss the other day.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why don\u2019t, why don\u2019t we...JINDAL: Wait, wait, wait. I want to respond. He has criticized something I said. I want to respond to that. Mike, with all due respect, I admire your social views, I share many of those views, your record as Governor tells a different story. Was \u2014 your time as Governor spending in Arkansas went up 65 percent, number of state workers went up 20 percent, the taxes for the average citizen went up 47 percent. That\u2019s not a record of cutting. I\u2019m saying we\u2019ve actually cut. We reduced the size of our budget. So wanting to cut is one thing, actually cutting is a different thing. Facts don\u2019t lie.SMITH: All right. Let\u2019s, let\u2019s bring Governor Christie in next.HUCKABEE: Sandra, before we get too far away, he specifically brought out some things about the record that I need to correct.SMITH: All right. Well, let\u2019s get the \u2014 let\u2019s keep the conversation going. Let\u2019s bring Governor Christie in here because we\u2019re talking about national debt, climbing toward $19 trillion, Governor. Our federal government employed nearly three million workers, our tax code is more than 74,000 pages long. If you\u2019re elected President, Governor Christie, what concrete steps would you take to reduce the size of the federal government?CHRISTIE: First off, let me, let me just say this in response to this back and forth. For the people who are out there right now, I want to guarantee you one thing real clearly. If you think that Mike Huckabee won\u2019t be the kind of President who will cut back spending, or Chris Christie, or John Kasich, wait \u2019til you see what Hillary Clinton will do to this country and how she will drown us in debt. She is the real adversary tonight and we\u2019d better stay focused as Republicans on her.Now I\u2019ve forward, I put forward an entitlement reform plan.CHRISTIE: We spend 71 cents of every dollar in America on entitlements and debt service, and if \u2014 you know, Willy Sutton used to say, when they asked him why he robbed banks, he said that\u2019s \u2018cause that\u2019s where the money is, OK?And where the money is in the federal government are these entitlement programs and debt service.What I\u2019ve said is we need to get a hold of that. We cannot continue to go down the $19 trillion in debt.So our plan will save over $1 trillion over the next 10 years and make sure that Social Security and Medicare are there for those who truly need it and also make sure that we have money to be able to reduce taxes and spend on the things we need to spend.I will also, on my first day as \u2014 as president, sign a executive order that says no more regulation for the next 120 days by any government agency or department. We are drowning in regulations. Stop and then we\u2019ll go out there and we\u2019ll cut and reduce regulation that small business owners across this country want us to do.You\u2019ll grow the economy then. More money will come into the system and we\u2019ll get more closer to balance.But the bottom line is, believe me, Hillary Clinton\u2019s coming for your wallet, everybody. Don\u2019t worry about Huckabee or Jindal, worry about her.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Christie, thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: All right, we are just getting started.REGAN: Medicare, Social Security and the future of ObamaCare \u2014 that is all straight ahead, live from Milwaukee and the Republican presidential debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(MUSIC)(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Welcome back to the Milwaukee Theater, and the Republican Presidential Debate. On to the next round of questions, Gerry has the next question.SEIB: Senator Santorum, we\u2019re in the Upper-Midwest, heart of the American auto industry. The Auto Alliance says the state of Wisconsin, where we are tonight, is home to 176 auto supplier companies. Back in 2008, you opposed the use of federal bailout funds for automakers as proposed then by the Bush administration. The automakers survived. In retrospect, do you still think that was the right position.SANTORUM: Absolutely. I\u2019m a capitalist, not a corporatist. I\u2019m not someone who believes we should be bailing out corporations whether their auto industries, or banks.(APPLAUSE)And, it is simply a matter that there\u2019s auto industry \u2014 the auto industry would have survived, it would have survived through a bankruptcy process of \u2014 instead of Washington picking a winner and a loser. And, in this case, the losers are the bondholders, and the winners were the unions. That\u2019s fine. They did it, the unions \u2014 the unions survived. We \u2014 we have not survived in continuing to grow manufacturing jobs. We have a \u2014 we have a president, and an economy right now, that is killing \u2014 choking our ability to be able to compete.I\u2019m one of the few people up here who actually believes that we need a level playing field when it comes to manufacturing. That means a good tax code, a good regulatory environment, low energy prices, better opportunities for workers to get training, and, also, I\u2019m \u2014 a supporter of the EXIM bank. Everybody else on this stage, everybody else, I think, in the entire field, is opposed to it.Why can you \u2014 how can you come out and say I\u2019m for manufacturing when a majority of republican congressmen and senators supported the EXIM bank because it means jobs for American workers here in America. The fact is that we\u2019ve seen already G.E. lose jobs here in America, and just move those jobs to France and Hungary. We have a right as a country to compete with other countries that have export financing.Every major manufacturer, 60 countries, competes against America, wants to take our jobs, and we have every Republican candidate \u2014 you want to talk about communicating to workers here in Wisconsin?(BELL RINGS)Ask them why we\u2019re tying one hand behind our back and saying go out and compete.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Thank you, Senator Santorum.REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you differ from many of your GOP opponents on the stage tonight over accepting Syrian refugees into this country. You have said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have an obligation to just open our doors.\u201dAs the Islamic state continues to expand, slaughtering and crucifying Christians, including women and children, refugees continue to flee their land by the thousands. Should America open its doors to accept any refugees in this country? If so, how many?HUCKABEE: Sandra, I\u2019ve been concerned that this administration has not done anything to help stop the slaughter of Christians. We didn\u2019t help the Kurds, we said we would. But, the idea that we\u2019re just going to open our doors, and we have no idea who these people are \u2014 what we do know is that only one out of five of the so called, \u201cSyrian Refugees\u201d, who went into Europe were actually Syrian. Many of them, we had no idea who they were. They weren\u2019t Syrian.Are we going to open the doors so that the ISIS people will come on in, and we\u2019ll give them a place to say, and a good sandwich, and medical benefits? My gosh, we have $19 trillion dollars in debt, we can\u2019t even afford to take care of Americans.So...(APPLAUSE)...If we\u2019re going to do something for the Syrians...(APPLAUSE)...let\u2019s find out who they really are, and the ones that are really in danger, let\u2019s help build an encampment for them, but closer to where they live, rather than bringing them here when they don\u2019t know the language, the culture \u2014 and, frankly, if we\u2019ve got as many homeless people as we have, I\u2019m not sure this makes any sense.So, let\u2019s do it where we can best help them. Send them some food. But, let\u2019s ask the Saudi\u2019s to step up. I\u2019m really tired of Americans being the only ones asked to do all the heavy lifting when it comes to charity, and, quite frankly, my number one concern right now is taking care of the fact that Americans are taking it in the gut without jobs. Many of them working two and three part time jobs. And, if America wants to do something great, let\u2019s get our economy growing again, stabilize the dollar, and we\u2019ll be in a much better position to help people around the world.REGAN: Alright, Governor Huckabee, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Christie, China is stealing our technology. China is pirating our intellectual property, and China\u2019s hacking into our computers, spying on American corporations, and spying on our citizens. China also slaps tariffs on U.S. goods, making it harder for us to sell our products. How are you going to stop them?CHRISTIE: Well, let\u2019s start with this, remember why we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re in with China, because an absolutely weak and feckless foreign policy that was engineered by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re in...(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 because (INAUDIBLE) the Chinese...(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 the Chinese don\u2019t take us seriously and why should they?Why should they?They hacked into the American government\u2019s personnel file and took millions of records in cyberwarfare against this country. I\u2019m one of the victims of that hack. They took my Social Security number, my fingerprints as a former United States attorney that was on file in there.And what has this president done?Not one thing.Let me be really clear about what I would do.If the Chinese commit cyberwarfare against us, they are going to see cyberwarfare like they have never seen before. And that is a closed society in China...(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 where they\u2019re hiding information from their own people. The information we take, we\u2019ll make sure all the Chinese people see it. Then they\u2019ll have some real fun in Beijing when we start showing them how they\u2019re spending their money in China.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: And one last thing.One last thing. I will tell you this, they\u2019re building those artificial islands in the South China Sea and the president won\u2019t \u2014 up until recently, wouldn\u2019t sail a ship within 12 miles or fly a plane over it. I\u2019ll tell you this, the first thing I\u2019ll do with the Chinese is I\u2019ll throw \u2014 I\u2019ll fly Air Force One over those islands. They\u2019ll know we mean business.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Governor Jindal, there\u2019s a new trade deal the Obama administration has completed with 11 other Pacific nations. The U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office says that deal will cut 18,000 different tariffs on American goods sent to the Pacific and will cut tariffs on goods made in your state of Louisiana by as much as 40 percent.Even a skeptical about \u2014 a skeptic about this deal, now that the details are public, are you going to be for it?JINDAL: I was absolutely a skeptic of giving this president more power. He negotiated a bad deal with Iran. He breaks the law routinely. I don\u2019t know why Congress would want to concede more authority to him.Look, this trade deal is 6,000 pages long. Unlike ObamaCare, I think we should read it before we decide whether we would vote for it or not vote for it.(APPLAUSE)JINDAL: I am for trade deals, but I want to make sure they are fair trade deals.I want to come back to something that Chris had said earlier. Look, I absolutely agree we\u2019ve got to beat Hillary Clinton. But just sending any Republican is not good enough. We\u2019ve had a Republican majority in the Senate and the House.What has changed?If we send another big government Republican to the White House, we will not do enough to fix what is wrong in this country.Chris, I think records matter. I think the way we govern matter.Under your leadership in New Jersey, your budget has gone up 15 percent. It\u2019s gone down 26 percent in Louisiana.It has gone up $5 million in New Jersey. It\u2019s gone down $9 billion in Louisiana. In New Jersey, you\u2019ve had nine credit downgrades, setting a record. We\u2019ve had eight credit upgrades in Louisiana.My point is this. If politicians say they\u2019re going to be conservative, they say they\u2019re going to cut spending but they don\u2019t do it, why should we send them to DC?It gets harder, not easier, when we send them to DC. Let\u2019s not be a second liberal party. Let\u2019s actually cut government spending. Let\u2019s grow the American economy. Let\u2019s not just beat Hillary, let\u2019s elect a conservative to the White House, not just any Republican. SEIB: Governor Christie?(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: I\u2019ll tell you, Gerry, it\u2019s interesting, if you go to New Jersey, they\u2019ll call me lots of different things. A liberal is not one of them. Um, and...(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: \u2014 I would say this. I have great respect for Bobby\u2019s record in Louisiana. I think he\u2019s been a wonderful governor and I think he\u2019s provided outstanding leadership for that state and I respect him for what he\u2019s done.And I think that all of us deserve that same level of respect.And my point is this. You know, the differences between me and Bobby Jindal, we can talk about those, and obviously, Bobby wants to spent a lot of time tonight talking about that.I\u2019ll tell you what I want to talk about. I want to talk about what\u2019s going to happen to this country if we have another four years of Barack Obama\u2019s policies.And by the way, it will be even worse, because Hillary Clinton is running so far to the left to treaty to catch up to her socialist opponent, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s hard to even see her anymore.The fact is \u2014 the fact is that we\u2019d better be focused on it. And I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll bring to the table, the fact that I\u2019ve won in a blue state, that I\u2019ve won in a state that has 750,000 more Democrats than Republicans...(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 that I won in a state for reelection after governing as a pro-life conservative...(BUZZER NOISE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 and got 61 percent of the vote. That\u2019s the person you want on the stage prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)JINDAL: But wait a minute, records matter.(APPLAUSE)JINDAL: Records \u2014 records matter. Yes, we\u2019ve got to...CHRISTIE: I don\u2019t...JINDAL: \u2014 beat Hillary Clinton. But Chris, it\u2019s also true that you expanded food stamps at a time that we\u2019ve got record numbers of Americans on food stamps. It\u2019s also true you caved into ObamaCare. You expanded Medicaid.We\u2019ve got a choice in front of us. This is an important debate. This is not about comparing Louisiana to New Jersey or Bobby to Chris. This is an important debate for the American people.This is supposed to be an economics debate. Let\u2019s have a debate.Do we want to grow government or do we want to grow the American economy?JINDAL: Do we want to grow dependence on government, or do we want to grow good paying jobs in the private sector...SMITH: ...Alright...JINDAL: ...you don\u2019t grow the economy by putting more people on food stamps, more people in Medicaid, you grow the economy by cutting government, cutting spending. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in Louisiana, you haven\u2019t done that in New Jersey...CHRISTIE: ..Let me...SEIB: ...Guys...JINDAL: ...We need a conservative, not a big government republican in D.C.SEIB: Governor Christie...CHRISTIE: ...Let me just...SEIB: ...last word, brieflyCHRISTIE: ...Sure.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: It\u2019s interesting. I complimented Bobby, imagine how much time he\u2019d want if I actually criticized him.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: You know, the fact is, he\u2019s done \u2014 done a nice job down in Louisiana, and I don\u2019t have any problem with the job he\u2019s done. I\u2019ve cut spending $2 billion dollars, except for our pension and health care in New Jersey, which was driven predominantly by Obamacare. We have reduce the number of employees we have on the state payroll by 15%, but, you know what? The people out there don\u2019t care about any of that.You know what they care about? They care about who\u2019s going to be able to beat Hillary Clinton...(BELL RINGING)...Who\u2019s going to keep their eye on the ball? I\u2019m going to keep my eye on the ball.(CROSSTALK)SEIB: ...Thank you both, Governors.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Next question to you, Governor...JINDAL: ...This is how we....REGAN: ...Next question to you, Governor...JINDAL: ...This is how we move our country forward, look, this is not about between me and Chris...HUCKABEE: ...I\u2019d like to get that opportunity to go...JINDAL: ...This is about...(CROSSTALK)JINDAL: ...are we going to be the party...REGAN: ...let me get in...(CROSSTALK)REGAN: ...Let me get in here, because the next question, it\u2019s to you, and it\u2019s on Obamacare. It is still unpopular with the American people. You\u2019ve seen the polls, they\u2019ve shown nearly half the country still opposes this law. You have been critical of your GOP opponents, some of them standing on the stage tonight, others later. Notably, Ted Cruz, for not having comprehensive plans.You say you do. What specifically makes your plan to replace Obamacare better than the opponents, some of them standing next to you.JINDAL: Well, look, only one other opponent, actually, one other candidate, actually, has a plan. That\u2019s Jeb Bush, and he creates a new entitlement program. My plan actually gets rid of all of Obamacare, it\u2019s great that Senator Cruz will shut down the government over Obamacare, but he still hasn\u2019t given us his plan to get rid of it. It\u2019s great that other republicans talk about getting rid of it.You go to a town hall in Iowa, or New Hampshire, ask them how they\u2019re actually going to get rid of it \u2014 my plan has been online for over a year. It gets rid of all of Obamacare, it reduces the cost. It actually puts Americans, their patients, their doctors back in control. And, it actually helps those that really need this help \u2014 but, this is one of the most critical issues we face domestically.I think I \u2014 look, right now, I think I am the only candidate running that refused to expand Medicaid. I\u2019m the only one that turned down \u2014 that did what we could to fight Obamacare. This is an important point, and, look, I appreciate Chris\u2019s nice compliments to me. And, Chris, you look to me very well, I love Mary-pat, but this isn\u2019t about me and Chris. This is about the country, and this is about what direction \u2014 this is the most important election in our lifetimes.Folks, a couple of years ago they told us give them the republican majorities in the House and the Senate, they\u2019d stop Obamacare, and amnesty, and the bad Iran deal \u2014 nothing changed. If they fooled us once, shame on them. If they fooled us twice, shame on us. Don\u2019t let them fool us again.Chris, look, I\u2019ll give you your ribbon for participation, and a juicebox, but in the real world, it\u2019s about results...(AUDIENCE REACTION)...but, in the real world it\u2019s about results. It\u2019s about actually cutting government spending, not just talking about cutting government spending.REGAN: Governor Jindal, thank you.CHRISTIE: Yeah, listen. We stopped Obamacare in New Jersey because we refused to participate in the federal exchange. But, here\u2019s the bigger issue. What do you think\u2019s going to happen when Hillary Clinton\u2019s elected president of the United States? The woman who tried to impose healthcare on this country over 20 years ago? And, she was stopped then by a strong group of republicans, and an American public that said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201dWhat she will do \u2014 what she will do is move us towards a single payer system. She will completely nationalize the federal health care system. That\u2019s what she wanted to do 20 years ago, and I guarantee you that\u2019s what she\u2019ll do if you give her the keys to the White House one more time.The fact is we need someone who knows how to beat democrats, who knows how to beat democrats in a democratic area. I\u2019ve done it twice as governor of New Jersey, and Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t want one minute on that stage with me next September when I\u2019m debating her, and prosecuting her for her vision for America...SANTORUM: ...Let me settle this argument...SEIB: ...No, no, Senator Santorum...SANTORUM: ...Well...SEIB: ...I have a question for you. Just about everybody agrees that the nation\u2019s infrastructure is in bad shape. Urban highway congestion costs the economy more than $100 billion dollars annually, nearly one in four bridges in the National Highway System is structurally deficient, or obsolete. Congress is working on a six year highway bill to try to fix this problem. It only funds it for about three years. Should Americans be asked to pay more in federal gas taxes in order to address this problem? SANTORUM: I\u2019ll answer that in a second, but, I want to answer this other problem because this is a real legitimate debate between Chris and Bobby, and if somebody says we need someone who can win in a blue state, and Bobby says we need a real principled conservative.(AUDIENCE REACTION)(APPLAUSE)Ninety-two percent conservative voting record, unlike some of the other senators that Bobby mentioned who hasn\u2019t done anything to cut federal spending, I was actually the author of welfare reform, which is the only time we\u2019ve ever seen a federal entitlement actually cut. We cut it. Senate did exactly what every conservative says they want to do. We took the program, we eliminated the federal entitlement, we blocked (ph) to the state, we capped the amount of money, cut it by about 10%, and then put two requirements, work, and time limits.We need to do that with the rest of the \u2014 means (ph) tested federal entitlements. I\u2019ve done it.SANTORUM: And I did it with a bipartisan support in the House and Senate, and after fighting two presidential vetoes by Bill Clinton.So I had a democratic president we had to get this through. No record of accomplishment. I agree with the folks who are from the Congress in this race. I have a record of accomplishment of being a conservative on everything.National security, on moral and cultural issues, on the economy, and twice won a blue state. The first time I beat the author of Hillarycare. I had Bill and Hillary in my state, James Carville managed the race against me, a state with a million more Democrats than Republicans.And I ran on health savings accounts, on private sector health care, as a conservative, pro-life, pro-family, and I won. And then in 2000, I was the only senator to win a state as a conservative that George Bush lost.You want someone who can win Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, with a conservative message, I\u2019m your guy.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Senator, I don\u2019t think we got to infrastructure, but I understand.(LAUGHTER)SANTORUM: I\u2019ll be happy to answer that if you give me more time.SEIB: No, no. To do the things you\u2019re talking about, that you\u2019re all talking about, getting things done in Washington, you have to work with the other side. So a question, who in Congress do you most admire on the Democratic side? I need one name from each of you.And let\u2019s start with Governor Jindal.JINDAL: We can waste our time. And I think this is why people were so frustrated with the last debate with these kinds of silly questions.(APPLAUSE)JINDAL: We\u2019ve only got a certain amount of time to talk about the economy. Let me use my time to say this. I want to fire everybody in D.C. in both parties. I think they all \u2014 we need term limits, get rid of them all, make them live under the same rules they passed on the rest of us.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)SEIB: Governor Huckabee?HUCKABEE: Well, since we\u2019re not going to answer the question, let me just remind everybody, tomorrow is Veterans Day. And here\u2019s what I would like to remind everybody. The VA has been a disaster in large part because the people in Congress have never bothered to fix it, and this president has certainly not...REGAN: We\u2019ll get to that.HUCKABEE: Let me finish, please. I\u2019m going to ask you just this, what would happen if the Congress and the president had to get their health care from the VA? We would fix the problem and we would fix Congress.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)SEIB: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: I\u2019ll continue in the pattern and just say...(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: And just say this to everybody, since it seems to be an open question.(LAUGHTER)CHRISTIE: I\u2019ll tell you the thing that disturbs me the most about what\u2019s going on with the Democratic Party in Washington, that they\u2019re not standing behind our police officers across this country.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: That they\u2019re allowing lawlessness...(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: That they\u2019re allowing lawlessness to reign in this country. I spent seven years of my life in law enforcement, here\u2019s what every law enforcement, 700,000, should know tonight. When President Christie is in the Oval Office, I\u2019ll have your back.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)SEIB: Senator Santorum?SANTORUM: I\u2019m going to answer two questions for the price of one. The infrastructure question, the answer is...(LAUGHTER)SANTORUM: We need to get the federal government out of this infrastructure business, other than vital economic highways. It has been said that if we cut the gas tax to 3 to 5 cents and send the rest back to the states, and just take care of the federal infrastructure that\u2019s vital for our economy, let the \u2014 we don\u2019t need the federal government and the road business that it is today. Number one.Number two, you know who I respect in the Democratic Party? You know why I respect them? Because they fight! Because they\u2019re not willing to back down, and they\u2019re willing to stand up and fight and win. And so I respect them because they are willing to take it to us.SEIB: Thank you, Senator Santorum.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Ronald Reagan did work with Tip O\u2019Neill.Anyway, we are going to take a quick break. Coming up, one of the top issues for voters, how much you\u2019re paying in taxes. We are live from Milwaukee with the Republican presidential debate.See you right back here.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)REGAN: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate.We are live from Milwaukee.A top issue on the campaign trail, taxes and how much you pay.All right, I\u2019ve got a question for all of you here.When looking at the federal income tax, state income tax and local tax, in some cases, combined, some Americans are paying over 50 percent of their paycheck to the government.What is the highest percentage, all in, in the way of taxes, that any American should have to pay and what is the lowest?I\u2019d like to, again, to hear from each of you. And I want those two all in numbers.I\u2019m going to start with you, Senator Santorum.SANTORUM: Well, I\u2019ll tell you, I have a 20 percent flat tax. That\u2019s one all income \u2014 so capital gains, corporations, individuals, 20 percent. I think that\u2019s a fair number, one out of five, to be able to \u2014 to help support the federal government.By the way it also approximates, if you take out some of the deductions, it approximates how much the federal government is, on average, spent of GDP, which is about 18 to 19 percent of GDP.So it actually fits with shrinking the size of government down to more like post-World War II levels.So the second thing we do is I don\u2019t allow for deductibility of state and local taxes, which will require state and local taxes to go down in order to be treated for their \u2014 for their people to be treated fairly.So the answer is, 20 percent and probably 33 percent overall.REGAN: All in.OK, Governor Christie? CHRISTIE: Yes. You know, our tax plan puts forward a highest rate of 28 percent for those who are doing the most and making the most in this country and 8 percent on the low end.And I agree with Senator Santorum, we get rid of all of the deductions and loopholes, except for the home mortgage interest deduction and the charitable contribution deduction. That means getting rid of the state and local income tax deduction, as well, because that will put more pressure on governors and on local officials not to keep raising those taxes, saying we can deduct them.And so ours will be 28 on the high end, 8 on the low end.And I will tell you one other thing. Americans for Tax Reform came out with a report six weeks ago and said I vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. I will do exactly the same thing as president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: And we\u2019ll get back to you.Governor Jindal?JINDAL: So under our tax plan, look, the top rate is 25 percent, 10 percent, 2 percent. That 2 percent is the most important.I think everybody should pay something. I think everybody should have skin in the game.JINDAL: We shouldn\u2019t be creating one group of Americans that\u2019s dependent on government, another group that\u2019s paying taxes.I want to come back to an earlier point though, that Chris said. Look, we all agree Hillary Clinton is bad. We all agree we need to beat her. But let\u2019s not pretend that out-of-control government spending is only a Democratic issue. This is a bipartisan issue, and just sending another big government Republican to D.C. is not good enough.We need to actually cut government spending. We need to cut \u2014 and we\u2019re not going to do it just by sending any Republican. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s vetoed taxes. The Tax Foundation graded New Jersey the 50th worst business climate due to taxes, high taxes in the state of New Jersey.SMITH: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, thank you very much.I still want to go back to the fact that if we got rid of all the taxes on our work, got rid of the taxes on our savings, investments, capital gains, and inheritance, and made a zero tax, we\u2019d pay at the point of consumption.Because why should we punish people for their productivity? And the fair tax doesn\u2019t punish people for doing well and building the economy. There\u2019s $31 trillion parked offshore. What happens if that money comes back to America? You\u2019d think it\u2019d goose the economy? I guarantee you it would.And that\u2019s why the fair tax is the best solution we have for economic growth in this country.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, Americans, under your plan, would pay a tax on every single thing that they purchase. Given that consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of GDP, some economists worry that your tax plan would actually discourage spending, thereby slowing our economy. How do you respond?HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, do you know an American that will just stop spending? I don\u2019t.(LAUGHTER) HUCKABEE: No, that\u2019s not going to be the problem. Look, Americans will go to the marketplace with more money they\u2019ve ever had. For the first time they\u2019ll be having their whole paycheck.You see, most people don\u2019t understand that when you buy something that is made in America, 22 percent of the cost of it is the embedded tax they never even know they paid. It\u2019s why China has beaten the daylights out of us, they can build stuff that we can\u2019t because they\u2019re not taxing it, when they don\u2019t tax capital and labor and we do.They bring something over here, it\u2019s automatically cheaper even without the regulatory environment because they\u2019re not embedding the taxes, we are.Take the embedded taxes out. Give a person his whole paycheck because every American would no longer have a payroll tax taken out. It means they\u2019d see their real paycheck for the first time. When they go to spend that money, they\u2019ll actually have it.And they only pay taxes on the stuff that\u2019s new. So a lot of Americans will buy used stuff. Look, here\u2019s the point, Americans are not going to quit shopping. Americans are not going to quit buying.But it would be nice if Americans could control how much they paid in tax, rather than having the government reach into their pockets and take it out before they ever had a chance to even see it, much less spend it.(APPLAUSE)HUCKABEE: And that\u2019s why the fair tax makes a heck of a lot more sense than punishing productivity and rewarding irresponsibility.REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.SEIB: Governor Jindal, you\u2019ve proposed something different. You\u2019ve proposed eliminating the federal corporate income tax entirely. Why would have you wage-earners and investors pay an income tax but not a corporation?JINDAL: Well, a couple of reasons. Look, we know big companies don\u2019t pay those taxes today. They hire lobbyists and accountants and lawyers. It\u2019s the small businesses that get hit.I want to get rid of the corporate tax, I want to bring the jobs and investment back to America. Make the CEOs pay the same rates as everybody else. Get rid of all the corporate welfare as well.Like I said, make everybody pay something, earned success is so much better than unearned success. And let\u2019s actually shrink the size of government. My plan purposely does that.Look, we can talk all night about tax plans, energy plans, I think you will find a lot of agreement among all the Republicans. We all want to get rid of the death tax, the marriage penalty. We all want lower, fewer brackets. We want to downsize, take away power from the IRS.What we really need to be talking about is this, these last seven years, we\u2019ve had more government spending, more government dependence. Poverty has gone up. Inequality has gone up. Only the top 10 percent have seen their incomes go up \u2014 their median incomes go up.We actually have more inequality thanks to what we have seen, the largest most expensive experiment in progressive government. We can\u2019t keep spending money we don\u2019t have.And the reality is, the last couple of years it hasn\u2019t mattered whether Republicans or Democrats were in control. We keep stealing from our children. That is immoral. It is wrong. And we\u2019re creating more government dependence.If we really want to grow the economy, yes, you need a rational energy plan, and you\u2019ve got to rein in the EPA, and you\u2019ve got to repeal Obamacare, and you\u2019ve got to cut taxes.But none of that will be enough if we\u2019re not serious about cutting government spending. We cannot afford to elect a big- government Republican. We need somebody. This is the most important election. Hillary Clinton is gift-wrapping this election to us. Let\u2019s not waste this opportunity to apply conservative principles and cut the size of government.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: All right. Governor Jindal, thank you.All right. Well, we are not finished yet.SMITH: More from the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)SEIB: Welcome back to the Republican Presidential Debate live from Milwaukee\u2019s historic theater. Let\u2019s get back to the questions. Governor Christie, by keeping interest rates so low for so long, is the Fed creating a new financial bubble in real estate or stock as prices that will burst and create problems down the road, or has it been right to err on the side of trying to help the recovery through low rates?CHRISTIE: Gerry, this has been the most political Federal Reserve I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. Now, when they first cut interest rates during the economic recession and the crisis, that was the right thing to do. But they\u2019ve kept those interest rates artificially low for one reason, and one reason only. Because they\u2019re trying to politically support Barack Obama and his agenda. And it\u2019s been wrong.And what it\u2019s done, in an administration where the President has talked about income inequality, he\u2019s had more income inequality in this administration than any previous administration. The middle class is doing worse than it\u2019s ever done before. And the investor class, the wealthy, are doing even better because of this cheap money from the Fed. And here\u2019s the worst part, we had one and a half percent GDP growth last quarter. If we slide back towards a recession, you cannot lower interest rates below zero. Where are we going to go if we need help if the economy slides back into recession?And with this government- controlled economy that Barack Obama, we\u2019re moving right towards it.CHRISTIE: The Fed should be audited and the Fed should stop playing politics with our money supply. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s been the wrong thing to do. It\u2019s hurting the American economy. And...(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 let me...(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: \u2014 let me add one other thing on this.Be very aware now, because what Hillary Clinton is talking about doing, if she\u2019s president of the United States, is to make sure that the government gets even more involved in the economy, even more involved in making choices for everybody. You do not want that to happen. You need someone who\u2019s going to stand up on that stage and prosecute the case against her and prosecute it strong.(BUZZER NOISE)CHRISTIE: That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Senator Santorum, you agree with Governor Christie. You also have said that the Fed should be audited.But many worry that given the Congressional challenges that they face, by having Congressional oversight of the Fed, which has been historically an independent body, you would be making the Fed much more political.How would you navigate that risk?SANTORUM: Well, I don\u2019t \u2014 I agree with Governor Christie, I don\u2019t think you can make it any more political than it\u2019s been. They \u2014 they are protecting a president that is over-taxing and over- regulating, shutting down this economy. And he \u2014 and they\u2019re keeping it up like Atlas, trying to hold up the Earth by \u2014 by these ridiculously low interest rates.And it\u2019s hurting American seniors, who are seeing no Social Security increases, seeing no \u2014 no savings. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re putting their money aside. They\u2019re getting nothing in their deposit accounts.This is hurting the people who have acted responsibly, all in favor of those who, um, you know, are \u2014 are speculators and \u2014 and those on Wall Street. It\u2019s not a good deal for \u2014 for the vast majority of responsible Americans.The other thing we have with the Fed is they\u2019ve been given way too much authority. Under Dodd-Frank, they\u2019ve been given this enormous new authority. I mean they \u2014 they now have almost become the most powerful entity in Washington, DC.We need to repeal Dodd-Frank, get away that authority from the Fed and put them under more \u2014 more scrutiny.That\u2019s only part of the problem. I understand the Fed is interesting for a business channel, but I think for most Americans, the most important business is the family. And we haven\u2019t really talked much about the importance of the family to the economy.And \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, every single book, from left to right, that\u2019s been written over the last couple of years has said the biggest problem in America today at the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the nuclear family in America.We\u2019d better be the party that\u2019s out there talking about this issue and what we\u2019re going to do to help strengthen marriage and return dads into homes in all communities.(APPLAUSE)SANTORUM: You want to talk about the communities that are hurting the most, the ones you see the protests in...(BUZZER NOISE)...SANTORUM: \u2014 there are no dads. And we need to do something about it.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Governor Huckabee, both Senator Santorum and Governor Christie were boat \u2014 both critical of the Federal Reserve. Also, many have questioned whether Janet Yellen is the right person to be running the Fed.If elected president, would you keep Janet Yellen?HUCKABEE: Well, my wife\u2019s name is Janet and when you say Janet Yelling, I\u2019m very familiar with what you mean.(LAUGHTER) HUCKABEE: But, look, I think the Fed is in a big trouble because they haven\u2019t addressed the number one issue that\u2019s hurting Americans and that\u2019s the fact that wages for the bottom 90 percent of the economy have been stagnant for 40 years.In the 25 years after World War II, up to 1971, wages grew by 85 percent in this country. People were \u2014 were moving up in the middle class. There was a middle class.That\u2019s not happening any more, and in large measure, the Fed has manipulated the dollar so it doesn\u2019t have a standard.Tie the dollar to something fixed and if it\u2019s not going to be gold, make it the commodity basket.But here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do. We absolutely have to get it where the people who go out there and work get something in return.And if the dollar keeps fluctuating, and this is as crazy as \u2014 as is the price of bread, well, the fact is, people can\u2019t get ahead then.SMITH: So would you change leadership at the Fed?HUCKABEE: Absolutely. Absolutely, because what we need to is to make sure that they tie the monetary standard to something that makes sense, rather than to their own whims, because who\u2019s getting gut punched?It ain\u2019t the people in Wall Street, it\u2019s the folks on Main Street. They\u2019re the ones who\u2019s wages have been stagnant for 40 years. And the average American today has a total savings of 1,000 bucks. One root canal and they\u2019re in trouble.And if their car breaks down the same week...(BUZZER NOISE)HUCKABEE: \u2014 they\u2019re out of business.REGAN: All right, Governor Huckabee, thank you.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: All right, Senator Santorum, by the way, today is the 240th...SANTORUM: Happy Birthday.REGAN: \u2014 of the United States...SANTORUM: \u2014 States Marine Corps.REGAN: \u2014 Marine Corps.(APPLAUSE)REGAN: Tomorrow is Veterans Day. We honor and recognize all those who have fought for, and served this great nation, Senator. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, meanwhile, which provides patient care, and federal benefits to those veterans, as well as their families, is beset by scandal.What new ideas do you have to fix the broken V.A. healthcare system?SANTORUM: That\u2019s very personal to me. I grew up on a V.A. grounds. I lived in apartments on V.A. grounds my entire childhood. Both my Mom and Dad, after World War II, marry \u2014 met at a V.A., married, and that\u2019s where I lived. Kitchen table discussion was, particularly when I was growing up in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, was the decline of the V.A.When they joined in the early 1950\u2019s, the V.A. was the top. They were the best, they were the best and brightest coming in after the war. And, we believed in the cause that we fought, and we invested in our hospitals to make sure that our veterans who left World War II were taken care of. But, after Vietnam, and during Vietnam, that began to change, and it really hasn\u2019t recovered since.The bottom line is the V.A. is antiquated. There\u2019s no need for a V.A. healthcare system as it existed after World War \u2014 why? Because we have the best private healthcare system in the world, we didn\u2019t need \u2014 we needed it in 1950\u2019s, hospitals were not particularly advanced, so, we built the best. We didn\u2019t maintain the best. Government didn\u2019t keep its promises to its veterans. So, what we need to do is two things. Number one, we need to allow veterans to go to private sector hospitals for their routine and ordinary care to get the best care in their community possible.(APPLAUSE)And, there is a place for the Veterans Administration. There are injuries, and there are \u2014 things like PTSD, or prosthetics that are uniquely problems within the veterans community where we can develop centers of excellence within \u2014 and replace the V.A. with a group of...(BELL RINGING)...centers of excellence that can help our folks to come back...SMITH: Senator Santorum, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: I have a question for all of you. Americans connection to the military has been increasingly fading. As a society, how do we restore that sense of duty, that sense of pride, that was the hallmark of the greatest generation. Again, I\u2019d like to ask each of you, 30 seconds each, beginning with Governor Jindal.JINDAL: Well, a couple things, first, I want to echo what others have said and thank those veterans that run towards danger, not away from it, so we can live in the greatest country in the history of the world.I think every veteran should get that card, and they should be allowed to get that health care wherever they want in the private sector. But, I also think \u2014 or the public sector, I also think we need to fire some of the V.A. bureaucrats. Somebody should go to jail over these scandals, and it is a crime that it has not happened.(APPLAUSE)When it comes \u2014 when it comes to uniting the American people, one of the things we\u2019ve done to honor our veterans in Louisiana, we\u2019ve given thousands \u2014 and I\u2019ve hand delivered these, to veterans \u2014 medals to veterans to thank them for their service. I\u2019ll just give you one quick example, I know my time is out, but, we\u2019ve had Vietnam war veterans with tears in their eyes saying nobody has ever thanked them before. We\u2019ve had World War II veterans, children, who said they never heard the stories of their parents heroic sacrifice. Whatever conflict, whenever they served, one of the things we can do is to teach our children we do live in the greatest country in the history of the world.We got a president who doesn\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism, but we still do, and it\u2019s because of those men and women in uniform. We should thank them everyday, not just veterans day.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: Well, I think thanking our veterans is a wonderful thing to do, but, they sure appreciate a better paycheck. They\u2019d appreciate the fact that we kept our promises to them. The men and women in uniform put on the uniform of our nation, they went halfway around the world, they face dangers on our behalf, and we promised them if they did that, when they came home we\u2019d take care of their medical care, we\u2019d make is possible for their kids to go to college, and they\u2019d be able to bind to a home.They kept their promises to us. We have not kept our promises to them, and today, less than one percent of Americans go to the military for service. We\u2019re fighting wars with other people\u2019s kids in large measure because we\u2019ve not taken seriously the moral, not the monetary, the moral obligation to take care of the veterans and to keep America\u2019s promise to the ones who kept their promise to America.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: The way to reconnect Americans to the men and women in uniform is to first, and foremost, give them a Commander in Chief who respects the military, and respects everyone who wears the uniform.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)Starts at the top there...(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And Secretary Clinton says, there\u2019s no crisis at the V.A.. That send a long, and hard message to our veterans that she doesn\u2019t get it, and she doesn\u2019t respect their service.CHRISTIE: When the President of the United States doesn\u2019t back up law enforcement officers in uniform, he loses the moral authority to any man or woman who is uniform.I spent seven years in law enforcement...(BELL RINGING)...I respect these folks, and I will do so as Commander in Chief of the military.SMITH: Senator Santorum.SANTORUM: It should come as no surprise to Chris, or anybody else, that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t stand behind our men and women in uniform here at home because he hasn\u2019t stood behind them overseas.The rules of engagement that we\u2019ve allowed our soldiers to go and fight against have put them in harm\u2019s way for political purposes. This has been the most politicized wars that we\u2019ve ever seen under this administration. He gets in, and gets out, based upon what the polls are saying, what pressure he\u2019s getting from groups. Talk about a Commander in Chief.We need a commander in chief who has a vision and plan of how we\u2019re going to execute the national security of our country. Commander in chief is not an entry level position. Experience matters, and that\u2019s why I would ask for your support as a Commander in Chief, because I have the experience against the enemy...(BELL RINGING)...to confront to do the job.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Candidates, it\u2019s time for closing statements, 30 seconds. Governor Jindal, we\u2019ll start with you.JINDAL: You know, I have spent a lot of time tonight talking about the need to cut the size of government. The reason I\u2019m doing that \u2014 it\u2019s not just about balancing the budget, or balancing a bunch of numbers. Because I believe in the American dream. I think President Obama\u2019s done a lot of damage to our country. I think that one of the worst things he has done is try to change the idea of America to be one of dependence. There are a lot of politicians that talk about cutting government spending, I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s actually done it that\u2019s running for President.The rest of them, it\u2019s a lot of hot air. If you want your paychecks to go up, if you want more good paying jobs, if you want the government out of your lives, we\u2019ve got to cut the size of government. It\u2019s not enough just to elect any republican, we\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve got to elect a republican that will take on the establishment in both parties. I\u2019m asking for your support.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Senator Santorum.SANTORUM: I announced from a factory floor in Western Pennsylvania. This campaign has all been about two words for me, working families. Working. Getting people the opportunity to see those wages rise, to be on the side of the American workers so they can get good paying jobs, and that means we have to start making things in America again. We need a president who\u2019s going to not just put policies in place, but is going to stand up at the bully pulpit and talk about the dignity of being a welder. The dignity of being a carpenter, about going to work and earning success.And, also, the importance of families, the importance of families and fathers, and mothers raising their children, and committing to that so that they can give children in our country the best opportunity to success. Working families is the key for us to win this election.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Governor Huckabee.HUCKABEE: In many ways, I feel like I\u2019m the luckiest guy on Earth. I really do. It\u2019s a long way from a little brick rent house on second street in Hope, Arkansas to this stage where I\u2019m running for President of the United States. It\u2019s not about me, not about these guys \u2014 \u2018ought to be about you, and I\u2019ve never been the favorite of the people who have the most money.But, I want to be the favorite of the people who still want to believe the American dream can work for them. Today in our office, I got a letter from a third grader in North Dakota, her name is Reese (ph).She sent $6 dollars from her allowance, and said, \u201cI want to help you be president.\u201dYou know, I\u2019m going to keep standing on this stage, and keep fighting for one reason, because somewhere out there in North Dakota, and all over America, there are kids like Reese (ph) who need a president who will never forget where they came from, and I promise I won\u2019t.(APPLAUSE)SEIB: Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: I want to tell the American people who are watching tonight the truth. I saw the most disgraceful thing I\u2019ve seen in this entire campaign a few weeks ago. Hillary Clinton was asked the enemy she\u2019s most proud of, and she said, \u201cRepublicans\u201d.In a world where we have Al-Qaeda, and ISIS, the mullahs in Iran, and Vladimir Putin \u2014 the woman who asks to run and represent all of the United States says that her greatest enemies are people like you in this audience, and us here. I will tell you one thing, and write this down, when you elect me President of the United States, I will go to Washington not only to fight the fights that need fighting, not only to say what I mean, and mean what I say, but to bring this entire country together for a better future for our children and grandchildren.(APPLAUSE)SMITH: Alright, thank you gentlemen. That does it, everyone, for the first debate here in Milwaukee. In just about one hour from now, at 9:00PM Eastern, eight more candidates are going to be taking to the stage. Right now though, special coverage of the Republican Presidential Debate, live from Milwaukee, continues right here on Fox Business.(APPLAUSE)(MUSIC)ENDFollowing is a transcript of the undercard Republican debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Living Longer. That\u2019s Great, Except for Social Security.", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the NumbersBut every rose has its thorn, and longer lives happen to create some problems for Social Security. As people live longer, they spend a larger fraction of their lives in retirement, collecting benefits.As large government programs go, Social Security retirement benefits are extremely simple: The program takes money from working people and gives it to retired people. This simplicity is great in that it makes it easy to see the magnitude of the program\u2019s solvency problem: large, but manageable through modest adjustments that can take place over decades. Simplicity is a disadvantage because it means the problem can\u2019t be addressed through innovation; the military or the Justice Department might find ways to do more with less, but sending out a $1,000 benefit check will always cost at least $1,000.For Social Security to be fixed, the program must take more money in, send less money out or both. So when overhaul options for Social Security get floated that aren\u2019t tax increases, you can usually assume they are fancy ways of saying \u201csend less money out.\u201dConsider, for example, a higher retirement age. This sounds like an alternative to lower annual benefits, but most Social Security beneficiaries experience it as a straightforward reduction in the annual benefit amount because they retire early. The full retirement age is 66, but people may start getting benefits as early as age 62 if they agree to accept a 25 percent reduction in their annual benefit. Under current law, the full retirement age is scheduled to rise to 67 by 2027, but it will remain possible to retire at 62; doing so will just mean taking a 30 percent hit to the annual benefit.\u201cChanging the full retirement age is just a benefit cut,\u201d said Alicia Munnell, an economist at Boston College who led the most recent Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods, a body of experts assembled by the federal government\u2019s Social Security Advisory Board.Ms. Munnell noted it would be possible to make people retire later by raising the minimum retirement age, but it would save very little money because the early retirement adjustments are pretty well designed to offset for life span. That is, forcing people to wait until 67 to collect wouldn\u2019t save taxpayers any more money than the 30 percent cut to the benefit at age 62 does. The real savings come from the benefit cuts, not from the number of years spent in retirement.Changes to \u201cindexing\u201d are another oblique way to cut benefits. As part of his search for a deficit reduction deal earlier in his presidency, Barack Obama offered to link Social Security benefits to the Chained Consumer Price Index, an alternative measure of inflation that economists generally say is more accurate than traditional inflation measures. It also happens to be lower than traditional inflation measures, meaning if it were used for Social Security, benefits wouldn\u2019t rise as fast. As such, Chained C.P.I. is another version of \u201csend less out.\u201dThe fact that Social Security overhauls can be reduced to simple arithmetic does not mean they all are equivalent. There are very important questions of fairness and efficiency about who will send what and who will receive what.Consider two possible \u201ctake more in\u201d approaches. Currently, Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on wage and salary income up to $118,500. The long-term funding gap in the program could be closed by raising this tax by 2.9 percentage points, or nearly closed by keeping the tax rate the same and abolishing the cap. But raising the tax hurts the low earners, and abolishing the $118,500 cap acts like a large tax increase on high earners.The \u201csend less out\u201d solutions that focus on getting people to retire later hurt poor people in another way because people with higher incomes enjoy higher life expectancies.\u201cYou\u2019re essentially punishing low-income people for a problem they didn\u2019t cause,\u201d said Andrew Biggs, a retirement policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.Mr. Biggs argues that older people\u2019s choices about work are highly sensitive to changes in their after-tax wages; he notes that their participation in the labor force actually went up in the last recession, and he believes either changes to the minimum retirement age or an exemption from the payroll tax could cause more people to work into their mid- and late 60s, which would grow the economy. But as he notes, later retirement would have especially negative effects for lower earners with shorter life expectancies, so he says these changes should be paired with others that help low earners, such as a substantially higher minimum Social Security benefit.That is, he\u2019s proposing a suite of reforms that seek to add up to \u201csend less out\u201d without soaking the poor.But Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says that\u2019s too complicated for a simple program.\u201cThere may be formulaic ways to fix the problems you create by raising retirement ages,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I usually try to avoid policies that break something and then add complexities to fix what you just broke.\u201dWhat then? Well, there are the \u201ctake more in\u201d options.\u201cI would certainly start on the revenue side,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said.An Upshot article on Tuesday about the effect of longer life spans on the solvency of Social Security misstated the year that the agency\u2019s retirement provisions last had a major overhaul. It was in 1983, not 1985.Advertisement"}

Unfortunately, the practical impact on demographic trends and the economy will be too little and too late.The response of families to earlier smaller steps toward liberalization was minimal. As a result, China\u2019s women still have only an average of about 1.5 births each, which makes the shrinking of the labor force, a deceleration of economic growth and rapid population aging inevitable.A much better step would be to drop all limits on childbearing and allow families to freely choose how many children to have and when.This would be universally welcomed, especially by Chinese women, and would lead to more favorable demographic and economic trends.Moreover, it would allow the government to dismantle a large, entrenched and much despised family planning bureaucracy.JOHN BONGAARTSNew YorkThe writer is vice president and a distinguished scholar at the Population Council.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Resisting Bomb Theory, Egypt Finds Itself Increasingly Alone", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Six days after the crash of a Russian charter flight from the Egyptian resort area of Sharm el Sheikh, the government of Egypt is finding itself increasingly isolated in its resistance to the possibility that a terrorist\u2019s bomb brought down the plane.But the government of Egypt, critically dependent on the money tourists bring to Sharm el Sheikh\u2019s resorts, has dismissed any suggestion that a bombing killed the 224 people aboard as \u201cpremature,\u201d \u201csurprising\u201d and \u201cunwarranted.\u201dIn that case, the Egyptian investigation was cloaked in mystery and, critics say, politicized from that start.A Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane.The desires of Egypt\u2019s political leaders to minimize the threat of terrorism would almost certainly set the course of its investigators, he said. \u201cThe air safety investigators in Egypt are under the thumb of the government,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that has changed.\u201dSeveral British news outlets, citing anonymous officials, reported on Friday that the British government based its conclusion about a bombing in part on telephone surveillance of Egyptian militants in the Sinai Peninsula, and reports focused on the chance that an airport employee might have planted an explosive.Mr. Obama, for his part, raised the same possibility on Thursday night in a radio interview. \u201cThere is a possibility that there was a bomb on board,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are taking that very seriously.\u201dRussia appeared to switch sides on Friday, suspending all flights to Egypt, pending a conclusion of the crash investigation. It was the first breach in what had largely been a consistent response from Russian and Egyptian authorities.A Kremlin spokesman said that Mr. Putin\u2019s decision did not necessarily mean that the crash was caused by a terrorist act, and Russian officials did not say whether the decision to suspend flights was based on new information from the investigation.Under international aviation rules, representatives from France, Ireland, Russia and Germany are included in the official committee investigating the crash because of various connections to the plane or the flight, and European officials briefed on the inquiry say others in the committee have urged the Egyptians to disclose more.But the rules give the Egyptians control over any public statements, and so far Egypt has rebuffed admonitions to disclose any preliminary details of what they may have learned, including whether explosive residue had been detected, the pattern of burn marks on the wreckage or on human remains, or of whatever may have been gleaned from the plane\u2019s flight-recording devices.A statement from Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Aviation on Friday conveyed mainly pique at the British for not only suspending their flights but also requiring separate planes to carry passengers\u2019 checked baggage home.\u201cThe British airlines opt to fly without the hold baggage of the British passengers,\u201d Hossam Kamal, the minister of civil aviation, said in the statement.\u201cThe airport will not accommodate more than 120 tons of left-behind luggage,\u201d he added. \u201cThis big volume affects the smooth operation of the rest of the domestic and international flights.\u201d The burden of the British baggage, he suggested, had caused the airport to reduce the number of British departures to eight instead of the 19 flights previously scheduled, thus prolonging the plight of the stranded vacationers.Hosni Mubarak, then Egypt\u2019s president, initially requested that Washington take the lead in the investigation, given the proximity to the United States and the difficulty of recovering the underwater wreckage.The evidence quickly pointed to a suicidal decision by one pilot, Gamil al-Batouti. He was heard on the voice recorder encouraging the captain and another co-pilot to leave him alone in the cockpit. He cut the engine, turned the plane into a nosedive toward the sea and repeated to himself again and again, \u201cI rely on God.\u201dBut as soon as the evidence began to emerge, Mr. Mubarak recalled his initial representative to the investigating committee, Mamdouh Hashment, a senior aviation official.\u201cMubarak replaced that team with another team that would follow the government line,\u201d said Mr. Hall, the former National Transportation Safety Board chief. \u201cIt made it a very long and trying investigation, which it really did not need to be.\u201dEgypt\u2019s new representatives sought at every turn to block any conclusion that held the pilot, Mr. Batouti, responsible. They repeatedly invented and advocated increasingly esoteric scenarios, demanding costly and time-consuming high-velocity tests to disprove each thesis.At home, the Egyptian state media floated conspiracy theories about American, Israeli or other plots that might have brought down the plane, which was carrying dozens of Egyptian military officers. Mr. Batouti was labeled a \u201cmartyr\u201d in the Egyptian press, and the Egyptian aviation authorities \u2014 dissenting from the Americans \u2014 ultimately pronounced the crash a mechanical failure.\u201cThe government would have viewed this exactly as it would, for example, an Islamic terrorist act in Luxor \u2014 something that we should cover up,\u201d Hani Shukrallah, a veteran Egyptian journalist, told Mr. Langewiesche. \u201cSo it got politicized immediately. And this became an official line: You are out there to prove that EgyptAir is not responsible. It became a national duty.\u201dIn an interview on Friday, Mr. Shukrallah said the Egyptian government was just as determined to cover up the possibility of terrorism in the Russian plane crash: \u201cOh yes, definitely!\u201d he said.\u201cThere is a sense \u2014 which everyone familiar with Egyptian airports is aware of \u2014 that the security precautions are not as they should be,\u201d he added.The fragile state of Egypt\u2019s economy makes any conclusion of terrorism extraordinarily costly. Sharm el Sheikh had been a bright spot for the nearly moribund Egyptian tourism industry at a time when a deep deficit in its balance of trade has forced Egypt to the brink of a currency crisis. Tourism, especially in Sharm el Sheikh, has long been one of its four main sources of hard currency (the others are petroleum exports, foreign aid and remittances from migrant workers abroad).Russians and Britons had been the two largest groups of tourists in Sharm el Sheikh, and with their departure, analysts warn a further drop in tourist revenues could have a devastating impact on the economy as whole. The government has already imposed strict controls on the movement of hard currency out of the country, even at the cost of making it difficult for businesses to obtain raw materials and other goods.But despite the economic stakes, managing the crash inquiry could prove harder this time, because of the international representatives on the investigating committee. The results of the EgyptAir Flight 990 inquiry place an added burden on the Egyptian investigation this time, analysts said.\u201cThe international community is not going to give Egypt the benefit of the doubt,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, a researcher based at the Century Foundation in New York.So if the cause of the crash was not a bomb and Egypt hopes to dispel the Western fears, \u201cthis is going to have to be an investigation that is of the utmost professionalism and really transparent,\u201d he said.\u201cThey are going to have to go about this in a way that is quite different from the past,\u201d he added.Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.Advertisement"}

An investor planning for the long haul can be confident, however, that what seems like a bargain will pay off eventually.Certain depressed assets \u2014 notably stocks in emerging markets or those related to energy and other commodities, or the commodities themselves \u2014 fit the bill, investment advisers say. They could offer excellent returns in coming years, even if they are risky propositions in coming weeks.Among the beaten-down groups of investments, Mr. Koesterich prefers emerging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a universally hated asset class\u201d that \u201chas underperformed for years,\u201d he said.He cautioned that while emerging markets in general are cheap, there is great variation in prospects among individual countries. The best long-term bets, in his view, include India and Mexico.The discrepancies have led him to calculate that emerging markets will return 7.9 percent a year for the next decade, net of inflation, compared with 1.1 percent for their American counterparts. He makes no claim about any shorter horizon.\u201cSpeculators in equities ask how I can be sure that equity prices in emerging markets will rise more than equity prices in the United States over the coming year,\u201d Mr. Brightman wrote. \u201cI respond that I have no clue about the prospects for short-term price changes. I am not speculating on price changes, I explain. I am investing to build long-term wealth.\u201dOn Wall Street, by contrast, analysts and money managers are judged on how well they do in a given year or even quarter. That can cause people to overemphasize the importance of recent performance when judging prospective investments. As strategists at HSBC note, recent history in developing markets is unpleasant.The developing world \u201cappears to have inherited a bad legacy from the developed world, namely low growth and high debt,\u201d they said in a report last month. They go on to say that the \u201cbleak fundamental outlook makes us remain cautious\u201d and that \u201ccurrent valuations offer only limited opportunities on a very selective basis.\u201dHSBC recommends owning stocks in China, India, Mexico and Taiwan and avoiding Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand.The HSBC strategists are not alone in their disdain. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers found them to be shunning emerging markets more than any other asset class, relative to their average allocation.Energy ranks a close second. Oil is trading at roughly half its price in the summer of 2014. Natural gas and other energy commodities have been pounded too, as have the stocks of companies that produce them.\u201cI think leadership is going to change,\u201d he predicted. There has been \u201ca massive tax cut in the form of a halving of commodity prices. Long term, that is hugely stimulative because 95 percent of the world is commodity consumers, not producers.\u201dAnticipating a recovery in commodities, he encouraged investors essentially to focus on the other 5 percent by buying stocks in economies where commodity production plays a big role, such as Canada and Australia. Foreign markets are generally cheap and so are commodities, so investments that can benefit from recoveries in both could be particularly rewarding, he said.Mr. Koesterich agreed that energy and mining stocks were cheap and \u201crepresent long-term value,\u201d but he was less certain how much value was available in commodities themselves, the main driver of producers\u2019 stocks. That is why he would rather own emerging markets, while being in no hurry to cash in.\u201cIt\u2019s the type of thing to buy and put away for 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t time the low, but you know you\u2019re getting in at a fairly cheap price.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The auction\u2019s winner was the company that promised, after paying that sum, to sell electricity to consumers at the lowest price, but China Three Gorges was the only company to bid on these two plants.\u201cThere weren\u2019t other bidders because of the way the government organized the auction,\u201d said Claudio Sales, president of Instituto Acende Brasil, an electricity sector think tank in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cFully operational hydroelectric plants with consumer contracts are attractive assets.\u201dThe auction was structured to raise funds for the government as quickly as possible. Brazil\u2019s Treasury is struggling to bring down a budget deficit that in September led credit the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s to downgrade the country\u2019s bonds to junk status.Government ministers have been explicit about their desire to receive revenue from this auction this year, and Mr. Sales said the auction was rushed as a result. \u201cThere was very little time for possibly interested parties to arrange financing to participate,\u201d he said.China Three Gorges, the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric operator, had already invested $505 million in Brazil in August, when it bought a handful of smaller plants from a Brazilian company, Triunfo. The Chinese utility has been present in Brazil since 2011, when it spent 2.69 billion euros to buy a stake in a Portuguese energy company, EDP, with multiple operations here.Another state-owned Chinese utility company, the State Grid Corporation, won a contract in July to build, at an estimated cost of $1.9 billion, a 1,500-mile transmission line to bring electricity from the giant Belo Monte hydroelectric plant in the Amazon to Brazil\u2019s industrial heartland in the southeast.China is also investing in other sectors of Brazil\u2019s economy. So far this year, China\u2019s banks have promised $12 billion in financing to the petroleum giant Petrobras and $4 billion to the mining company Vale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bonus Pay on Wall Street Is Likely to Fall, a Report Says", "Date": "2015-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven as they emerge from the post-financial-crisis haze, bankers are seeing few signs that their institutions \u2014 and their bonuses \u2014 will stage a full recovery anytime soon.Bonuses in the financial industry this year are expected to fall 5 to 10 percent, according to an annual report being released Monday morning by the compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates. It is the first year since 2011 that compensation for the industry as a whole is expected to drop. There are still a few bright spots, including private equity and mergers-and-acquisition work, but most of the largest segments of the industry are struggling. End-of-year compensation in investment and commercial banking has been falling steadily and this year will be down 30 percent from 2009 levels, the Johnson Associates report predicts. Even asset management, a part of the industry that has been doing better, will experience a 5 percent drop in bonuses this year. Alan Johnson, founder of Johnson Associates, said many in the industry had been anticipating a rebound. This year, though, those hopes have been fading. \u201cWe kept expecting next year will be the year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t really happened \u2014 and I don\u2019t see it for the next three to five years.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the swell of demand that will bail us out here.\u201dBut the analysis from Johnson Associates, based on data from 30 or so of the largest financial institutions, is the latest reminder of the challenges facing the industry as it deals with a combination of new regulations, slow economic growth and increasing competition from new, technologically oriented competitors. In recent weeks, several European banks have announced major management changes and cutbacks after previously resisting such moves. New executives at Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Barclays have all talked about rethinking their basic commitment to the Wall Street businesses that were so lucrative a decade ago.Mr. Johnson said he expected that \u201cgoing forward, these companies are going to have to cut costs significantly.\u201dThe challenges depend on the bank and the quarter. But there are broader trends affecting all the banks to some degree. In recent months, turmoil in China was responsible for the chaos in the markets, which dragged down trading returns.Mr. Johnson said that several economies around the world had been performing worse than expected and in ways that seemed unlikely to turn around quickly, leading to less activity for banks.New rules since the financial crisis have also forced banks to maintain higher levels of capital to serve as buffers against future financial downturns.Keeping those capital levels up \u2014 often by raising money from shareholders \u2014 has made several businesses more expensive, especially the trading desks known as fixed income, where bonds, currencies and other assets are bought and sold.In the new Johnson Associates report, fixed-income bonuses are predicted to drop 10 to 20 percent this year \u2014 the sharpest decline of any part of the industry. Before the crisis, fixed income was one of the most reliable engines of profit on Wall Street.Generally, business lines that require less capital \u2014 often because they are less risky \u2014 are seeing better returns and bonuses. The most attractive segment of the industry has been the work of advising companies considering mergers and acquisitions, which tends to be about relationships rather than capital. For those bankers, the incentive payments this year are expected to be 15 to 20 percent higher.Advisory banking is what many people think of when they think of Wall Street, but it is a relatively small part of the industry and not enough to make up for the challenges elsewhere.The other business segment that banks have been emphasizing in recent years, in large part because it requires less capital, is the work of managing assets for such clients as wealthy individuals and large institutions. This year, though, even that business has struggled because of the tepid markets and economy, and bonuses are likely to be about 5 percent lower.Mr. Johnson said that because of the problems facing Wall Street, finance is losing its allure for the most talented young potential recruits, who are seeing better offers from tech companies in Silicon Valley. That used to be \u201csporadically true,\u201d he said.\u201cIn the last few years, it\u2019s become a real issue,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Year of Living Airbnb ", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlistair Cooke once described New York as \u201cthe biggest collection of villages in the world,\u201d and I dreamed of living in them all. That wanderlust, rather than my work as an academic physicist or diplomat, had compelled me to move constantly between continents with my wife, Elaine Kuok, for more than 15 years. Last fall, we decided to follow her art career as a painter and sculptor to New York and finally settle down. But after we had searched for a home to buy or rent long-term, Elaine realized she didn\u2019t want to take the plunge without first knowing the city and its neighborhoods better.Elaine said yes, her fears allayed by the service\u2019s safeguards. She liked that we could check out user reviews of our prospective hosts and in particular, Airbnb\u2019s policy of refunding your money or finding you a replacement if, within 24 hours of moving in, you realize the place isn\u2019t as advertised. And my wish to village-hop aside, I wondered if Airbnb could fundamentally alter the way we live, not just the way we travel. We initially focused on the downtown name-brand neighborhoods \u2014 Chelsea, West Village, SoHo \u2014 which happily also seemed to have the most Airbnb listings. We read the reviews closely, screening for noise and other potentially nasty surprises, from among the listings for places within our budget, which we based on the median rent in New York \u2014 roughly $100 a night, or $3,000 a month. A handful of hosts denied us, presumably because we were new to the Airbnb system and there were no host reviews of us as guests, another Airbnb feature. But finally, after a week of back and forth with hosts, we found a place just a few days before the date we wanted to move in.As winter set in, and while the bulk of our belongings made their languorous journey across the Pacific from Bangkok, we took our three suitcases to Chelsea for our maiden Airbnb foray. Here was artsy New York, where Sid and Nancy became Sid and Nancy, and from which an imposing branch of the Gagosian Gallery presides over the art world today. A residential neighborhood of walk-ups, cafes and rats, right in the center of it all, Chelsea epitomized our image of city living, a fitting first stop on our home-free journey.But as soon as we entered our one-bedroom rear-facing walk-up, we were struck by the smell of gas. Worried, we alerted our host, who came over and called the fire department. Within minutes, sirens drew near. Helmeted men burst into the apartment.\u201cSmells like garbage,\u201d said one. \u201cSpearmint,\u201d declared another.And they were gone. A shrug of the shoulders, and our host was gone, too. We set out bowls of vinegar, scattered charcoal briquettes, and dusted the floors with baking soda, to no avail. Defeated, Elaine bought a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s Chubby Hubby for consolation, but in a few hours it had turned to sludge \u2014 the freezer was warmer than the fridge.We enjoyed the homier experience of staying in someone\u2019s actual place at our next stop, on the north side of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, two blocks from where Frank Serpico was shot. A studio, it was decorated with Titanic-style suitcases, the leather boxlike kind made for voyages, not trips; a big white \u201cS,\u201d perhaps from the sign of a defunct drugstore; a big red \u201cO\u201d in a font that made me think of an old-time movie theater; a manual typewriter; and so forth. But beneath this vintage look was a morbid vibe. A fractured skull of some horned animal hung from the wall \u2014 could have been a deer, but I\u2019m no zoologist. A porcelain hand on a shelf grasped upward, suggesting a drowning man. The dark iron overhead light with its squirrel-cage filament bulbs screamed torture chamber. A window into our host\u2019s soul, or perhaps just the passing fashion. Williamsburg is set against a backdrop of exposed brick. The shops go overboard with individual touches, yet somehow they all look the same; the residents seem similarly afflicted. With some neighborhoods you wish you could stay longer, but a month here was sufficient \u2014 long enough to do a field study of hipster subspecies, to discover gems like Best Pizza (which really does have the best pizza) and to realize that having been born in the late 1970s, we were too old for this party.As the taxi pulled up to our next address, Hamsterdam of \u201cThe Wire\u201d came to mind. We were in an edgy part of Gowanus, an industrial strip in Brooklyn on the early side of transitional, centered on a canal so polluted it won a mention on the Superfund National Priorities List. There was no key inside the designated black shoe so, as instructed by our host, we used a credit card on the lock (accidentally jimmying the neighbor\u2019s lock first \u2014 without success, thank goodness) and found the previous occupant\u2019s suitcases still there, open. The central heating had apparently been broken for years and the weather forecast predicted a blizzard. When dealing with the frustrations of city living, it\u2019s nice to have folks on speed dial incentivized to help. Airbnb went beyond its 24-hour policy of issuing a refund for substandard accommodation, sending us by taxi to a swanky hotel in Times Square for the night, all expenses paid. It suggested some alternative listings, but we ended up finding a new place ourselves, and by the next day, we were on our way to the border of East Harlem and the Upper East Side. Our rear-facing prewar one-bedroom, where the couch sagged and the shower was in the kitchen, was as silent as a padded cell. Here, the heat blasted unbidden, from which we escaped by opening the windows to winter\u2019s coldest month. That first night, on the way to the corner store to get some food, we dodged mice scurrying between bags of trash. Back in the kitchen, Elaine fired up the stove by the bath towels, but when the pasta from the corner store hit the boiling water, a few little worms floated to the top. I skipped dinner that night. At one point, we took a trip back to my hometown in Alabama to escape the bitter cold and paying rent \u2014 a nice perk of living home-free. Our 108 boxes of household effects had arrived from Bangkok, and we realized we hadn\u2019t missed my heretofore cherished books, Elaine\u2019s cookware or the stacks of clothes we had accumulated over the years. We sold or donated the majority, storing only things of sentimental value in my parents\u2019 closets. Then it was back to trawling through Airbnb listings. Frustrated with the stock of apartments in our price range, I started contacting hosts of more expensive places, up to triple our budget. Whereas before only a handful had met our constraints, now there were dozens upon dozens. I spent hours sorting through these, each listing providing a glimpse at how people in this city live.I learned to recognize red flags. In addition to the hosts like the guy in Chelsea (you\u2019re probably looking at one if the same profile picture keeps popping up, or if the host has scores of reviews for other listings), and fifth-floor walk-ups (if you can\u2019t tell from the reviews or the photos, don\u2019t book until the host tells you what floor the apartment is on), drawn curtains and limited photos suggest spaces that might have something to hide. To the hosts of places that resonated, I would explain our back story, our home-free experiment, and ask if he or she would let us stay for a month for our budget or thereabouts. As E. B. White said, \u201cNo one should come to New York to live unless he is willing to be lucky.\u201dElaine was taken by the Peugeot pepper grinder and the toaster with a digital display counting down to crusty perfection. However, even this high-tech assistance and Le Creuset pots couldn\u2019t put her back in gourmet mode. It always takes her time to get going in a new kitchen, my sad sacrifice to the home-free lifestyle. Fortunately, I never tire of two of New York\u2019s finest attributes \u2014 its pizza and bagels.We were there on the cusp of spring, in time to watch the skeletons by the roadside slowly reveal themselves to be cherry trees \u2014 a glorious sight up and down the tangle of streets dotted with what looked like amazing restaurants (we wouldn\u2019t know because we couldn\u2019t afford them). Sumptuous though the West Village is now, I wish I had been there when it was the Bohemian mecca of Joseph Mitchell\u2019s writings \u2014 full of poets and artists. Would these natural wanderers have embraced this new home-free lifestyle or dismissed it simply as an indulgent take on minimalist living? Since Steinbeck\u2019s time, Fort Greene bottomed out with widespread crime and poverty in the 1970s and \u201980s, and now has come full circle to once again be a welcoming home for aspiring young writers.Next, we hit the jackpot in the East Village with space enough to dance in a subsidized co-op dominated by Chinese and Ukrainian old-timers. The common areas looked strictly institutional and occasionally smelled like pot, but our apartment windows framed a magnificent view over this varied city. The two bedrooms looked out to the Empire State and Chrysler buildings in the distance, and down upon the psychic on the corner; the balcony faced Alphabet City next door.We had been attracted to the East Village ever since a memorable dinner we shared with some new friends \u2014 a pleasant lesbian couple in their late 60s \u2014 at a tiny Thai restaurant in the area. Everyone there knew everyone else from decades of being neighbors. A 6-year-old customer, the very image of the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, made the rounds in the dining area and the kitchen where, from the sound of it, he was received with enthusiasm. Given our chosen lifestyle, it might seem strange that the rootedness of this community resonated with us. But looking back over the time that, together, Elaine and I moved between London and Paris, Tokyo and Bangkok, the southern tip of Africa and the high desert of New Mexico, I realize that I had always been rooted, just not by a fixed address.With the sharing economy, a home-free lifestyle is now becoming accessible to normal people, not just the superrich. And as out there as living this way may sound today, the city is replete with shareable stuff that was initially seen as bizarre: Uber and Citi Bike, for instance.Living home-free requires the right temperament. If I\u2019m anything to go by, it\u2019s a combination of wanderlust and an urge to diversify the risk of, say, being stuck next to a construction site.Elaine, on the other hand, sometimes finds this lifestyle disorienting, though fortunately she is anchored by a work space she found in Chinatown. She is a creature of habit and on more than one occasion has taken the wrong train, returning to one of our former abodes. While we laugh about that, what I do find disconcerting is that she no longer goes out of her way to connect with the community the way she used to \u2014 not getting to know the Bengali fruit sellers, the supers, the dog walkers, the crazies. Nevertheless, Elaine will tell you the constant change has honed her awareness of passing time and that she still prefers living this way to navigating the city\u2019s brutal rental market \u2014 unless you ask her when there\u2019s been another all-too-frequent 11th-hour cancellation. So although our experimental year has passed, our address is still Airbnb.There are times I miss thumbing through my books and being Elaine\u2019s guinea pig as she tested her way through stacks of recipes. Elaine sometimes longs to look through our photographs from the analog days. Yet, whenever we set off for the next place with all our possessions in a taxi\u2019s trunk, even Elaine reexperiences the catharsis we both felt when we first pared down our belongings. And I dream of the next adventure.David Roberts is a senior adviser at the Harvard Kennedy School.\u00a0He is producing two documentaries on Asia. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Student Debt in America: Lend With a Smile, Collect With a Fist", "Date": "2015-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe American student loan crisis is often seen as a problem of profligacy and predation. Wasteful colleges raise tuition every year, we are told, even as middle-class wages stagnate and unscrupulous for-profit colleges bilk the unwary. The result is mounting unmanageable debt.There is much truth in this diagnosis. But it does not explain the plight of Liz Kelley, a Missouri high school teacher and mother of four who made a series of unremarkable decisions about college and borrowing. She now owes the federal government $410,000, and counting.This is a staggering and unusual sum. The average undergraduate who borrows leaves school with about $30,000 in debt. But Ms. Kelley\u2019s circumstances are not unique. Of the 43.3 million borrowers with outstanding federal student loans, 1.8 percent, or 779,000 people, owe $150,000 or more. And 346,000 owe more than $200,000.This is partly a function of continuing economic hardship. But it also reflects how the federal government has become the biggest, nicest and meanest student lender in the world.Ms. Kelley, 48, first enrolled in college in 1990 at Maryville University, a private school near St. Louis. She was a nontraditional student, already married with children. She took out loans to help pay tuition, and by the time she graduated with a degree in English in 1994, the total was $26,278, which is the inflation-adjusted equivalent of about $42,000 in 2015. This is not an unusual sum. The typical private college graduate who borrows holds $32,600 in debt.Then as now, the job market was not clamoring for English majors. Practicing law and teaching seemed like the best options, and Ms. Kelley chose the former. Entering law school also allowed her to delay repaying her undergraduate student loans. She again borrowed for tuition, $37,000 for the first three semesters, which is also a fairly typical amount. Law school graduates today often have six-figure loans.But then Ms. Kelley experienced her first real piece of bad luck. She became ill with a life-threatening autoimmune disease, requiring a lengthy hospitalization. She dropped out of law school and ultimately chose not to return. But she still owed the money, in addition to her undergraduate loans, which had been accumulating interest. She rolled the two loans together, which now added up to $68,518, at an annual interest rate of 8.25 percent.Ms. Kelley decided to go into teaching, which meant graduate school back at Maryville. She had four children and a husband who worked, so in addition to borrowing for tuition, she took out extra loans to pay for child care. This is a legal and common practice. Students can take out federal loans to pay for the full cost of attending graduate school, including both tuition and living expenses such as food, rent, transportation and child care. Ms. Kelley\u2019s husband was also a borrowing student at the time, but she took out all the child care loans.Ms. Kelley found work as a teacher at a public school. To be eligible for the highest possible salary, she needed additional graduate work, which she borrowed to complete. By staying enrolled in graduate school from 1999 to 2004, she was able to again put off repaying her older loans. But the interest charges continued, compounding every year. Graduate school and child care added $60,700 to the principal.For those keeping track, the loans totaled $194,603 by April 2005.Ms. Kelley\u2019s husband worked in the construction industry. In 2005, the family moved to Laredo, Tex., following the great American housing boom. The Great Recession was devastating. Facing home foreclosure, Ms. Kelley cashed out her public teacher retirement funds, despite the stiff penalty. But it wasn\u2019t enough. In 2008, she and her husband lost their home, and they divorced.Ms. Kelley was now several years out of graduate school, and the loans were due. But the federal government allows a borrower to defer payments for up to three years in the case of an economic hardship, which Ms. Kelley certainly had. She consolidated her loan balance, which had grown to $260,000, at slightly more than 7 percent interest.By this time, Ms. Kelley\u2019s children were reaching college age. One received a financial aid package that included $12,000 in Parent PLUS loans, a federal program that allows parents to borrow money for their children\u2019s college education after the children have reached the maximum on loans of their own. She agreed, hoping to minimize her children\u2019s debt. She briefly enrolled in an education Ph.D. program at Texas A&M before withdrawing, but not fast enough to avoid an additional $7,458 in loans.Eventually, Ms. Kelley moved back to Missouri, where she found work as a high school teacher in a parochial school. After resolving a long, contentious child care fight with her ex-husband, she finally felt financially stable enough to tackle the pile of student loan documents that had been accumulating. After her loan deferment ended, she enrolled in another, similar federal program called forbearance, also because of an economic hardship. The hardship this time was the loans themselves.A representative from Ms. Kelley\u2019s loan servicer called this September, explaining that her final forbearance would expire in 16 months. After that, Ms. Kelley said, they told her they would \u201ccome after her,\u201d garnishing her wages and eventually her Social Security. She had taken out her first student loan 25 years earlier and had yet to make a single payment.She also had not come to grips with how much it had added up to in the end.The $410,000 total shocked her. The accumulated interest was more than twice the original principal. She was in a new relationship, but remarriage was impossible \u2014 who would attach themselves to that much debt? Because she had stayed home with her children for many years, she had contributed relatively little to Social Security. Her public teacher retirement fund was gone, along with the equity in her lost home. She, not her ex-husband, had borrowed for child care.At age 48, she wanted to begin saving for retirement. But the monthly loan payments of $2,750 stretched for 30 years, far more than she could afford and long past retirement age.Over the next 11 months, Ms. Kelley will accumulate more in interest charges than she borrowed for her entire undergraduate degree. She would like to go bankrupt, but federal law all but precludes that method of discharging student loans.\u201cI am not a victim,\u201d said Ms. Kelley, who shared her loan documents with me. \u201cI made choices.\u201dBut her story is more complicated than that. It reveals the deep contradictions in the federal government\u2019s approach to student loans.People have always had a difficult relationship with debt. Access to capital is the fuel of a modern economy. Borrowing for college is often a good idea, because it represents an investment in human potential in a time when brainpower is the most valuable asset most people own. But there\u2019s a reason debt is often grouped with sins and frailties in ancient moral codes. Borrowing is risky, financial decisions are not always rational, and people often do a poor job of properly weighing the interests of their present and future selves.The private enterprise system is built to limit overborrowing by sharing risk between lenders and borrowers. Lenders examine credit and income histories and ask for collateral that can be repossessed in case of default. They charge more interest when they take on more risk. Because most loans can be discharged in bankruptcy, lenders share the cost of default. It\u2019s likely that Ms. Kelley\u2019s mortgage lender lost money on her 2008 foreclosure, for example.But the federal student loan program doesn\u2019t work that way. Those ads that run on bus stop signs and on late-night television \u2014 \u201cNo Cash? No Credit? No Problem!\u201d \u2014 are essentially the Department of Education\u2019s official policy on student loans.On the front end, the department is the world\u2019s nicest, most accommodating lender. Interest rates are set by Congress and are lower than banks charge in the private market. Borrowing for college is essentially an entitlement \u2014 as long as you\u2019re enrolled in an accredited college and aren\u2019t in arrears on a previous student loan, it doesn\u2019t matter how much debt you have or how little money you make. Undergraduate loans are capped to contain borrowing and college costs, but graduate loans are bound only by the vague limits of \u201cliving expenses.\u201dPrivate lenders also don\u2019t let people defer making payments for years or decades at a time.A private sector lender approached by a potential borrower with no assets, a modest income and $350,000 in debt who had never made a payment on that loan in over 20 years would not, presumably, lend that person an additional $7,800. But that\u2019s exactly what the Department of Education did for Ms. Kelley in 2011. Legally, it could do nothing else.Our culture also encourages a great deal of trust in colleges. When people walk onto a used-car lot, they generally understand that promises of easy credit are just another tool for a slick salesman to close a deal. The local university and the Department of Education, by contrast, are assumed to have students\u2019 best interests in mind.Pro-student organizations support low interest rates, no credit checks and lengthy deferment options, as do colleges that can\u2019t stay solvent without debt-financed tuition. Individually, these policies have merit, just as not repaying a student loan is often a perfectly rational choice in the short term, right up until the point when the short term becomes long. For some people, it hardly seems like debt at all.When the loan bill finally comes due, the federal government transforms into a heartless loan collector. You don\u2019t need burly men with brass knuckles to enforce debts when you have the Internal Revenue Service. It is both difficult and illegal to hide money from the federal government, which can and will follow you as long as you live.The government acts this way because the federal student loan program has been removed from the norms and values of prudent lending. Because the Department of Education doesn\u2019t consider risk, it takes no responsibility. If life, luck and bad choices leave you $410,000 in the hole, it\u2019s all on you.Most college students don\u2019t end up like Ms. Kelley. They pay back their loans and enjoy the fruits of their degrees. But most pack-a-day smokers don\u2019t die of lung cancer. And most people who bought cars with Takata airbags from 2002 to 2008 weren\u2019t killed by shrapnel from explosions. Nevertheless, we still regard small risks of catastrophic outcomes as problems to be solved.In the meantime, Ms. Kelley feels hopeless. She understands how she got here. But, she says, \u201cthere ought to be a way out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turning Renters Into Buyers ", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesThe upward trajectory of rents in many metropolitan areas, which shows no sign of abating, often makes homeownership the better deal. But renters still aren\u2019t rushing to buy.Real estate listing and lender websites are awash in charts and mortgage calculators aimed at persuading renters that they can cut their monthly costs by buying a home. The problem is, \u201cincreasing rents have a very paradoxical effect on the housing market,\u201d said Ralph McLaughlin, a housing economist at Trulia, the real estate information site. \u201cRising rents make it a relatively better deal to buy, but it also makes it more difficult for households to save up for a down payment.\u201dIn calculating the cost differences, Trulia assumed home buyers put down 10 percent of the purchase price, got a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.85 percent, and would stay in the home for five years.The areas where buying is the better deal by far \u2014 upward of 40 percent cheaper \u2014 include Houston; Baton Rouge, La., and New Orleans; Syracuse, N.Y., and Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.The gap is smaller in hot markets in California, like San Francisco and Sacramento, as well as in the New York metropolitan area, where it is 11 percent cheaper to buy, the report says. However, most New York City lenders require at least 20 percent down, which lowers the monthly payments but calls for more cash up front.In a September survey of 1,000 renters conducted for TD Bank, more than half said their rent had increased within the last two years. The average monthly increase was $288.Fifty percent of those surveyed reported that they were likely to buy a home within the next two years, citing rising rents and a desire to build equity. But an equal share said they either hadn\u2019t saved enough money or had too much debt to buy now.\u201cIt\u2019s really about wage increases,\u201d said Ray Rodriguez, the regional mortgage sales manager in the New York area for TD Bank. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep up with the increases in rents and home prices.\u201dStill, Mr. Rodriguez said that renters\u2019 hopes to buy were realistic given the improving economy and the availability of mortgage programs requiring very low down payments. TD Bank\u2019s first-time buyer program for low- to moderate-income households, for example, requires only 3 percent down.Mr. McLaughlin of Trulia said he does not expect the homeownership rate to rise much, however, until the so-called millennial generation \u2014 often defined as between ages 18 and 34 \u2014 starts forming its own households, marrying and having children in greater numbers.\u201cThose are three things that millennials are taking their sweet time to do,\u201d he said.The Mortgages column last Sunday, about renters who are not rushing to buy homes, gave an incorrect percentage from TD Bank for the down payment it requires for its first-time buyer program for low- to moderate-income households. It is 3 percent, not 2 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The October Jobs Numbers Are a Big Relief", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportWell, that\u2019s a relief.Of course there is no reason to think there was a radical yo-yo effect that caused the economy to add a mere 137,000 jobs in September but a whopping 271,000 in October. Similarly, there is no reason that the number of people who neither had a job nor were looking for one spiked and then fell, or that pay increases came to a halt around Labor Day only to begin soaring again in the run-up to Halloween. More likely the United States job market has been improving at the same relatively gradual pace the last couple of months and, frankly, all year.Instead, what we\u2019ve probably just witnessed is a classic study in the challenges of making sense of the fortunes of a $17 trillion economy with 157 million workers in real time.While all the focus on the first Friday of every month is on the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 estimate of how many jobs employers added or cut during the preceding month, that\u2019s not really what it\u2019s tallying. It\u2019s trying to count up all the jobs on American payrolls. In October, its best estimate was that there were 142.654 million jobs; in September the estimate was 142.383 million.But because financial markets and central bankers and economics reporters really only care about the delta \u2014 the change from month to month \u2014 it is easy to let a couple of months\u2019 random gyrations make a person unreasonably optimistic or unreasonably pessimistic depending on a coin flip of whether in a given month the official data somewhat overstate or understate the strength of the job market.The Federal Reserve now appears fairly likely to raise interest rates in December, barring a reversal in the economic data in the next six weeks, and Janet Yellen\u2019s refusal to back away from those rate hike plans after a handful of soft economic reports looks better after the blockbuster October numbers than before.So with the good October numbers added to the pile, here is a theory about the state of the economy: There is a big divergence between the industrial sector, where companies that are exposed to a strong dollar, slowing economies in emerging markets and low oil prices are being hammered, and the broader job market and consumer economy in the United States, which is pretty much fine.Sometimes the headlines coming out of those sectors of the economy where things are tough dominate, and that helps explain a stock market sell-off back in August. Other times, the underlying reality of a solid job market and consumer economy dominates, which helps explain the market rally in the last month.With the end of the year approaching, the American economy seems to be what we thought it was: solid over all, but with some weak spots that become more obvious the closer you look.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrat Wins Mississippi House Race After Drawing Straw", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Sometimes American politics is about ideas, powered by Jeffersons and Adamses and Reagans. Sometimes it is about strategy, with races determined by the chess-match machinations of Axelrods and Roves.But every once in a while, the fate of governments is determined by a considerably less eminent character, one usually found lurking in back-alley craps games and on the Vegas strip: Lady Luck.In Mississippi on Friday, luck smiled on a Democratic state representative, Blaine Eaton II, who had been forced, by state law, to draw straws for his seat after his race for re-election ended in a tie. On Friday afternoon, in a short, strange ceremony here presided over by Gov. Phil Bryant and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, Mr. Eaton and his Republican challenger, Mark Tullos, each removed a silver box from a bag. Mr. Eaton opened his box to reveal a long green straw.And with that, a mathematically improbable tie for the House District 79 seat \u2014 each candidate had received exactly 4,589 votes \u2014 had been broken, though not by the voters.Moments after winning, Mr. Eaton, who raises cattle and grows timber and soybeans, attributed his win to a farmer\u2019s luck. \u201cThere\u2019s always happiness in a good crop year,\u201d he said.A lawyer for Mr. Tullos said that a challenge had been filed with the State House of Representatives. Mr. Tullos, a lawyer himself, declined to comment but had said he planned a challenge if he lost the draw. He had cited concerns about the way a county election board handled nine paper \u201caffidavit ballots\u201d filed by voters who believed their names were erroneously left off the voter rolls.Resorting to a game of chance to break an electoral tie is common in many states, and coin tosses are often used to settle smaller local races. But in few instances had the pot been as rich as this: If Mr. Tullos had won, his fellow Republicans would have gained a three-fifths supermajority in the State House of Representatives, the threshold required to pass revenue-related bills.At stake, potentially, was hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. The three-fifths requirement has allowed the Democratic minority to block Republican tax-cut proposals in the past on the grounds that Mississippi needs the revenue to finance schools and other services. Republicans, who also control the State Senate and governor\u2019s mansion, say the cuts, including a proposal to phase out the state\u2019s corporate franchise tax, will jump-start the economy and promote job growth.District 79 is a rural chunk of farmland and piney woods about an hour\u2019s drive east of Jackson. Mr. Eaton, 48, had not threatened a challenge if he lost, but, like his opponent, was not happy with the way the race was decided.\u201cIt\u2019s wrong \u2014 philosophically, morally,\u201d Mr. Eaton said before Friday\u2019s drawing. \u201cIt\u2019s archaic, it\u2019s medieval, and it\u2019s wrong. We need a new election.\u201d He repeated the sentiment even after winning and said that he hoped to co-author a bill to change the law that settles some elections by the drawing of lots.The mere fact that the election came to this is one of a long string of disappointments for Southern Democrats, who once ran the region as a virtual one-party zone but whose power has collapsed in recent years. In every state south of Virginia, Republicans control the governor\u2019s mansion and both chambers of the legislature. In 2011, Mississippi Republicans won a majority in the State House for the first time since Reconstruction, and increased their numbers in voting this month. If Mr. Tullos had won, he would have been the 74th Republican in the House out of a total of 122 seats.Mr. Eaton, a gregarious and proudly homespun man, met a reporter Wednesday morning at the Huddle House in his hometown, Taylorsville, and tried to make light of the forces of history, and perhaps fate, that appear to be arrayed against him.\u201cIf I lose the coin toss, it\u2019s going to be kind of like that Hank Williams Jr. song, \u2018Dinosaur,\u2019\u201d he said, and he recited a few lyrics: \u201cI should\u2019ve died a long time before,\u201d he said.Another line: \u201cExcuse me, man, but where\u2019s the door?\u201dIf nothing else, the drawing of straws was a fittingly civilized conclusion to a race that was run with exceeding small-town politesse. The men know each other, and both are well known among the voters in District 79, which encompasses Smith County and part of Jasper County.\u201cI told Bo\u2019s wife when I qualified that she\u2019d never hear a bad thing come out of my mouth about her, or her husband, or her family,\u201d Mr. Tullos said.Mr. Eaton has served in the House for 19 years, occupying a seat formerly held by his grandfather, a pine-belt populist who was also named Blaine Eaton and was known as \u201cthe silver-tongued orator of Sullivan\u2019s Hollow.\u201dAfter the tie, Mr. Eaton originally said that he hoped to call a special session and change the law. Later, though, he resigned himself to the outcome of Friday\u2019s draw.\u201cLook, my life\u2019s a gamble,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a farmer. I depend on the weather and the rain. The statute\u2019s clear, but my life is not.\u201dMr. Tullos\u2019s law practice is about 20 minutes up the road in the county seat of Raleigh, a small town where many things \u2014 a small park, offices, a dental clinic \u2014 conspicuously bear his family name. He said he went door to door with a campaign that did not emphasize Republican Party talking points so much as a promise to bring more business to the area.Smith County, he said, lacks a retailer where one can buy a decent pair of shoes. \u201cI want to go to Jackson, and whenever they start talking about economic development, I want to hold up my hand and say, what about this district?\u201d Mr. Tullos, 51, said before Friday\u2019s drawing.Some Democrats wondered whether the Republican-controlled House would be able to impartially judge the matter. On Thursday, Greg Snowden, the Republican House speaker pro tempore, predicted that \u201cevery member of the House will treat this with the utmost seriousness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a game,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France, Paradise Lost", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParis \u2014 WHEN I moved to France 12 years ago, it was like arriving in an unfriendly paradise. Sure, hardly anyone spoke to me. But there was national paid maternity leave and free preschool. Practically everyone seemed to agree on the need for strict gun laws, and access to birth control and abortion. Not only did the whole country have health insurance; most undocumented immigrants could get medical and dental care free. (Cruelly, their thermal bath cures weren\u2019t covered.)I also came to appreciate the way the French think, as explained by Sudhir Hazareesingh in his aptly named new book, \u201cHow the French Think.\u201d How could I resist a country where rappers mention Rousseau, philosophy is a compulsory subject in high school and ordinary people point out the duality in everything from outfits to marriages?As a journalist, I marveled at people\u2019s capacity for abstract thought. When I interviewed Parisians about infidelity, many began by asking whether \u201cfidelity\u201d meant being faithful to your partner, or to yourself. The French believe \u201cthey have a duty to think not just for themselves but also for the rest of the world,\u201d Mr. Hazareesingh writes.All that thinking can have an admirable moral mission. When hundreds of thousands of refugees fled Vietnam in the late 1970s, France\u2019s pre-eminent intellectuals \u2014 led by Jean-Paul Sartre and Raymond Aron, who had been feuding for decades \u2014 teamed up and pleaded with the French president to help. \u201cThese are men in mortal danger whom we must rescue because they are men,\u201d Mr. Sartre said at a news conference. (They were also fleeing a former French colony.) France took in nearly 130,000 \u201cboat people\u201d from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.That influx, and others like it, have helped make France a nation of immigrants. Nearly a quarter of the population has at least one foreign-born grandparent.Of course I fretted about the rise of the far-right National Front, and the fact that many sub-Saharan and North African immigrants \u2014 and their descendants \u2014 are marginalized.But what the headlines don\u2019t say is that daily life in Paris, and in most French cities, is also full of pleasant multicultural experiences. My local cheese stand is owned by a Moroccan lady who\u2019s married to a Serb. My children have public-school classmates who speak Chinese, Italian or Arabic at home. At my twins\u2019 recent birthday, a table of kids descended from Greek, Lebanese, Portuguese and American immigrants insisted on singing \u201cLa Marseillaise.\u201dSo when hundreds of thousands of migrants began arriving in Europe, I assumed that France would be welcoming.It wasn\u2019t. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said in September that France would take in an additional 24,000 refugees over the next two years. In a national poll afterward, 70 percent of respondents said 24,000 was \u201csufficient\u201d or \u201cvery sufficient,\u201d and half said they would refuse to accept refugees in their own city.To put that in perspective: The International Organization for Migration estimates that some 724,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year. Many others have arrived by land. Germany expects to receive at least 800,000 asylum seekers this year.France\u2019s strategy is apparently to be so unwelcoming that most migrants won\u2019t want to stay. The French refugee camp known as the Jungle has swelled to about 6,000 people, most of whom aspire to get to Britain. When French officials went to Munich in September to bring the first of the new refugees to France, their buses returned half empty.What happened to the nation that thinks for the world?Prominent intellectuals have turned rightward or spoken out against helping refugees. Sartre was a global star. Today\u2019s thinkers are mostly known inside France, where they appear alongside actresses on prime-time talk shows.Politicians seem to have decided that there\u2019s nothing to be gained from a big humanitarian gesture. Every party is getting tougher on immigrants, to reclaim voters from the National Front.And there\u2019s the elephant in the room (the French call this the \u201chidden face of the iceberg\u201d): the fact that most of the migrants are Muslim. In a 2013 government survey, just 65 percent of respondents said French Muslims are \u201cFrench like others,\u201d down from 80 percent four years earlier.But France has also gotten worse. What once seemed like adorable grouchiness or \u201cbleak chic\u201d has morphed into something darker: a willingness to believe that people are walking here from Aleppo for free root canals; a sense that \u2014 despite being the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy \u2014 France is powerless to help more.At this point, the French even seem unhappy about how negative they\u2019ve become. A positive approach to refugees would probably energize them. As it stands, France can no longer claim to have a universal message. These days, it\u2019s just a flawed, ordinary country that mostly thinks for itself.Pamela Druckerman is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

In fact, his methods were extreme: More than 100 civilians were killed, at least some by sniper fire. It remains to be seen whether Russian special forces were imbedded with Ukrainian security forces under Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s authority, as Ukrainian officials have suggested. At best, his tactics were encouraged by President Vladimir Putin; at worse, the Russian leader was complicit.Russia\u2019s backing of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine has also been tragic: The Dutch Safety Board has concluded that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile, allegedly launched from separatist-controlled territory; the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in September that nearly 8,000 people have been killed in the conflict in eastern Ukraine from mid-April 2014 through Aug. 15.While the United States and its NATO allies seek to contain Russian aggression in Ukraine and elsewhere, as former Ambassador McFaul advocates, we should be mindful of whom we are dealing with.

His father, Pierre Trudeau, formalized the concept of a multicultural Canada, and it was under his influence that our nation came to be a moral arbiter in the Western Hemisphere. Respect and cultural engagement have defined Canada\u2019s distinct approach to Latin America and the Caribbean. In our cynical age, a period in which we instantly receive information and dismiss it just as quickly, it is a relief to see that Mr. Cohen is among those columnists who recognize the significance of ideals \u2014 the imperative of leaders who aspire to embracing the better angels of our nature.Justin Trudeau\u2019s elevation to prime minister resonates around the hemisphere, not just for his sunny outlook on the future of Canada but also for his real understanding of the lives of the people he will serve. Demographics are fast-changing, a point that should be noted by Republicans in the United States. Divisive politics earns no more than a few points in any national poll. Mr. Trudeau has shown there is a better way.Re \u201cReinventing the library\u201d (Opinion, Oct. 24) by Alberto Manguel: I strongly disagree with the elitist notion that libraries must remain repositories of the past rather than open places to explore the future. The primary purpose of the library is to provide access to information, which is essential to advancing individual opportunity and community progress. In short, libraries are not just about what we have for people, but what we do for and with people. Today\u2019s libraries are committed to advancing a legacy of reading while developing a more digitally inclusive society. This isn\u2019t a deviation from the foundation of the library; it\u2019s an evolution that reflects the ways in which providing access to the Internet, e-books, 3-D printers and employment services are essential to helping people thrive in a digital world.

Aquino III of the Philippines, Mr. Obama, who was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, said he had had \u201crepeated discussions\u201d with Mr. Putin about the two militaries working more closely together.\u201cThe problem has been in their initial military incursion into Syria, they have been more focused on propping up President Assad,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that \u201cIf in fact he shifts his focus and the focus of his military, to what is the principal threat, which is ISIL, then that is what we want to see.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s comments are the most direct indication that the United States is prepared to work with Russia to counter the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.The president suggested that American officials remained skeptical about whether Mr. Putin would shift his focus toward the terrorist group, even in the wake of the Paris attacks.But he said that the Russians have been \u201ca constructive partner\u201d during diplomatic talks in Vienna last week, where foreign ministers agreed to a path to a cease-fire in Syria and an eventual political transition.Mr. Obama added that there was a \u201ccatch\u201d to that cooperative spirit, saying that \u201cMoscow is still interested in keeping Assad in power.\u201dHe said, however, that \u201cthose differences have not prevented us at looking at how could we set up a cease-fire.\u201dAlexander V. Bortnikov, the head of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, said investigators estimated that the bomb that brought down the Metrojet Airbus A321, killing all 224 people aboard, was made of up to 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of TNT. He added that \u201cforeign made\u201d explosive material had been found in the wreckage.In remarks to Russia\u2019s Security Council on Monday and broadcast on Tuesday morning, he said that \u201cwe can say definitely that this was a terrorist act.\u201dAn \u201cimprovised explosive device\u201d detonated soon after the plane took off, Mr. Bortnikov said, adding that \u201cthe plane disintegrated in midair, which explains the widely scattered fuselage pieces.\u201dEgyptian officials have repeatedly asserted that it was premature to conclude that an act of sabotage had destroyed the Russian jetliner, with some saying such an explanation was part of an international conspiracy against their country. But Egypt\u2019s position has become harder to maintain in recent days as the Russian government, one of its closest allies, gave increasing indications that it believed a bomb was the most likely cause. The Russians moved to sever almost all air connections with Egypt.On Tuesday, after hours of silence following the Russian announcement, Egyptian officials seemed to be gingerly walking back their denials. Egypt\u2019s civil aviation minister said the committee investigating the crash had \u201cnot arrived at any criminal evidence,\u201d but a statement from the Interior Ministry included the possibility of a \u201cterrorist attack,\u201d while announcing enhanced security measures at airports.\u201cThis is the first time that the Egyptian authorities admit the possibility that whatever happened to the Russian plane was a terrorist attack,\u201d said Mustapha Kamel al-Sayyid, a political science professor at Cairo University and the American University in Cairo. While the change was \u201cnot easy\u201d for the Egyptian government, he said, it appeared to reflect an attempt to avoid a rift with the Russians.The Russians did not acknowledge that the Islamic State had planted the bomb. But the Russian attacks that followed on parts of Syria held by the Islamic State, presented in the live television briefing, left no doubt that the Russians were intent on showing they blamed the group.Russia fired 34 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean, hitting more than a dozen targets in Aleppo and Idlib, said Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the Russian military\u2019s chief of staff.Military aircraft, including long-range bombers flying from Russia, flew 127 sorties, hitting 266 targets and destroying 140, the defense minister said. The Russian Air Force deployed in Syria has flown almost 2,300 combat missions since the attacks started 48 days ago, General Gerasimov said.\u201cWe will search for them everywhere, no matter where they are hiding,\u201d Mr. Putin said at a meeting with his security council broadcast on television. \u201cWe will find them in any place on the planet and will punish them.\u201dReporting was contributed by Kareem Fahim and Merna Thomas from Cairo, Eric Schmitt from Washington, Michael D.

{"Headline": "Behind Puerto Rico\u2019s Woes, a Broadly Powerful Development Bank", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf anything stands as a symbol of how Puerto Rico ended up mired in billions of dollars of debt, it is an oceanside golf resort going to seed some 15 miles east of San Juan.Known until this month as the Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, it was built as a for-profit venture, subsidized by federal taxpayers and backed by the island\u2019s powerful Government Development Bank, which sold to investors and guaranteed repayment of more than $50 million in tax-exempt bonds.Despite the Trump name, which the former owners licensed from the billionaire investor and now presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, the resort failed to attract enough golfers since the first tee-off in 2004.This year, it went bankrupt. (Mr. Trump was not involved in the financing or operation of the club, but he is a creditor.) Then, about a week ago, a buyer scooped up the property, wine cellar and all, for a mere $2.2 million and is rushing to get it ready for a Professional Golfers Association tournament in March, a nationally televised event and a point of pride for Puerto Rico.The name \u201cTrump\u201d is being removed from the signs, to be replaced by \u201cCoco Beach.\u201d A spokesman for the buyer said it was committed \u201cto making this a showcase for the island and the community.\u201dBut the new owner, OHorizons Global, a private investment firm based in San Juan, did not take over the existing debt. The Government Development Bank is still making payments on the bonds that are outstanding; the last one is due in 2034. The deal and how it came to be provide telling insight into the workings of the Government Development Bank, which is responsible for managing the $72 billion in debt that the island has amassed \u2014 and says it cannot hope to repay. Although it has so far defaulted on only a tiny portion of the debt, the next test comes on Tuesday, when the bank is scheduled to make a $354 million bond payment. It will not yet say whether it can or should meet the deadline.Even if it does, however, it faces a series of legal and tactical challenges through December, with another major test on Jan. 1.Deals like the golf resort are not the only reason the Government Development Bank has found itself at the center of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial jam. But it is an example of how the bank helped borrow on behalf of public and private enterprises over the years, then ended up with much of the debt, even when deals failed to fulfill their original purpose: the development of Puerto Rico.\u201cGuarantees are good when you have a good venture,\u201d said Melba Acosta Febo, the president and chairwoman of the bank. A lawyer and Harvard-trained accountant, Ms. Acosta is also now serving as a kind of financial magician, making cash appear as needed and staving off most defaults, at least for now.In an interview in New York last week, Ms. Acosta acknowledged that even she found the \u201cdebt stack\u201d confusing and called the golf venture \u201ca great example\u201d of how things had gone wrong.\u201cBut this is just one example,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have many failed ventures that have not been able to pay their debts.\u201dIt is not clear how long her particular brand of magic can continue. Puerto Rico has been warning that it is running out of cash, and Ms. Acosta said the \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d she had been using to produce cash so far were unsustainable. The measures include delaying people\u2019s tax refunds, borrowing from the island\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation fund, forcing community credit unions to hand over their cash in exchange for i.o.u.s, and now, even considering whether the island should withhold millions of dollars in holiday bonuses to government workers and retirees.The bonuses are paid just in time for Christmas shopping. But the benefit is not only to consumers. The sales tax revenue from the year-end rush to spend helps fill the government\u2019s coffers, and some is dedicated to making bond payments. \u201cUsually we get that back,\u201d Ms. Acosta said, explaining how a government outlay of more than $120 million in bonuses could be justified, even during a financial crisis.The bond payments due on Tuesday are for principal and interest on debt issued by the development bank, but guaranteed as a general obligation by the island\u2019s government. That puts them near the top of Puerto Rico\u2019s hierarchy of credits.People briefed on the situation say that Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, who must make the final decision, has revealed almost nothing about his intentions. He traveled to Europe last week, partly to court investors. The governor\u2019s trip came in the midst of a cacophony of advice flowing his way about how to steer Puerto Rico out of its crisis.\u201cThe decision matrix is like choosing whether you want to die by cyanide or by hanging,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the governor\u2019s dilemma, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything as complicated as this.\u201dSome advisers are said to be urging the governor to play by the rules, make the payment on Tuesday and build good will in Congress, which holds the keys to what could be Puerto Rico\u2019s ultimate salvation: access to bankruptcy courts. As a United States territory, it cannot legally take shelter from its creditors in bankruptcy; the law explicitly excludes it. Yet many officials on and off the island believe meaningful debt relief is possible only in bankruptcy and have been calling on Congress to amend the law and give access to at least part of the island\u2019s government.On Tuesday, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will hold a hearing on the bankruptcy question, the latest in a series of hearings intended to consider help for Puerto Rico.But other advisers to the island\u2019s government have been urging the governor to default on the debt, saying that only a catastrophe would move Congress \u2014 especially Republicans \u2014 to help. \u201cWe need Chapter 9,\u201d said Ms. Acosta, referring to the bankruptcy chapter used by cities and other local governments. \u201cGive us the tool and we will finalize what we are doing.\u201dMs. Acosta said the enormous financial quagmire facing the bank was inextricably tied to its history as a unique institution on United States-controlled soil.The bank was founded in 1942 by Rexford G. Tugwell, who was appointed governor of the commonwealth by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Puerto Ricans have elected their own governors since 1948.) Its mandate was to foster development, primarily by financing electricity at a time when the island was known as \u201cthe Poorhouse of the Caribbean,\u201d with an economy based almost entirely on sugar cane.But after an unrelated financial scandal three years later, the bank was given tremendous new powers: to advise the government on transactions, to vet and restructure bond deals, to hold public money in trust, to borrow money for other government agencies, to lend its own money to those agencies, to finance private enterprise, and any number of other powers meant to ensure that the island was not cheated by commercial banks on the mainland.\u201cYou\u2019re really not going to find any similar entity in any state,\u201d Ms. Acosta said.States typically decentralize their financial activities. But even today, Puerto Rico tends to run everything through the Government Development Bank. Its job is \u201creally a combination of things that the Treasury, the New York Fed and a development bank like the Inter-American Development Bank do,\u201d she said.Puerto Rico\u2019s per capita income doubled from 1950 to 1960. And after Fidel Castro\u2019s revolutionaries took control of Cuba in 1959, Washington put Puerto Rico on a pedestal, extending minimum wage laws to the island and tax breaks to corporations willing to set up shop there, and parading its \u201cShowcase of Democracy\u201d before the world.But even after the growth cooled, the borrowing continued.\u201cThe problems started when the Government Development Bank started lending for deficit financing instead of capital improvements,\u201d Ms. Acosta said, \u201cand when it started lending to entities that didn\u2019t have a source of repayment.\u201d In theory, it was illegal for the development bank to grant loans to borrowers that had no way to pay them back.\u201cThe law didn\u2019t include the public corporations,\u201d she said, referring to the big, free-standing government enterprises that provide crucial services like electricity, drinking water and road maintenance. \u201cThat loophole explains the amount of the loans that were given.\u201dMs. Acosta recalled that when she became Puerto Rico\u2019s budget director, in 2001, she was shocked to learn of $4 billion of loans from the development bank to various government agencies on the island.\u201cWe were like, \u2018$4 billion! Oh, my God!\u2019 And we went out to the market and we started to repay it,\u201d she said.But when she returned to government as the Treasury secretary in 2012, the bank\u2019s loans had grown to $10 billion.Some of the loans were to companies; others were to local governments on the island that could no longer borrow on their own. The capital markets were still happy to do business with the Government Development Bank, not just because of its high level of sophistication, but also because it could structure bond deals that were remarkably easy to sell. Not only was there that constitutional guarantee, but Puerto Rico\u2019s legal status as a territory allows it to pay interest that is exempt from federal, state and local taxes to investors in all 50 states.Today, given its financial straits, Puerto Rico could not borrow to make the coming bond payments even if it wanted to. It may have to get the cash by raiding government programs.At the new Coco Beach golf course in Rio Grande, meanwhile, grass is being planted, fresh sand spread in the sand traps and updated furnishings installed in the clubhouse. The new owners expect to be ready when the world\u2019s top golfers show up to compete for a $3 million purse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nordic Countries, Overwhelmed by Migrants, Retreat From Generous Traditions", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAASEPORI, Finland \u2014 Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland, countries that long set the standard for welcoming refugees from war and persecution, are rapidly rethinking their generosity as the tide of migrants to Europe strains their budgets and roils their politics.The welcome mat will not be quite the same, either. Sweden decided last month to offer only three-year residence permits to many new asylum seekers rather than permanent status. The change was part of agreement the government had to make to get the votes it needed on a new budget.On Friday, Denmark \u2014 which had already slashed benefits to new arrivals by about 50 percent, added language requirements and extended the waiting period for permanent residency \u2014 announced further restrictions. The changes include allowing the police to search asylum seekers\u2019 luggage for cash or valuables that could be used to help pay for their stays, , and requiring refugees to wait longer to bring family members to Denmark. Norway has said it will cut benefits to refugees by 20 percent, increase the wait for permanent residency to five years from three and send people back if the situations improve in their home countries.Finland, faced with mounting numbers of asylum seekers from Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia, announced last month that it now considered some areas of those countries safe and began negotiations with the home countries to step up deportations. Finnish officials then issued news releases in Arabic with details of the new policies.\u201cWe are not telling them not to come,\u201d said Jorma Vuorio, the director general of Finland\u2019s Migration Department. \u201cBut we are telling them that this is not paradise.\u201dThe changing attitudes are evident to citizens of those countries and to the migrants. In the scramble to find housing for the growing number of asylum seekers, Finland has turned to old army barracks, vacant hotels and even places like the sprawling union training center here, with its saunas, pool tables and idyllic lakeside views.But on a recent evening, there was plenty of grumbling to be heard here. Some asylum seekers said they were bored, too far from stores and unable to make do on the $100 monthly allowance they were each getting in addition to free housing and meals.\u201cIf I had known it would be like this, I would have gone somewhere else,\u201d said Ameer, a 27-year-old Iraqi, who sought out a reporter to complain but did not want to give his last name.But whether the new, less welcoming posture will help is unclear. A few days after Finland made its most recent announcements, the number of migrants entering the country dropped slightly, and officials took credit for the change. But by the end of October, the numbers were rising steeply again.In a news release last week, the Finnish Ministry of the Interior warned that the country would soon have to resort to putting asylum seekers in tents and containers. The ministry also said that about two-thirds of the new asylum applications would probably be turned down.Despite worsening weather, the human stream crossing from Turkey to Greece and then traveling north shows only small signs of abating. In October, more than 150,000 people, the majority of them Syrian, made the journey, compared with fewer than 8,500 in October 2014, according to Frontex, the European border agency. Germany, a country of about 83 million, continues to be the favored destination and could have a million asylum seekers by the end of the year, while hundreds of thousands have headed to the much smaller Nordic countries.In Finland, the numbers started to climb at a startling pace in August. Already 27,000 asylum seekers have arrived this year, prompting officials to predict at one point that the number could reach 50,000 before the end of the year.But many officials say such predictions are little more than a guess at this point, and polls suggest that Finns are particularly worried because the migrants, arriving mostly through the border with Sweden, are coming at a time when the country\u2019s economy is in the doldrums, jobs are scarce and the government has outlined more than 4 billion euros, or $4.31 billion, in wide-ranging cuts over the next four years.Sampo Terho, a member of Parliament whose populist Finn Party (formerly known as the True Finns) is part of the governing coalition, said people in a market square had recently asked him, \u201cHow can it be that we are doing cutbacks for citizens, but we seem to have an unlimited budget for migrants?\u201d\u201cThat is a very difficult question to answer,\u201d he added. \u201cThe man asking that question is my voter. The asylum seeker is not, for the moment.\u201dAs the Nordic countries cut back, each has been carefully watching the others, mindful of setting standards in line with its neighbors so as not to end up as a more attractive destination.Some experts say that despite their long tradition of humanitarianism, the Nordic nations are simply facing facts.\u201cThey realized they had reached the political limit of what could be done,\u201d said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, the president of the Migration Policy Institute of Europe. \u201cThis is going to cost an untold amount of money, and these countries are not wealthy like Germany. They had to turn back.\u201dIn recent weeks in Sweden, various political parties have suggested adopting a raft of new restrictions to stem the migrant flow, with the Christian Democrats even advocating the building of transit camps on the border.\u201cWe are hearing new suggestions from political parties every 10 minutes,\u201d said Livia Johannesson, an expert on migration politics at Stockholm University. \u201cYou really can\u2019t keep up with all the suggestions.\u201dMs. Johannesson said polls indicated that most Swedes remained proud of the country\u2019s commitment to welcome the needy. But the country may be paying for its high-mindedness, with few of their neighbors inclined to help them. \u201cI think some of our neighbors are saying: \u2018You Swedes, you always want to be best in the class. Now you have to deal with it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.At the former training center here, some asylum seekers, most of whom are from Iraq, said they had researched their options when they decided to make their way to Finland. They believed it was more lenient in accepting asylum applications from their country. But some said they had come to Finland simply because Germany seemed too full.And some, like Rasha Ibrahim, a 30-year-old teacher who came from Baghdad with her husband and two children after a bombing killed her mother, said they had no idea where they were going when they put themselves in the hands of smugglers. \u201cI just said, \u2018Take us to a safe place,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.While others complained about being more than an hour\u2019s drive from Helsinki with no jobs or educational opportunities in sight, she said she could not be more delighted with the beauty and the quiet of the center.Ameer, who said his parents had financed his journey to Europe because he had gotten into an argument with a Baghdad militia leader, said that he was tired of sitting around and that he wanted a job or to go to school.\u201cIt would be like heaven to go on vacation here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are learning nothing right now. Most of us do not have our own money. I went to the store, and my aspirin was \u20ac10. The allowance they give us is not enough.\u201dAlready, Finnish officials say, 1000 Iraqis have decided to return home since the beginning of the year.Johanna Lemola contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Partnership Text Released, Waving Green Flag for Debate", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The release on Thursday of the full text of President Obama\u2019s trade accord with 11 Pacific Rim nations brought out opponents and supporters and officially opened what may be the last big battle of the president\u2019s tenure: winning congressional approval of the largest regional trade deal in history.The opposition mainly came from the left, as an array of unions, environmental groups and public advocacy organizations that typically resist global trade agreements registered their dismay. But some businesses, like Ford Motor, also joined the emerging resistance to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The reaction confirmed that in this final fight, Mr. Obama will have to rely on the Republicans who control Congress if he is to sell the legacy-making agreement in the months before the House and Senate vote next spring. Republican leaders were withholding endorsements for now, leaving the president to make the case on his own.The accord ties together countries from Canada to Chile and Japan to Australia that account for 40 percent of the world\u2019s economy. While the 12 nations\u2019 trade ministers concluded the agreement a month ago, after years of negotiations, Mr. Obama said that the disclosure of the details now should build support. He cited the agreement\u2019s labor and environmental protections, the end of many tariffs and trade barriers among the countries, and expanded markets for American goods and services.\u201cIt eliminates 18,000 taxes that various countries put on American goods,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat will boost Made-in-America exports abroad while supporting higher-paying jobs right here at home. And that\u2019s going to help our economy grow.\u201dHe cited the strategic as well as economic advantages of a trade alliance that would counter a rising China, which is not a party to the agreement.\u201cWhen it comes to Asia, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing regions, the rule book is up for grabs. And if we don\u2019t pass this agreement \u2014 if America doesn\u2019t write those rules \u2014 then countries like China will,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world.\u201dThe president\u2019s post on Medium came hours after the United States trade representative first released the 30 chapters, side agreements and other attachments that make up the voluminous accord in the middle of the night, simultaneous with other nations doing so.Also on Thursday, he officially notified Congress of his intent to sign the agreement in 90 days, a period specified by law to give the House and Senate time to begin deliberating over its terms. Congress has additional time beyond that to debate and vote on legislation to enact the agreement.Final action is expected by perhaps May, ensuring that Congress\u2019s debate will occur against the backdrop of a presidential campaign in which leading candidates of both parties already have gone on record against the accord.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democrats\u2019 nomination, said the trade text was proof that the accord \u201cis even worse than I thought\u201d \u2014 a threat to American jobs, food and product safety and access to affordable drugs, for the benefit of international corporations and third-world countries.Without naming Mrs. Clinton, who last month announced her opposition to the agreement, Mr. Sanders summoned the phrase she once used as secretary of state to hail the emerging Pacific accord. \u201cIt is clear to me that the proposed pact is not, nor has it ever been, the gold standard of trade agreements,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.The Obama administration is hoping that the accord\u2019s labor protections, along with separate bilateral agreements on labor and human rights between the United States and Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, will help persuade some Democrats to back the deal. The administration is especially eager to promote its agreement with Vietnam, which commits its communist government to change its laws to allow workers to freely unionize and to strike, not just for better wages and hours but also for improved working conditions and other rights.\u201cWithout reservation, I think this is the best opportunity we\u2019ve had in years to encourage deep institutional reform in Vietnam that will advance human rights, and it will only happen if T.P.P. is approved,\u201d Tom Malinowski, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said in an interview.The organization where Mr. Malinowski formerly worked, Human Rights Watch, is among the skeptics who say Vietnam\u2019s commitments are unenforceable, especially given the track record of the United States trade office. John Sifton, the group\u2019s Asia advocacy director, said workers should have been given the same right that corporations have under this trade agreement and others: to take complaints about a country\u2019s compliance directly to a dispute settlement panel.\u201cAre trade unionists who actually produce all the capital that we\u2019re talking about here allowed to bring complaints against a country for violations?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201dFor the first time as part of a trade accord, the Pacific partners agreed in a \u201cjoint declaration\u201d to avoid manipulating the value of their currencies for trade advantage, to report interventions in foreign exchange markets and to meet annually to hold one another accountable. The language did not persuade some Democrats \u2014 or Ford, which broke with other big businesses supporting the agreement \u2014 that it would prevent Japan and other countries from intervening to underprice their exports unfairly.The annual currency forum \u201cdoes nothing to change the status quo,\u201d Ford said in a statement, adding, \u201cIt fails to include dispute settlement mechanisms to ensure global rules prohibiting currency manipulation are enforced.\u201dWhile the Obama administration played up environmental standards included in the accord as precedent-setting, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council were among groups that came out in opposition, calling the language weaker than in trade pacts negotiated during the George W. Bush administration.Other advocacy groups, including Doctors Without Borders, cited language that would give pharmaceutical companies up to eight years of intellectual property protections before their data is available for production of lower-cost generic drugs.That has put the administration in a bind: Those protections, while too long for health care advocacy groups, are shorter than the 12 years the big drug companies currently enjoy. That has angered drug company allies in Congress, especially Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade. Without Mr. Hatch\u2019s support, Senate approval could be impossible.The senator was noncommittal on Thursday, promising only a \u201crigorous review\u201d of the pact. Also staying neutral was the new House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cWe do not rubber-stamp anything around here, let alone trade agreements,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters at the Capitol.videoAdvertisement"}

We need a wider variety of indicators to help us take a more accurate reading of the economy. Some of these might seem frivolous, but paying close attention to worldly detail could make forecasting more reliable.Take women\u2019s fashions, for instance. One playful theory, born in the days of flapper dresses in the 1920s, is that the height of hemlines provides a surprisingly good indicator of the state of the economy. Long skirts are associated with hard times; but when the economy booms, as in the \u201920s or \u201960s, skirts get shorter. So if you see skirts sweeping the floor next season, it might be time to start worrying \u2014 assuming there\u2019s a discernible fashion trend.The hemline is only one of myriad indicators that economists have used to divine prospects for growth. Another anecdotal measure is the number of cranes visible on the skyline, their stately dance a prominent visual signal of the underlying pace of construction activity.Spending on luxury items is another example. During a boom, sales of fast cars, expensive paintings, prime real estate and diamond necklaces all soar, as do their prices. A chart of prices realized on modern art at auctions looks like the stock market. One well-known index, the Modern Art 100, rose by two and a half times in the two years before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008; it then lost half its value in 18 months.Less obvious are trends in retailing. When the good times roll, people decide that their great idea for a specialty store is viable. Thus booms bring all those boutiques selling just one type of good: socks or scented candles or freshly squeezed juices. But like flowers that display the behavior known as nyctinasty \u2014 opening to the sun\u2019s light and warmth \u2014 they close as soon as the skies darken and things start to cool.Anarchists in East London were onto the symbolism of such retailers when they recently attacked a cafe selling solely breakfast cereal varieties for about $5 a bowl. No matter that it was a struggling small business, to the anti-gentrification protesters it was catering to the decadent tastes of the 1 percent.There are other indicators we\u2019re all familiar with, such as how easy, or otherwise, it is to get restaurant reservations or tickets for shows (box office grosses for Broadway shows have been climbing steadily since 2008). It used to be that the difficulty of finding a cab was another sign \u2014 but one whose usefulness may be being eroded by competition from Uber; perhaps the prevalence of surge pricing is its modern counterpart.One of my favorites is how many \u201chelp wanted\u201d signs appear in the windows of stores and restaurants. While nobody collects these statistics, the impressionistic evidence can amplify formal data about vacancies. These have been on an upward trend since early 2010, pointing toward employers\u2019 being so desperate for workers that, even in these times of online job search, they\u2019re willing to hire someone who walks in off the street.All these signs, statistical or anecdotal, tend to be clearest when the economy is growing fast, because they reflect spending that is sensitive to the state of the business cycle. Economists working in governments and central banks need indicators that give prompt warning of the trends, supplementing these with informal signs that can act as early alarm signals. By the time official stats are available, the last wave of specialty stores will have closed down \u2014 then it\u2019s too late either to cool the boom or to temper the recession quickly by adjusting interest rates or using fiscal measures.Better yet would be signals that can foretell the future of the economy, but there are fewer of these \u201cleading indicators.\u201d One of the earliest attempts to predict the business cycle looked at the pattern of sunspots. The British economist William Stanley Jevons argued in 1875 that sunspot activity was linked to subsequent weather patterns, and this in turn affected corn harvests. That sounds bizarre now, and was never a successful forecasting tool, but it was a not unreasonable attempt in an economy far more reliant on agriculture than ours is today.Since then, stock markets have been the classic leading indicator, as investors are supposed to foresee the economic trends \u2014 with every incentive since they\u2019re betting on them. But these days, greater skepticism about the rationality and efficiency of financial markets has undermined confidence in their predictive power.Still, another standard financial sign of an impending downturn is the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, known as the yield curve. Normally, this has an upward slope because investors need a higher return the longer their money is tied up. However, if they expect the economy to weaken soon, and the Federal Reserve to respond by cutting interest rates, the yield curve will slope down.This held true before the 2008 financial crisis: There was a negative yield curve for months. The problem was that hardly anybody paid attention to it. (At present, the yield curve bends reassuringly upward.)Of course, the one figure that everyone takes seriously as a key economic barometer is the quarterly change in G.D.P. Yet it is one of the least useful. It lags events, is frequently revised and provides no meaningful detail.It cannot tell us, for example, how people on low incomes, as well as high ones, are doing; nor how Nevada is growing compared to Massachusetts. G.D.P. almost certainly fails to capture newer areas of economic activity, such as today\u2019s digital innovation \u2014 so other sources of information are needed to fill the gap. Commentators sometimes say that steering the economy using G.D.P. data is like driving a car using only the rearview mirror.So economic policy makers usually scrutinize tens, or even hundreds, of indicators, covering different industries and assets, different parts of the country, different groups of people. They monitor jobs reports, advertising rates, wage settlements, the cost of shipping freight, asset prices, sales of consumer durables and much, much more. The White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, for example, uses about 200 indicators.No forecasters have a consistently good track record, but the best supplement their statistics and computer models of growth with informal evidence. To get an accurate picture of the economy, the wise economist uses something like an artist\u2019s pointillist technique \u2014 individually, all those tiny dots make little sense, but together they provide a decent portrait of the whole.That\u2019s why it can pay for economists to check the skyline and skirt lengths as they stroll around the city.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ride-Sharing Apps Bring Back Car-Pooling", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsJACK DeMANCHE\u2019S commute to work was like many in the Boston area \u2014 long. But that was before Mr. DeManche, a digital strategist for an advertising agency, began sharing a ride with other commuters with the service Bridj.Now, the hourlong trip from his home in Brookline to his office at the Boston seaport has been cut in half. And at $70 a month, he estimates that the trip costs less than using the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.\u201cThe ability to book a week in advance is a time-saver,\u201d he said. He is guaranteed a seat, he can use Wi-Fi on board and the van drops him off a block from his office.Bridj is just one of the new services that are helping to redefine car-pooling.Long the province of shift workers headed to the same factory and suburban parents who drove children to after-school activities, car-pooling is getting an urban makeover as technology becomes more prevalent and a younger work force relies on mobile devices.\u201cThis is the most exciting development in car-pooling in decades,\u201d said Joseph Schwieterman of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University in Chicago.In the last 15 months, Uber and Lyft have introduced shared rides in Austin, Boston, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington through UberPool and Lyft Line. Cars or vans sporting names like Split (sections of Washington only) Via (sections of Manhattan only) Bridj (rush hours in Boston and Washington) and Carma, which also runs in Chicago, Houston, San Diego and Seattle, also compete. Some ride-sharing apps are available internationally as well.\u201cThey\u2019re very specific to niche transportation needs,\u201d said Tony Dutzik, a senior policy analyst at the Frontier Group, a research company in Boston.The new services come after a long decline of car-pooling. According to a report released by the Census Bureau in August, car-pooling fell to a low of just over 9 percent in 2013, the last year for which figures are available, from nearly 20 percent in 1980. About 76 percent of people who traveled to work drove alone in 2013, according to the report.Christopher Koopman, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, gained firsthand experience in the sharing economy. After landing at Reagan National Airport in Washington, he considered the traditional options: taking a taxi or riding on mass transit. In the end, he used UberPool, a recent venture by Uber that offers shared rides on demand.Although the trip to his office took a detour to a hotel to drop off his traveling companion, the price of the ride fell to $8, from $12 if he had ridden solo.\u201cIt was cheaper in terms of cost, slightly more in terms of time,\u201d he said of the 15-minute ride.No one riding in these vehicles would mistake being on a fixed transit route. Algorithms match cars with riders going in the same direction. While UberPool and Lyft Line offer door-to-door pickup, Via and Bridj require passengers to walk a short distance to catch transportation. Bridj, for example, operates during rush hours and creates pop-up transit stops to meet demand, according to the company\u2019s chief executive, Matthew George.The praise isn\u2019t universal. To Mr. DeManche, Bridj\u2019s algorithms aren\u2019t as sophisticated as he would like. \u201cThe tech system is not able to understand traffic patterns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t predict traffic and volume of traffic.\u201dMr. George said in an email that Bridj\u2019s algorithm took into account factors like traffic and how long it took to pick up other passengers.Split, the Washington service, uses its algorithm to calculate the most direct route based on the destination of passengers.\u201cYou tell us where you are and where you are going,\u201d said Split\u2019s chief executive, Ario Keshani. The company charges a $2 base fee and $1 for each additional mile.Other services may be cheaper and cover a wider area. Carma\u2019s chief business officer, Paul Steinberg, said that service charges $1 for the first mile, 20 cents a mile until 15 miles and then 8 cents thereafter.Even if passengers find a ride-share service they prefer, its success is not assured, as users of Leap in San Francisco recently discovered. It charged riders $6 to get across San Francisco. Buses were luxurious, with wood-trim interiors, individual USB UBS ports and Wi-Fi. But in May, shortly after it began operations, Leap received a cease-and-desist letter from the California Public Utilities Commission. The company did not comply with the conditions of its original approval and is now in bankruptcy.Experts say this lack of collaboration with state and local officials may be the exception.\u201cElectronic car-pooling is getting tremendous adoption among cities open to allowing these services to operate to try to manage congestion,\u201d said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared-Use Mobility Center in Chicago.Whether car-pooling will expand to other cities is unclear. \u201cThere are only a handful of cities where people live and work along densely populated corridors,\u201d Mr. Schwieterman said. Bridj, however, said it had plans to enter Kansas City early next year in a partnership with the city.Others have doubts about an expansion as well. \u201cEmployment clusters are less geographically concentrated than they once were, so people who live near one another are less likely to be headed in the same direction,\u201d Brian McKenzie, the author of the Census Bureau report, wrote in an email. Still, smartphones have presented a more efficient way to organize commuters based on where they live and work.Mr. Koopman sees an upside. \u201cI can come and go as I please, without it being the product of someone else\u2019s collective schedule,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Easton, Conn.: Embracing a Farming Culture", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In14 PhotosPatti and Allan Popp didn\u2019t move to the rural town of Easton, Conn., to take up farming. They were simply searching for more privacy than they had at their previous home in Stratford. Ms. Popp happened to fall in love with a 1740 house in foreclosure along one of Easton\u2019s main routes, Sport Hill Road.But within a few years of arriving in town in 1997, Ms. Popp, who worked as an office manager for a doctor, and her husband, a landscaper, decided to take a gamble. Ms. Popp\u2019s employer was retiring, and she was ready for something new. So, like many Eastonites before them, the Popps would try to earn a living from the land.The community has \u201cwelcomed us here,\u201d Ms. Popp said, \u201ceven though we are one of the newer farms.\u201dEaston\u2019s peaceful, rural feel was the primary draw for Angenette and Bill Lynch, who moved from Stamford with their two children last year. Ms. Lynch grew up in a small town in upstate New York, and Easton felt familiar.When a four-bedroom house went on the market right next door to one of Mr. Lynch\u2019s cousins, the couple jumped, paying slightly more than the asking price, to get it. Mr. Lynch\u2019s commute into New York City, where he is chief operations officer for the Specialty Food Association, is longer, \u201cbut this location checks all his boxes in terms of where he wants to be living,\u201d Ms. Lynch said. And they are happier with the public school system in Easton; in Stamford, they paid for parochial school.What You\u2019ll FindAlthough Easton covers 27 square miles, it has only around 2,500 households, which makes it far less dense than the rest of the county \u2014 274 people per square mile, versus the county average of 1,468, according to state calculations. Easton is not on the Metro-North rail line, so New York City commuters typically drive to the station in downtown Fairfield.Many residents work at the headquarters of General Electric, which sits just outside Easton\u2019s border in Fairfield. The company\u2019s announcement earlier this year that it is considering relocating outside Connecticut is a source of concern, although the effect of a move on the local housing market would depend on where G.E. relocated and whether the company moved some or all of its offices, said Gayle Worthington, an agent with William Raveis Real Estate who lives in Easton.Lower Easton \u2014 defined as the section below the blinking yellow light in the town center at Beers and Sport Hill Roads, according to Ms. Worthington \u2014 has mostly one-acre zoning. Upper Easton has three-acre-minimum zoning.There are no condominiums or apartment complexes. A controversial proposal by the Saddle Ridge development company for 99 housing units, a portion of them affordable, on about 124 acres in the three-acre zone is on appeal in state Superior Court, having been turned down by the town\u2019s planning and zoning commission, said Adam Dunsby, the first selectman, who acts as the town\u2019s chief executive.What You\u2019ll PayThe roughly 120 homes on the market earlier this month were priced from $450,000 to $2.9 million. The bulk of the properties fell between $600,000 and $1 million.The number of sales was down about 12 percent this year as of the end of September compared with a year earlier, according to Ms. Worthington. The median sales price of $595,000 is up slightly over last year, but is still 22 percent below the market high in 2006, she said.Properties in Lower Easton tend to sell more quickly because of their proximity to Fairfield and the Merritt Parkway, said Kelly Higgins, an agent with Coldwell Banker. But over all, buyers who choose Easton are usually seeking more house for their money, relative to towns on the rail line, and a small-town lifestyle, she said.What to DoEaston has a senior center, a public library and a community center, which has a rock-climbing wall and a fitness center.The members-only Easton Racquet Club has tennis courts and a swimming pool.The SchoolsThe CommuteThe drive to the station in downtown Fairfield takes 15 to 25 minutes. Travel time to Grand Central during peak hours runs from around 70 to 90 minutes. A monthly rail pass is $354.76 purchased online.The HistoryAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Elections in Myanmar, Citizens Express Desire for Change", "Date": "2015-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe heard from voters about their excitement, and their concerns about many of the pressing issues, including civil war and education, the country faces today. A number of respondents also expressed support for the National League for Democracy, the opposition party led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has long been a symbol of democracy in the country, formerly known as Burma. Here is a selection of the responses. They have been edited and condensed for clarity.The Momentum of the Whole CountryI have high hopes for the N.L.D. to win. I don\u2019t think the current leaders in charge would go as far as a coup because the people would not stand for it. If they go as far as spilling blood, people will also spill their blood. It would not be easy for them to stop the momentum of the whole country.\u2014 Myo Min Soe, 28, MandalayFreedom in the AirYou can really see the change and feel the progress and freedom in the air in Burma/Myanmar.I hope for political stability that allows our country to rebuild the economic and social institutions, eventually lifting the population out of poverty and crucially creating an educated and productive voting population that can thrive in today\u2019s world.I am extremely concerned that the N.L.D. is still running on an any-change-is-good platform with very little articulation of policy and strategy for the future of the country, which is desperately needed. They will attract both the popular and protest votes, but revolutionaries rarely make good governments.We have had six decades of isolation, and severe underinvestment in education and infrastructure. This is a critical moment, and I fear that one more decade will result in the country not being able to recover at all.Instead of perpetuating the isolation and xenophobia through sanctions, I would urge the international community to engage regardless of the election process and result. Intended punishment of the few at the top is resulting in heartbreaking punishment of the entire nation, especially of the many at the bottom.An End to Civil WarI hope this election will bring a benefit for all ethnic groups in Myanmar. I think the people are ready to vote and choose a leader even though the situation is getting tough for those who live in southern Shan State.Currently, there is a civil war between the Myanmar troops and the S.S.A. (Shan State Army) in Shan. Many children have left school because of the war. I just feel so sorry and sad for those who are not going to be able to vote. I just hope that they could stop the war and come talk to each other.Fears of UnrestI am so happy that our country has come this far. Despite some voting restrictions, this free election allows the people to raise their voices, share their opinion on the parties freely and vote for the party of their choice. This is wonderful!I hope, from the election, we have a change in system, like new water in a new glass, not old water in a new glass.My immediate concern is civil unrest. I hope, whichever party wins, the election will end peacefully.We do have many major issues like environmental deterioration, a poor education system, the economy, health and so on. But the civil war is my top priority. I hope there will be more cease-fire agreements soonest, not only on paper but also off paper. I hope the next government, either a new or old one, takes greater and more effective action on this issue.This is my first time voting. I cannot wait to cast a vote for the party of my choice and I cannot wait even more for the result.\u2014 Khin Myat Mon, 22, YangonA Commitment to ChangeMy hope from this election is to see real change no matter who wins.The previous years have been a buildup to this moment, but this will be a defining one. This will be a moment when everyone decides that the Myanmar government is committed to change for the better.Of course, this does not come without the fear that civil unrest will follow the election results. If that happens, it is saddening. People as well as officials need to learn the real meaning of democracy.The biggest issues facing this country are tolerance, lack of appreciation for diversity and blind trust. People do not question what they hear or see. These issues can be resolved through education reform and economic reform.\u2014 Kaungset, 26, YangonOur Eyes Had Been Closed for 50 YearsFor the real change we all will vote for the N.L.D., which is the strongest party in Myanmar, led by Aung San Suu Kyi. She is the only one who can bring democracy for Myanmar.We had our eyes closed for over 50 years. We had poor education for years.We need to open our eyes now. We need a better education. We need good communication with the world\u2019s countries.\u2014 Hein Htut Aung, 17, YangonA Hope for Big ChangeAll citizens hope for big change. Today the main issues are health and education.\u2014 Khin Ohnmar Aung, 38, YangonI really hope this election will be honest and ethical as the current government has promised. However, we have seen many immoral and unethical actions they have committed (such as voting issues in Myanmar embassies in foreign countries). Additionally, we might also have to question the neutrality of the election council.A Fear of RiotsMy biggest fear is state-sponsored riots.\u2014 Than Tun, 25, YangonvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Republicans Still Love the Gold Standard", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn Tuesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, Senator Ted Cruz reintroduced an idea that had many viewers scratching their heads and nearly all economists pulling out their hair. Mr. Cruz advocated a return to the gold standard \u2014 that is, tying the value of a dollar to a set amount of gold \u2014 because, he said, it produced prosperity under the Bretton Woods system and it helped \u201cworkingmen and -women.\u201dMr. Cruz is confused about history and economics. The framers of Bretton Woods specifically designed their new international monetary system not to be a gold standard because they believed gold-based currency was largely responsible for the Great Depression. Their system, named for the New Hampshire town hosting the 1944 international conference that created it, was not a gold standard but \u201cthe exact opposite,\u201d according to John Maynard Keynes, one of the system\u2019s principal designers. Under Bretton Woods, nations were not obliged to set monetary policy according to how much gold they had, but rather according to their economic needs.Leaving his historical errors aside, Mr. Cruz is not the only Republican presidential candidate to express admiration for the gold standard: Senator Rand Paul and Ben Carson have, too. The gold standard has long been a pet cause among some conservatives (it was hinted at in the 2012 Republican platform) and has gained credence among mainstream Republicans as a tool to limit government influence over the economy.But a return to the gold standard would be catastrophic, especially as we continue the climb out of our Great Recession. That is because, as the framers of Bretton Woods knew, the course of an economy depends not only on what happens, but on what people expect will happen.Under a gold standard, the amount of gold a nation holds in bank vaults determines how much of its money circulates. If a nation\u2019s gold stock increases through trade, for example, the country issues more currency. Likewise, if its gold stock decreases, it issues less.Gold as currency has obvious problems. First, there is relatively little of it while there are more people and goods all the time. So in the long term, the gold standard exerts a downward pressure on prices as money becomes relatively tighter and its value increases. If prices continue to decline, people are less likely to spend their money. After all, if you believe that the price of, say, shirts will continue to drop, you\u2019ll delay splurging on haberdashery.With enough time, the gold standard can create a deflationary spiral that brings an economy completely to a halt \u2014 which is what happened in the Great Depression. It was for this reason that Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard in the first days of his presidency, declaring that he would make the dollar into a \u201cmanaged currency\u201d the value of which policy makers might increase or decrease in response to economic need. In giving policy makers the power to regulate the money supply as they saw fit, Roosevelt created the expectation of a turn toward inflation, giving people reason to spend more money in the short term. (As Keynes observed, inflation causes problems, too, but at least it encourages spending, while the expectation of deflation can \u201cinhibit the productive process altogether.\u201d)Recovery began as soon as Roosevelt took office in March 1933, and his use of the dollar to spark recovery created the basis for the adoption of managed currencies around the world. Eleven years later, Bretton Woods gave multiple currencies fixed but adjustable rates. Nations now had precisely the freedom the gold standard denied them, to use monetary policy to regulate their economies. (The United States dollar had a nominal value in gold of $35 an ounce but the country was not obliged to set monetary policy according to how much gold it had.)Mr. Cruz correctly notes that the world economy enjoyed decades of prosperity under Bretton Woods, but that happened without a gold standard, not because of one. Why is a discredited policy now attractive to Republicans? The gold standard suits a political moment. Tying the dollar to an arbitrary quantity of shiny metal binds policy makers\u2019 hands, robbing them of their discretion to act: The central bank can\u2019t adjust the money supply to counteract crises or prevent them. These limits, for many Republicans, are good things. The gold standard is essentially the monetary equivalent of a government shutdown.A new Bretton Woods might be a good idea, to encourage greater international cooperation on monetary issues, but a gold standard is not, as nearly all economists agree. Even the mainstreaming of gold-standard talk can have bad consequences, should its proponents gain the ability to pressure central bankers to tighten the money supply, as a gold standard would oblige them to do. A return to the good old days of gold could leave us vulnerable to precisely the outcome Bretton Woods was intended to prevent: another Great Depression.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fewer Golfers, but Some Lush Courses Are Coming Back", "Date": "2015-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetBOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 Weeds, crabgrass and fallen palm fronds cover the wildly overgrown greens of what was once the Mizner Trail Golf Club, its decrepit state emblematic of the fate of hundreds of golf courses around the country, many of them derisively known as \u201crabbit patches\u201d or \u201cgoat farms.\u201dA short drive away, however, perspiring construction workers in yellow vests swarmed on a recent afternoon over the emerging structure of a 150,000-square-foot activities center, part of a $50 million renovation of the 44-year-old Boca West Country Club, home to some 6,000 residents, where fairways are newly planted and houses sell for as much as $5 million.With the winter golf season beginning in Florida \u2014 the nation\u2019s leader in golf courses with more than 1,000 \u2014 the extremes of failure and success point to a nationwide upheaval in the sport. It was booming when players like Tiger Woods reigned, but has since been roiled by changing tastes and economics, an aging population of players, and the vagaries of the millennial generation\u2019s evolving pastimes.There are about four million fewer players in the United States than there were a decade ago, according to the National Golf Foundation. Almost 650 18-hole golf courses have closed since 2006, the group says. In 2013 alone, 158 golf courses closed and just 14 opened, the eighth consecutive year that closures outpaced openings. Between 130 and 160 courses are closing every 12 months, a trend that the foundation predicts will continue \u201cfor the next few years.\u201dDozens of private and public golf courses here in South Florida, and hundreds around the country, are in transition. Some courses have sought bankruptcy protection, while others have slipped into foreclosure. Many are under construction, with single-family homes and condominiums going up on land once dotted only with pin flags, sand traps and water hazards. Others have gone to seed as they await resolution of legal and zoning disputes.Many clubs have survived by lowering sign-up fees and other costs, reducing the number of playable holes, and offering family-friendly amenities and activities that go far beyond hitting a ball with a 9-iron.\u201cSome courses are adapting, others are just not,\u201d said Paul H. Chipok, a lawyer in Orlando who specializes in land-use and environmental issues. \u201cIt costs $100,000 a month to operate an 18-hole golf course \u2014 mowing the grass, fertilizing, regular maintenance. And that\u2019s not including capital improvements. You need a lot of green fees to cover that.\u201dAt private courses, members may be willing to pay more if necessary \u201cbecause they expect a certain level of service,\u201d Mr. Chipok said. \u201cBut courses that are open to the general public may not have the money to keep up their maintenance, and with less maintenance, the courses look worse and so they have to charge less to play on them. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. This is the correction phase we\u2019re going through now.\u201dLesley Deutch, a senior vice president in the Boca Raton office of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, said the \u201cold model\u201d of private golf clubs with high initiation fees and \u201cvery exclusive\u201d memberships is in decline.\u201cI don\u2019t think the industry is over,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just changing.\u201dIn South Florida, where buildable land is fast disappearing, developers see golf courses as wasted space. Vast swaths of land that were once pristine courses in the middle of residential communities are becoming highly exploitable territory \u2014 prime opportunities for profits much greater than what fairways and putting greens can provide. As a result, the fallout of the downturn in the sport has been felt most keenly by residents of communities where the holes are no longer being played, primarily because the value of their homes often drops markedly once the course has closed.\u201cThere are big issues, and they\u2019re being fought and litigated,\u201d said Steven M. Ekovich, a broker based in Tampa, Fla., who represents sellers of golf courses. \u201cHomeowners paid a 20 or 30 percent premium for a golf-course lot, and suddenly a developer comes in and wants to build in front of them. There are big fights over that.\u201dA few miles south of here, in Tamarac, the owner of the Woodmont Country Club, Mark Schmidt, faced stern opposition from some of the club\u2019s homeowners to his plan for the course, which involved reducing the 36 holes to 18, putting up a four-and-a-half-acre commercial center, and building 152 single-family homes \u2014 in addition to the 1,900 houses already there. The plan was ultimately approved last year, but city officials have since balked at the owner\u2019s proposal to build a 120-room hotel on the site.\u201cThere\u2019s always resistance,\u201d said Mr. Schmidt, who bought the Woodmont property 10 years ago. \u201cThe cost of operating a golf course today is very difficult, so the land is being put to better use. As much as some people lost their views, others have gained better views. No point in allowing the land to remain fallow.\u201dLike other golf club owners who foresee an upside in expanding their offerings, Mr. Schmidt said he was building a new clubhouse and fitness center, as well as a new swimming pool. \u201cWithout these adjustments, golf would be in desperate trouble,\u201d he said of the industry in general. \u201cThis is an absolute necessity.\u201dTo prevent similar headaches on another property in Tamarac, the 275-acre Colony West Golf Club, the city itself bought the course in a 2011 short sale for $3.3 million. \u201cWe wanted to control the real estate,\u201d Michael C. Cernech, the city manager, said of the championship course, which opened in 1971. Under a five-year contract, management of the course was turned over in 2013 to the Virginia-based firm Billy Casper Golf, which runs about 140 courses nationwide.Michelle F. Tanzer, a Boca Raton lawyer who represents resort developers and owners and sits on the board of the National Club Association, has helped country clubs adapt to what she said is growing demand for fitness facilities, resort-style pools, water parks and improved dining choices in places where previously only golf was the norm. The golf industry, she said, is \u201cdoing much better than it\u2019s looked since 2009.\u201dThe Boca West Country Club\u2019s heavy investment in its facilities, Ms. Tanzer said, \u201cis a perfect example of adapting\u201d to the changing economics of golf. \u201cThey\u2019re spending a fortune on making the place family-friendly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a home run.\u201dAt Boca West, where it costs new members $70,000 to sign up, Jay DiPietro, the club\u2019s 78-year-old president and general manager, suggested that the troubles besetting some of his competitors could be blamed on poor management and on their focus on \u201cthe business of selling houses.\u201d But he operates on a different principle, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re in the people-pleasing business,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people paid a lot to be here.\u201dIn any case, Mr. DiPietro said, the golf industry was vastly over-supplied with courses. \u201cIt was just waiting for a recession to knock the hell out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recession separated the boys from the men.\u201dOliver K. Hedge, who appraises golf course properties for the real estate brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield, said the golf industry had \u201cmade great strides\u201d in shaking off underperforming courses in the last few years.\u201cA lot of clubs that have closed really should have closed,\u201d Mr. Hedge said. \u201cFlorida is a good microcosm of the nation because we\u2019re so dense with golf courses.\u201dMany of the closures, he said, have involved public and semi-private courses, the latter a reference to clubs that have an active membership program but that let non-members play for a fee.In 2009, under what Mr. Hedge called \u201cthe prior economy model,\u201d the Marsh Landing Country Club, a private course 300 miles north of here in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., charged a $100,000 initiation fee, 90 percent of it refundable upon resignation. Dues were $6,612 a year. Today, that same membership costs $25,000, but it is non-refundable, while annual dues have gone up to $8,400.Still, golf clubs are \u201cjust scratching out a profit,\u201d Mr. Hedge said from his office in Orlando. \u201cGolf is a razor-thin industry from an investor standpoint. I hardly ever advise investing in a golf course. You\u2019ve got to really know what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ve got to have a razor-sharp pencil. You might spend $20 million to $30 million to build a private country club \u2014 if you can clear 7, 8, 10 percent, you\u2019re lucky. There are huge fixed costs. You could have a club that\u2019s doing $10 million in revenue, but you\u2019ve spent $9.9 million to get there.\u201dThe price of the Jupiter resort \u2014 now known as the Trump National Golf Club \u2014 was not disclosed, although Mr. Trump\u2019s company invested about $20 million in renovations for the course, clubhouse and amenities, according to Mr. Hedge.\u201cThe key to the success of these ventures was the broader market timing,\u201d Mr. Hedge said, referring to the two Trump resorts. \u201cI assume they saw the luxury golf market returning, which it has done.\u201dMr. Ekovich, the golf-course broker in Tampa, was slightly less positive in his estimation of the market\u2019s strength.\u201cRevenues are up a little bit, and so are rounds,\u201d said Mr. Ekovich, who noted that during the years of the recession the price of some golf courses had \u201ccratered\u201d to about half their former value. \u201cThings are moving in the right direction, but they are by no means meteoric rises.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the financial struggles of American golf courses misidentified the war cited in a commemorative plaque at a Donald J. Trump golf course in Virginia. It was the Civil War, not the Revolutionary War.An article last Wednesday about the financial struggles of American golf courses misstated part of the history of the Colony West Golf Club in Tamarac, Fla. While the course was opened with the expectation of hosting the Jackie Gleason Classic, the PGA Tour event was actually held at the nearby Inverrary Country Club; Colony West did not host the tournament.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buffalo Entices Start-Ups to Relocate With $5 Million Contest", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosBUFFALO \u2014 Until two weeks ago, Ace Callwood had never set foot in this chilly, postindustrial city, but he committed, sight unseen, to move his fledgling technology business and its four employees here. The lure that drew him was cash: a guaranteed investment of at least $250,000 and a shot at as much as $1 million.Buffalo\u2019s downtown is filled with signs of both the area\u2019s struggles and its steps toward revitalization. New restaurants and retailers, along with the decades-old ones that have endured, sit adjacent to derelict buildings, many of which still bear architectural traces of the area\u2019s more prosperous past. The toll of Buffalo\u2019s economic troubles is even starker in the outskirts of the city, which has a poverty rate that tops 30 percent and a median household income of around $31,000.One of their suggestions was to create a fund for microgrants to promising new ventures \u2014 perhaps $5,000 each to 100 or so recipients, recalled Jordan Levy, a venture capitalist who is the chairman of 43North\u2019s board of directors.\u201cIt was the stupidest thing I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d said Mr. Levy, a partner at SoftBank Capital. \u201cWho is going to come to Buffalo if it\u2019s not the biggest, most monumental business competition in the entire world?\u201dThe $5 million 43North contest stands out for having the biggest prize pool of any competition in the United States and the largest individual prizes. Most of the money comes from state sources, although corporate and philanthropic sponsors also contribute.Instead of splitting their funding among dozens of companies, the organizers decided to direct it like a fire hose at just a few. The grand-prize winner collects $1 million, and 10 finalists receive investments of either $250,000 or $500,000. In return, each company gives 43North a 5 percent equity stake and commits to being based in Buffalo for at least 12 months.The inaugural contest last year drew nearly 7,000 applicants. This year, 11,000 companies entered.In addition to cash, 43North gives its 11 winners a year of support services, including mentorship and free office space. Its most valuable perk, though, may be the community created. Assembled together into 43North\u2019s incubator space, the entrepreneurs have peers with whom to talk, network and commiserate.\u201cWe\u2019ve built incredible personal and professional relationships here,\u201d said Daniel Shani, 29, the chief executive of Energy Intelligence, an alternative energy start-up that began in Boston and moved to Buffalo after winning $500,000 in last year\u2019s competition.\u201cYou can get office space and mentors anywhere; there are a lot of smart people in a lot of cities that can help you grow your business,\u201d Mr. Shani said. \u201cThe people are what really separates this from other accelerators or competitions that we\u2019ve been a part of.\u201dCity officials and business leaders are eager to assist growing companies, and Buffalo\u2019s residents are welcoming to newcomers, he added.The Painless1099 team encountered that enthusiasm on its very first day in the city, as the group wandered around searching for potential places to live. \u201cWe met a lot of neighbors who were like, \u2018Do you want to watch the Bills game with us?\u2019 It was scary friendly,\u201d said Justin Kauszler, 26, sounding both pleased and bemused.The goal of 43North is to infuse Buffalo\u2019s business community with the kind of entrepreneurial energy projected by Mr. Callwood and Mr. Kauszler, the company\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cThere was a significant resource gap here at the early stage for businesses,\u201d said John T. Gavigan, the executive director of 43North. \u201cWe want entrepreneurship to be part of the culture and to be something that people see that they can pursue.\u201dWhile many of 43North\u2019s finalists are transplants, the top prize in both years has gone to a local company. This year\u2019s $1 million winner, ACV Auctions, is an online auction platform that lets car dealers buy and sell wholesale inventory. Founded 11 months ago, the company plans to use the cash to expand to new markets and hire additional employees for software development, design, customer service and sales.ACV and last year\u2019s winner, ASI, a start-up developing a new manufacturing process for metal components, are both firmly rooted in the Buffalo area and determined to remain there as they grow. But will those who arrived from elsewhere stick around?As last year\u2019s cohort approaches the end of its yearlong residency commitment, the answer, for many, remains uncertain. Mr. Shani, now a passionate Buffalo booster, plans to retain a presence in the area, but where his core team goes next will depend in part on where it secures its next funding round and commercial customers.Lauren Washington, 32, who moved from New York City last year to work on KeepUp, a social media management app, is the only full-time member of her team living in Buffalo. Her six other employees work remotely, and Ms. Washington, who is currently pitching investors, has not yet decided where she will be in a few months.As more places experiment with business competitions and grants, the big question hanging over those efforts \u2014 do they work? \u2014 remains hard to answer.But business dynamics vary widely in different geographies, and in the United States, it is hard to find contests with track records long enough to generate meaningful data.Of the 65 companies that received grants since the program began in 2012, only five have gone out of business, according to Ginger Imster, the program\u2019s executive director. Six have relocated to other cities. The remaining ventures have created or retained around 300 jobs in Missouri and raised $65 million from investors, by the program\u2019s calculation.Mr. Motoyama sees anecdotal evidence that Arch Grants recipients benefited from having a peer group of fellow entrepreneurs in proximity, and from the aid the organization\u2019s staff and mentors offered in connecting them with potential customers, investors, employees and other resources. He wonders, though, if that early helping hand will carry through to longer-term business success.\u201cSelecting winners is really difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at the venture capital industry; even the professionals have a hard time. It\u2019s very unlikely that public entities and nonprofits can choose winners.\u201dMr. Levy, who knows too well about the long odds in venture capital, agrees with that assessment \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t care. He sees other measures for success in Buffalo.\u201cMost incubator and accelerator programs are failures. The companies that have gone through them are failures,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think this will be different. But it\u2019s doing what it\u2019s supposed to do: It\u2019s bringing companies to Buffalo, and it\u2019s changing the mind-set. It\u2019s spurring people to take risks that they didn\u2019t take before.\u201dAn earlier version of a slide show caption with this article misspelled the surname of one of the people shown. The chief executive of the ACV Auction team, which was pictured, is Joe Neiman, not Nieman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gay Candidates Find Support, or at Least a Shrug, in Salt Lake City", "Date": "2015-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALT LAKE CITY \u2014 It was only at the end of the debate \u2014 after arguments over city rail service, policing and homelessness \u2014 that Jackie Biskupski nodded to how her mayoral run could make history here in Utah\u2019s capital.\u201cWhen I was elected to the Utah Legislature, that was no cakewalk,\u201d she said. \u201cI was the first openly gay elected official, and there was a lot of hard work that needed to be done then, and there\u2019s a lot of hard work that needs to be done in our city today.\u201dMs. Biskupski, who is in a close race against Salt Lake City\u2019s two-term incumbent, will become the city\u2019s first openly gay mayor if she wins the election on Tuesday. She and Mayor Ralph Becker, both Democrats, are running on a nonpartisan ballot.It often surprises visitors to learn that Salt Lake City, the headquarters of the Mormon Church, where returning missionaries receive cheers at the airport, is also home to a rollicking gay pride parade, a gay-friendly men\u2019s choir and a boutique hotel offering guests a \u201cgay power package.\u201d People sometimes describe the city as a rainbow island surrounded by a very red state.\u201cThere are those who want to hold me back because I\u2019m a single mom,\u201d Ms. Biskupski, 49, said in an interview at her campaign offices. \u201cThere are those who want to hold me back because I\u2019m a lesbian. It says a lot about the people here and how we\u2019ve evolved as a community that I am where I am today.\u201dLast week, the crowded conference rooms of the downtown Grand America Hotel offered a glimpse into the contrast between this city\u2019s broad liberal streak and the conservative views on abortion, same-sex marriage and gender issues that form the bedrock of many smaller towns in Utah.Thousands of people from around the state and world gathered at the hotel for the World Congress of Families, a conservative gathering whose speakers embrace traditional marriage and oppose abortion. To loud applause, speakers urged audience members to fight rulings on same-sex marriage that had \u201cput a lie into the law.\u201d Some warned of ties between homosexuality and pedophilia. One mother said she had been met with shouts when she stood up to ask how the faithful might embrace gay relatives like her son.Outside the hotel, protesters stood in the rain on Thursday night, waving rainbow flags and signs, and gave speeches condemning the conference.But this kind of cultural clash has been conspicuously absent in local elections in which gay candidates are running against straight ones.\u201cThe most surprising thing about this campaign is how little emphasis there has been on the sexual orientation of these candidates,\u201d said Jim Dabakis, a gay state senator who endorsed Ms. Biskupski. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gay people and straight people on both sides.\u201dMs. Biskupski and Mayor Becker are tangling on questions of public safety and who is the better choice to sustain Salt Lake City\u2019s booming economy and spread the benefits of gleaming, glassy downtown development to struggling corners of the city.They said his advocacy had helped pave the way for a statewide ban on housing and employment discrimination, including for sexual and gender identity, that won support from Mormon leaders and the Republican-led Legislature.Ms. Biskupski beat Mr. Becker by 15 percentage points in the election\u2019s five-way first round in August, but recent polls have the race a dead heat.Ms. Biskupski says the city is not doing enough to deal with a growing homeless population or to bring growth to neighborhoods on its west side. Mr. Becker, 63, argues that Salt Lake is in cultural and economic bloom, with a vibrant restaurant scene, a new performing arts center, refurbished parks, more bike lanes and 3 percent unemployment.\u201cThe city is doing well,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI want to take advantage of that momentum and really finish the job.\u201dIn a race for the City Council, Derek Kitchen, a lead plaintiff in the court case that overturned Utah\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, is campaigning on a platform to help small businesses. He is a founder of a business that sells Middle Eastern foods, and he has met with the government-relations staff at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to discuss economic development in his downtown district.\u201cPeople look at me as someone who did something that was unfathomable a year before,\u201d he said.In the suburb of Midvale, an old lead-smelter town where office parks now spring up, Sophia Hawes-Tingey, who would become the first transgender elected official in the state, is campaigning for the City Council on a platform including street repairs and better communication between voters and City Hall.She moved to Utah five years ago, chasing work as a software engineer, and decided to run after serving in a volunteer resident group. For weeks, she has been knocking on doors in her 2,000-person district, introducing herself to neighbors and asking what they want from their local government.\u201cI was afraid I\u2019d lose supporters because of ingrained cultural beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat turned out not to be the case.\u201d Of her gender, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s part of who I am, but it\u2019s not the core and central piece of my campaign.\u201dHer incumbent opponent, Paul Glover, operates a garden center and truck-accessory business and is running on his experience and his family\u2019s deep ties to the town. He said that the race had drawn outsize attention \u2014 he had never been asked for an interview before this race \u2014 but that it boiled down to experience.\u201cI have experience, and she doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Glover said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who she is. It\u2019s whether she can do a better job for Midvale. The rest of it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ruling From the Shadows", "Date": "2015-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWE\u2019VE come to expect bickering from our politicians. We\u2019re often exasperated by this state of affairs and sometimes we yearn for a quieter, gentler age, when compromise wasn\u2019t a dirty word. But the raucous rivalry in Washington has its benefits: a political process thick with competition. By contrast, political competition in other important parts of our democracy is worrisomely thin.Narrower interests that would otherwise find themselves straining to shape political outcomes often prevail unchallenged. Somewhat perversely, we may well be better off when politics is a bazaar of ideas and incentives.Consider the technical regulations that govern capital markets \u2014 the tedious but critical details that determine how companies account for profits, whether banks have as much capital as they say they do, and how insurance and pension entities should measure their obligations. We might think these regulations are somehow self-evident, derived from fundamental laws of economics. In reality, they are largely social constructs, reflecting expert opinions and political necessities. The meetings where these esoteric rules are imagined into existence are often eerily amiable.I call these regulatory processes thin political markets because they seldom attract wide public participation. On any specific rule-making issue, there are usually a handful of business executives \u2014 often fewer than 50 \u2014 who are truly experts on the subject. They also have the greatest stakes in the outcome. They meet with regulators in genteel isolation, obligingly offering direction for regulation. The rules of the game that emerge reflect their interests.But there are no manifest villains here. Executives get involved when they understand an issue, and it matters to them. When they participate, they rarely face serious opposition. Those who might oppose them are sometimes not even aware of the regulatory proceedings. What arises in aggregate is a system of rules that looks as if it was produced by a quilt of special interests. Society as a whole bears the costs of this subtle subversion of capitalism.Look at our system for corporate accounting rule making. We don\u2019t often think about the quality of the accounting rules underlying our economy, but without sound measures for corporate performance, markets cannot function fairly or efficiently. Distortions in accounting rules can resonate harshly through the economy.Over three decades of academic research suggests that on average publicly listed firms pursuing corporate acquisitions overpay for their targets. With tens of trillions of dollars spent on corporate acquisitions over that time period, why would this overpayment persist? One likely reason is that the corporate managers and investment bankers involved have found ways to game the accounting rules used to assess a merger\u2019s long-run performance.To see how that happens, one has to peek inside the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a small, private organization operating out of an office park in Norwalk, Conn., that is largely responsible for setting the accounting rules for corporate America. Back in 2000, when F.A.S.B.\u2019s leaders sat down to reconsider rules for corporate acquisitions, they were joined by representatives from what were then the country\u2019s three largest investment banks and by lobbyists for companies routinely engaging in acquisitions, like the tech giant Cisco Systems.Accounting rules can help moderate overpayment by the chief executives who are acquiring companies. In particular, effective rules would hold an acquiring firm accountable for any excess paid over its target firm\u2019s independently verifiable value. This premium is the most capricious element of an acquisition. It represents conjectural future profits that an acquiring chief executive hopes to unleash by bringing two companies together.Accountants call this premium the \u201cgoodwill\u201d acquired. On average over the last several years, acquiring C.E.O.s have allocated about half of what they\u2019ve paid in corporate acquisitions to goodwill. In other words, they\u2019ve paid twice the independently verifiable value of their targets. In the case of Cisco, a senior executive estimated that intangibles such as goodwill accounted for about 95 percent of acquisition value in the period leading up to its lobbying efforts in 2000.It\u2019s notoriously difficult to convert the nebulous notion of goodwill into hard cash. Much depends on the sometimes impossible task of getting two very different corporate cultures to work together. The investment bankers and other lobbyists who joined the F.A.S.B. meetings pushed for rules that gave acquiring C.E.O.s substantial discretion in timing when they would be held accountable for goodwill acquired. Because the rules dampen responsibility for potential overpayment, the investment bankers can benefit from higher deal values (which drive their own fees). In other words, the system can enable wealth transfers away from ordinary shareholders.Acquiring managers can also boost their own compensation by avoiding timely goodwill accountability. Between its high in 2000 and the close of 2001, as the tech bubble crashed, Cisco experienced a decline of over 75 percent in its market value, a loss of over $400 billion. The decline largely persisted through 2014. Nevertheless, the company, which carried billions of dollars of goodwill on its books, did not record any substantial goodwill-related charge over that period. Of course, it\u2019s difficult to say conclusively that avoiding goodwill charges helped drive anyone\u2019s pay, but it is worth noting that the company\u2019s chief executive was awarded over $200 million in pay during that period.Thin political markets abound in many abstruse, lucrative corners of our regulatory system, from the rules that determine how companies are audited to the regulations that keep nuclear power plants safe. They embody a peculiar problem for our democracy.Special interests attempt to dominate political processes across the regulatory spectrum, but some areas, like Social Security and health care, animate us more than others, like accounting and auditing rules. The result is that politicians and journalists who intervene on behalf of ordinary citizens in areas crowded with attention are seldom drawn to thin political markets.In fact, the F.A.S.B.\u2019s own oversight body \u2014 the Financial Accounting Foundation \u2014 is so obscure that when one longtime financial-industry chief executive was tapped to serve as its chairman, he admitted to never having heard of it.\u201cThe social responsibility of business,\u201d Milton Friedman famously said in this newspaper 45 years ago, \u201cis to increase its profits.\u201d But he was careful to clarify that his dictum for business held true \u201cso long as it stays within the rules of the game.\u201d Our acute reliance on industry experts in thin political markets and the instances of their self-serving behavior together raise a curious challenge for capitalism. What is the social responsibility of business when it comes to setting the rules of the game? Can it ever be legitimate to manipulate the definition of profit in the spirit of increasing profits?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saving the World, Startup-Style", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyI remember feeling almost giddy as she told me this story. Jelen was about to get her wish. I knew that the American government, working with one of Haiti\u2019s leading mango exporters, was funding a project to help everyday Haitians like her ship their mangoes to America.Five years later, farmers like Jelen are still waiting. I hadn\u2019t heard wrong: The United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) did indeed promise to fund such an effort. The idea was part of its mission to improve the supply chain of poor farmers by helping them prepare their food for sale long distances away. But just before sheds and a well were constructed, someone in Washington shifted U.S.A.I.D.\u2019s primary goals in Haiti, and the project was canceled.The story of Jelen and her mangoes is the story of the failure of American and world aid to help poor people in other countries. The United States government spends about $30 billion a year toward this end, while the rest of the world\u2019s governments spend an additional $100 billion combined. Since World War II, that adds up to trillions spent on foreign aid. But global development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D. and the World Bank, have had trouble figuring out whether the money they spend actually makes poor people better off. For decades, grand theories were developed in rich countries about how to alleviate poverty, and huge amounts of money were spent, with stunningly little regard for their actual impact. There was the big-push model, the dual-sector model, the critical minimum effort, the Fei-Ranis surplus-labor model, capital accumulation, capacity building and, widely adopted and then thoroughly repudiated, the Washington Consensus. Each theory promised an elegant, compelling solution to world poverty. Each has fallen short, in many cases making poor people worse off.During the past decade, there has been a quiet revolution in the way many scholars and advocates think about aid. We can call it the post-theory approach. The idea is that rich countries shouldn\u2019t see themselves as responsible for coming up with theories about how poor countries can become richer. Rather, the rich countries allow the poor ones to determine what they think needs to happen \u2014 more girls in school, more vaccination, better access to global markets for farmers \u2014 and then pay money to whoever comes up with an actual solution. There are many versions of this approach. Under one idea, cash-on-delivery aid, donors would set aside some amount and then pay, say, $10 for every child who gets a vaccine shot. Governments, nonprofits and private-sector companies can compete on who can do this best. Development-impact bonds are another new idea. Private investors put their money at risk to achieve certain outcomes, like a lower H.I.V.-infection rate or cleaner water, and are paid back only if the projects they fund actually achieve their goals. The idea is that government money is spent only when an outcome is achieved, improving lives for the poor while saving taxpayers wasted expenses.But most governments and large aid organizations are still doling out billions of dollars based on insufficient data. One of U.S.A.I.D.\u2019s most prominent metrics seems like a relic from the 1950s. Called Dollars to Results, it simply counts how much money has been spent toward various goals: $7.2 million to help Cambodia improve its environment; $6.6 million to help Bangladeshi children go to school. There is minimal information about what actually matters, like whether Cambodia\u2019s environment is measurably better or if Bangladesh\u2019s children know more. And of course, when goals fall out of favor \u2014 like how to best manage a supply chain in Haiti \u2014 worthy projects can be scuttled in an instant.I have no idea if, even given continuous support, Jelen\u2019s mangoes would ever be commercially successful on the global market. But studying the broader economy, I do know that this is no way to find out. For a good chunk of the 20th century, much of American business worked the way U.S.A.I.D. often does. Someone at headquarters would lay out a three-year or a five-year plan, and then the minions would fall in line. But that model was discarded long ago. Business schools and corporate executives now talk about learning organizations, adaptive leadership, continuous improvement and lean start-ups, i.e., companies that are designed to respond constantly to markers of success or failure. They set up systems to pour resources into those projects that are working and away from those that aren\u2019t.By contemporary management standards, even the new data-driven efforts at philanthropy feel a little bit hidebound. Whatever you think of Silicon Valley, the venture-capital philosophy of investing can be an extremely useful model for philanthropy in its confident embrace of risk. In V.C.-backed fields, new ideas start out with minimal funding and, as they prove themselves, attract greater and greater sums. An individual or institution can kick in a so-called angel investment, of $50,000 or maybe up to $2 million, with the knowledge that most will not be home runs. The ideas that prove themselves in the market move to larger rounds, funded by folks whose appetite for risk is somewhat smaller but who are prepared to give more, say from $2 million to $10 million; they expect perhaps six out of every 10 investments to succeed. And so on. At each stage, the ideas need to be less risky, more proven. And the ideas are shaped themselves by this process as they are continually tested against reality to see which ones work and which don\u2019t.Alex Thier, head of policy at U.S.A.I.D., told me the agency has begun to experiment with such programs through its Global Development Lab. Moreover, he said, the agency is now making it a priority that poor recipient countries should play a much bigger role in deciding how aid money is spent. A vast majority of American and world aid, however, is still delivered according to wildly outdated models. It often seems designed to help American foreign-policy goals as much as the poor, disproportionately going to geopolitically important countries \u2014 Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan. Also, there is a powerful political system supporting the ways aid is allocated. For example, lobbyists for American farmers and shipowners have kept in place an absurd law that requires much of the emergency food aid sent to crisis-racked countries to come from American farms and be carried by American ships.There\u2019s still some hope for farmers like Jelen to export their mangoes to America. The United States government now has a global program called Feed the Future, but many local farmers are still waiting to see if their mangoes will qualify. All told, they\u2019ve spent less time expanding their businesses than they have navigating the bureaucracy of the American government.Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rebuke to India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDuring a national election in India last year, Narendra Modi promised \u201cdevelopment for all.\u201d As prime minister, he has yet to deliver big economic improvements, but in the meantime, members of his government and political party have shredded his promise of inclusion by inflaming sectarian tensions. Now, voters in the country\u2019s third most populous state have sent Mr. Modi a message: Put an end to the hatemongering.Poisoning politics with religious hatred is bound to squander the country\u2019s economic potential at a time when India should be playing a bigger and more constructive role in South Asia and the world. India\u2019s history is filled with examples of religious and caste-based violence that set the country back. Those conflicts subsided during India\u2019s rapid economic growth, but many Indians now fear a resurgence.In the months leading up to the Bihar election, hard-liners in the B.J.P. and organizations affiliated with the party stoked India\u2019s long-simmering sectarian tensions. The party\u2019s lawmakers pushed for beef bans around the country ostensibly to protect the cow, which many Hindus consider holy, but really as a ploy to divide Hindus and Muslims, some of whom eat beef.Mr. Modi has not forcefully condemned the beef-related killings, despite pleas by Muslims and other minorities. He has tolerated hateful and insensitive remarks by his ministers and by B.J.P. officials.Mr. Modi and the B.J.P. secured a majority in the lower house of Parliament last year with promises of economic reforms. Now, to push through those reforms, the party needs to win the control of the upper house, which is elected by state assemblies. It won\u2019t win those elections unless Mr. Modi gets rid of the officials in his government and party who are fueling sectarian culture wars.Meanwhile, there are things Mr. Modi could do administratively to improve the economy, like investing in education and health care and building infrastructure. Voters in Bihar have sent the B.J.P. a clear message. Mr. Modi should heed it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Way to Improve College Enrollment", "Date": "2015-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMERICAN public schools do a good job of getting students into college, but a poor job preparing them to succeed once they\u2019re there. While more than two-thirds of high school graduates enroll in college, nearly two-thirds of those arrive on campus unprepared for college-level rigor.Instead of trying to solve this problem together, high schools and colleges typically operate in silos \u2014 high schools concentrate on increasing graduation rates, while universities pay little attention to what\u2019s happening in the local public schools.The situation is entirely different in Long Beach, Calif. In that predominantly immigrant city south of Los Angeles, where a third of the children under age 17 live in poverty, the public schools have teamed up with the local community college and the state university to confront the impact of poverty, racial discrimination and limited educational opportunities.The Long Beach College Promise guarantees high school graduates a tuition-free year at Long Beach City College. If they meet the minimum academic requirements, they\u2019re assured admission to California State University, Long Beach, one of the country\u2019s top regional schools.This guarantee has been a game-changer for a city whose economy was battered by the closing of the naval base, the decimation of the local aerospace industry and, more recently, the Great Recession. Three-quarters of high school graduates now enroll in college, 10 percent above the national average. Many stay in Long Beach after earning a bachelor\u2019s degree, improving the city\u2019s economy. Early awareness, college preparedness, college access \u2014 it\u2019s a strategy worth emulating.Collaboration starts with 4-year-olds, as Mayor Robert Garcia has made universal preschool for disadvantaged children his top priority. Long Beach City College President Eloy Ortiz Oakley and Long Beach State President Jane Close Conoley have joined the mayor\u2019s fund-raising drive. They understand the long-term value of early education. \u201cWe put up a picture of a preschool student,\u201d Mr. Oakley has said. \u201cThen I ask my staff, \u2018What are we going to do today to ensure that in 2027 this student will be on the platform graduating?\u2019\u201dAll fourth and fifth graders, together with their parents, tour the local college campuses. \u201cMost of our parents never thought college was a possibility for their kids,\u201d the Long Beach school superintendent, Christopher Steinhauser, points out. \u201cBut those visits can change their minds.\u201dEvery high school junior takes an early assessment exam, which few California districts require. Those who fare poorly get a rigorous dose of English and math, giving them the skills needed to satisfy the state universities\u2019 admissions requirements. Going to college is increasingly on these students\u2019 minds. Last spring they signed up for more than 10,000 advance placement exams, a two-year increase of more than 41 percent. This year\u2019s graduates garnered $96 million in scholarships, $40 million more than in 2012.Collaboration is ubiquitous, with about 200 joint ventures linking the public schools and colleges. Among these are high school courses in Mandarin and ethnic studies, designed by Long Beach State professors.The university has demonstrated its commitment where it counts most \u2014 admission. With more than 56,000 applications, the eighth highest nationally, it could admit a class composed entirely of students with gleaming grade point averages to raise its national ranking. Instead, it keeps a seat for every eligible local applicant. Although they have high school G.P.A.s well below students from elsewhere, they are equally likely to graduate. The same holds true for Long Beach City College transfers, also favored in admissions. This locally focused strategy pays off \u2014 the overall graduation rate, 67 percent in six years, is 20 percent higher than that at comparable schools, and the 63 percent graduation rate for poor and minority students is 25 percent higher than at similar institutions.The community college is preparing more students to transfer to a four-year institution, and many go to Long Beach State. Instead of consigning freshmen with weak placement test scores to dead-end remedial classes, the college relies on high school grades, assuring that students who can succeed in college-level math and English courses are accepted, regardless of the test scores. As a result, the number of completed college-level math courses has doubled and the number of completed English courses quintupled. Minority students, who often flub placement exams, have been the biggest beneficiaries.While there\u2019s work to be done \u2014 too few of Long Beach\u2019s high school graduates have the credentials that state universities demand, and the community college\u2019s completion rate is still slightly below the state average \u2014 each institution keeps getting better. \u201cWhat we do is surprisingly simple but amazingly powerful,\u201d Ms. Conoley told me. \u201cWe communicate all the time. No turf. No bureaucracies. Just building and evaluating programs with the goal of removing barriers and supporting student success.\u201dThe Long Beach collaboration offers a textbook illustration of what business gurus call \u201ccontinuous improvement.\u201d The willingness of educators, from pre-K to Ph.D., to shelve their egos and do right by the community makes all the difference.David L.

{"Headline": "Brazil Hedge Fund Star Looks Elsewhere for His Next Big Bet", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Luis Stuhlberger\u2019s Brazilian hedge fund has had an astonishing run \u2014 even in the face of his country\u2019s sinking economy.But he has grown increasingly bearish about the economic outlook for Brazil, and he is no longer placing most of his bets here, deciding to look elsewhere for investment opportunities.\u201cBrazil is going to get much worse before it gets better,\u201d he said.Given his record, when Mr. Stuhlberger talks, Brazil watchers pay attention. His flagship fund Verde, known for its big-picture calls on economic trends, has returned an average of 29 percent a year, after fees, since it was founded in 1997.Brazil\u2019s stock market returned 10 percent a year, on average, and its main bond market benchmark returned 16 percent a year over the same period.And while Brazil has been practically synonymous with economic volatility, Verde has had only one down year ever \u2014 2008, during the global financial crisis, when it lost a modest 6 percent.These numbers are in Brazil\u2019s currency, the real, in which Mr. Stuhlberger\u2019s fund is priced, and most of his clients are Brazilian retail investors. But even in dollars, Verde\u2019s average annual return has been over 20 percent.A Brazilian who had given him 35,000 reais, the cost of a sport utility vehicle at the time, would now have 4 million reais, enough for a couple to retire in comfort.\u201cHe has the best long-term track record in Brazil,\u201d said Arm\u00ednio Fraga, head of the Brazilian asset manager G\u00e1vea Investimentos, and former managing director of the investor George Soros\u2019s firm. \u201cLike all great investors, Luis thinks big and he thinks creatively, without dogma or formulas.\u201dGlobal players have taken note. Credit Suisse bought Mr. Stuhlberger\u2019s firm, Hedging-Griffo, in 2006. When his noncompete clause ended last year and Mr. Stuhlberger became independent again, the Swiss bank bought a minority stake in his new firm, Verde Asset Management.\u201cHe\u2019s a legend here, so we benefit from being able to offer our clients meetings with him and early access to his views,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Olympio Pereira, chief executive of Credit Suisse Brazil.The hedge fund giant Blackstone recently allocated part of its $3 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund to Mr. Stuhlberger, alongside names such as Goldman Sachs and Cerberus.Mr. Stuhlberger is not a stock picker, and he rarely holds a big position in a single company. Instead he tries to identify economic trends, to allocate funds among asset classes to get ahead of these trends, and to use hedging strategies to smooth out the ride while he waits for his bets to pay off.\u201cMost of the time I do nothing except read and study,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I go the whole year without changing allocations. Then I make a big change and wait.\u201dHe got a little too far ahead of local trends early last year, as his decision to exit Brazil\u2019s stock market, short its currency and keep his bond holdings conservative kept Verde slightly in the red for most of 2014.But in September 2014 markets came around to his bearishness, and Verde ended the year up 9 percent. So far this year, it is up 24 percent.Such returns were below the fund\u2019s historical average, but Alberto Jacobsen, chief executive of Risk Office, a S\u00e3o Paulo investment consultancy for institutional investors, said Mr. Stuhlberger\u2019s performance was \u201chighly impressive\u201d given the country\u2019s environment. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to make money when the stock market is falling and interest rates are rising. Many other hedge funds here lost money.\u201dBut despite his past success, Mr. Stuhlberger concluded last year that there were too few opportunities in Brazil for a fund of Verde\u2019s size to be fully invested. So he has begun to return, in installments, 40 percent of its 14 billion reais ($3.8 billion) to investors.\u201cIt\u2019s much too early to buy the stock market here. My clients don\u2019t pay me to hold cash for them,\u201d he said.Verde is required by regulations to keep 80 percent of its assets inside Brazil. But Mr. Stuhlberger, long unusual among fund managers here for investing globally \u2014 he bet big on German real estate in 2011 \u2014 opened a new fund this year that is available only to qualified investors, and therefore has no limit on how much it can invest abroad.His main bets in this go-anywhere fund, called Horizonte, are that developed-country equity markets and the dollar are not done rising; China will devalue its currency; and emerging markets will stay in the doldrums as low interest rates, low commodity prices and slow growth persist for the foreseeable future.Some are cautious about his new venture. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, but we\u2019re not certain that he\u2019ll have the same competitive advantage outside Brazil that he does at home,\u201d Mr. Jacobsen said.\u201cThe country isn\u2019t financially viable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has tried to build a European social democracy in the third world. The numbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d\u201cThere will have to be a major crisis before the population accepts cuts in social spending,\u201d Mr. Stuhlberger said.And though outrage at the way some of that spending is diverted has led to a groundbreaking investigation into corruption, Mr. Stuhlberger said the corruption was so endemic he feared that no new, clean political institutions existed to replace the old ones.While he waits for the crisis to deepen, his Brazilian allocation is mostly in local inflation-protected bonds. He also holds currency derivatives that will profit if the real falls further, and has a small position long on Petrobras bonds and short on the stock.For both the government and Petrobras, the energy giant, he said, \u201cDefault is not a risk, for now.\u201dMr. Stuhlberger came late to the hedge fund business. Planning to work in his father\u2019s construction company, he studied civil engineering, but found that math interested him more.In 1980 he started to work in a small brokerage house trading first coffee, then gold, at a time when many Brazilians sought the precious metal as a defense against hyperinflation, since the government forbade holding foreign currency as an investment.When Brazil lifted most capital and currency controls in 1990, Mr. Stuhlberger began to trade stocks and bonds on the newly important futures exchanges.He was 42 years old when he opened Verde in 1997. He started with under a million dollars. Success quickly brought clients, and he closed the fund to new investors in 2002.For all his gloom about Brazil\u2019s economy, Mr. Stuhlberger, now 60, says he loves life here.\u201cThe people are incredibly talented, and the Brazilian way is to help each other out. There\u2019s not the ruthlessness that you see in the U.S. Here you can be friends with your competitors.\u201dHe said work left him little time for socializing or hobbies, though he and his wife of 36 years have a passion for movies from Argentina.He now spends several months a year traveling internationally, and some members of his team are abroad more often than they are at home.\u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re looking for investments now,\u201d Mr. Stuhlberger said. \u201cOutside of Brazil.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plan to Close Nuclear Plant in Upstate New York Rattles Its Neighbors", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCRIBA, N.Y. \u2014 The huge concrete cooling tower standing near the shore of Lake Ontario might give chills to visitors catching a first glimpse of it. But to many residents of this semirural section of Oswego County, the two nuclear power plants in town have been a comforting presence.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to have a very, very devastating effect on our area and our schools,\u201d said Missy Taylor, the owner of the Stylin & Smilin Hair Salon, about five miles from the plant. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see more homes abandoned.\u201dSitting in a swivel chair awaiting an evening appointment, Ms. Taylor said she had two customers, husband and wife, both employed at the plant, who had postponed their plans to build a house until they knew if their jobs would be saved. \u201cThey\u2019re nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dThe pending departure of a major employer is a familiar narrative in upstate New York, which is dotted with cities and towns blighted by the erosion of jobs. But the potential effects of the FitzPatrick plant\u2019s closing are particularly alarming because of the specialized nature of the work there and the poor prospects for replacing it.Officials of Entergy, which is closing two other nuclear plants in the Northeast, said the low cost of natural gas had driven power prices so low that FitzPatrick was losing $60 million a year. Among the plant\u2019s shortcomings, they said, is that it has just one reactor, compared with two at Indian Point. The plant next door to FitzPatrick, the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station operated by Exelon, also has two reactors.All told, utilities employ more than 1,800 people in the county, said L. Michael Treadwell, executive director of Operation Oswego County, an industrial development agency. The FitzPatrick plant employs more than 600 people at an average salary of more than $120,000 a year, better than double the wages in any other local industry, Mr. Treadwell said.\u201cIn the case of nuclear power, you\u2019re pretty much in a straitjacket not being able to redevelop that massive piece of property sitting right on Lake Ontario,\u201d Mr. Treadwell said.Entergy\u2019s plan is to cease operation of the FitzPatrick plant late next year or in early 2017 and immediately eliminate about half of the jobs there, more than 300 positions. Beyond that, the staff will shrink gradually as the spent fuel from the reactor is cooled and placed in dry cask storage on the site.The company, based in New Orleans, said it would try to find positions for the displaced workers at its other nuclear plants or its traditional electric utilities, but any of those transfers would require an uprooting of productive members of local communities.The potential losses to the surrounding school district, known as Mexico Academy and Central School, are devastating to Sean C. Bruno, the district superintendent. He said the FitzPatrick plant provides just about half of the annual tax revenue that goes to the schools, about $12.5 million a year.\u201cWe\u2019ll lose that revenue, we\u2019ll lose student population, we\u2019ll lose the families that live in the community,\u201d Mr. Bruno said. \u201cIt will hit us in waves.\u201dAs families move away, the district, which has more than 2,100 students, will lose some of the aid it gets from the state, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have homes going up for sale without any incentive for anybody to be the buyer,\u201d Mr. Bruno said. The falling value of real estate would cut deeper into the property tax revenue the schools rely on, he said.Mr. Bruno, an upstate native who has worked in three other school districts, laid out that bleak situation for Mr. Cuomo in a letter dated Oct. 1, in which he pleaded for the governor\u2019s intervention. \u201cThis story is all too familiar with upstate New Yorkers, and has gone on for far too long,\u201d Mr. Bruno wrote.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s director of state operations, Jim Malatras, said state officials had been negotiating with Entergy to try to find a way to keep the plant open. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is find a way to come up with a solution and a deal that works for everybody,\u201d Mr. Malatras said. \u201cThe good news is we\u2019ve got time.\u201dThe impact of a shutdown would ripple to the city of Oswego, about 35 miles north of Syracuse, and well beyond, Mr. Treadwell said. That is because the area\u2019s economy gets a lift at least once a year when the nuclear plants are refueled. For several weeks, workers from around the country arrive to help with the refueling, filling local motels, restaurants and bars, he said.\u201cYou hear that there\u2019s going to be a refueling, and everybody has big smiles on their faces,\u201d Mr. Treadwell said.Mr. Powers said Evergreen\u2019s 25 roadside cabins are filled for four to six weeks during refuelings, which residents sometimes refer to as \u201coutages.\u201d The motel\u2019s website pitches its convenient location: \u201cLet us not forget, only moments from the nuclear plants making the commute for the outage visitors effortless.\u201dThe Evergreen charges $400 a week for a single room or $500 for a double, said John Searor, its manager. He answered the bell one recent evening, his hunting license still attached to the outfit he had worn for an afternoon of bowhunting for deer.They can afford it, Mr. Powers said, because \u201cthey\u2019re making 60 to 70 bucks an hour\u201d and working six or seven days a week. When the temporary workers are not at the plant, \u201cthey go to the bars,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bars are all full.\u201dThe temporary workers account for as much as 30 percent of the Evergreen\u2019s business, Mr. Powers said. Most of the rest comes from people visiting the area to hunt or fish, he said. And, of course, \u201cwe get our hourly people, having rendezvous,\u201d he added.Mr. Powers said there was no doubt that a shutdown of the FitzPatrick plant would hurt the local economy and especially the Mexico schools, which some of his children attended. But, he said, he could foresee a silver lining of sorts to a shutdown: bargains on cars, boats and other assets the laid-off workers might have to sell.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got some cash saved up, it\u2019s going to be a good time to buy,\u201d he said, wiping the grease from his blackened hands.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paris and the Presidential Election", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Nov. 7, 8 percent of those polled ranked terrorism as the most important problem facing the country. More than twice as many people, 21 percent, identified the economy as more troubling, and 11 percent identified unemployment as their gravest concern. By Nov. 24, 27 percent of respondents named terrorism as their primary worry, compared to 15 percent who identified the economy, and 10 percent who named unemployment. If terror remains this high in voters\u2019 consciousness a year from now, it is likely to pose a major problem for Democrats.Voters preferred the Republican Party by an average of 21 points, 52-31.Republican strategists are acutely aware of Democratic vulnerability on matters of national security and, by extension, on foreign policy in general.From the 1968 election of Richard M. Nixon to the 2004 George W. Bush campaign, Republicans have demonstrated expertise in tarring liberalism with softness on crime and insufficient vigilance on terrorism.Because of the unusual character of the party\u2019s leading candidates this year, Republicans may not be able to fully capitalize on the party\u2019s advantage on security issues.The views that some of the candidates have recently espoused \u2014 especially those of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz but also Marco Rubio \u2014 could obviate the party\u2019s advantage on terrorism. Jeb Bush\u2019s mainstream credentials and more nuanced stands could position him to more effectively capitalize on public fears, but his candidacy has been on a steady downward trajectory.I will stop illegal immigration. We\u2019ll build a wall on the southern border. And yes, I will also quickly and decisively bomb the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019ll rebuild our military and make it so strong no one, and I mean no one, will mess with us.For most of us, its venom is a clear and deadly threat. But others refuse to even speak its name. Since the scorpion seeks our destruction, isn\u2019t it time we recognize the scorpion for what it is before it strikes again?Ben Carson, one of the least bellicose candidates and a candidate without foreign policy expertise (not that Trump has any), has been the big loser. Nationally, Carson has fallen from 24.4 percent to 19.8 percent since the attacks, and suffered similar declines in New Hampshire and Iowa.Robert Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia and expert on polling, wrote me:I interpret it as close for Hillary and Trump, with Hillary still probably with an edge. It looks close with Rubio, Christie, and Carson who have been closing the gap.For Clinton, any sign that she is abandoning liberal stands could prove damaging during the primaries. She is running for the presidential nomination in a Democratic Party that has moved well to the left since 2000.Clinton\u2019s willingness, or lack thereof, to stay the liberal course in the general election will reflect the political resilience of the Democratic coalition that displayed its strength in the 2008 presidential election. The more Clinton can rely on this coalition for victory, the less pressure she will be under to move toward the center.Republicans, meanwhile, are relishing a general election in which they hope the threat of terrorism will deal a lethal blow to Clinton.These events are producing a tremendous rise in nationalism, I think in tribalism in Europe, of nations\u2019 desiring to be themselves, securing their borders, and almost as well of Caesarism \u2014 in other words, the look for a strong leader, someone who will deal with these devils who came to kill us and who will deal with them in a tough way.For Republicans, 2016 will prove to be no normal election, because it will confirm that the new America is here and that the counterrevolution has lost. That is why I expect the result to be shattering for the Republican Party as we know it.Terrorist attacks, especially if they are reinforced by new assaults, have the potential to undermine the legitimacy of a tolerant liberalism. Based on the present risk of terrorist violence here and abroad, this is a threat Democrats cannot avoid. The goal of terrorism is to destroy the liberal state. If Clinton and candidates up and down the ticket cannot persuade voters that a Democratic administration can protect the lives of American citizens, the damage will extend far beyond one political party and one presidential campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Losing Its Competitive Edge in Banking, Trade Group Warns", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government needs to take \u201curgent action\u201d to address concerns about its regulatory and tax environment if London is to remain a global financial center and if lenders based in Britain are to remain competitive internationally, according to a banking trade group.The report, which was produced with the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, found that the total amount of banking assets in Britain had fallen 12 percent since 2011, but that it had increased 12 percent in the United States, 34 percent in Hong Kong and 24 percent in Singapore in the same period.The number of jobs in the banking sector in Britain has fallen 8 percent in the past four years, according to the group. The industry employs more than 405,000 people in the country.The financial industry has been critical of some of the changes.By 2019, British banks will be required to shield their retail operations from investment banking and other riskier businesses in a financial crisis, a process known as ring fencing. The regulatory changes are expected to be costly for the industry, as lenders redesign their systems and create new operating entities to comply with the new rules.A divisive tax known as a bank levy has also hit financial companies here particularly hard. The tax was put in place in 2010 to help pay for government efforts to rescue the financial system, but it has also generated revenue for other programs.He said \u201csimply ratcheting up\u201d fines was not a long-term answer to changing behavior in the industry and promised to seek to \u201cright the balance\u201d in future regulation to protect the British economy, while allowing firms to remain competitive.\u201cLet me be clear \u2014 I want Britain to be the best place for European and global bank headquarters,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s in our national interest to be so.\u201dMr. Osborne has also promised to reduce the bank levy beginning next year, and to change the way it is calculated in future years. Banks based in Britain have been taxed on their global balance sheets, while overseas competitors are taxed only on their British operations.In its report, the British Bankers\u2019 Association said that British lawmakers must establish a \u201cvision\u201d for international banking to remain part of its future economic growth, through predictable policy and regulation.The association said the government should conduct a review of the recent regulations to identify \u201cunintended consequences and areas where objectives are not effectively met.\u201dIt also said the government should ensure that the threshold for ring fencing is \u201cinflation-proof,\u201d so that smaller lenders are not stifled by having to comply with the new rules.The Bank of England requires British lenders with more than \u00a325 billion in deposits to wall off their retail banking operations under those rules.The bankers association also called for the government to clearly state that the bank levy was a \u201ctransitional measure\u201d that would be reduced in scope and magnitude over time, as future regulations reduce the need for government bailouts. It also said the government should review the time frame for the tax to be removed.Advertisement"}

They are all so reminiscent of the drum rolls that preceded Europe\u2019s descent into \u201cthe pit of barbarism\u201d during a century of two world wars that almost destroyed its civilization, followed by 40 years of Cold War. Seventy years after the democracies, together with the Red Army, triumphed in World War II, and 25 years after the reunification of Germany, the new Europe has made what Kershaw deems an \u201castonishing recovery.\u201dKershaw will devote a second volume to Europe\u2019s rise from the ashes, but the continent today is hardly immune to recurrent economic and political crises with traces of the xenophobia, mass media incitements and the kind of pathological delusions that led Europe in the 20th century to hell and back after nearly 100 years of prosperity and stability following the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815. \u201cTo Hell and Back\u201d should be required reading in every chancellery, every editorial cockpit and every place where peevish Euroskeptics do their thinking.Why did Europe go mad? The four horsemen of the apocalypse Kershaw identifies in his nightmare history are a dramatic rise of ethnic-racist nationalism; angry, conflicting demands for territorial revisionism; acute class conflict that took on sharper focus by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia; and a prolonged crisis of capitalism that many thought terminal. The turmoil of the interwar years would have tested a Bismarck, a Charlemagne. It troubles Kershaw, as it should all of us, that the seminal catastrophe of World War I could have been avoided, and the second war it bequeathed was as much the result of moral cowardice and political miscalculation in the West as in the rampant new imperialisms of Germany, Italy and Japan. Might we not blunder again?Kershaw argues that World War I could have been forestalled if Vienna had acted with speed to punish Serbia for its complicity in the murder of the heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; it had the Kaiser\u2019s reckless blank check for punishment, but as Kershaw puts it, the Austrian Empire \u201cknew only two speeds, slow and dead stop.\u201d By the time Vienna sent its ultimatum to Belgrade, three weeks after the assassination, Russia, with France in tow, had encouraged the Serbs to be more bloody-minded. More bloody-minded, in my own judgment, than justified.Kershaw identifies a second missed opportunity to avert mass slaughter. He writes that even as Russia started to mobilize in the summer of 1914 \u2014 much before Germany \u2014 \u201ca firm British declaration of neutrality .\u2008.\u2008. might even at a late hour have prevented general war. But Grey\u2019s disastrous hesitation meant that the room for diplomatic initiatives vanished.\u201d Pretty well every history nods to the poetic prescience of Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign secretary, in the foreboding he expressed on Aug. 3. Standing by his big window overlooking Horse Guards Parade, he watched the gas lights being lit in the street below and said: \u201cThe lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.\u201d They were, though Grey lived to see Europe, with the lights on, begin to fumble its irresolute way to World War II.Grey, who died in 1933, is an appealing figure, spared much criticism for his diplomacy in World War I, but David Owen, who stood at the same window as foreign secretary from 1977 to 1979, buttresses Kershaw\u2019s judgment with an explanation of Grey\u2019s fatal ambivalence, which forfeited a role for Britain as a referee. Owen\u2019s recent book \u201cThe Hidden Perspective,\u201d published too late, perhaps, to be caught in Kershaw\u2019s prodigious research net, documents how, in 1906, Grey, unbeknown to the cabinet, approved secret talks between British and French military chiefs, committing Britain to land an expeditionary force in the event of war. As Henry Kissinger has written of the 1907 Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia, it was the beginning of the end of the balance of power.The consequences were almost 15 million dead in World War I, followed by the Bolshevik Revolution and World War II. Over 40 million died in Europe alone in that rerun; six million Jews were murdered, millions of families uprooted, centuries of Europe\u2019s heritage destroyed and countless unspeakable cruelties exacted by psychopaths. Our ally Stalin shot nearly 700,000 in his mad purges in the 1930s, and condemned three million to his jails and gulags. Never before, Kershaw writes, had any government terrorized so many of its people so wantonly and callously. Stalin was so paranoid he suspected his pet parrot of deviant tendencies when it imitated his crude spitting; he purged it with a death blow from his pipe.Knockoff dictators adopted the techniques. In Croatia, doomed in our times to cycles of ethnic cleansing, Ante Pavelic, the wartime leader of the Ustasha fascists, forced a third of the Serbs to become Catholics, expelled a third, killed a third. It\u2019s entirely believable, as legend maintains, that he kept as souvenirs on his desk a basket full of human eyes.Kershaw documents each and every \u201cism\u201d of his analysis with extraordinary detail and passionate humanism. He is as diligent in exploring the character of the men \u2014 no women to filter the macho posturing \u2014 as he is in analyzing the movements, notably the rise of a virulent nationalism based on ethnolinguistic identification rather than territory.He has spent a lot of time in the asylum. He is the author of a trenchant two-\u00advolume biography of Hitler and a history of the German Reich\u2019s final year. We can see Hitler as pure evil, a master of manipulating the German masses as well as the democracies, but Kershaw insists on a fact some historians prefer us to forget: that the former beer hall demagogue turned dictator was in Germany \u201cthe object of almost deified veneration.\u201d He gave Germany what it craved: revenge for the humiliation of the 1918 defeat it could never acknowledge; liberation for millions of Germans decanted to other states by the Versailles Treaty; prosperity; and the pride of a master race.Kershaw heads his chapter on the years after World War I with the judgment on the 1919 Versailles peace conference by Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France: \u201cThis is not a peace. It is an armistice for 20 years.\u201d Foch was right almost to the day, though he was not alone in his skepticism; John Maynard Keynes and Herbert Hoover shared it. Nobody seems to have noted that the day the treaty was signed, June 28, 1919, was the day five years before when the shots were fired at Sarajevo.The Big Three (Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau) were midwives to 10 new nation-states born from four sundered empires, but Kershaw finds vindication in his central thesis about the fundamental importance of religious and ethnic division within a heterogeneous state. Almost all of the states that were the fruit of Versailles were ethnically homogeneous. The signatories paid lip service to Wilson\u2019s impossible ideal of self-\u00addetermination, but the new map was little more than a reflection of the appetites of the winners. Germany lost 13 percent of its territory, with millions of Germans ending up in Poland, the new countries of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and the free state of Danzig. The Big Three at Versailles should have invited Machiavelli to remind them of his principle that it\u2019s imprudent to wound an adversary and leave him with an appetite and capacity for retaliation.Wilson hoped his precious League of Nations would keep the peace between the new democracies with their resentful minorities, but the league could only advise on sanctions and then only by unanimous vote. In the interwar years democracy prevailed in most northwestern countries, but the Europeans in the rest of the Continent lived under some form of repressive rule, with minorities subject to persecution and discrimination.The big test for the democracies came at dawn on March 7, 1936, when German soldiers, with flags flying and drums beating, marched into the Rhineland, the buffer zone between France and Germany, demilitarized for an indefinite period by Versailles. Everyone talks of Munich 1938 as the turning point. Kershaw, more accurately, writes of 1936: \u201cThis proved the last chance, short of war, for the Western democracies to stop Hitler in his tracks. Why did they not do so? After all, only a small German force advanced into the Rhineland, and with orders to retreat if challenged.\u201dAll the democracies flunked it. France, with by far the larger army, did not move a soldier. Britain was content to appeal to the League of Nations. Kershaw does not comment, as well he might, that the United States was feeble, too. Hitler was violating not only Versailles but America\u2019s separate peace treaty with Germany from 1921 and the Locarno pact of 1925. Franklin Roosevelt went fishing; Cordell Hull didn\u2019t even bother to send a note of protest. It confirmed Hitler in his contempt for the democracies, and also any version of the dictum attributed to Burke that all that\u2019s required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.Another mistake that doomed Europe, even before Chamberlain\u2019s sacrifice of Czechoslovakia, was the response to the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Kershaw, in another emphatic echo of our times, is unhesitant in exposing the democracies\u2019 economically futile and socially divisive attempts to balance budgets in a downturn. Hitler\u2019s grip, and the German economy, were boosted by Germany\u2019s combination of work-creation, state investment, a new freedom given to enterprise \u2014 and, it must be said, state repression of the left and the trade unions. Germany\u2019s stunning revival, well before high spending on rearmament, produced a Germany so strong that by 1939 it constituted \u201cthe supreme factor in the European constellation of power.\u201dIt still is \u2014 but now it\u2019s the moral leader of Europe in its embrace of hundreds of thousands of refugees. And in another positive omen for this redoubtable historian\u2019s second volume: The world\u2019s fastest growing Jewish population is in Berlin, the source of the Holocaust.TO HELL AND BACKEurope, 1914-1949By Ian KershawIllustrated. 593 pp. Viking. $35.Harold Evans is editor at large of Thomson Reuters and the author of \u201cThe American Century.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nuremberg Nazi Site Crumbles, but Tricky Questions on Its Future Persist", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNuremberg JournalFirst comes the sheer physical size: a parade ground bigger than 12 football fields. A semicircular Congress Hall that dwarfs any structure at Lincoln Center. Great Street, more than one-and-a-half miles long, with no structures on either side \u2014 a modern Appian Way where the storm troopers strutted between the old Nuremberg of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and the rallies idolizing the F\u00fchrer.Then there are its troubled history and the far stickier question of what to do with it. \u201cThese are not simple memorials,\u201d said Mathias Pfeil, chief curator of historic sites in Bavaria, \u201cbecause they symbolize a time we can only wish had never happened.\u201dShould public money be spent to preserve these crumbling sites? Is controlled decay an option for anything associated with the Nazis? Or have Hitler and his architect, Albert Speer, locked future generations into a devilish pact that compels Germans not only to teach the history of the Thousand Year Reich the Nazis proclaimed here but also to adapt it for each new era?Several dozen experts \u2014 and some curious citizens \u2014 gathered for a weekend recently to ponder such questions at a forum titled \u201cPreserve. For what?\u201dThe forum kicked off several weeks of events intended to stir citywide discussion before a decision next year on whether to expand existing exhibits and pointers across the four-square-mile site. Participants also pondered whether and how to use apps and other modern techniques to conjure the Nazi universe for present and future generations with no witnesses left to consult.\u201cEach generation has to find its own way to handle Nazi history,\u201d Mr. Maly said.\u201cWe cannot spare them the work,\u201d he said, but can provide the raw material for thought.\u201cWe do not want to prettify anything, but we want to stop the decay,\u201d he said. If so, then whole structures must be shored up, he said, arguing that piecemeal repairs risk further wholesale damage.One of the forum-related events is an exhibit that traces the Parteitagsgel\u00e4nde, where party congresses were held, since United States troops reached it in 1945 and blew up the towering stone eagle and swastika atop the Zeppelin tribune.Since that decisive move to obliterate a powerful Nazi symbol, the site has been many things to many people. In 1955, the evangelist Billy Graham preached and rallied thousands. The Sudeten Germans, ethnic Germans expelled in 1945 from their ancestral lands to the east, rallied here that year as well. Their rally, noted the exhibit curator Alexander Schmidt, now looks and sounds like a latter-day Nazi gathering.In 1978, a year before The Who, Bob Dylan gave a famous concert, playing \u201cMasters of War\u201d and noting, \u201cWhat a pleasure it is to sing it in this place.\u201dIn 1995, Billy Joel and his half brother, Alexander, a classical musician, performed here, honoring their father and grandfather, who came from Nuremberg and fled the Nazis.\u201cThese buildings are not harmless,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cThey have to do with the Nazis.\u201dUlrich Herbert, a historian and professor at the Albert Ludwigs University in Freiburg, said the site was important not least because \u201cthis is a place where you can understand how the Nazis succeeded in winning people over.\u201d It was here, he noted, that the party staked its claim to absolute power \u201cwith an intimidating production that enshrined a cult of the F\u00fchrer.\u201dThat \u201cintimidating production\u201d was chronicled and partly fashioned by Leni Riefenstahl in her 1935 propaganda film, \u201cTriumph of the Will,\u201d filmed here at the previous year\u2019s Nazi party congress.Her glorification of Hitler \u2014 right from the opening when he flies through clouds, descending on Nuremberg like a god from the heavens \u2014 skipped features now noted in the city\u2019s museums: the beer-swilling squalor in the city and parade grounds, and the anti-Semitic race laws that Hitler signed during the 1935 party congress here and thus bear Nuremberg\u2019s name.Up to 250,000 people, half of them foreigners, now visit the museum at the site of the party congresses each year. Northern Bavarians in their early teens pay compulsory school visits, experiencing what Mr. Herbert calls \u201cthe German peculiarity\u201d of discovering and taking responsibility for the Nazi past, making being German \u201cdifferent than being Swiss.\u201dHow modern the memorials and museums here should be was one point of heated discussion among the academics. A British historian, Neil Gregor of the University of Southampton in England, who has chronicled Nazi Nuremberg, argued hardest for contemporary themes, such as refugees, and making the debate more multiethnic.Others wanted the focus firmly on the Third Reich. Nurembergers younger than 25, who have grown up in a united Germany with no memory of the United States troops who left here in 1994, scarcely have the same interest in or sensitivities to the Nazi structures as their parents, said Michael Husarek, a father of six who is deputy editor of the local newspaper N\u00fcrnberger Nachrichten.\u201cFor the young, they don\u2019t have the same fears of contact with, say, the parade ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has always been part of their lives.\u201dOn a recent Saturday afternoon, local youths played hockey at the steps of the tribune, while foreign tourists looked at Hitler\u2019s lectern. Rock music blasted nearby.For five decades, the Americans limited access to Soldiers\u2019 Field, the sports facilities used by the United States military below the tribune. The Americans left, said Mr. Schmidt, the curator, but the Nuremberg Rams football team lives on and practices there.\u201cAnd they should stay,\u201d Mr. Schmidt added. \u201cImagine what the F\u00fchrer would say. And if he wouldn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s probably a good outcome.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hidden Costs of Terrorism", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhat is the economic cost of terrorism?The conventional wisdom is that an act of terrorism accounts for a mere blip in economic damage. Economists often point to research showing that after the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the London subway bombings in 2005, gross domestic product in those countries barely budged and showed little direct correlation to the attacks.Even in the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, consumption remained relatively stable, though investment fell. (There have been bigger impacts on places like Bali and Tunisia, whose economies depend heavily on foreign tourism.)If the stock market can be considered a barometer of economic confidence, it is remarkable to see how quickly it typically rebounds after a terrorist event. In the case of New York, Madrid and London, the market briefly dropped but then recovered, often within weeks. In the case of Sept. 11, the S.&P. 500-stock index returned to where it had been before the attacks just 30 days later.On Monday, market participants steeled themselves for a steep decline, but the indexes in the United States were up more than 1 percent, and markets in Europe were close to flat.But that reaction \u2014 and the reaction to previous attacks \u2014 may belie the true cost of terrorism and, more important, underestimate the potential cost of the Paris killings.\u201cThe aftermath of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks may not in itself prompt extensive market-based volatility,\u201d Citigroup wrote in a report, suggesting that financial markets \u201ctreat such developments as idiosyncratic and the unfortunate reality of a world where large-scale carnage has become an almost daily, if sickening, development.\u201dThe report, however, said, \u201cWe think this time is different.\u201dThat view is consistent with the opinions of some security experts, who in recent days have said that the attack in Paris represents just one in a continuum.\u201cWe have upgraded the risk of terrorist attacks not only in the Middle East but also in the West, as well as the likelihood of increased international military intervention in IS strongholds in Syria, Iraq and Libya,\u201d Citigroup said, referring to the Islamic State.The attack in Paris could have far-reaching implications for the future of the eurozone and for companies doing business there. The events in Paris could add to the pressure to close borders in the eurozone. It is also reigniting a debate about privacy and surveillance that could have big implications for technology companies.Over the weekend, Evercore ISI, the research arm of the investment bank Evercore, published a note to its clients suggesting that the events in Paris could threaten the political support inside Germany for its chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has been a big supporter of open borders, of the Syrian migration and of limiting electronic surveillance on civil liberty grounds.\u201cThe connection between the terror threat and migration flows threatens to rupture the border-free Schengen zone,\u201d the note said, describing the borderless, passport-free zone known as the Schengen area. \u201cIt challenges Merkel\u2019s position at home and in the wider E.U., nudging higher the tail risk that Europe\u2019s indispensable leader could fall from power.\u201dThe economic implications of this are significant, to say the least. Evercore ISI even speculated it was possible that Ms. Merkel could ultimately be replaced by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, who has seemingly been inclined to let Greece leave the eurozone.An analysis of the cost of Sept. 11 conducted by The New York Times added up the physical damage ($55 billion) and the economic damage ($123 billion). It also included other costs: the cost of developing the Homeland Security Department ($589 billion), war funding ($1.6 trillion) and what was determined to be the continuing cost of those wars and taking care of veterans ($867 billion).Some economists might say much of that actually increases economic growth. That\u2019s true. Sort of. The truth is it\u2019s an unproductive form of spending. And the development of Homeland Security and the war creates a so-called economic friction in the system that slows down just about everything; it\u2019s hard to measure, but it\u2019s there.One place to look at the cost of terror is Israel. An academic study that examined the economic damage of the attacks in Israel between 1994 and 2003 showed that the country\u2019s per-capita G.D.P. \u201cwould have been 8.6 percent higher than it was\u201d had there been peace.Conducted by Dotan Persitz, a scholar at Tel Aviv University, the study found that \u201cPalestinian terror increased the shares of consumption and government expenditures\u201d while it \u201cdecreased the shares of investment and trade balance in G.D.P.\u201dThe study is hard to fully appreciate on its face, but even if the damage in Israel were only half what was reported, it would have been billions of dollars.Let\u2019s hope the attacks in Paris were a one-off. But the study is a reminder that the cost of terrorism could be greater than we think.videoAdvertisement"}

Is she simply an employee? A paid proxy aunt? Is her influence felt in every room and in every interaction, or is she weightless, invisible, a tidying ghost?These are the questions a beloved caretaker inevitably raises. She is part of the family stew, yes, but not of its stock; a little less than kin but more than kind.Babette can be grating, certainly, rewashing dishes that have already been done; she teems with convictions and proverbs and \u201cnot very original pronouncements.\u201d But this indomitable widow soon becomes indispensable \u2014 not just to the family\u2019s practical functioning, but also to its psychic life.\u201cMrs. A. was the only real witness of the enterprise we embarked on day after day, the sole observer of the bond that held us together,\u201d the narrator says, adding, \u201cEvery love needs someone to witness and acknowledge it, to validate it, or it may turn out to be just a mirage.\u201dThen, one day, after eight years of faithful service, Mrs. A. abruptly quits, declaring that she\u2019s exhausted. Shortly thereafter, she is diagnosed with lung cancer and dies. \u201cWithout her gaze,\u201d says the narrator, \u201cwe felt at risk.\u201dThe reader learns these essentials early in the narrative. (Mr. Giordano, who has a Ph.D. in particle physics, is a master of economy.) What follows is a toggle between past and present, as the narrator pieces together who Mrs. A. truly is (beyond an avid reader of horoscopes) and, more important, what hidden role she played in his fragile family \u2014 what subtle fissures she helped smooth over, what shortcomings she helped conceal.The narrator, a theoretical physicist, is fretful, introverted, a paragon of rationality; his wife, Nora, is exuberant, ethereal, a dervish of chaos. Under Mrs. A.\u2019s sure-footed direction, the house ran smoothly, making their differences manageable, even romantic. Now, with her vanished from their lives, those differences threaten to overwhelm. His understanding of Mrs. A.\u2019s terminal illness \u2014 \u201ca statistic, maybe in the overlooked tail of the Gaussian curve, though still within the natural order of things\u201d \u2014 strikes Nora as cynical; her unwillingness to be consoled strikes him as \u201ca lack of generosity.\u201d\u201cMrs. A.\u2019s cancer,\u201d says the narrator, at a particularly low moment, \u201chad called attention to our separateness. We were, in spite our hopes, insoluble in one another.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the couple who suffer. So does their little boy, Emanuele, who misses Babette, and \u201ccan\u2019t understand the self-centeredness the illness has forced on her.\u201d Throughout his life, she has doted on him; she was so effusive in her praise that his father was slow to discover his son\u2019s intellectual weaknesses. Without Mrs. A., Emanuele is vulnerable to the anger and frustration of his father, who is aghast at his child\u2019s limitations, in mathematics especially. \u201cIt\u2019s zero. Zero!\u201d he barks, when Emanuele fails to come up with the answer to a simple equation. \u201cIf you can\u2019t grasp it, then just get used to it!\u201d His wife quietly takes over.\u201cHere we are, then,\u201d says the narrator, \u201call three of us absorbed by ourselves and no one else: Nora reeling from her proliferation of chores, Emanuele trying to suppress his longing for his nanny and me giving in to psychic weakness.\u201dAll while Mrs. A. lies dying \u2014 the ultimate solitary experience, the loneliest thing we\u2019ll ever do.This may sound terribly bleak. But bleakness isn\u2019t the overall mood of \u201cLike Family,\u201d nor is it the final note the book sounds; rather, it\u2019s melancholy, and there\u2019s a world of difference. The characters in \u201cLike Family\u201d know what hope is. They know joy, they know love. They are in pain because they know that illusions are often required to sustain these feelings. Mrs. A. was often the provider of these illusions, sometimes by accident and sometimes by design.\u201cI miss the way she encouraged us,\u201d Nora says. \u201cPeople are so stingy with their encouragement.\u201dEven on her deathbed in her home, Mrs. A. seems in no way pitiable, and she remains the source of mysterious coherence that she had been at the peak of her vitality. As Nora trembles at her bedside, trying to fasten a bracelet around her wrist, Mrs. A. tells her: \u201cDon\u2019t cry. For a while we were good company for each other.\u201dGiven our na\u00efve and lofty ambitions, this may not sound like much.

Both the Sanders and O\u2019Malley campaigns will tell you that their man is running \u201cthe old-school retail way,\u201d which basically means attempting to have at least one meal with every single person in the state.Iowans expect that kind of behavior \u2014 ask average voters why they prefer Candidate X, and they\u2019ll quote something he told them at brunch last Sunday. But they\u2019re impossible to satisfy. In 2008, then-Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd got less than 1 percent of the vote even after he moved his family to Iowa and enrolled his daughter in kindergarten there.Another great tradition of Iowa presidential campaigns is megapandering to farming interests, and perhaps we will get a debate question about the federal government\u2019s expensive ethanol program, which does zip for the environment but uses a hell of a lot of corn in the process. Both Sanders and O\u2019Malley seem generally pro-ethanol. As a senator from New York, Hillary Clinton was a staunch critic, but since she\u2019s moved on to the presidential arena she has evolved and now promises to \u2026 um, make it better.There will also be debate on tax issues, and bank regulation \u2014 no better way to spend a weekend night than cuddling up by the fire and listening to people argue about the Glass-Steagall Act. But even when everyone onstage is issue-oriented to an extreme, there\u2019s still always the possibility something exciting and cheesy will happen.Maybe somebody will ask Clinton about joining the Marines. She recently said in New Hampshire that when she was 27, she tried to enlist and was told that a woman her age would be better off checking in with the Army. The first time she recounted this tale, as first lady in 1994, it was greeted with extreme skepticism, given the fact that she was describing a point in her life when she was an accomplished Washington lawyer, soon to be married to a man who was clearly planning a political career in Arkansas.But now she\u2019s brought it up again, with no additional context. Maybe Clinton was just testing the Marines to see if they were sexist. Or maybe she was having second thoughts about getting married. If that\u2019s the story I would definitely like to hear more.A) \u201cNobody told me it included New Zealand.\u201dB) \u201cThe opportunity to speak one-on-one with the American people during this campaign has given me a whole new appreciation of the yarn situation.\u201dC) \u201cIt\u2019s a deal that was designed for China.\u201dBetter not to use the last option because 1) It\u2019s a quote from Donald Trump and 2) China isn\u2019t part of the agreement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Attacks to Dominate Agenda at G-20 Conference in Turkey", "Date": "2015-11-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president landed in Turkey on Sunday for a 10-day trip to that nation, the Philippines and Malaysia, after a series of simultaneous attacks in Paris prompted President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France to tighten the nation\u2019s border controls and mobilize the military. Before leaving Saturday, Mr. Obama convened a meeting of his National Security Council to review the latest intelligence on the attacks, officials said.The official economic agenda in Turkey and Asia was already likely to be overshadowed by a series of intense meetings between Mr. Obama and his counterparts about the Syrian civil war, the refugee crisis in Europe, disputes with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and ongoing tensions in the South China Sea.But the Paris attacks are certain to push even those topics to the side, at least temporarily, as world leaders confront the scale of the terrorist attacks in the French capital. The leaders will grapple with the rising threat of the Islamic State, which Mr. Hollande has blamed for the Paris attacks. American authorities on Saturday did not dispute Mr. Hollande\u2019s assessment or the Islamic State\u2019s own claim of responsibility.Mr. Obama had been scheduled to meet one-on-one with Mr. Hollande, but the French president canceled his visit to Turkey soon after the scale of the attacks became clear.Six years after Mr. Obama attended his first G-20 meeting at the height of the global economic crisis in 2009, the United States economy has rebounded and the president was looking forward to attending this year\u2019s gathering as the leader of one of the world\u2019s strongest economies.Mr. Obama had also planned to use the summit meetings to make diplomatic progress after recent military advances in Iraq against the Islamic State, which has seized vast territory in both Iraq and Syria. Secretary of State John Kerry has been trying to forge a diplomatic path that could lead to the eventual departure from Syria of President Bashar al-Assad and an end to four years of conflict in the country.Mr. Obama\u2019s conversations with world leaders are scheduled to take place not far from Turkey\u2019s border with Syria, a transit point for refugees. Before the Paris attacks, aides to Mr. Obama had expressed hope for what they called \u201cincremental\u201d movement during the president\u2019s discussions, but they cautioned that negotiations would need to continue beyond the president\u2019s trip to the region.\u201cThese issues are hugely complex and fraught,\u201d said Susan E. Rice, the president\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t, they would have been resolved a long time ago.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody expects a single outcome that all of a sudden readily resolves all these difficult issues,\u201d she added.Not on the official schedule is a meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin, who is expected at the summit meeting in Antalya. But even before the Paris attacks, White House officials said they had anticipated that the two leaders would have \u201cample opportunity\u201d to talk privately. The last meeting between the two men, at the United Nations General Assembly in September, was described as confrontational, even before Mr. Putin expanded his country\u2019s own military involvement in Syria.But Ms. Rice rejected that assessment of Mr. Putin. \u201cThe Russians certainly have their ideas; we have ours; other players have theirs,\u201d she said, adding that she did not see \u201cany indication that President Putin\u2019s isolation is diminished.\u201dLater in his trip, Mr. Obama is expected to highlight the Pacific trade agreement to underscore what White House officials call his long-term commitment to a larger American presence in Asia.\u201cThe United States takes no position on competing sovereignty claims\u201d in the South China Sea, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a news briefing before the Paris attacks. \u201cBut what we do take a strong position on is protecting the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea and airspace that\u2019s guaranteed to all countries.\u201dMr. Obama is certain to hear much on that subject from other Asian leaders, many of whom want help from the United States in standing against China\u2019s claims on the disputed waters off its coast. In late October, the administration sent a Navy destroyer through the disputed waters in what officials called a \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercise designed to send a signal to the Chinese.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Andes Mountains, a Ski Run of a Lifetime", "Date": "2015-11-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTILLO, Chile \u2014 I was struggling as I reached the top of one of the most famous ski runs in the Andes Mountains: the Super C Couloir.At the end of Portillo\u2019s surface lifts, we still had a two-hour hike. I\u2019d snapped one of my lightweight backcountry skis when I\u2019d collided with some avalanche debris a couple of days earlier and was now ascending with a pair of borrowed boards easily as big as waterskis.Kalen Thorien, my friend, the 27-year-old professional skier and adventurer from Salt Lake City, high-fived me at the top, as did five new friends we\u2019d made at dinner the night before. It was the culmination of one of the best ski weeks either of us had ever seen, and it was about to get better.From Aug. 6 to 11, a single storm system had dumped seven feet of snow, and then the skies cleared to blue. We stood at the entrance to the Super C three days later, the first people to complete the hike to the top since the storm.The run \u2014 a basement-stairs-steep chute that descends more than 4,000 feet (from 12,729 feet to 8,398 feet above sea level) through a 30-foot-wide hallway of rock \u2014 was packaged in a nearly nine-foot-thick, untracked blanket of white.\u201cI tore a picture of Super C out of Powder magazine and had it in my locker when I was a kid,\u201d said Thomas Laakso, 44, who works for a snow-safety start-up called Avatech in Park City, Utah. He had been trying to ski the fabled couloir, or gully, for 10 years, but the conditions were never right for him. Just two days earlier, he\u2019d tried and failed to reach the top. But he made it this day.Himay Palmer, a dreadlocked bus driver from Telluride, Colo., also was among the five. \u201cYou just can\u2019t plan for something like this,\u201d he said.For Kalen and me, these comments validated a plan we\u2019d devised the previous Friday, booking plane tickets and a week at Hotel Portillo on a day\u2019s notice.In an age where climate change is making it harder to rely on previously consistent adventure destinations for anything from surfing to fly fishing, there\u2019s a huge upside to hanging back, waiting for the perfect forecast and then enduring economy middle seats on a red-eye flight. No, it\u2019s not budget-friendly to travel on short notice, but it feels better to spend too much on a great trip than get a bargain on terrible snow.So the coup wasn\u2019t that we\u2019d lucked into prime conditions but that we\u2019d ambushed the storm of the decade from 5,700 miles away.Three weeks earlier, on July 18, Portillo had finally opened after its first winter storm. The resort sits along the International Highway at the border with Argentina, two hours north and east of Chile\u2019s capital, Santiago.\u201cWe had the suicide hotline on speed dial in June,\u201d said Frank Coffey, an American who for two decades has been snow safety director at Portillo, about 110 miles northeast of Santiago. \u201cWe were at 4 percent of our normal precipitation in June. California was at 5 percent. It was the driest June in Chile in 47 years.\u201dFrom 2010 until March, the Pacific Ocean\u2019s waters were cooler than average, what scientists call a La Ni\u00f1a pattern, which led to droughts and left slopes barren across the Western Hemisphere. An El Ni\u00f1o \u2014 warmer waters \u2014 was declared in spring, and now climate scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say there\u2019s a greater than 95 percent chance the El Ni\u00f1o, with its drenching rains, will continue through the winter.The August storm wasn\u2019t the first time the Portillo area has coped with large snowfalls brought on by the phenomenon. \u201cMy first year here was 1997,\u201d Mr. Coffey said. \u201cIt was a strong El Ni\u00f1o year. My second week, it snowed four meters in five days, and the road was closed for nine days. We had a couple hundred Peruvian workers who got stuck in buses on the road heading to Argentina to work.\u201d He recalled that Henry Purcell, the resort\u2019s owner, put them up for $1 each a night. \u201cThe guests that were here were stuck for nine days,\u201d he said.The hotel\u2019s operations manager, Michael Rogan, another American, said, \u201cThere have been times when people would fly in and out in helicopters when the road was closed. And there have been times that they\u2019d ski in and out.\u201cThe road would be opened to the bottom of the Juncalillo chairlift, and people would ride up the lift, and we\u2019d have grooms at the top of the lift to grab their bags and walk them down to the hotel,\u201d Mr. Rogan said. \u201cPeople would ski out to the snow line where the taxis would be waiting. The best part is that when you\u2019re snowed-in in Portillo, you\u2019re snowed in.\u201dIn early July, there had been no sign of significant snow. Then between July 10 and 14, the first El Ni\u00f1o storm arrived and pounded the Andes with six feet.Around Aug. 1, an even bigger blob of moisture, equivalent to more than four feet of rainwater, showed up on the regional radars. It was off the coast of Chile, still a week away. Forecasts from MeteoChile, the local weather agency, predicted that the storm would be huge \u2014 and unlike many forecasts that change as the weather gets closer, this one continued to promise a significant snowfall.\u201cThe flow became zonal, meaning from west to east,\u201d Mr. Coffey said. \u201cIt was like a firehose pointed right at us, and suddenly we were in the money.\u201dOn Aug. 6, in Salt Lake City, I noticed an outrageous snow forecast calling for 14 feet in the Portillo area. And I\u2019d seen photos in my social media feeds from Chris Davenport \u2014 a professional skier who runs an annual trip to Portillo for well-heeled experts, called Superstars Ski Camp \u2014 that he\u2019d taken during the first storm.So I booked a ticket to Santiago for that Saturday \u2014 36 hours later \u2014 and told my editors at Outside magazine that I wouldn\u2019t be at work the next week.Kalen was canyoneering in Zion National Park but needed no prodding when she emerged. \u201cI want to play...\u201d was the full text of her note when I told her I was going. (Like many millennials, Kalen communicates primarily with her thumbs.)When we arrived Aug. 9, the road had just reopened to local traffic. The historic yellow Hotel Portillo, which opened in 1949 along an old rail line, was taken over in 1961 by the New York hotelier Bob Purcell, who hired his nephew Henry, now 81, as the general manager. The resort, which is perched 30-odd switchbacks above the valley, offers several levels of service, including the hostel-like Inca Lodge, the dormitory-style Octagon Lodge, cozy chalets and four-star suites in the yellow hotel itself. But at its core, Portillo offers only one product: The all-inclusive ski week. Occupancy maxes out at 460. During our stay, there were 357 guests (which meant untracked snow all week).\u201cIf you have people checking in and out every day, it takes away from the sharing and the exchange of getting to know people and hanging out in the mountains,\u201d Mr. Rogan said.Meals are served in the common dining room or cafeteria or at the mid-mountain Tio Bob\u2019s restaurant. Each night until midnight, a different band \u2014 all-female \u201990s cover acts seem popular \u2014 plays in the bar, where we saw a 12-year-old boy crowd surfing and the ski-film stars Wendy Fisher and Ingrid Backstrom dancing on tables. We spent one Pisco-and-Escudo-soaked evening at a bar called El Paseo, in honor of the ninth birthday of Radka, the St. Bernard usually found asleep in the hotel lobby. And Kalen learned some crude Chilean slang meaning roughly, \u201cno way!\u201d that became her catchphrase.Mostly I kept marveling at how well everything seemed to work, despite there being so many different people from so many backgrounds, ages, abilities and alcohol tolerances steeping in the same giant hot tubs overlooking the Laguna del Inca, the nearby lake.\u201cThe walls talk to you,\u201d said Bill Johnston, a banking executive from Connecticut who was vacationing with his wife and four children. \u201cThey\u2019re haunted with ski history.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to be an expert to ski Portillo, but it\u2019s more fun if you are. Groomed beginner runs descend to the hotel from most of the elevated chairlifts, but the powderfields like Primavera and a hike up into an apron called Two-Hundred Turns are what get people worked into a feverish lather.Just riding the surface lifts to them can be an adventure.The most famous of the so-called va-et-vient (come-and-go) rope tows, specially designed by the French chairlift engineering company Poma to haul skiers straight up the avalanche chutes, is the Roca Jack. It features five frisbee-like seat discs attached to a steel bar, which is, in turn, attached to a cable that drags skiers up the mountain five at a time \u2014 and a little too fast. Wipeouts are common.The real draw of the area, though, is the out-of-bounds terrain above the lifts, which you can reach with a guide \u2014 heli skiing is available as well \u2014 or on your own. (Slopes beyond the boundaries aren\u2019t controlled with explosives, so skiers should have avalanche training and carry standard backcountry gear, including a locator beacon, a shovel, and a probe.)Four narrow couloirs descend into the Lake Run, and there\u2019s the crown jewel, the Super C. From where we stood on the vertigo-inducing gendarme, or pinnacle, that divides the ascent and descent routes, the hotel and the road\u2019s switchbacks were visible thousands of feet below. Behind us, with a flag of wind-driven snow kicking off its 22,837-foot summit, was Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the Western Hemisphere.Himay and Thomas dropped in first, and, one by one, we each followed, descending into a kind of dream state of the perfect ski run that never ends. The jitters of dropping into such a steep couloir subsided. Fifteen minutes later, our group emerged onto the apron of the run where we made wide, fast, giant slalom turns that felt as effortless as surfing a glassy wave.\u201cIt\u2019s like somebody flipped the switch,\u201d Mr. Coffey said of El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cIt\u2019s probably what\u2019s going to happen in California this winter, too.\u201dWe\u2019ll be ready when it does.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the location. It was the Toilet Bowl chute, not the Super C Couloir.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea Targets Dissent", "Date": "2015-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSouth Koreans can be as proud of their country\u2019s emergence from dictatorship into a vibrant democracy as they are of the rags-to-riches development that made their country a global industrial powerhouse. So it is alarming that President Park Geun-hye appears intent on backtracking on the democratic freedoms that have made South Korea as different from North Korea\u2019s puppet regime as day is from night.Last weekend, tens of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets to protest two repressive government initiatives. One would replace the independently selected history textbooks now available to South Korea\u2019s educators with government-issued textbooks. The other would change labor laws to make it easier for South Korea\u2019s family-controlled business conglomerates to fire workers.Ms. Park is also attempting to control criticism and dissent on social media and the Internet. On Saturday, Lee Sir-goo, the co-chief executive of South Korea\u2019s most popular messaging app, stepped down. He is facing criminal charges for failing to prevent teenagers from posting lewd photos, but critics contend the real goal is to punish him for resisting government surveillance efforts and refusing to curb users\u2019 opinions critical of the government. Ms. Park is the daughter of Gen. Park Chung-hee, who was an Imperial Japanese officer in the colonial era and South Korea\u2019s military dictator from 1961 to 1979. Rehabilitating her father\u2019s image appears to be one motivation for making sure South Korea\u2019s students learn a whitewashed version of their country\u2019s history \u2014 especially the period when democratic freedoms were seen as an impediment to industrialization.South Korea\u2019s economy has been hit hard this year by an outbreak of MERS respiratory disease and a slowdown in demand from China and other Asian countries. The biggest risk to South Korea\u2019s reputation abroad, however, is not economic but political, chiefly Ms. Park\u2019s heavy-handed attempts to rewrite history and quash dissent. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Banks on Incentives and Persuasion to Keep Migrants Home", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cOf course, we cannot match their dream of being in Italy,\u201d said Giuseppe Loprete, Niger mission chief for the International Organization for Migration, which runs the center. \u201cBut we can give them a local development project.\u201dThat gamble was at the heart of a summit meeting that began Wednesday in Valletta, the Maltese capital, with European and African leaders trying to forge a consensus on an urgent issue that confronts them both, though in sharply different ways: What to do about the tens of thousands of young Africans who try to cross a treacherous desert and sea in the hope of brighter prospects in Europe.Europe is legally obliged to take in refugees escaping war, but not migrants who cannot make a compelling case that they are fleeing conflict or persecution. So European leaders are dangling the promise of development aid and scholarships for college students, hoping to get African countries to keep their would-be migrants at home \u2014 and to take back others who have already made it to Europe.The deal includes a 1.8 billion euro fund (roughly $2 billion) for African countries from which migrants originate. In an effort to make it more palatable to Africans themselves, it also promises to double the number of university scholarships for African students and to offer new training opportunities for African entrepreneurs.The European Union\u2019s top diplomat at the United Nations, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, said that the deal being proposed was one that African leaders should embrace.\u201cIt is in their interest that we organize a joint response to the challenge,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe alternative, if they don\u2019t engage themselves as well, is we find ourselves in a situation where you would find very little, very little support for any kind of migration.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s asking them to help us make that flow a politically sustainable operation,\u201d he added.Critics liken those efforts to draining sand out of the Sahara.For one thing, Europe makes it virtually impossible for Africans to live and work in Europe legally, giving them few options other than the illegal, often dangerous, route.Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, made it clear that accepting returned migrants \u201cis a difficult subject\u201d for his continent. \u201cWe have people who have often taken chances with their lives in terrible conditions, who have crossed deserts and the Mediterranean,\u201d and there have been \u201cthousands of deaths,\u201d Mr. Sall told reporters Wednesday in Valletta.\u201cWe have to have a frank discussion,\u201d said Mr. Sall, who emphasized that there also needed to be a focus on allowing Africans to stay in Europe.Charity, said Gita Honwana Welch, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based policy research group, is not going to be enough. Many African economies, including those from which the migrants come, are growing fast, she pointed out, but doing little to create decent jobs for young citizens who aspire to a better life.The summit meeting itself hints at the vast gulf between the two continents on how to tackle migration. For Europe, keeping out economic migrants is an urgent political priority. For Africa, the exodus of young, ambitious men is potentially a political relief valve and an economic lift. It not only brings in cash, but also provides an exit route for frustrated young men who, as a recent report by the International Crisis Group notes, have no decent job prospects nor \u201creal loyalty to the state.\u201dEuropean capitals have historically had little success in sending home failed asylum seekers. A small share of them agree to return voluntarily, usually with a package of cash incentives facilitated by the International Organization for Migration. Most remain in Europe in the shadows.Now, with the surge of Syrian and other refugees from war, whom Europe is obliged to take, the continent\u2019s leaders are under intense pressure to draw a clear line against those who have no such legal protections \u2014 and to send them back home.The aid money that the European Union is expected to announce in Valletta this week \u2014 some of the \u20ac1.8 billion over the next several years is repackaged aid that Europe had already promised \u2014 is intended to spur economic opportunities in the migrants\u2019 home countries, including vocational training. But the money is also meant to be used for what the draft action plan calls \u201cmigration management, including containing and preventing irregular migration.\u201dMr. Loprete, the migration organization\u2019s director in Niger, took pains to point out that his center, which is financed by European donors, does not force anyone to return. It seeks instead, he said, to inform the migrants of the real risks that lie ahead \u2014 including getting stuck in Libya for months, which is what often happens \u2014 and to give them reasons to stay in the region. In the past, migrants returning home were sometimes offered a sewing machine to start a new business, or aid workers would help build water wells in their arid villages.His agency is now hoping to arm migrants with skills to make a better living closer to home \u2014 hence the school to teach them how to make bricks with sand and plastic.\u201cThey have sand everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately they have plastic everywhere,\u201d too.Mr. Loprete is keenly aware that it is not easy to talk someone out of following a dream. Not long ago, he said, he met a young man who was trying to get on a boat to Italy. It was his sixth try.James Kanter contributed reporting from Valletta, Malta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Burns Much More Coal Than Reported, Complicating Climate Talks", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven for a country of China\u2019s size, the scale of the correction is immense. The sharp upward revision in official figures means that China has released much more carbon dioxide \u2014 almost a billion more tons a year according to initial calculations \u2014 than previously estimated. The increase alone is greater than the whole German economy emits annually from fossil fuels.\u201cThis will have a big impact, because China has been burning so much more coal than we believed,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cIt turns out that it was an even bigger emitter than we imagined. This helps to explain why China\u2019s air quality is so poor, and that will make it easier to get national leaders to take this seriously.\u201dThe new data, which appeared recently in an energy statistics yearbook published without fanfare by China\u2019s statistical agency, show that coal consumption has been underestimated since 2000, and particularly in recent years. The revisions were based on a census of the economy in 2013 that exposed gaps in data collection, especially from small companies and factories.The new data indicated that much of the change came from heavy industry \u2014 including plants that produce coal chemicals and cement, as well as those using coking coal, which goes to make steel, Ms. Jones said. The correction for coal use in electric power generation was much smaller.\u201cIt\u2019s created a lot of bewilderment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur basic data will have to be adjusted, and the international agencies will also have to adjust their databases. This is troublesome because many forecasts and commitments were based on the previous data.\u201dWhen President Xi Jinping proposed that China\u2019s emissions stop growing by 2030, he did not say what level they would reach by then. The new numbers may mean that the peak will be higher, but they also raise hopes that emissions will crest many years sooner, Mr. Yang, the climate adviser, said.\u201cI think this implies that we\u2019re closer to a peak, because there\u2019s also been a falloff in coal consumption in the past couple of years,\u201d he said.Chinese energy and statistics agency officials did not respond to faxed requests for comment on the data revisions.The press office of the International Energy Agency said by email that the organization would revise its own data to reflect China\u2019s revisions, starting with numbers for 2011 to 2013 that will be released Wednesday. The agency estimated, based on the new figures, that China\u2019s carbon dioxide pollution in 2011 and 2012 was 4 percent to 6 percent greater than previously thought.But some scientists said the difference could be much larger.When estimating emissions, scientists prefer to account for coal use by the amount of energy in it rather than by its raw mass, which includes impurities that end up as ash. Measured in energy terms, Dr. Korsbakken said, China consumed 10 percent to 15 percent more coal than the old data had showed from 2005 to 2013, the last year for which the new and old figures can be compared. The revisions for 2001 through 2004 were smaller.Economists have grown increasingly skeptical about the economic data China publishes, and the revisions open a new episode in the debate over its energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions. China burned or otherwise consumed 4.2 billion metric tons in 2013, according to the new data, and its emissions now far exceed those of any other country, including the United States, the second-largest emitter.The revised numbers do not alter scientists\u2019 estimates of the total amount of carbon dioxide in the air. That is measured directly, not inferred from fuel consumption statistics the way countries\u2019 emissions are usually estimated.\u201cIf the emissions are partially wrong,\u201d Mr. Canadell said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be wrong in attributing carbon sources and sinks.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the release of new data showing that China burns up to 17 percent more coal per year than the government had previously disclosed misidentified, in some editions, the measurement that the figure of 4.2 billion metric tons applies to. It represents the amount of coal consumed in China in 2013, not the amount of carbon dioxide emitted.Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

The thinking is that buyers in Taipei will like the project because of its prices \u2014 studios start at $490,000 \u2014 its tax abatements, its rapidly improving neighborhood and the possibility of appreciation down the road, he said. Data on foreign buyers is hard to pin down, but Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, estimates they make up about 15 percent of the overall Manhattan residential market. Their presence is much larger in the condominium market, where foreigners drive about one-third of sales, and they are even more prominent in new developments, where they buy roughly half of all units, Mr. Miller said. As foreign buyers begin to shift away from trophy towers, the supply coming online is disconnected from the demand. As often happens in real estate cycles, because of the time it takes to plan and construct a building, the apartments now hitting the market tend to be high-end. On the market earlier this month were 1,362 apartments priced at $4 million or more in New York City and 185 apartments priced at $20 million or more, according to StreetEasy.com, At the same time, prices were cut at more than one in four apartments priced at $4 million or above and at one in five apartments priced at $20 million or more. Despite the inventory and price cuts, more apartments are coming. Twenty-eight condominium developments will deliver 1,175 more apartments through the end of the year, according to Douglas Elliman. Of those, eight buildings with some 375 units, or 32 percent, are considered luxury. And more are in the pipeline. Plans have been filed for 17 additional buildings, bringing another 700 units priced at $4 million or higher, to market over the next year, according to data from CityRealty. Meanwhile, some of the city\u2019s newer trophy towers have yet to generate the returns for which buyers had hoped.Foreign buyers are not expected to absorb much of this high-priced new inventory. Sanjay Sachdev, who is from Mumbai, is among the Indians who are already here and making just the kind of purchase Mr. De Niro describes. The executive chairman of ZyFin Holdings, a macro analytics research and investment advisory company, Mr. Sachdev did not consider looking at Billionaires\u2019 Row on West 57th Street, in West Chelsea or in other neighborhoods where wealthy foreign buyers have been known to flock.The reason Indians are forgoing apartments in flashy new buildings isn\u2019t just financial, said Jason Lanyard, a salesman at Stribling & Associates, who, along with Nicole Grandelli, a saleswoman at Stribling, represents Mr. Sachdev. Political and social pressures at home, particularly how badly buying an apartment in a trophy building would play to a domestic audience, are also having an impact on Indians\u2019 buying choices, they said. The Indian government also caps how much money each Indian can take out of the country annually, which limits what an individual can spend on real estate abroad. Foreign nationals are also buying in the United States because of their children. Mr. Sachdev has one child at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another at the University of Southern California \u2014 and he will use his second apartment to spend the summers here with his wife while his children are on break. Indians \u201cdon\u2019t typically take their money out of India because it is unsafe,\u201d Ms. Grandelli said, \u201cbut because the children are going to school here already or they expect they will someday.\u201d \u201cPolitical gyrations and geopolitical instability is driving the Chinese flight to safety, but on the other hand, it has diminished their purchasing power,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. The Chinese still have plenty of money to spend, so the change is more psychological than financial, Mr. Friedman said. \u201cChinese care about discounts,\u201d he said. \u201cThat part of the Chinese psyche was eclipsed by wanting to have their currency in something safe, but now that is going to be a more prevalent attitude, with buyers looking for deals.\u201cAre we going to continue to see Chinese buyers in New York? Absolutely. But are they going to think harder before they buy something? Yes.\u201d The number of Russian buyers has dropped in the past year or two, but those who already own here are still buying, said Edward Mermelstein, the managing partner of the law firm Rheem Bell & Mermelstein, who has many Russian clients. \u201cThose who are coming here for the first time are doing so for political reasons,\u201d Mr. Mermelstein said. \u201cThere are changes in Russia, cloaked under the guise of \u2018anti-corruption reforms.\u2019 So if they are coming today, it is because they are worried what might happen tomorrow.\u201d Whatever the motivator, international buyers continue to seek out New York as a safe investment, although the days of the $100 million penthouse appear to be on the wane. \u201cThere are no more vanity purchases,\u201d Mr. Mermelstein said. \u201cThe name of the game now is return.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meeting With Taiwan Reflects Limits of China\u2019s Checkbook", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Beijing has discovered, again, that money cannot buy love.The encounter, scheduled to take place on neutral ground in Singapore on Saturday, will be trumpeted by both sides as a milestone in cross-strait relations. But it also seems to be an implicit acknowledgment by Mr. Xi that the Chinese effort to woo Taiwan with economic benefits alone has been unsuccessful \u2014 and that Beijing\u2019s dream of unification with the island is as distant as ever, despite a long courtship.\u201cXi Jinping is at a loss,\u201d said Parris Chang, president of the Taiwan Institute for Political, Economic and Strategic Studies, a think tank in Taipei. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dJonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Nottingham, described the decision to meet Mr. Ma as \u201ca Hail Mary pass with time expiring.\u201d\u201cBeijing has finally realized that the partner it has been working with on Taiwan, the K.M.T., is heading for disaster,\u201d Professor Sullivan said, referring to the Kuomintang by its initials.Mr. Xi is breaking with long-established policy by agreeing to meet Mr. Ma. But it is unclear how much further the Communist leadership is able or willing to go to win over the 23 million people of Taiwan, who polls show are uninterested in unification and increasingly anxious about the self-governing island\u2019s dependence on the much larger Chinese economy.Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, is widely favored to become Taiwan\u2019s new president. So far, she has not been subjected to the sort of vitriol that the Communist Party has heaped on some of the D.P.P.\u2019s past candidates, an indication that Beijing may be receptive to working with her.Yet there has been no hint that China is capable of taking steps that might improve its public standing in Taiwan, by allowing the island greater representation in the United Nations or other international organizations, for example, or signaling a willingness to treat it as an equal in a future political union.In many ways, the Communist Party\u2019s approach to Taiwan has mirrored its policies in volatile Chinese territories like Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang, where it opens its checkbook to distribute economic benefits but refuses to compromise on political matters.The lesson for the Chinese leadership was that \u201cthe usual influence of the mainland \u2014 more money, more investment \u2014 has less impact,\u201d said a senior Asian diplomat following cross-strait relations, who requested anonymity to speak freely about a subject the Chinese consider sensitive.Joseph Wu, secretary general of the D.P.P., said the meeting scheduled for Saturday represented a shift by Beijing but was also a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\u201cChina is trying to woo Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I think the resentment among regular people for China is quite deep. People\u2019s dislike of President Ma is also deep. For those two to get together in Singapore may not change people\u2019s minds.\u201dPart of the problem in Taiwan has been slow growth; gross domestic product contracted in the last quarter, despite all the Chinese tourism and trade. Many are worried that investment in China has undermined Taiwan\u2019s own industries. And even when the island\u2019s economy performed better, wage growth stagnated, with the benefits of cross-strait trade going disproportionately to Taiwan\u2019s business elite.The larger concern, though, has been China\u2019s intentions. Beijing considers Taiwan to be Chinese territory that must be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary, and the demonstrations against Mr. Ma\u2019s policies have been driven by fear that China is using trade to achieve what decades of military bluster could not.Both sides have said Saturday\u2019s meeting is meant to consolidate peaceful relations and ensure future prosperity. \u201cThis meeting is positive, for Taiwan, for the mainland, for the world,\u201d Mr. Ma said in a news conference on Thursday.But many in Taiwan view the meeting as an attempt to influence the vote in January. Beijing has tried before to dampen popular support for independence-leaning politicians in Taiwan. It lobbed missiles into waters near the island ahead of the 1996 election. And it lavished attention on the Kuomintang to undercut the former president, Chen Shui-bian, whose moves to formalize Taiwan\u2019s separate status from China angered Beijing and, at times, Washington.\u201cChina has always tried to use different methods to influence Taiwan,\u201d said Lin Fei-fan, one of the leaders of the Sunflower Movement. \u201cMost people in Taiwan understand why they want to meet now,\u201d he added.Given that the Kuomintang\u2019s candidate, Eric Chu, is trailing Ms. Tsai in the polls, the Chinese government sees a meeting with Mr. Ma as a chance to shake up the race, said Li Jiaquan, a retired Taiwan researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. \u201cWe chose the timing because the situation for K.M.T. is critical right now,\u201d he said.\u201cThe meeting is to inspire the routed K.M.T.,\u201d he added, \u201cand on the other hand, suppress the charge of the D.P.P.\u201dBut Mr. Li acknowledged the gambit had little chance of success with an electorate in Taiwan that has soured on closer ties with the mainland. \u201cI can\u2019t say it would really work, but we need to do something to humble the D.P.P.,\u201d he said.Many analysts in Taiwan predict the meeting will only hurt the K.M.T. further. Ms. Tsai has already gone after Mr. Ma on the issue, denouncing his surprise announcement of the meeting and warning him against making concessions that could undermine Taiwan\u2019s status.\u201cThe way to win an election in Taiwan is to be the less dangerous of the two options,\u201d said Nathan F. Batto, a political scientist at Academia Sinica in Taipei. The D.P.P. was voted out of power after Mr. Chen\u2019s efforts to assert Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and rile China, he noted. \u201cBut over the past four years, I think Ma Ying-jeou defined himself as the more dangerous option. He engaged China too eagerly.\u201dOthers said the criticism of Mr. Ma overlooked how his policies had drastically reduced tensions and the potential for armed conflict between China and Taiwan. \u201cHe deserves more credit than he gets,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a prominent investor from Taiwan and former head of Google in China.The D.P.P. says it would be open to meetings with Mr. Xi, too, if it wins in January, but it has rejected Beijing\u2019s insistence that both sides first agree that Taiwan is part of \u201cone China.\u201d It has also called for broad transparency and legislative oversight of meetings with mainland officials.Beijing has tried to hedge for the possibility that the D.P.P. will return to power in Taiwan, inviting several party figures to China for meetings with local officials in recent years. But if Ms. Tsai is elected as expected, there is little doubt that she will slow its efforts to bind Taiwan more closely to the mainland economically.That leaves Mr. Xi with limited options. \u201cThis line of united-front thinking has failed,\u201d wrote Li Ping, a journalist for Apple Daily, a newspaper in Hong Kong, referring to China\u2019s strategy of using economics to pursue its political goals. \u201cBut the Communist Party has never engaged in introspection.\u201dJane Perlez contributed reporting from Beijing.

She sold her condominium, intending to live off the proceeds. She figured she would have no problem going back to work in a better position.A year and a half later, she had completed her dissertation and received her doctoral degree in education. But the job market was a disaster.Even with her new doctorate in hand, she found nothing suitable, setting in motion an unexpected downward spiral. At times, Ms. Horton, said she was \u201csofa surfing,\u201d or sleeping on a relative\u2019s or friend\u2019s couch.\u201cIt put you in a position of thinking, \u2018I should not have left my job,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI am the kind of person who thinks things happen and you take responsibility and you move on.\u201dMs. Horton barely scraped by, she said, making it through a long period without much income only with the help of a \u201cvery small circle\u201d of family and friends. She worked in unpaid fellowships, temporary and contract positions before finally turning, in September 2013, to the San Francisco Jewish Vocational Service, an organization that helps people build skills and find jobs.The recession was over, but it was still a challenge to find a decent job in a rapidly transforming economy. In what she calls her \u201caha!\u201d moment, Ms. Horton decided to take her degrees off her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 all of them \u2014 so as not to be perceived as overqualified, and to get her \u201cfoot in the door.\u201dAt the beginning of 2014, she was hired as manager of radiology and biomedical imaging at the University of California, San Francisco, where she has been working ever since. She is making more money now than she was when she left her job in 2007. \u201cWhat better way to end your career than doing something you care about and can affect others in a positive way?\u201d she said.

Rutledge, a labor economist at the Center for Retirement Research and a co-author of the paper. \u201cIt was really difficult for them to get back in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter if they had retired or were laid off.\u201dFor older Americans, paths to returning to full-time work vary. Some go into consulting, others seek specialized knowledge and new contacts by working as a volunteer. Still others resume their education through courses online or at a for-profit or community college, while some enroll in professional association courses. Many decide to start a business.The biggest challenge for those seeking a new job after an extended period of unemployment is updating their skills for the current workplace.\u201cIf you have been laid off or retired for a couple of years, skill sets may have moved on quite rapidly without you,\u201d said Mark Schmit, executive director of the SHRM Foundation, a research affiliate of the Society for Human Resource Management. \u201cThis puts you at a disadvantage to the people who are working, including peers who are the same age.\u201dRich Feller is a professor of counseling and career development at Colorado State University, past president of the National Career Development Association and a thought leader with AARP Life Reimagined. Dr. Feller said a key credential for returning to the work force is the ability to \u201cdocument your technology skills.\u201d If you can, he said, employers will \u201coverlook your age.\u201dThe popular belief that younger workers are more productive than older workers is \u201clargely a myth,\u201d Mr. Schmit said. \u201cThe only evidence we have of that is in physical labor.

{"Headline": "Fed Minutes Signal Readiness for December Rate Increase", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost Fed officials say they think the economy will be ready for higher rates by year\u2019s end, the Fed revealed on Wednesday in an official account of its October policy-making meeting.The account cautioned that the Fed might still be deterred by \u201cunanticipated shocks\u201d or disappointing economic data, but such warnings sound increasingly pro forma. After the strong October jobs report, investors and analysts are convinced that a rate increase is imminent. Borrowing costs are rising, and Fed officials are encouraging the solidification of expectations.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.\u201cI am comfortable with moving off zero soon, conditioned on no marked deterioration in economic conditions,\u201d Dennis P. Lockhart, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president and a reliable monetary policy bellwether, said on Wednesday at a conference in New York.The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008 as the major element in its campaign to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. By raising interest rates, it will reduce that encouragement, although Fed officials have emphasized that they plan to raise rates gradually because the economy remains relatively weak.\u201cWe continue to expect a December liftoff,\u201d Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank, wrote in an analysis after the release of the minutes on Wednesday. \u201cHaving said that, we expect the Fed to increasingly emphasize the gradual, or even glacial, pace of hikes thereafter, likely assuaging fears and containing any unwarranted tightening in financial markets.\u201dFed officials at the October meeting expressed confidence in the health of the domestic economy despite disappointing job growth in August and September. The ranks of people unsuccessfully seeking work have gradually dwindled, and most Fed officials saw labor market conditions as nearly normal. Additionally, most continued to predict that inflation would rebound after several years of sluggishness.\u201cParticipants were encouraged by the solid pace of consumption growth in the third quarter and generally expected consumer spending to rise moderately going forward,\u201d the account said.It also noted that markets had settled after a period of volatility that contributed to the Fed\u2019s decision not to raise rates in September. \u201cThe U.S. financial system appeared to have weathered the turbulence in global financial markets without any sign of systemic stress,\u201d it said.The minutes published on Wednesday appeared to have little impact on financial markets, which in recent weeks had already raised the odds of a December rate increase to about 66 percent.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who has emphasized the importance of preparing financial markets for liftoff, said on Wednesday before the publication of the minutes that it appeared investors were ready for the Fed to start raising rates.\u201cThe good news is that this is probably the most well-advertised, discussed, thought-about, mused-over prospect of beginning a normalization of monetary policy in history,\u201d said Mr. Dudley, who spoke at the same conference as Mr. Lockhart. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a big reaction.\u201dSome officials still argued at the Fed\u2019s October meeting that it was too soon to start raising rates. Their case focused less on current conditions than on the risk the economy would suffer a setback.These officials warned that a global downturn could cause \u201ca potential loss of momentum in the economy and the associated possibility that inflation might fail to increase as expected.\u201dOthers Fed officials, however, counseled against delay. They argued that the Fed would only confuse financial markets by delaying, and it risked undermining economic confidence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Global Sales Fell 5% in October", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVolkswagen attributed the decline partly to its having halted sales of some diesel models whose engines were found to have software designed to recognize when they were undergoing emissions tests and to activate pollution controls.On the road, the exhausts of those cars would exceed allowable levels of nitrogen oxide, a harmful pollutant.In Europe, sales of Volkswagen brand cars slipped 1 percent to 142,300 vehicles in October compared with a year earlier. It was the first full month of sales since the emissions cheating came to light in September.The company\u2019s reputation has suffered further since it admitted last week that it had made exaggerated claims about fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions for about 800,000 vehicles in Europe. That means the company must now go through the embarrassing process of restating the figures for its latest models, which could be damaging to future sales.\u201cThe sales drops Volkswagen experienced were expected as the brand and group navigates its way through unprecedented times,\u201d Akshay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in a statement. \u201cVolkswagen\u2019s bottom line will feel the impact for years to come.\u201dWhile the sales decline in Europe was modest, it was potentially serious for the company because the region accounts for about 30 percent of Volkswagen brand sales worldwide, which totaled 490,000 in October.Volkswagen also continued to suffer from plunging sales in Brazil and Russia because of economic problems in those countriesAbout half the cars sold in Europe are diesels, far more than in the United States or other major markets. So any problem with diesels is likely to have a more striking effect in Europe than anywhere else. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche and several other car brands, is the biggest automaker in Europe by far.Sales of Volkswagen brand cars in Brazil fell 50 percent during October compared with a month earlier and fell 27 percent in Russia. Sales in China, which account for nearly half of Volkswagen brand sales, rose 2 percent, but that was not enough to compensate for declines elsewhere.Volkswagen sold 30,387 cars in the United States in October, 74 more vehicles than during October 2014. The company has been providing thousands of dollars in incentives to potential buyers to help keep United States sales alive. Because diesels accounted for only about 20 percent of Volkswagen sales in America, the effect of a halt in diesel sales is less significant than in Europe in terms of the absolute number of cars.Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche and Audi units continued to record gains in the United States. As a result, sales of all Volkswagen brands in the United States rose 6 percent during October, to 52,400 vehicles.The cars for which Volkswagen understated carbon dioxide emissions and overstated fuel economy include its most popular models, including the Volkswagen Golf, Passat, Jetta and Tiguan. The affected cars also include a broad range of models made by Volkswagen\u2019s SEAT and Skoda brands, which are not sold in the United States.One Audi model was included, the A1, a subcompact. No Porsche models were on the list.Volkswagen said it was still trying to determine which older cars are affected. The company said it would cover the cost of repaying tax breaks that car buyers received from European governments, most of which provide incentives for people to buy cars with low carbon dioxide emissions.Advertisement"}

This one, though, ends in an image of guns firing and one man\u2019s journey to the grave. The storied duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton provides the book\u2019s scaffold. Along the way we glean bits of information about each statesman\u2019s life, framed as a set of parallels and contrasts. We learn about the contested work of \u00adnation-building that Hamilton and Burr were engaged in, and that both were orphaned but did well in school, fought in the Revolution and became lawyers. But the book\u2019s primary framing device is the gunfight and the argument between the two men that led up to it. At the climactic moment, a two-page spread shows only a pistol in each hand and the words \u201cBANG! BANG!\u201d drawn in block letters, blasting us back to a time when history was measured in important shootings.The duel-ridden dawn of the 1800s may serve as a touchstone for parents or teachers to discuss contemporary gun culture, first-person-shooter video games or gangster rap. But the book also represents the most traditional of historical practices, in which the world is presented as a series of events, battles, \u201cdiscoveries,\u201d births and deaths, with everything culminating in scenes that are often apocryphal: Washington chopping down the cherry tree or Pocahontas saving the life of Capt. John Smith.\u201cGame Changer,\u201d written by John Coy and illustrated by Randy DuBurke, takes a different approach to the practice of history, presenting an \u201cuncovered\u201d story set against the backdrop of an accepted narrative. This book frames its narrative around good folks who fought injustice, racism and segregation through their participation in a sporting event. We learn about a secret college basketball game in the Jim Crow South in which blacks and whites \u2014 forbidden from officially competing in the same league \u2014 played against one another, then sat around together afterward talking, \u201cthe way basketball players do.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of story from which \u201cinspirational\u201d movies are made, in which there are no villains but the occasional local who says something like, \u201cThat\u2019s not how we do things \u2019round here.\u201dWhere \u201cAaron and Alexander\u201d reiterates the importance of already celebrated historic figures, \u201cGame Changer\u201d resurrects the lesser-known John McLendon, the African-American basketball coach of the North Carolina College for Negroes team, who made the \u201csecret game\u201d against the Duke University Medical School team happen, and the players on both squads who challenged tradition and played together.DuBurke\u2019s illustrations are appropriately historical in feel. The basketball scenes are rendered in sequences as quickly paced as television montage. Muted tones and a vintage newsreel patina add a veneer of authenticity. The historical bent of the storytelling is perhaps less authentic, weaving between reportage and occasional shortcuts intended for dramatic effect, as when Coy claims that some of the white players who grew up in the segregated South of nannies and footmen and countless service employees \u201chad never been this close to a person of a different color.\u201d This book adds new heroes to the pantheon, yet continues the tradition of seeing the practice of history as being about electing heroes and creating unified narratives.By contrast, in \u00ad\u201cHiawatha and the Peacemaker\u201d the practice of history itself undergoes a radical transformation in the able hands of Robbie \u00adRobertson, the musician and songwriter, and the Caldecott Honor artist David Shannon (\u201cNo, David!\u201d). While the importance of the Iroquois Confederacy is well known (it\u2019s even thought to have influenced the formation of the government of the United States), and the figure of Hiawatha has been depicted by artists including \u00adThomas Eakins and \u00adEdmonia Lewis, the narrative of the creation of the confederacy by the Mohawk leader and his mystic companion, the Great Peacemaker, is ripe for mythologizing. With its breadth, richness and emotional weight, this retelling of the story opens up the historical narrative for inquiry, curiosity and wonder. There is no one central moment. Robertson\u2019s prose paddles through the river of Hiawatha\u2019s journey with an urgency, vitality and import that many historical \u00adtexts lack.Shannon, whose work has always exhibited a painterly expertise, does particularly well here. He changes angles and distance rapidly, moving from a spare landscape of the Peacemaker\u2019s canoe cutting through the morning mist to a two-page spread of an eye close up reflecting Hiawatha\u2019s lost family. His visual storytelling includes a wide range of references: a borrowed palette from Paul Gauguin, or elsewhere a style reminiscent of traditional paintings on deer or buffalo hides.A book like \u201cHiawatha and the Peacemaker\u201d asks young readers to understand that all stories can be told from different perspectives, that history is the collection of stories we tell ourselves about who we are. It suggests that even if we are not the ones who can sculpt bronze statues on marble pedestals, telling and sharing one another\u2019s stories is the only way we can come to an understanding of what history really means. Young readers invited into the past in such a way will surely investigate further the stories that make up who they are, and find new ways to make myths of their own histories.AARON AND ALEXANDERWritten and illustrated by Don Brown32 pp. Roaring Brook Press. $17.99.

{"Headline": "Citing Climate Change, Obama Rejects Construction of Keystone XL Oil Pipeline", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama announced on Friday that he had rejected the request from a Canadian company to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline, ending a seven-year review that had become a symbol of the debate over his climate policies.Mr. Obama\u2019s denial of the proposed 1,179-mile pipeline, which would have carried 800,000 barrels a day of carbon-heavy petroleum from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast, comes as he seeks to build an ambitious legacy on climate change.\u201cAmerica is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change,\u201d Mr. Obama said in remarks from the White House. \u201cAnd, frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership.\u201dThe once-obscure Keystone project became a political symbol amid broader clashes over energy, climate change and the economy. The rejection of a single oil infrastructure project will have little impact on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, but the pipeline plan gained an outsize profile after environmental activists spent four years marching and rallying against it in front of the White House and across the country.Mr. Obama said that the pipeline has occupied what he called \u201can overinflated role in our political discourse.\u201d\u201cIt has become a symbol too often used as a campaign cudgel by both parties rather than a serious policy matter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all of this obscured the fact that this pipeline would neither be a silver bullet for the economy, as was promised by some, nor the express lane to climate disaster proclaimed by others.\u201dThe rejection of the pipeline is one of several actions Mr. Obama has taken as he intensifies his push on climate change in his last year in office. In August, he announced his most significant climate policy, a set of aggressive new regulations to cut emissions of planet-warming carbon pollution from the nation\u2019s power plants.Both sides of the debate saw the Keystone rejection as a major symbolic step, a sign that the president was willing to risk angering a bipartisan majority of lawmakers in the pursuit of his environmental agenda. And both supporters and critics of Mr. Obama saw the surprisingly powerful influence of environmental activists in the decision.\u201cOnce the grass-roots movement on the Keystone pipeline mobilized, it changed what it meant to the president,\u201d said Douglas G. Brinkley, a historian at Rice University who writes about presidential environmental legacies. \u201cIt went from a routine infrastructure project to the symbol of an era.\u201dEnvironmental activists cheered the decision as a vindication of their influence.\u201cPresident Obama is the first world leader to reject a project because of its effect on the climate,\u201d said Bill McKibben, founder of the activist group 350.org, which led the campaign against the pipeline. \u201cThat gives him new stature as an environmental leader, and it eloquently confirms the five years and millions of hours of work that people of every kind put into this fight.\u201dEnvironmentalists had sought to block construction of the pipeline because it would have provided a conduit for petroleum extracted from the Canadian oil sands. The process of extracting that oil produces about 17 percent more planet-warming greenhouse gases than the process of extracting conventional oil.But numerous State Department reviews concluded that construction of the pipeline would have little impact on whether that type of oil was burned, because it was already being extracted and moving to market via rail and existing pipelines. In citing his reason for the decision, Mr. Obama noted the State Department findings that construction of the pipeline would not have created a significant number of new jobs, lowered oil or gasoline prices or significantly reduced American dependence on foreign oil.\u201cFrom a market perspective, the industry can find a different way to move that oil,\u201d said Christine Tezak, an energy market analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington firm. \u201cHow long it takes is just a result of oil prices. If prices go up, companies will get the oil out.\u201dHowever, a State Department review also found that demand for the oil sands fuel would drop if oil prices fell below $65 a barrel, since moving oil by rail is more expensive than using a pipeline. An Environmental Protection Agency review of the project this year noted that under such circumstances, construction of the pipeline could be seen as contributing to emissions, since companies might be less likely to move the oil via expensive rail when oil prices are low \u2014 but would be more likely to move it cheaply via the pipeline. The price of oil has plummeted this year, hovering at less than $50 a barrel.The recent election of a new Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, may also have influenced Mr. Obama\u2019s decision. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper, had pushed the issue as a top priority in the relationship between the United States and Canada, personally urging Mr. Obama to approve the project. Blocking the project during the Harper administration would have bruised ties with a crucial ally.While Mr. Trudeau also supports construction of the Keystone pipeline, he has not made the issue central to Canada\u2019s relationship with the United States, and has criticized Mr. Harper for presenting Canada\u2019s position as an ultimatum, while not taking substantial action on climate change related to the oil sands.Mr. Trudeau did not raise the issue during his first post-election conversation with Mr. Obama.The construction would have had little impact on the nation\u2019s economy. A State Department analysis concluded that building the pipeline would have created jobs, but the total number represented less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation\u2019s total employment. The analysis estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs over its two-year construction period \u2014 about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest in indirect support jobs, such as food service. The department estimated that the project would create about 35 permanent jobs.Republicans and the oil industry criticized Mr. Obama for what they have long said was his acquiescence to the pressure of activists and environmentally minded political donors.\u201cA decision this poorly made is not symbolic, but deeply cynical,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who leads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \u201cIt does not rest on the facts \u2014 it continues to distort them.\u201dJack Gerard, the head of the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for oil companies, said in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately for the majority of Americans who have said they want the jobs and economic benefits Keystone XL represents, the White House has placed political calculations above sound science.\u201dRuss Girling, the president and chief executive of TransCanada, said in a statement that the president\u2019s decision was not consistent with the State Department\u2019s review. \u201cToday, misplaced symbolism was chosen over merit and science,\u201d said Mr. Girling, whose company is based in Calgary, Alberta. \u201cRhetoric won out over reason.\u201dThe statement said that the company was reviewing the decision but offered no indication if it planned to submit a new application. If a Republican wins the 2016 presidential election, a new submission of the pipeline permit application could yield a different outcome.\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline is a huge mistake, and is the latest reminder that this administration continues to prioritize the demands of radical environmentalists over America\u2019s energy security,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president. \u201cWhen I\u2019m president, Keystone will be approved, and President Obama\u2019s backward energy policies will come to an end.\u201dAs Mr. Obama seeks to carve out a substantial environmental legacy, his decision on the pipeline pales in import compared with his use of Environmental Protection Agency regulations. The power plant rules he announced in August have met with legal challenges, but if they are put in place, they could lead to a transformation of the nation\u2019s energy economy, shuttering fossil fuel plants and rapidly increasing production of wind and solar.Those rules are at the heart of Mr. Obama\u2019s push for a global agreement.But advocates of the agreement said that the Keystone decision, even though it is largely symbolic, could show other countries that Mr. Obama is willing to make tough choices about climate change.\u201cThe rejection of the Keystone permit was key for the president to keep his climate chops at home and with the rest of the world,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a Washington research organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With China in Mind on a Visit to Manila, Obama Pledges Military Aid to Allies in Southeast Asia", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKicking off five days in Asia by visiting the home port of the 378-foot ship, now known as the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would spend an additional $250 million over the next two years to help ensure maritime security for countries in Southeast Asia.\u201cWe have a treaty obligation, an ironclad commitment to the defense of our ally the Philippines, who can count on the United States,\u201d Mr. Obama said in brief remarks after touring the Gregorio del Pilar. \u201cMy visit here underscores our shared commitment to the security of the waters of this region and to the freedom of navigation.\u201dOfficially, the United States takes no position on the competing territorial claims on the South China Sea by China and its neighbors. But fears that Beijing\u2019s behavior in the strategic waterways could hamper the free flow of commerce from the region, which has become increasingly important, have prompted Mr. Obama to act.The president\u2019s visit to the Philippine harbor on Tuesday was meant to emphasize that message without directly challenging the Chinese before the start of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting here on Wednesday.In his remarks after his tour, Mr. Obama did not mention China\u2019s activities in the South China Sea. But Susan E. Rice, the president\u2019s national security adviser, made clear ahead of the trip that concerns about China would be a \u201ccentral issue of discussion.\u201dIn a fact sheet about the president\u2019s announcement, White House officials said that the additional money was intended to \u201caddress the evolving dynamics of the region\u201d and that it would increase \u201cthe maritime security capacity of our allies and partners, to respond to threats in waters off their coasts.\u201dOnce named the Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton, the ship that Mr. Obama toured on Tuesday now carries the name of a Filipino hero who fought in the revolution against Spanish rule and in the Philippine-American war, before he was killed in 1899.\u201cThe ship that I just toured, a former U.S. Coast Guard vessel, helps the Philippines respond to disasters, perform counterterrorism missions and patrol the South China Sea,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding, \u201cMore capable navies and partnership with the United States are critical to the security of this region.\u201dAs part of the $250 million commitment, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would transfer two ships to the Philippines \u2014 another Coast Guard cutter and a research vessel. The Philippines is already the largest recipient of American maritime assistance in the region; it will get $79 million this year.Mr. Obama made no mention of the agreement that the United States and the Philippines reached a year ago to open several bases on the island here to American personnel and equipment. That agreement has been delayed by legal wrangling and is awaiting a decision by the Philippine Supreme Court and that country\u2019s legislature.Once approved, that agreement could mean a return of United States forces to the Subic Bay military base, which once served as the largest overseas outpost for the American military.If the United States military returns to Subic Bay, it would provide a significant new base from which to assert its influence in the region. And it would be a powerful symbol of what the Obama administration calls its \u201crebalance\u201d of foreign policy toward Asia.That effort relies partly on harnessing the spending power of the emerging economies in the region \u2014 something that could be threatened if the countries do not find ways to stand up to Chinese claims on the waters that surround them.After touring the Gregorio del Pilar, Mr. Obama said the effort to do that was well on its way.\u201cI can tell you that after inspection, your ship looks like it is in tiptop shape,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End of China\u2019s One-Child Policy Stings Its \u2018Loneliest Generation\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut these days, he does not consider himself fortunate. As he wandered around a bookstore here one recent Saturday in a fur coat and suede shoes, he described his generation as \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cmiserable,\u201d ignorant of family love and exceedingly self-centered.\u201cWe were sacrificed because of a political mistake,\u201d said Mr. Wang, the founder of an Internet start-up. \u201cWe were used.\u201dBut for some of the more than 150 million young people who grew up as only children, the announcement has reawakened feelings of isolation and regret, according to interviews with more than two dozen of them.The Chinese media are already calling them \u201cthe loneliest generation.\u201d\u201cThey are lucky and unlucky,\u201d said a recent article on Sina.com, a Chinese news website. \u201cThe \u2018one-child\u2019 policy ended in 2015, but this generation\u2019s loneliness never goes away.\u201dSome have reacted with frustration as they confront the reality that their generation will be a historical aberration, a 37-year blip. Others are struggling to draw meaning from their unwitting participation in one of humanity\u2019s largest social experiments.\u201cIn 5,000 years of Chinese history, we will have been the only generation made up of almost all only children,\u201d said Wang Yunpeng, 35, an engineer living in Xi\u2019an, a city in northwest China. \u201cThe policy has caused so many problems.\u201dLiu Zhe, 33, a cashier at a supermarket in Shanghai, said, \u201cOur lives were dictated by an arbitrary policy in circumstances that were entirely out of our control. Sometimes I wonder whether it is fair.\u201dThose entering adulthood now will form the backbone of Chinese society at a pivotal moment, as the ranks of the elderly grow rapidly and as the economy faces new strains, including a shortage of workers.In interviews, members of the one-child generation said they grew up hearing that they were among the most blessed generations in Chinese history, having avoided the poverty and brutal conflicts experienced by their parents and grandparents, only to realize later that they would have to shoulder the burden of taking care of aging parents, in-laws and children without the support of siblings.\u201cWe were told we were spoiled little emperors,\u201d said Zhang Cheng, 22, a university student in Beijing. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t tell us we would be the only generation that would have to face these obligations alone.\u201dLi Luochen, 26, who works in marketing for a video game company, said that as a child she enjoyed receiving undivided attention from her parents. But now that she is an adult and her parents are urging her to have children, she wishes she had a brother to turn to.\u201cBeing a female only child is too much pressure,\u201d she said inside a Beijing cafe. \u201cEvery girl wants to grow up with a big brother.\u201d Several people mentioned that an older brother would come in handy if you got into a fight.In social media posts, some Chinese have called on the government to offer an apology or compensation for the fact that they were denied a sibling. Others said nothing could be done to alleviate the hardships.Some experts still defended the policy, which was begun in response to concerns about the impact of overpopulation on natural resources.\u201cIt\u2019s true, it was a big social experiment,\u201d said Tang Kun, 33, an assistant professor of global health at Peking University. \u201cBut what else could we have done?\u201dChina\u2019s one-child generation is far different from the generations that have preceded it. It is unusually well educated, with more than 85 percent of children born in the 1990s having attended high school. They generally have more intimate relationships with their parents, who doted on them for much of their lives but also imposed high expectations.Chinese leaders and social scientists are closely watching the reaction of the one-child generation to the \u201ctwo-child\u201d policy. A sharp rise in births could help replenish the national labor supply and pay for pensions and benefit packages for retirees, who will make up a third of the population by 2050.But some analysts say the one-child policy had become redundant: As China developed and urbanized, families were choosing to have fewer children anyway. When the government relaxed restrictions on the one-child policy in 2013, allowing couples to have two children if one of the parents was an only child, the reaction was tepid; only about 14 percent of eligible couples took advantage of the change.Now that many of the one-child generation have reached prime childbearing age themselves, they are struggling to decide whether to have that second child, given the high cost of raising children in Chinese cities. They worry that the economy might force them to inflict on their children the same loneliness they endured because of policy.\u201cI can\u2019t give my son a sibling, it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d said Liu Jia, 27, a nail salon worker in Beijing. \u201cBut I can try to make up for it by giving him more love, spending more time with him and taking him out more often, to make him feel less lonely.\u201dOthers said they were eager to have two children so that their offspring would not experience the isolation they had felt in their youth.\u201cI wanted a sibling so much when I was a kid,\u201d said Shi Jiandong, 22, a student at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cI don\u2019t want our kids to experience the loneliness that we felt.\u201dHuang Haitao, 30, a planning executive at Xinhua, a state-run news agency, in Beijing, said he worried that his children would feel even more isolated than his generation, since they would lack aunts, uncles or cousins.\u201cI had a dozen cousins to play with when I was a kid who were like my brothers and sisters,\u201d he said. \u201cMy daughter is going to be much lonelier than me. She will have none of that.\u201dMr. Wang, the Internet company founder, said that many Chinese families had forgotten that having a large family was a natural part of life. A Chinese proverb says that having a son and a daughter makes a family complete.\u201cA family is supposed to have more than one child; kinship should be like this,\u201d he said. \u201cMy daughter doesn\u2019t know what an aunt or an uncle is. I don\u2019t want her not to know what brothers or sisters are.\u201dLi Jingyuan and Yingzhi Yang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetters to the International New York TimesFrance, refugees and integrationRe \u201cFrance, paradise lost\u201d (Opinion, Nov. 4): Pamela Druckerman concludes her article on France with: \u201cThese days, it\u2019s just a flawed, ordinary country that mostly thinks for itself.\u201d I, too, have lived in France for over 12 consecutive years and do not recognize the France the writer describes. The French remain book readers, rational, caring for the \u201cother,\u201d simultaneously pragmatic and abstract in their thinking, both altruistic and realistic, and believers in the idea that thought has no frontiers.France has the largest Muslim population in Europe and must be commended for insisting that those who aspire to become French citizens adhere to the rules of the enlightened republic and its secular laws \u2014 and that learning the French language is mandatory. Likewise, France ought to serve as an example to the United States, mired as its political system is in Christian fundamentalism, gun culture, and a phobia of the immigrant \u201cother.\u201d The French have succeeded in finding the balance between non-savage capitalism and the humanistic tenets of the French Revolution. Theirs is a country whose values beg emulation.The author describes France\u2019s lack of enthusiasm in welcoming Syrian refugees compared to Germany, without producing the main reasons explaining such difference.First, the weight of the existing large Muslim minority in France and the failure of the country to properly integrate them is influencing the French people to adopt a hostile stance toward further immigration. Second, your readers should have been informed of the massive difference between Germany\u2019s vibrant economy and France\u2019s sluggish economy. Germany needs immigration to feed its work force, while France has no new jobs to offer to its existing and future population, hence its economic and financial inability to welcome additional immigrants, especially Muslims, given the higher unemployment rates within this group.A country without wealth may no longer entertain delusions of grandeur and idealism.While Ms. Druckerman makes many concrete points regarding the French state\u2019s inaction on Syrian refugees, she confounds two distinct issues: that of the refugee crisis and that of French Muslim integration.It has become quite clear that the state has a considerable effort in place to address structural inequities faced by French Muslims. From increased education funding for underprivileged areas to supporting the practice of Islam at the local level, the state genuinely, though sometimes ineffectively, seeks to improve the lives of its Muslim citizens. The majority of French Muslims increasingly frame their own discourse in the universalism of French values.The far right in France, like certain ultra-conservative moments in the United States, has a tendency to dominate media attention on the place of Islam in society. Their rhetoric on the unassailable nature of Islam should not be taken as the dominant perspective on this issue.French \u201cuniversalism\u201d is far from perfect, but French citizens, including French Muslims, are in the process of redefining a new social \u201cparadise.\u201dYes, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s commitment to take in 24,000 additional refugees over the next two years appears anemic compared to the German response to the current crisis. But before we chastise France, let\u2019s put its reaction in a broader context and remember that the United States, which really does pride itself on being a country of immigrants, has promised to take in only 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year. We should also remember that the French opposed our reckless invasion of Iraq in 2003, which helped destabilize the entire region, and contribute far less than we do to climate change, two recent developments that are driving people from their homes in the Middle East and Africa to what they hope will be brighter futures in the north.Shut down the ivory traffickersRe \u201cThe ivory-funded terrorism myth\u201d (Opinion, Oct. 30) by Tristan McConnell: Ending elephant poaching and ivory trafficking requires both targeting criminal networks and boosting anti-poaching work on the ground, where there are grave human impacts. Poaching is the lifeline, for example, of Joseph Kony\u2019s Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, a terrorist group that has abducted 30,000 children as child soldiers and relies on ivory sales to buy ammunition.Recent attention to ivory trafficking and conflict financing is leading to new policies, including the Obama administration\u2019s National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, Congress\u2019 Global Anti-Poaching Act, and initiatives by United States Customs, Interpol and others. During stings on criminal syndicates in October, two alleged ivory traffickers, Yang Feng Glan and Boniface Matthew Mariango, were arrested in Tanzania.More investment is needed to take down traffickers and the corrupt officials they conspire with, but rangers in poaching areas are also vastly under-equipped. They urgently need support before elephants in central Africa are wiped out completely.The writer is the associate director of policy for The Enough Project.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Involved in the Metrojet Crash Investigation", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestigators from Egypt, Russia and Western Europe have descended on the Sinai Peninsula, hoping to find evidence that would explain why a commercial flight carrying 224 people crashed on Saturday, leaving no survivors.Technical failure, human error, an explosion on board and a missile strike have all been proffered as potential explanations for the destruction of the plane, Metrojet Flight 9268. A complex web of national and business interests and the agendas and motives of individuals and terrorist groups intersect in the investigation.Here is a look at the principal parties and what they have at stake.InvolvementMetrojet is a Russian airline, the flight was bound for Russia and all 224 people aboard were Russian citizens. The disaster is being treated as a national tragedy, with flags lowered to half-staff and President Vladimir V. Putin calling for a \u201cthorough inquiry.\u201dRussian aviation officials went to Egypt after the crash, but according to Alexander Neradko, the head of the Federal Air Transport Agency, the Egyptian authorities were refusing on Monday to share data from the plane\u2019s flight recorders or ground-based radar.At StakeRussia recently began a military campaign to defend the rule of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Russia\u2019s only ally in the region, from the rebel forces assailing him, including the Islamic State. Russian officials have spoken out in defense of the safety of their frequently criticized civil aviation fleet.InvolvementThe aircraft took off from Sharm el Sheikh, an Egyptian resort town on the Red Sea, and crashed in the Sinai Peninsula, a restive region of Egypt where the military is fighting Islamic extremists, including allies of the Islamic State. The Egyptian authorities will lead the investigation into the crash, and are able to control international investigators\u2019 access to the wreckage and to evidence obtained from flight recorders, ground radar and witnesses.Egypt\u2019s military-backed government is nominally allied with the West in the fight against organizations like the Islamic State, and is also friendly with Russia. Egypt\u2019s economy depends heavily on tourism, but years of civil strife and terrorist attacks have frightened visitors away from many parts of the country. Sharm el Sheikh had been one of the few places in Egypt that foreign tourists, many of them from Russia, still felt comfortable visiting.InvolvementThe airline, formerly known as Kogalymavia, operated Flight 9268, a charter flight bound for St. Petersburg, Russia.After the crash, the wife of the plane\u2019s co-pilot told the news media that her husband had complained about the condition of the aircraft, an Airbus A321-200. The plane\u2019s tail was damaged during a landing in Cairo in 2001.At StakeThe airline\u2019s safety and maintenance practices will inevitably be scrutinized. Though Metrojet has so far had limited access to the crash site and none to flight-recorder data, the airline\u2019s executives moved swiftly to try to pre-empt any blame for the crash.\u201cWe absolutely exclude the technical failure of the plane, and we absolutely exclude pilot error or a human factor,\u201d Aleksandr A. Smirnov, a former pilot and the airline\u2019s deputy director for aviation, told reporters in Moscow on Monday.InvolvementThe aircraft was built by Airbus, a European company with headquarters in France, and was registered in Ireland. The plane was assembled in Germany in 1997, and its flight recorders were made there. Investigators from Airbus and the governments of Germany, France and Ireland have all arrived in Egypt.At StakeThe Airbus A321-200 has a global reputation for safety and reliability that the company and its home countries are keen to defend. The airplane in question had flown for less than half of its planned service life of 120,000 hours.InvolvementSoon after the crash, the Islamic State, a terrorist organization fighting both the Egyptians in Sinai and the Russians in Syria, claimed that it had destroyed the aircraft, and it offered a blurry video clip that it said showed the plane being shot down by a missile.At StakeInvestigators doubt that the group, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, would be able to shoot down a plane at cruising altitude. But they have not ruled out a more conventional terrorist attack, like a bomb placed onboard. The Islamic State has called for jihad against Russia, following the country\u2019s intervention in Syria, and sowing fear is essential to the way the group operates.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the planned service life of the Airbus A321-200. It is 120,000 hours, not 60,000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Antidote to Cynicism in Canada ", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt has become common to bemoan the sorry state of politics, what with all the big money, dirty tricks, image molding, partisan gridlock and general cynicism. Yet voters seem never to cease longing for a leader who can restore pride to high office and rekindle the national spirit.His intent, he explained simply, was to \u201cpresent to Canada a cabinet that looks like Canada.\u201d When asked why an equal number of men and women, his response was even more refreshing: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201dAfter a campaign in which his Conservative opponent, Stephen Harper, raised Syrian refugees and the Muslim veil as divisive issues, Mr. Trudeau named a Muslim woman born in Afghanistan as his minister for democratic institutions. The minister for citizenship and immigration was rechristened minister for immigration, refugees and citizenship, and charged with resettling 25,000 Syrian and Iraqi refugees by the end of the year.There is an almost involuntary reflex at euphoric moments like this to warn that it cannot last. Political passion can be polarizing and no aura lasts forever, as Mr. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Trudeau, learned when the extraordinary excitement he generated in his day, dubbed \u201cTrudeaumania,\u201d began to wane. There are many conservative Canadians, of course, who already resent Justin Trudeau\u2019s brand of liberalism.Yet for a majority of Canadians, Mr. Trudeau and his cabinet symbolize a renewed sense of national identity rooted in diversity, in humane and inclusive social policies at home and in humanitarian service overseas. The thrill of the moment may be fleeting, but it is invaluable for awakening new generations to public service and as an antidote to the cynicism about politics that has sadly become the norm in established democracies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Catalan Legislators Raise Stakes in Push for Secession From Spain", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move was immediately denounced by Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, as the latest evidence that Catalan separatists were willing to flout Spanish law in their pursuit of independence.In response, Mr. Rajoy said he would sign a decree to suspend all the declaration\u2019s possible consequences, pending a ruling by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court that is expected to strike down Catalonia\u2019s resolution, the latest in a series of steps to break away from Spain that have escalated over the last three years.\u201cCatalonia is not going to disconnect from anywhere, and there is going to be no breakup,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said.The standoff over the future of Catalonia \u2014 which accounts for a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy \u2014 has become increasingly tense as both sides have raised the stakes in each round of the confrontation, and as both Mr. Rajoy and the head of Catalonia\u2019s regional government, Artur Mas, have used the conflict to bolster their own standing in the face of political challenges.Mr. Rajoy has sought to present himself as the defender of Spanish unity ahead of a general election on Dec. 20. The vote is unlikely to yield a clear-cut winner, according to the most recent opinion polls, with Mr. Rajoy and his Popular Party holding a small lead that would be insufficient to keep their parliamentary majority.Should he not get sufficient support, the main separatist coalition can either present an alternative candidate or try to prolong the internal negotiations over its leadership until Jan. 9, the deadline for a new Catalan regional president to take office or for new regional elections to be called.Addressing the Catalan Parliament on Monday, Mr. Mas called on fellow separatists to unite in the \u201cgigantic\u201d challenge of forming a new nation.\u201cWe have the opportunity to create a new country,\u201d Mr. Mas said. Catalonia, he argued, has reached a crossroads, facing a choice between \u201csubordination and freedom.\u201dThe resolution approved on Monday calls for Catalonia to become an independent republic, a goal that Mr. Mas and other separatists aim to achieve within 18 months. Most controversially, the resolution includes a defiant claim that Catalonia\u2019s march toward nationhood need not be subject to approval by Spanish institutions or the country\u2019s Constitutional Court.In recent days, Mr. Rajoy has met with other national party leaders in order to present a common front against Catalonia\u2019s separatist ambitions. While Spain\u2019s other main parties want Catalonia to remain within Spain, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s rivals in next month\u2019s general election have blamed Mr. Rajoy for allowing the secessionist drive to reach such a precipitous point.Monday\u2019s vote followed regional elections in September that gave separatist parties the most parliamentary seats, but denied them a majority of the votes. The fact that 48 percent of votes went to separatist parties was hailed by Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government as proof that separatism was not backed by most of the region\u2019s 7.5 million citizens.Still, the separatist declaration was approved by 72 to 63. The separatists who voted in favor included those of a far-left party known by its Catalan acronym of CUP, which wants to remove Mr. Mas as regional leader.Mr. Mas did not address CUP\u2019s concerns about his leadership directly on Monday. Instead, he sought to portray himself as the victim of persecution by Madrid. He was recently forced to appear in court over an independence vote in Catalonia a year ago that was also struck down by Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court.\u201cWho wants to live in a state that prosecutes criminally somebody who promotes the ballot boxes?\u201d Mr. Mas said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghan Jobs Program Aims to Stem Exodus of Young", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday began a modest jobs program to try to stem an exodus of young Afghans to Europe and restore some faith in the struggling government and economy.The economic hardship, increasing insecurity and a loss of faith in the country\u2019s future have prompted a huge wave of migration, with about 146,000 Afghan migrants arriving in Europe this year, according to Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani.The first phase of Mr. Ghani\u2019s jobs program, called Jobs for Peace, is planned to cover 12 provinces. The aim is to bring about two months of food security for nearly 100,000 families by creating around 5.5 million labor days. The initial cost is about $100 million, officials said. The program is to expand to cover all 34 provinces by June, requiring about $350 million.\u201cIn the first phase, the program will cover 4,700 villages, and in the spring it will reach 15,000 villages,\u201d Mr. Ghani said in a televised address.Many of the jobs within the program will involve maintenance work on development projects completed in rural areas, and cleaning work in the urban centers. Existing local councils are to help identify poor people in each village who could work.Some analysts see the program as a way for Mr. Ghani to buy some time in the face of mounting domestic criticism, as the program is unlikely to be able to do much to reverse the trend of educated Afghans\u2019 leaving the country. The government estimates that nearly 700,000 job seekers, a large part of them high school and college graduates, enter the market every year, but with no prospects.William Byrd, an economist at the United States Institute of Peace who has written extensively about Afghanistan, said that without political improvements, such economic programs usually had little effect in creating broader economic confidence.\u201cThe short-term focus is right, but you can\u2019t just throw money at the problem, because there is no money,\u201d Mr. Byrd said. \u201cThe government needs to start acting like a unified government that is facing a crisis. We really don\u2019t see that.\u201dWhile a decline of economic growth was expected with the withdrawal of foreign forces, the government\u2019s slow start \u2014 it has struggled for months to make even the most basic appointments \u2014 has fueled the problem, Mr. Byrd said. The only bright spots are that revenue declines have been reversed in recent months and that agriculture remains a stabilizing factor.The modest scale of the program, despite the severity of the crisis, also suggested how little financial leeway Mr. Ghani has. In months of negotiations with international donors, it became clear to him that they \u201ccan\u2019t put out an extra dime,\u201d according to one adviser to Mr. Ghani. Donor nations still foot the bill for around two-thirds of Afghanistan\u2019s annual expenditure, and have been loath to expand that, particularly given lagging progress in fighting corruption.Putting the jobs program into effect in rural areas may be made easier for Mr. Ghani by the existence of a vast rural structure that is already in place, the National Solidarity Program. The program, which has for years created community councils and given them small grants to start projects, has been credited as a rare success in an otherwise gloomy Afghan development sector marred by waste. Mr. Ghani was one of the founders of the program, when he served as finance minister in the early years after the American invasion.Officials say the National Solidarity Program\u2019s success is rooted in a local focus, scaled to existing capacity. By chopping up billions of dollars\u2019 worth of aid into small packages, it has been able to evade the large-scale corruption common in larger, centralized contracts.One success story has been in Joi Bala, a village of about 246 families tucked between pine-covered mountains in Kapisa Province. Through the local council set up by the National Solidarity Program there, the village added three irrigated freshwater sources and two community centers for $52,000.The local ownership of the projects also meant that the insurgents were less likely to try to block them. Even in insecure areas like Kapisa Province, local elders have often found ways of negotiating with the Taliban to allow the completion of development projects.But there are concerns that now, with the Taliban becoming increasingly aggressive, development will be more difficult. In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Ghani noted that heavy fighting and harsh weather would prevent some communities from benefiting from the jobs plan right away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paul Ryan, Pledging Openness, Eases Path for Amendments", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the highway measure, which contains six years of major infrastructure projects but money for only three years, also loomed as a first test of Mr. Ryan\u2019s ability to balance the political imperatives of his fellow Republicans against the hard realities of governing.Hard-line conservatives who pushed out the previous speaker, John A. Boehner, had demanded changes that would empower individual lawmakers, including a more freewheeling and open amendment process. Mr. Ryan, at his first news conference as speaker, said on Tuesday that the highway bill would represent a first step in that direction.\u201cThis week, you will see the highway bill is a good place to start,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at the news conference, in the lobby of the Republican National Committee headquarters.\u201cWe\u2019re opening up the process,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re allowing members to participate in a way that the founders intended. And we\u2019re advancing an issue that is a big priority to the hard-working taxpayers of this country, fixing our roads and our bridges, improving our transportation infrastructure.\u201dWith nearly 300 amendments filed on the highway bill, however, freewheeling could easily turn unwieldy.\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act,\u201d said John Feehery, a former senior aide to House Republican leaders, including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. \u201cThis is the hardest part of being speaker, knowing when to take over. And it\u2019s not easy because the temptation is always to just make it happen if you are the speaker. And he has the power to do that, but you have to work through your committee process.\u201dStill, the amendment process on the highway bill was not fully open. Rather than allowing any amendment to be brought to the floor, Republicans were using the usual Rules Committee procedures to approve groups of amendments to be debated and voted on.House Democrats said they did not expect any amendments that would change provisions on paying for the bill, including tax provisions on which Republicans and Democrats have their most serious disagreements.It was perhaps fitting that Mr. Ryan\u2019s big legislative test was to preside over a debate that is actually less a fight about transportation infrastructure than a battle over tax policy, which has been his main area of interest in Congress.The problem is relatively simple: Virtually everyone agrees on the need to maintain the nation\u2019s roads, but there is fierce disagreement over how to pay for it.The Highway Trust Fund, which pays for many federal transportation infrastructure programs, is financed largely by a tax on gasoline, currently set at 18.3 cents per gallon. The tax, however, was never indexed for inflation, and that, combined with the greater fuel economy of modern cars, has left the highway fund woefully short of cash \u2014 by more than $53 billion since 2008.Congress has made up the difference in recent years using general funds, but to make matters even tougher, existing law calls for the gas tax to be cut next year to 4.3 cents per gallon. Congress is almost certain to forestall the cut, as it has repeatedly in the past. Congressional analysts said that if the tax had been indexed for inflation in 1993, when it was last increased, it would now total about 30 cents per gallon.Mr. Ryan, who before becoming speaker was the chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, has long opposed any increase in the gas tax, a position shared by many Republicans.The stalemate over how to finance the trust fund led lawmakers to draw up a highway bill that includes six years of policy prescriptions \u2014 generally regarded as an optimum length of time for states to plan roadwork and other projects \u2014 but with enough money to cover only three years\u2019 worth of the measure.That created an awkward situation in which Mr. Ryan and Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, contradicted each other on Tuesday.\u201cThis six-year bill creates more certainty for folks out there that are doing the work on our roads and infrastructure around the country,\u201d Mr. Shuster saidBut when Mr. Ryan was pressed on the three years of financing, he said: \u201cWell, it\u2019s a three-year bill that has three years of financing. And if we can come up with more financing down the road, we can add more years to the bill.\u201dRaising the gas tax would be the most straightforward approach, and many business groups support doing so, especially given the low price of gasoline. Yet Republicans oppose such a tax increase, especially because it would hit individual motorists who could take revenge at the ballot box.Some Democrats are also resistant because they view the tax on gasoline as having a disproportionate impact on lower-income Americans.One alternative would tax corporations earnings repatriated from overseas, but that proposal also has critics.Mr. Feehery, the former Republican leadership aide, who is now a lobbyist, said that Mr. Ryan was confronting the complicated politics of paying for transportation programs, and that the absence of a clear tax policy was not Mr. Ryan\u2019s fault, even though he led the Ways and Means Committee, which has the authority to formulate a solution.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame it on Ryan; I think it was a leadership call on what he could and couldn\u2019t do because of the politics behind it,\u201d Mr. Feehery said. \u201cAnd you also have to take a look at the Senate.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe view from the speaker\u2019s chair is much different from the view from the Ways and Means Committee.\u201dMr. Shuster, the chairman of the transportation committee, said that some 280 amendments had already been filed, setting the stage for debate that could last three days or more. On Tuesday, 45 of those amendments were debated and voted on.Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee, said that she, like the Republicans, was happy to have a more free-flowing debate. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we operated when we first got here,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said. \u201cI have no objection whatsoever to watching democracy at work.\u201d Noting that the Rules Committee was accustomed to working late, she added: \u201cI brought an apple to work today. A New York apple.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Welcome to the Republican presidential debate here on the Fox Business Network. I\u2019m Neil Cavuto, alongside my co- moderators, Maria Bartiromo, and the editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, Gerard Baker.BARTIROMO: Tonight we\u2019re partnering with the Wall Street Journal to ask questions on the economy that voters want answered. We\u2019re also working with Facebook, who tells us that since the first Republican debate, more than 58 million people have joined the political conversation online.More than 9 million are talking specifically about the economy.BAKER: The candidates on stage tonight were selected based on their standing in an average of four national polls. Those standings determining their position on the stage. And here they are. At center stage, businessman Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Florida Senator Marco Rubio.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Texas Senator Ted Cruz.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Businesswoman Carly Fiorina.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: And Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Tonight\u2019s rules are simple. Up to 90 second for each answer. One minute for each follow-up response. And if a candidate goes over their allotted time, you\u2019ll here this.CAVUTO: It sounds like a game show but it\u2019s not.Now I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the elephant in the room, and I\u2019m not talking about your party\u2019s fine symbol. I\u2019m talking about the purpose of tonight\u2019s debate.The economy and what each of you would do to improve it. No more, no less. We are focused on those issues, and what you have said on those issues in your words and what your opponents have said in their words about your words. That is the agenda tonight. How each of you plans to make America better tomorrow. And so we begin. Candidates, as we gather tonight in this very august theater, just outside and across the country, picketers are gathering as well. They\u2019re demanding an immediate hike in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Just a few hours ago, near Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed doing the same for all state workers, the first governor to do so.Mr. Trump, as the leading presidential candidate on this stage and one whose tax plan exempts couples making up to $50,000 a year from paying any federal income taxes at all, are you sympathetic to the protesters cause since a $15 wage works out to about $31,000 a year?TRUMP: I can\u2019t be Neil. And the and the reason I can\u2019t be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I\u2019ve come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It\u2019s going to be a tremendous plan. I think it\u2019ll make our country and our economy very dynamic.But, taxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we can not do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can\u2019t do it.CAVUTO: So do not raise the minimum wage?TRUMP: I would not do it.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Dr. Carson, you have long bemoaned this lackluster recovery. And this Facebook map show Americans share your concern. The green represents how the jobs issue is resonating all across the nation, especially here in the state of Wisconsin.You suggested one minimum wage does not fit all, and that perhaps we should offer a lower or starter wage for young people. Those protesters outside are looking for $15 and nothing less. Where are you?CARSON: Well, first of all, delighted to be here. My family\u2019s here, and my little granddaughter, who\u2019s three years old, said she wanted to come to the debate. So this is very cool.As far as the minimum wage is concerned, people need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases.It\u2019s particularly a problem in the black community. Only 19.8 percent of black teenagers have a job, who are looking for one. You know, that \u2014 and that\u2019s because of those high wages. If you lower those wages, that comes down.You know, I can remember, as a youngster \u2014 you know, my first job working in a laboratory as a lab assistant, and multiple other jobs. But I would not have gotten those jobs if someone had to pay me a large amount of money.But what I did gain from those jobs is a tremendous amount of experience, and how to operate in the world and how to relate to different people, and how to become a responsible individual. And that\u2019s what gave me what I needed to ascend the ladder of opportunity in this country.That\u2019s what we need to be thinking about. How do we allow people to ascend the ladder of opportunity, rather than how do we give them everything and keep them dependent?(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: So, sir, just to be clear, you would not raise it?CARSON: I would not raise it. I would not raise it, specifically because I\u2019m interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Rubio, you called the recent Democratic debate in Las Vegas a night of giveaways, including free health care, free college and a host of other government-paid benefits. Since you aren\u2019t a fan of all they\u2019re giving away, tell us tonight what you would take back.RUBIO: Well, let me begin by answering both the first question and this one, because they\u2019re related. As I\u2019ve said many times before, my parents were never rich people. My father was a bartender. My mother was a maid. They worked for a living. But they were successful people, because, despite the fact that they weren\u2019t well educated and had those jobs, they made enough money to buy a home in a safe and stable neighborhood, retire with dignity, leave all four of their children better off than themselves.RUBIO: We call that the American dream, but in fact, it\u2019s a universal dream of a better life that people have all over the world. It is a reminder that every country in the world has rich people.What makes America special is that we have millions and millions of people that are not rich, that through hard work and perseverance are able to be successful.The problem is that today people are not successful working as hard as ever because the economy is not providing jobs that pay enough. If I thought that raising the minimum wage was the best way to help people increase their pay, I would be all for it, but it isn\u2019t. In the 20th century, it\u2019s a disaster.If you raise the minimum wage, you\u2019re going to make people more expensive than a machine. And that means all this automation that\u2019s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.Here\u2019s the best way to raise wages. Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business, tax reform and regulatory reform, bring our debt under control, fully utilize our energy resources so we can reinvigorate manufacturing, repeal and replace Obamacare, and make higher education faster and easier to access, especially vocational training. For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.(APPLAUSE)If we do that \u2014 and if we do this \u2014 if we do this, we will be able to increase wages for millions of Americans and we will be able to leave everyone better off without making anyone worse off.CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator Rubio.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We\u2019ve asked people on Facebook to submit their questions for the candidates. Seth Bell wrote, \u201cWe are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?\u201d Governor Kasich, you have spoken much about your success in balancing the budget under President Clinton. Today the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably. Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years. Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency. With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?KASICH: First of all, let me just say that, in the state of Ohio \u2014 and I\u2019m the only acting executive on \u2014 on this stage today \u2014 we do have a moderate increase in the minimum wage. And I got to tell you, my father carried mail on his back. His father was a coal miner. He died of black lung. He was losing his eyesight. My mother\u2019s mother lived with us. She could barely speak English. I come from a town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people found themselves out of work. An economic theory is fine, but you know what? People need help.Now, I have a plan that, in fact, would cut taxes, but not $11 trillion or $12 trillion that would put my children further in debt. I have a plan that would not only cut taxes, lower the income tax rate for individuals, lower the tax for businesses so businesses will compete here and not move operations overseas, and also a plan \u2014 the only plan of anybody standing on this stage to get us to a balanced budget by the end of a second term.And, you know, the simple fact of the matter is, we hear a lot of promises in this debate, a lot of promises about these tax cuts or tax schemes sometimes that I call them. Hillary and the Democrats promise everything on the spending side. We\u2019ve got to be responsible about what we propose on the tax side.And our most important moral purpose as leaders in the political system is to make sure we create an environment for job creation so people can live their dreams and realize their God-given potential. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important.And for those at the bottom, we\u2019ve got to do what we can to train them so they can move up. But to just look the other way is not acceptable, because, you know what, as the governor of Ohio I have to deal with real challenges, and we\u2019ve gotten it done in our state, and I will do it for America.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Did you want to name any specific steps, sir?KASICH: Sure. We would move the Medicare system from a 7 percent growth down to about a 5 percent growth. And I have a whole series of ways to do that. In Ohio, we reduced Medicaid funding for the poor from 10 percent to 2.5 percent, didn\u2019t cut one benefit or didn\u2019t take anybody off the rolls. Why? Because we\u2019re innovators. I\u2019ve been an innovator my entire career. And I really don\u2019t care what special interests or lobbyists have to say. I have a job to do when I take over a public office. Now, we freeze non-defense discretionary for eight years. We also put an increase in defense spending. Our tax cuts balance out. And at the end of the day, we will get to a balanced budget.And I want everybody here to know, when I was Budget Committee chairman in Washington, I stepped on every toe in that town, and we got to a balanced budget, and we had enormous job growth. And as governor of Ohio, we went from 350,000 lost jobs to a gain of 347,000 jobs.BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.KASICH: I\u2019ll do it in Washington. I\u2019ve done it twice; I\u2019ll do it thrice for the United States of America.BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, the International Monetary Fund recently cut its expectations for economic growth. Many economists expect a recession to hit the U.S. within the next year due to the weakening of manufacturing. The next president will have to deal with it. You say tax reform is a powerful lever to spur economic expansion. You\u2019re calling for a 10 percent income tax and a 16 percent business tax. What other elements do you need in this plan to actually create jobs?CRUZ: Well, Maria, it\u2019s great to be with you. It\u2019s great to be here in Milwaukee. You know, the question you asked really I think is the most important question any of us can have \u2014 face, which is, how do we get the economy growing? How do we bring back economic growth?Because economic growth, it\u2019s foundational to every other challenge we have. As you rightly noted, from 2008 to today, our economy has grown 1.2 percent a year on average. The Obama economy is a disaster, and the IMF is telling us this is a new normal. It doesn\u2019t have to be.If you look at the history of America, there are three levers that government has had to facilitate economic growth. The first is tax reform. And as you noted, I have rolled out a bold and simple flat tax: 10 percent for every American that would produce booming growth and 4.9 million new jobs within a decade.The second element is regulatory reform, pulling back the armies of regulators that have descended like locusts on small businesses.And the third element is sound money. Every time we\u2019ve pursued all three of those \u2014 whether in the 1920s with Calvin Coolidge or the 1960s with JFK or the 1980s with Ronald Reagan \u2014 the result has been incredible economic growth. We have done it before, and with leadership, we can do it again.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.KASICH: Excuse me.BARTIROMO: Governor Bush...KASICH: Yeah, I would like to make a comment.BUSH: You\u2019ve already made two comments, John. It\u2019s my turn.BARTIROMO: We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich, coming up. We have more questions for you, Governor Kasich.BUSH: I got about four minutes in the last debate. I\u2019m going to get my question right now.KASICH: I appreciate it, Jeb. I\u2019m all of you. But I want at some point to talk about a value-added tax and $11 trillion, $12 trillion tax cuts that will put our kids way deeper in the hole than they have been at this point. So I would like to talk about it at some point, because that\u2019s what leadership is.BARTIROMO: We will \u2014 we will certainly get to that. Governor Bush?BUSH: Yes.BARTIROMO: Almost 40 percent of Americans are without a job and are not looking. Many have given up. That\u2019s what the participation rate tells us. You\u2019ve said your policies will drive the economy back to 4 percent growth, which we haven\u2019t seen since the year 2000. What specific regulations would you change? And how will that lead to jobs and growth?BUSH: First of all, we could get to 4 percent growth. The new normal of 2 percent puts huge demands on government. The reason why we have structural deficits is that more and more people are relying on government and the growth that we don\u2019t have makes \u2014 makes the deficit grow.A 4 percent growth strategy starts with tax reform. And the proposal that I\u2019ve laid out is the one the Wall Street Journal editorial board has said is the most pro-growth of all the proposals out there. We cut the \u2014 we eliminate a lot of deductions and cut the rates down. A corporate rate of 20 percent, which puts us 5 percent above \u2014 below that of China, and allows us full expensing of investing. It would create an explosion of investment back into this country, creating higher-wage jobs, and so that\u2019s part of it.On the regulatory side I think we need to repeal every rule that Barack Obama has in terms of work in progress, every one of them.(APPLAUSE)And start over. For those that are already in existence, the regulation of the Internet, we have to start over, but we ought to do that.The clean power act, we ought to repeal that and \u2014 and start over on that. The waters of the United States act, which is going to be devastating for agriculture and many industries, we should repeal that. We should repeal the rules because the economic costs of this far exceed the social benefit.BUSH: And if we\u2019re serious about being serious about high growth, then we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than \u2014 than are \u2014 than are being set up.Hillary Clinton has said that Barack Obama\u2019s policies get an A. Really? One in 10 people right now aren\u2019t working or have given up altogether, as you said. That\u2019s not an A. One in seven people are living in poverty. That\u2019s not an A. One in five children are on food stamps. That is not an A. It may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do, but it\u2019s not the best America can do.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.BAKER: Ms. Fiorina, while you\u2019ve all pointed out how weak the current recovery has been and how disappointing by any historical standards, in the general election, the Democrats will inevitably ask you and voters to compare the recent president\u2019s jobs performance.Now, in seven years under President Obama, the U.S. has added an average of 107,000 jobs a month. Under President Clinton, the economy added about 240,000 jobs a month. Under George W. Bush, it was only 13,000 a month. If you win the nomination, you\u2019ll probably be facing a Democrat named Clinton. How are you going to respond to the claim that Democratic presidents are better at creating jobs than Republicans?FIORINA: Well, first of all, I must say as I think about that question, I think about a woman I met the other day. I would guess she was 40 years old. She had several children. And she said to me, you know, Carly, I go to bed every night afraid for my children\u2019s future. And that really struck me. This is America. A mother is going to bed afraid for her children\u2019s future.And the reason she\u2019s afraid for her children\u2019s future is because we\u2019ve had problems for a long time. Yes, problems have gotten much worse under Democrats. But the truth is, this government has been growing bigger and bigger, more corrupt, less effective, crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time. This isn\u2019t about just replacing a Democrat with a Republican now. It\u2019s about actually challenging the status quo of big government.Big government has created a big business called politics. And there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics. Specifically, we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again. We need to go to zero-based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent, we can challenge any dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar.(APPLAUSE)We need to actually reform the tax code. Go to a three-page tax code. Yes, there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages. In addition to rolling back what President Obama has done, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of every single regulation on the books. That hasn\u2019t been done in 50 years. We need to pass the REINS Act so Congress is in charge of regulation, not nameless, faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one. We\u2019ve become a nation of rules, not a nation of laws.And finally we actually, yes, have to hold government officials accountable for their performance. All this has to be done, and the citizens of this nation must help a President Fiorina get it done. We must take our government back.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Paul, income inequality has been rising in the United States. Fifty years ago, for example, the average CEO of a big corporation in this country earned 20 times the average salary of one of his or her workers. Today, that CEO earns about 300 times the average salary of a worker. Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?PAUL: Absolutely. And I think that we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst. It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats, governors of...(APPLAUSE)States run by Democrats and countries currently run by Democrats. So the thing is, let\u2019s look for root causes.But I would also say \u2014 lay some blame at the \u2014 the feet of the Federal Reserve. I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse. By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money. They\u2019re actually talking now about negative interest.The money as it\u2019s created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York. And because we\u2019re now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy. So what we\u2019re finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you\u2019re finding is that, if you\u2019re poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you\u2019re trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.So really we need to reexamine whether we not \u2014 we want a Federal Reserve that\u2019s involved so much in determining interest rates. We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.But the bottom line is, if you want less income inequality, move to a city with a Republican mayor or a state with a Republican governor.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you, Senator.CAVUTO: All right. We\u2019re only just getting started. Coming up, your taxes. Stick around. You\u2019re watching FOX Business(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Welcome back to the Milwaukee Theater and the Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s get right back to our questions.Dr. Carson, to you. You recently railed against the double- standard in the media, sir, that seems obsessed with inconsistencies and potential exaggerations in your life story, but looked the other way when it came to then-Senator Barack Obama\u2019s. Still, as a candidate whose brand has always been trust, are you worried your campaign \u2014 which you\u2019ve always said, sir, is bigger than you \u2014 is now being hurt by you?CARSON: Well, first of all, thank you not asking me what I said in the 10th grade. I appreciate that.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: I\u2019ll just forget that follow-up there.(LAUGHTER)CARSON: The fact of the matter is, you know, what \u2014 we should vet all candidates.CARSON: I have no problem with being vetted. What I do have a problem with is being lied about and then putting that out there as truth.(APPLAUSE)And I don\u2019t even mind that so much, if they do it about \u2014 with everybody, like people on the other side. But, you know, when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video.Where I came from, they call that a lie. And...(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)I think that\u2019s very different from, you know, somebody misinterpreting, when I said that I was offered a scholarship to West Point, that is the words that they used. But, I\u2019ve had many people come and say the same thing to me.That is what people do in those situations. We have to start treating people the same, and finding out what people really think and what they\u2019re made of. People who know me know that I\u2019m an honest person.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.BARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, a federal appeals court just dealt a blow to the Obama administration\u2019s plan to prevent the deportation of 5 million people living in this country illegally. The White House is appealing to the Supreme Court.At the heart of this issue is the effect that illegal immigrants are having on our economy, what will you do about it?TRUMP: I was so happy yesterday when I saw that decision come down. That was an unbelievable decision.(APPLAUSE)And we don\u2019t have enough of those decisions coming down. He of the executive order, because nobody wants to listen to him, including the Democrats, so he just goes around signing executive orders. That was a great day. And, frankly, we have to stop illegal immigration. It\u2019s hurting us economically. It\u2019s hurting us from every standpoint. It\u2019s causing tremendous difficulty with respect to drugs and what that does to many of our inner cities in particular.And it really is \u2014 was such an unbelievable moment because the courts have not been ruling in our favor. And it was a 2-1 decision. And it was a terrific thing that happened.And I will tell you, we are a country of laws. We need borders. We will have a wall. The wall will be built. The wall will be successful. And if you think walls don\u2019t work, all you have to do is ask Israel. The wall works, believe me. Properly done. Believe me.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Can we just send 5 million people back with no effect on economy?TRUMP: You are going to have to bring people \u2014 you are going to have to send people out. Look, we\u2019re a country...BARTIROMO: So what will you do?TRUMP: Maria, we\u2019re a country of laws. We either have a country or we don\u2019t have a country. We are a country of laws. Going to have to go out and they will come back but they are going to have to go out and hopefully they get back.But we have no choice if we\u2019re going to run our country properly and if we\u2019re going to be a country.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.KASICH: Maria, can we comment on that?BAKER: Senator Rubio...KASICH: Can we comment on that?BAKER: Yes, one quick comment, yes.KASICH: Well, look, in 1986 Ronald Reagan basically said the people who were here, if they were law-abiding, could stay. But, what didn\u2019t happen is we didn\u2019t build the walls effectively and we didn\u2019t control the border. We need to. We need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house.But if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law-abiding, who are in this country, and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of Mexico \u2014 to Mexico, think about the families. Think about the children.So, you know what the answer really is? If they have been law- abiding, they pay a penalty. They get to stay. We protect the wall. Anybody else comes over, they go back.But for the 11 million people, come on, folks. We all know you can\u2019t pick them up and ship them across, back across the border. It\u2019s a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: All I can say is, you\u2019re lucky in Ohio that you struck oil. That is for one thing.(LAUGHTER)Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. \u201cI like Ike,\u201d right? The expression. \u201cI like Ike.\u201d Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back.TRUMP: Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn\u2019t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back.(LAUGHTER)Dwight Eisenhower. You don\u2019t get nicer. You don\u2019t get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice.(CROSSTALK)BAKER: Governor Bush...KASICH: Jerry, Gerald, it was an attack.(CROSSTALK)(UNKNOWN): If you\u2019re not going to have my back, I\u2019m going to have my back.(UNKNOWN): A couple things here. First of all...BAKER: Governor \u2014 Governor, you...BAKER: You should let Jeb speak.(UNKNOWN): We have grown \u2014 we have grown...TRUMP: No, it\u2019s unfair.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: In the state of Ohio, the state of Ohio, we have grown 347,000 jobs. Our unemployment is half of what it was. Our fracking industry, energy industry may have contributed 20,000, but if Mr. Trump understood that the real jobs come in the downstream, not in the upstream, but in the downstream. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get our jobs.But Ohio is diversified. And little false little things, sir, they don\u2019t really work when it comes to the truth. So the fact is, all I\u2019m suggesting, we can\u2019t ship 11 million people out of this country. Children would be terrified, and it will not work.(CROSSTALK) TRUMP: ... built an unbelievable company worth billions and billions of dollars. I don\u2019t have to hear from this man, believe me. I don\u2019t have to hear from him.BAKER: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you yourself \u2014 you yourself said let Governor Bush speak. Governor Bush?BUSH: Thank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate. That\u2019s really nice of you. Really appreciate that.(APPLAUSE)What a generous man you are. Twelve million illegal immigrants, to send them back, 500,000 a month, is just not \u2014 not possible. And it\u2019s not embracing American values. And it would tear communities apart. And it would send a signal that we\u2019re not the kind of country that I know America is.And even having this conversation sends a powerful signal \u2014 they\u2019re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now when they hear this. That\u2019s the problem with this. We have to win the presidency. And the way you win the presidency is to have practical plans. Lay them out there. What we need to do is allow people to earn legal status where they pay a fine, where they work, where they don\u2019t commit crimes, where they learn English, and over an extended period of time, they earn legal status. That\u2019s the path \u2014 a proper path...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)BAKER: Senator Rubio? Senator...TRUMP: We have millions of people right now on line trying to come into this country. Very, very unfair to the people that want to come into our country legally. They\u2019ve gone through the process. They\u2019re on line. They\u2019re waiting. Very, very unfair to them. That I can tell you.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Senator Rubio, Senator Rubio, let me \u2014 let me take you to a question that I think gets to the root of a lot of the anxiety that people have in this country. The economy is undergoing a transformation through information technology. Americans are anxious that the new economy isn\u2019t producing higher-paying jobs. Many are concerned that the new wealth seems to be going mainly to innovators and investors.Meanwhile, with factories run by robots and shopping done increasingly on smartphones, many traditional jobs are just going away. How do you reassure American workers that their jobs are not being steadily replaced by machines?RUBIO: Well, you know, that\u2019s an excellent question, because what we are going through in this country is not simply an economic downturn. We are living through a massive economic transformation. I mean, this economy is nothing like what it was like five years ago, not to mention 15 or 20 years ago.And it isn\u2019t just a different economy. It\u2019s changing faster than ever. You know, it took the telephone 75 years to reach 100 million users. It took Candy Crush one year to reach some 100 million users.(LAUGHTER)So the world is changing faster than ever, and it is disruptive. Number one, we are in a global competition now, and several of the candidates have said that. There are now dozens of developed economies on this planet that we have to compete with. And we lose that competition because we have the highest business tax rate in the industrialized world, because we have regulations that continue to grow by the billions every single week, because we have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people, but because we\u2019re not fully utilizing our energy resources, that if we did, it would bring back all kinds of growth, especially in manufacturing, and because we have an outdated higher education system.Our higher education system is completely outdated. It is too expensive, too hard to access, and it doesn\u2019t teach 21st century skills. If we do what needs to be done \u2014 tax reform, regulatory reform, fully utilize our energy resources, repeal and replace Obamacare, and modernize higher education, then we can grasp the potential and the promise of this new economy. And we won\u2019t just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And then truly this new century can be a new American century.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you. Senator Cruz \u2014 Senator Cruz, entitlements. You\u2019ve argued for raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group...MORE(AUDIO GAP)BAKER: ...reducing benefits for future retirees, but reducing any sort of benefits for the elderly has always been notoriously hard to do politically. When Speaker Paul Ryan proposed replacing traditional Medicare with federally funded private plans a few years ago, a liberal group responded with a commercial that featured a granny being pushed off a cliff.What\u2019s going to be different this time? CRUZ: Well, my Mom is here, so I don\u2019t think we should be pushing any grannies off cliffs.(LAUGHTER)And, you miss-stated what I\u2019ve said on entitlement reform. What I\u2019ve said is for seniors we should make no changes whatsoever, for younger workers we should gradually raise the retirement age, we should have benefits grow more slowly, and we should allow them to keep a portion of their taxes in a personal account that they control, and can pass on to their kids...(APPLAUSE)BAKER: ...I said for future retirees was your statement...(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: I want to go back to the discussion we had a minute ago because, you know, what was said was right. The democrats are laughing \u2014 because if republicans join democrats as the party of amnesty, we will lose.(APPLAUSE)And, you know, I understand that when the mainstream media covers immigration, it doesn\u2019t often see it as an economic issue. But, I can tell you for millions \u2014 of Americans at home watching this, it is a very personal economic issue. And, I will say the politics of it will be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande.(AUDIENCE REACTION)Or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press.(AUDIENCE REACTION)(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)Then, we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation. And, I will say for those of us who believe people \u2018ought to come to this country legally, and we should enforce the law, we\u2019re tired of being told it\u2019s anti-immigrant. It\u2019s offensive.(APPLAUSE)I am the son of an immigrant who came legally from Cuba...(BELL RINGING)...to seek the American dream. And, we can embrace legal immigration while believing in the rule of law \u2014 and I would note, try going illegally to another country. Try going to China, or Japan. Try going to Mexico. See what they do. Every sovereign nation secures its borders, and it is not compassionate to say we\u2019re not going to enforce the laws...(BELL RINGING)...And we\u2019re going to drive down the wages for millions of hardworking men and women. That is abandoning the working...(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We go back to Facebook. Dewayne Wesley Cato asks on Facebook, how do we get rid of regulations choking our businesses? Ms. Fiorina?Specifically, under the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more employees are required to offer health insurance, or be fined. Many are opting to pay the fine. Others are cutting back employee hours to duck the law altogether. What specific ways will you alleviate the pressure on small business?FIORINA: Well, first Obamacare has to be repealed because it\u2019s failing...(APPLAUSE)...it\u2019s failing the very people it was intended to help, but, also, it is croney-capitalism at its worst. Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, every single one of those kinds of companies are bulking up to deal with big government. See, that\u2019s what happens. As government gets bigger, and bigger \u2014 and it has been for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike \u2014 and business have to bulk up to deal with big government.So, we have to repeal it. It\u2019s tens of thousands of pages long, no one can possible understand it except the big companies, the lawyers, the accountants, the lobbyists that they hire to protect their interests. Then, we have to give back to states the responsibility to manage a high risk pool. We need to try the one thing in health insurance we\u2019ve never tried. Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies.We need to try the free market. The free market. Where people actually have to compete.(APPLAUSE)And, we \u2018ought to have the government ensure that you must \u2014 and I don\u2019t use that term often, that government \u2018ought to do something, but every healthcare provider \u2018ought to publish its costs, its prices, its outcomes, because as patients we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re buying.(APPLAUSE) Now, let me just say \u2014 let me just say, I know more about innovation and entrepreneurship than anyone on this panel because I have led innovative businesses in the most highly competitive industry in the world for decades. The truth is the secret sauce of America is innovation, and entrepreneurship, it is why we must cut our government down to size, and hold it accountable. It\u2019s why we have to take our government back, because innovation and entrepreneurship is crushed by the crushing load of a 73,000 page tax code. It is crushed...(BELL RINGING)...by regulatory thicket that is so vast we don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in it anymore. It is crushed as well by government bureaucrats who don\u2019t do their jobs very well, and who are not held accountable, which is why I\u2019ve said we got to take our government back, and to do that, we have to know where every dollar being spent, and be able to move any dollar. We have to hack through this regulatory thicket, repeal so much, but, also, know what\u2019s in that regulatory thicket \u2014 we don\u2019t even know what regulations have been passed.Third, we need to build a meritocracy \u2014 Scott Walker, by the way, is trying now to do in Wisconsin...(BELL RINGING)...Finally, we need to get to a three page tax code, and, yes, that plan exists.BARTIROMO: Just to be clear, you want to repeal Obamacare...(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: ...but, what\u2019s the alternative?FIORINA: Sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.BARTIROMO: Just to be clear, you say you would repeal Obamacare...FIORINA: ...Absolutely...BARTIROMO: ...But, what is the alternative...FIORINA: ...You need to give...BARTIROMO: ...and how does that help small business...FIORINA: The alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help. Look, I\u2019m a cancer survivor, OK? I understand that you cannot have someone who\u2019s battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn\u2019t helping anyone.We\u2019re throwing more, and more people into Medicaid, and fewer, and fewer doctors are taking those payments.FIORINA: The point is Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we\u2019ve never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers...BARTIROMO: ...Thank you...FIORINA: ...that we have information to shop wisely for our health care.CAVUTO: Alright, thank you. We\u2019re going to take a break here. Coming up, a big issue many Americans are facing, taxes. The Republican Presidential Debate continues now, live, from Milwaukee.(MUSIC)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate live from Milwaukee. Let\u2019s get back to the questions. And we want to touch on obviously one of the biggest of this issue in this year, taxes. And this will go to several of you.One of the biggest economic concerns of course in the country are taxes. Facebook data certainly backs that up. Once again the green on this map that we\u2019re going to see here shows how the conversation around taxes is resonating across the nation, especially here in Wisconsin.First off, Dr. Carson, to you. You say you are in favor of a tax system, I guess akin to tithing, sir, with a flat tax rate of up to 15 percent because you said, if everybody pays this, I think God is a pretty fair guy, so tithing is a pretty fair process.But Donald Trump says that is not fair. That wealthier taxpayers should pay a higher rate because it\u2019s a fair thing to do. So whose plan would God endorse then, Doctor?(LAUGHTER)Yours or Mr. Trump\u2019s?CARSON: Well, you know, when I say tithing, I\u2019m talking about the concept of proportionality.CAVUTO: Right.CARSON: Everybody should pay the same proportion of what they make. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. You get same rights and privileges.I don\u2019t see how anything gets a whole lot fairer than that. But you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes because that is the thing that tilts it in one direction or another. And you have to set the rate at an appropriate level.Now I will say that, there are a lot of people who say, if you get rid of the deductions, you ruin the American dream because, you know, home mortgage deduction. But the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913 when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.And they say there will be no more charitable giving. We had churches before that and charitable organizations before that. The fact of the matter is, I believe if you put more money in people\u2019s pockets that they will actually be more generous rather than less generous. And it\u2019s...(APPLAUSE)... the money that they earned.And, the other thing is, I do care about the poor people. And in the system that we\u2019re putting together, there will be a rebate for people at the poverty level. But I also want to emphasize the fact that as we get the economy moving, and I hope I get a question about how do we get the economy moving, there will be a lot more opportunities for poor people not to be poor people because this is America.This is the land of dreams. And our policies should be aimed at allowing people to realize that dream.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Thank you very much.Senator Paul, you said you want to blow up the tax code and start over with an across-the-board 14.5 percent fair and flat tax. You happily offered that it is not revenue neutral and that\u2019s the idea. You want to choke off the amount of money coming into Washington.But don\u2019t you risk, sir, creating a near-term budget crisis just as your presidency would be beginning?PAUL: Well, it\u2019s a great question, Neil, and thanks for including me in the tax debate.I think what\u2019s important about the tax debate is, is that we have to ask the question, where is money best spent, in the private sector or in the government sector? I want a government really, really small, so small you can barely see it. So I want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)My tax plan, however, is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan. I put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five-year period.Each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut. The question came up earlier, where would you cut? Nobody likes to say where they would cut. I\u2019ve put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance.I\u2019m also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we\u2019d just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years. So I think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget.PAUL: What is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax. Democrats demagogue this issue to death, and when they do they say, oh, a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making $10,000.That\u2019s proportionality, as Ben is trying to explain to folks. But the thing is, is if we get rid of the payroll tax, everybody is going to get a tax cut. And this is something that I think the public at large will support and could win an election.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: There are no deductions on your \u2014 under your plan?PAUL: Ours is 14.5 percent for corporations, 14.5 percent for individuals. No payroll tax for the employee. The business tax pays for social security, and there would be two remaining deductions \u2014 home mortgage and charity.CAVUTO: Thank you, Senator.PAUL: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, there isn\u2019t anyone in this audience or watching at home tonight who would not like to pay less in taxes. Most people just want a fair shake, and they don\u2019t want their money to be wasted.But explain how your plan works. How can you cut taxes as much as you propose without running up debt and deficits?CRUZ: Well, sure, you put your finger on what the problem is. The current system isn\u2019t fair. Washington is fundamentally corrupt. There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible \u2014 and \u2014 and not a one of them is as good.(LAUGHTER)Every one of them reflects a carve-out or a subsidy, and it\u2019s all about empowering the Washington cartel. My simple Flat Tax says that, for a family of four, for the first $36,000 you earn, you pay no taxes whatsoever. No income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing.Above that, every American pays 10 percent across the board \u2014 a flat, fair tax. Which means that no longer do you have hedge-fund billionaires paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.On the business side, I\u2019ve got a business flat tax of 16 percent \u2014 again, that applies across the board. Right now, with our corporate income tax, giant corporations with armies of accountants regularly are paying little to no taxes while small businesses are getting hammered.This plan eliminates the payroll tax, eliminates the death tax, eliminates the corporate income tax, and it abolishes the IRS.(APPLAUSE)And the effect of that is incredible economic growth. It means every income group will see double-digit increases, from the very poorest to the very weakest, of at least 14 percent.So if you\u2019re a single mom, if you\u2019re making $40,000 a year, what that means is an extra about $5,000 in your pocket to provide for your kids, to make ends meet. It has a powerful, powerful effect.And there\u2019s one other really powerful feature of my plan, which is that it\u2019s border-adjustable. Which means, if you\u2019re an exporter \u2014 if you\u2019re a farmer, if you\u2019re a rancher, if you\u2019re a manufacturer, you don\u2019t pay the businesses flat tax.Exports are free of that tax, but all imports pay that 16 percent business flat tax, which means this tax plan would cause jobs to boom, and it would let America compete with China and the world on a level playing field.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: But you haven\u2019t told us how to pay for it.CRUZ: Well, the numbers the Tax Foundation had put out is that the static cost of the plan is $3.6 trillion over 10 years, but the dynamic cost of the plan, which \u2014 which is the cost that factors in growth, is about $768 billion.It is less than a trillion. It costs less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth and it\u2019s one of the very few plans that abolishes the IRS.But on top of that, today, we rolled out a spending plan. $500 billion in specific cuts \u2014 five major agencies that I would eliminate. The IRS, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and HUD \u2014 and then 25 specific programs.BARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush, Republican primary voters say tax reform should be a priority for Congress and the administration. But, Governor Bush, how important is tax reform in your domestic policy agenda? Will you guarantee it in the first year of your presidency?BUSH: I\u2019m gonna fight as hard as I can to make sure that we shift power away from Washington, simplify the tax code, to spur economic activity in this country. Of course it\u2019s the highest priority.If we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re stuck with the \u201cnew normal\u201d of 2 percent growth. Hillary Clinton says, basically, we just gotta get used to it. Two percent growth means declining income for the middle class. It means more than 6 million people are stuck in poverty than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated.It means \u2014 it means more demands on government \u2014 growing the economy is the first job, if we\u2019re going to be serious about dealing with the deficit and debt. And more importantly, people are really struggling right now.In this economy, the disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks. So yeah, we\u2019ve created jobs, your \u2014 argue (ph) \u2014 brought that up early, and it was a good question. Jobs are being created, but they\u2019re lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.And the net effect of this is we need to jump-start the economy. I think of Jonathan (ph) and Reagan Love (ph), who are supporters of mine. Jonathan has been deployed by the National Guard, he is \u2014 he\u2019s in Oklahoma.Reagan Love \u2014 by the way, pretty great name, I think \u2014 is a teacher. When \u2014 if they had this tax cut, what they told me was that that $2,300 of money in their pocket \u2014 they would go back to South Carolina and start a business.Imagine what it would be like, instead of having more businesses closed than started, we had it the exact opposite. We would grow our economy, and the government would get the revenue necessary to make things \u2014 make things better.Hillary Clinton\u2019s approach to this is more top-down, more regulation, more taxes, more government, and it will destroy our economy.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor.BAKER: Senator Rubio. Can I just come to Senator Rubio? We\u2019re coming to you, Mr. Trump, in one second. I \u2014 I promise. TRUMP: Yes.BAKER: Senator Rubio, your tax plan includes a large expansion of child tax credits to raise off (ph) the tax incomes for low-income parents. A similar tax credit that you previously proposed in the Senate was estimated to cost as much as $170 billion a year, according to the Tax Foundation.Isn\u2019t \u2014 isn\u2019t there a risk you\u2019re just adding another expensive entitle program to an already overburdened federal budget?RUBIO: The most important job I\u2019m ever going to have, the most important job anyone in this room will ever have, is the job of being a parent. Not the job of being president, or the job of being a senator, or the job of being a congressman.The most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president (sic), because the most important institution in society is the family. If the family breaks down, society breaks down.You can\u2019t have a strong nation without strong values, and no one is born with strong values. They have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities.And so when we set out to do tax reform, we endeavor to have a pro-family tax code, and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living.It is expensive to raise children in the 21st century, and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the United States, and everything costs more. In 35 out of 50 states, child care costs more than college.There are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what I\u2019m talking about. They don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to make that payment every month, and if they can\u2019t make it, they can\u2019t work, because someone needs to watch their kids during the day. They don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to save for their kids\u2019 future, to go to college.And so, yes, I have a child tax credit increase, and I\u2019m proud of it. I am proud that I have a pro-family tax code, because the pro- family tax plan I have will strengthen the most important institution in the \u2014 in the country, the family.PAUL: Neil, there\u2019s a point I\u2019d like to make here...(APPLAUSE)....Neil, a point that I\u2019d like to make about the tax credits.We have to decide what is conservative and what isn\u2019t conservative. Is it fiscally conservative to have a trillion-dollar expenditure? We\u2019re not talking about giving people back their tax money. He\u2019s talking about giving people money they didn\u2019t pay. It\u2019s a welfare transfer payment.So here\u2019s what we have. Is it conservative to have $1 trillion in transfer payments \u2014 a new welfare program that\u2019s a refundable tax credit? Add that to Marco\u2019s plan for $1 trillion in new military spending, and you get something that looks, to me, not very conservative. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)BAKER: Governor Kasich? Let me come to Governor Kasich.TRUMP: No, I\u2019m sorry. No, excuse me. I was there.BAKER: Governor Kasich.(CROSSTALK)BAKER: Very quickly, Senator.RUBIO: Now I get my 60 seconds to respond. He\u2019s talking about my tax plan.BAKER: Please.RUBIO: So let me begin with this. I actually believe \u2014 first of all, this is their money. They do pay. It is refundable, not just against the taxes they pay to the government, but also the \u2014 on their federal income tax, it\u2019s refundable against the payroll tax.Everyone pays payroll tax. This is their money. This is not our money. And here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand \u2014 if you invest that money in a piece of equipment, if you invest that money in a business, you get to write it off your taxes.But if you invest it in your children, in the future of America and strengthening your family, we\u2019re not going to recognize that in our tax code? The family is the most important institution in society. And, yes...PAUL: Nevertheless, it\u2019s not very conservative, Marco.RUBIO: ... I do want to rebuild the American military.PAUL: How is it conservative?RUBIO: I know that Rand is a committed isolationist. I\u2019m not. I believe the world is a stronger and a better place, when the United States is the strongest military power in the world.PAUL: Yeah, but, Marco! Marco! How is it conservative, how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure for the federal government that you\u2019re not paying for?RUBIO: Because... PAUL: How is it conservative?RUBIO: ...are you talking about the military, Rand?PAUL How is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military expenditures? You can not be a conservative if you\u2019re going to keep promoting new programs that you\u2019re not going to pay for.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: We can\u2019t even have an economy if we\u2019re not safe. There are radical jihadist in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. A radical Shia cleric in Iran trying to get a nuclear weapon, the Chinese taking over the South China Sea...(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: ...Yes, I believe the world is a safer \u2014 no, no, I don\u2019t believe, I know that the world is a safer place when America is the strongest military power in the world.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)PAUL: No. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re any safer \u2014 I do not think we are any safer from bankruptcy court. As we go further, and further into debt, we become less, and less safe. This is the most important thing we\u2019re going to talk about tonight. Can you be a conservative, and be liberal on military spending? Can you be for unlimited military spending, and say, Oh, I\u2019m going to make the country safe? No, we need a safe country, but, you know, we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined?I want a strong national defense, but I don\u2019t want us to be bankrupt.(BELL RINGING)(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ...Middle ground that brings both of these together...FIORINA: ...Yes, the middle ground is this...CRUZ: ...Exactly right, that we have to defend this nation. You think defending this nation is expensive, try not defending it. That\u2019s a lot more expensive.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CRUZ: But, you can do that, and pay for it. You can do that, and also be fiscally responsible. You know, I mention that the 25 programs that I put today, that I would eliminate them. Among them are corporate welfare, like sugar subsidies. Let\u2019s take that as an example. Sugar subsidies. Sugar farmers farm under...(BELL RINGING) CRUZ: ...under roughly 0.2% of the farmland in America, and yet they give 40% of the lobbying money. That sort of corporate welfare is why we\u2019re bankrupting our kids, and grandkids. I would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation...BAKER: ...Gentleman, we need to move on...FIORINA: ...This is why \u2014 this is why we must combine, actually, zero-based budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine, and cut, and move, every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government, we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time.Ask yourself this question, how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year, which the federal government has been doing, receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike, and yet, never has enough money to do the important things?The answer? All the money\u2019s always spoken for. All the money\u2019s spoken for. So, we have to go to zero-based budgeting, which is a simple idea \u2014 by the way, there\u2019s been a bill for zeros-based (ph) budgeting...(BELL RINGING)FIORINA: ...It exists, it can be voted on. Every dollar must be examined. Any dollar can be cut. Any dollar can be cut, any dollar can be moved. We have to go to a three page tax code. You lower every rate, you close every loophole, why? Because the government uses the tax code to decide winners, and losers. You have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it. You have to know where every single dollar is being spent...BAKER: ...We need to move...FIORINA: ...Cut where you need to, and invest where you need to...BAKER: ...We need too...FIORINA: ...The two go hand in hand...BAKER: ...We do need to move on. Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Please, if I could just...BAKER: ...Very quick.TRUMP: We have to make our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before so that nobody messes with us, and a long run, it\u2019s going to save us. I agree with Marco, I agree with Ted, we have no choice. And, I can tell you this with certainty. We all have a different tax plan. Some I don\u2019t totally agree with.One thing we understand, each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Let\u2019s talk about \u2014 No, no, Governor, I really must move on. I really want to move on.Mr. Trump, let\u2019s talk about the international economy...KASICH: ...Mr. Baker, everybody got to talk about taxes...BAKER: ...We really need to move on...KASICH: ...I think you were coming to me and then...BAKER: ...No, governor, I promise I will come to you...KASICH: ...Look, I hate to crash the party to you, Mr. Baker, but, you know, what\u2019s fair...BAKER: ...Listen...KASICH: ...Yes, sir...BAKER: ...Mr. Trump, can I ask you about...TRUMP: ...Yes...BAKER: ...the U.S. just concluded an international trade agreement with 11 countries in the Pacific. You\u2019ve said that you\u2019d rather have no deal...TRUMP: ...Yeah...BAKER: ...than sign the one that\u2019s on the table...TRUMP: ...It\u2019s a horrible deal...BAKER: ...Most economists \u2014 most economists say that trade is boosted growth, and every single post war president has supported the expansion of international trade, including the last three republican presidents. Why would you reverse more than 50 years of U.S. trade policy?TRUMP: The TPP is horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It\u2019s a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. It\u2019s 5,600 pages long. So complex that nobodies read it. It\u2019s like Obamacare; nobody ever read it. They passed it; nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now. And it will be repealed.But this is one of the worst trade deals. And I would, yes, rather not have it. With all of these countries, and all of the bad ones getting advantage and taking advantage of what the good ones would normally get, I\u2019d rather make individual deals with individual countries. We will do much better. We lose a fortune on trade. The United States loses with everybody. We\u2019re losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan. By the way, Mexico, $50 billion a year imbalance.So I must say, Gerard, I just think it\u2019s a terrible deal. I love trade. I\u2019m a free trader, 100 percent. But we need smart people making the deals, and we don\u2019t have smart people making the deals.BAKER: The \u2014 the deal, as you say, the terms of the deal were published \u2014 were published just last week, the details, 5,000 pages of it, and 80 percent of U.S. trade with countries in the Pacific, these countries, these 11 countries, is actually tariff-free, and these \u2014 the trade deal only affects the other 20 percent. Which \u2014 are there particular parts of the deal that you think were badly negotiated?TRUMP: Yes. Well, the currency manipulation they don\u2019t discuss in the agreement, which is a disaster. If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States \u2014 China in particular, because they\u2019re so good. It\u2019s the number-one abuser of this country. And if you look at the way they take advantage, it\u2019s through currency manipulation. It\u2019s not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement. It\u2019s not even discussed.BAKER: There was a separate \u2014 separate...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And as you understand, I mean, you understand very well from the Wall Street Journal, currency manipulation is the single great weapon people have. They don\u2019t even discuss it in this agreement.So I say, it\u2019s a very bad deal, should not be approved. If it is approved, it will just be more bad trade deals, more loss of jobs for our country. We are losing jobs like nobody\u2019s ever lost jobs before. I want to bring jobs back into this country.PAUL: Hey, Gerard, you know, we might want to point out China is not part of this deal.(UNKNOWN): True. It\u2019s true.BARTIROMO: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right.PAUL: Before we get a little bit off-kilter here...BAKER: But isn\u2019t that \u2014 isn\u2019t that part of the problem? When I say, Senator, that if \u2014 if this deal is not ratified by \u2014 by the U.S. \u2014 by the Senate, then it would actually give China an opportunity to grow its economic leadership, which it\u2019s been seeking to do? And if the U.S. is unable to take part in this trade deal with these countries in Asia, China will take the lead? PAUL: There is an argument that China doesn\u2019t like the deal, because in us doing the deal, we\u2019ll be trading with their competitors. You\u2019re exactly right. But I think we\u2019ve sort of missed the point a little bit here.There is an important point, though, about how we discuss these trade treaties that I do agree with Mr. Trump on. We should negotiate from a position of strength. And we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us. I think it\u2019s a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals. We give up the power to filibuster, and I\u2019m kind of fond of that power.(LAUGHTER)We give up the power to amend. And I think, really, one of the big problems we have in our country is, over the last century, really, so much power has gravitated to the executive branch. Really, Congress is kind of a bystander. We don\u2019t write the rules. We don\u2019t make the laws. The executive branch does. So even in trade \u2014 and I am for trade \u2014 I think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you. Thanks, Senator.BARTIROMO: Coming up, the biggest threats facing the next commander-in-chief. You\u2019re watching the Republican presidential debate, live tonight from Milwaukee. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. The candidates taking the questions you want answered. Also tonight, you can see what America is saying about the debate. Go to Facebook and type #gopdebate into the search box.Now, back to the questions. Americans face security threats at home and abroad. Last year, terrorist attacks rose 61 percent, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, with the most deaths occurring in just five countries, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria.Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president\u2019s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?CARSON: Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re called special ops, they\u2019re actually able to guide some of the other things that we\u2019re doing there.And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.We also must recognize that it\u2019s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.What we\u2019ve been doing so far is very ineffective, but we can\u2019t give up ground right there. But we have to look at this on a much more global scale. We\u2019re talking about global jihadists. And their desire is to destroy us and to destroy our way of life. So we have to be saying, how do we make them look like losers? Because that\u2019s the way that they\u2019re able to gather a lot of influence.And I think in order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate. And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if \u2014 outside of Anbar in Iraq, there\u2019s a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I\u2019ve learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.But you have to continue to face them, because our goal is not to contain them, but to destroy them before they destroy us.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: We asked Facebook to take a look at some of the major issues we\u2019re talking about, and tackling in this debate tonight. This word cloud shows what people are focusing on the most. The bigger the word, the more the talk. One of the most discussed issues in the last month, homeland security. Governor Bush, what is the biggest threat facing America today?BUSH: It is \u2014 I\u2019d say it is Islamic terrorism, and, back to the question of what we are dealing with in Iraq, when we pull back voids are filled. That\u2019s the lesson of history, and, sadly, this president does not believe in American leadership. He does not believe it, and the net result is that we have a caliphate the size of Indiana that gains energy each and everyday to recruit Americans in our own country, and the threat to the homeland relates to the fact that we have not dealt with this threat of terror in the Middle East.We should have a no fly zone in Syria. We should have a support for the remnants of the Syrian Free Army, and create safe zones. If you want to deal with the four million refugees that are leaving Syria because of the devastation there, then we \u2018ought to create safe zones for them to stay in the region rather than go to Europe. And, that requires American leadership.Without American leadership every other country in the neighborhood beings to change their priorities. It is tragic that you see Iraq, and other countries now talking to Russia. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Russia had no influence in the region at all. And, so, the United States needs to lead across the board.This president, and Hillary Clinton both do not believe the United States has a leadership role to play, and we\u2019re now paying a price, and it will have a huge impact on the economy of this country if we don\u2019t deal with this.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.Mr. Trump, in 2012 debate, President Obama mocked Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion that Russia was the top geopolitical challenge facing the United States, saying he was a Cold War dinosaur. Now, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and has put troops in Syria. You have said you will have a good relationship with Mr. Putin. So, what does President Trump do in response to Russia\u2019s aggression?TRUMP: Well, first of all, it\u2019s not only Russia. We have problems with North Korea where they actually have nuclear weapons. You know, nobody talks about it, we talk about Iran, and that\u2019s one of the worst deals ever made. One of the worst contracts ever signed, ever, in anything, and it\u2019s a disgrace. But, we have somebody over there, a madman, who already has nuclear weapons we don\u2019t talk about that. That\u2019s a problem.China is a problem, both economically in what they\u2019re doing in the South China Sea, I mean, they are becoming a very, very major force. So, we have more than just Russia. But, as far as the Ukraine is concerned, and you could Syria \u2014 as far as Syria, I like \u2014 if Putin wants to go in, and I got to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes, we were stablemates, and we did very well that night.But, you know that.But, if Putin wants to go and knocked the hell out of ISIS, I am all for it, 100%, and I can\u2019t understand how anybody would be against it...BUSH: ...They\u2019re not doing that...TRUMP: ...They blew up \u2014 hold it....BUSH: (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP: ...They blew up, wait a minute...(AUDIENCE REACTION)TRUMP: ...They blew up a Russian airplane. He cannot be in love with these people. He\u2019s going in, and we can go in, and everybody should go in. As far as the Ukraine is concerned, we have a group of people, and a group of countries, including Germany \u2014 tremendous economic behemoth \u2014 why are we always doing the work?We are \u2014 I\u2019m all for protecting Ukraine and working \u2014 but, we have countries that are surrounding the Ukraine that aren\u2019t doing anything. They say, \u201cKeep going, keep going, you dummies, keep going. Protect us...\u201d(BELL RINGING) TRUMP: ...And we have to get smart. We can\u2019t continue to be the policeman of the world. We are $19 trillion dollars, we have a country that\u2019s going to hell, we have an infrastructure that\u2019s falling apart. Our roads, our bridges, our schools, our airports, and we have to start investing money in our country.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.BUSH: Donald \u2014 Donald\u2019s wrong on this. He is absolutely wrong on this. We\u2019re not going to be the world\u2019s policeman, but we sure as heck better be the world\u2019s leader. That\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s a huge difference where, without us leading...(CHEERING)BUSH: ...voids are filled, and the idea that it\u2019s a good idea for Putin to be in Syria, let ISIS take out Assad, and then Putin will take out ISIS? I mean, that\u2019s like a board game, that\u2019s like playing Monopoly or something. That\u2019s not how the real world works.We have to lead, we have to be involved. We should have a no fly zone in Syria. There are \u2014 they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country. If you\u2019re a Christian, increasingly in Lebanon, or Iraq, or Syria, you\u2019re going to be beheaded. And, if you\u2019re a moderate Islamist, you\u2019re not going to be able to survive either.We have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it\u2019s too late.TRUMP: Assad is a bad guy, but we have no idea who the so-called rebels \u2014 I read about the rebels, nobody even knows who they are. I spoke to a general two weeks ago, he said \u2014 he was very up on exactly what we\u2019re talking about. He said, \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump? We\u2019re giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people, we have no idea who they are.\u201dSo, I don\u2019t like Assad. Who\u2019s going to like Assad? But, we have no idea who these people, and what they\u2019re going to be, and what they\u2019re going to represent. They may be far worse than Assad. Look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Look at the mess we have after spending $2 trillion dollars, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over the place \u2014 who I love, OK? All over.We have nothing. And, I said, keep the oil. And we should have kept the oil, believe me. We should have kept the oil. And, you know what? We should have given the oil...(BELL BRINGING)...We should\u2019ve given big chunks to the people that lost their arms, their legs, and their families, and their sons, and daughters, because right now, you know who has a lot of that oil? Iran, and ISIS.FIORINA: You know, Mr. Trump fancies himself a very good negotiator. And, I accept that he\u2019s done a lot of good deals, so, Mr. Trump \u2018ought to know that we should not speak to people from a position of weakness. Senator Paul should know that as well.One of the reasons I\u2019ve said that I would not be talking to Vladimir Putin right now, although I have met him as well, not in a green room for a show, but in a private meeting.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)FIORINA: One of the reasons I\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t be talking to Vladimir Putin right now is because we are speaking to him from a position of weakness brought on by this administration, so, I wouldn\u2019t talk to him for awhile, but, I would do this. I would start rebuilding the Sixth Fleet right under his nose, rebuilding the military \u2014 the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose. I would conduct very aggressive military exercises in the Baltic States so that he understood we would protect our NATO allies...(BELL RINGING)...and I might also put in a few more thousand troops into Germany, not to start a war, but to make sure that Putin understand that the United States of America will stand with our allies. That is why Governor Bush is correct. We must have a no fly zone in Syria because Russia cannot tell the United States of America where and when to fly our planes. We also have a set of allies...(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: ...We also have a set of allies in the Arab Middle East that know that ISIS is their fight. They have asked us specifically over, and over again to support them. King Abdullah of Jordan, a man I\u2019ve known for a very long time, has asked us for bombs and material, we have not provided it.The Egyptians are asking us to share intelligence, we are not, I will. The Kurds have asked us to arm them for three years, we are not, I would. The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrain\u2019s, the Emirati, the Kurds...(BELL RINGING)...all of these, I know, by the way, understand ISIS is their fight, but they must see leadership support and resolve from the United States of America...MALE: ...let me follow up that...FIORINA: ...we have the strongest military on the face of the planet, and everyone has to know it.CAVUTO: Senator Paul...(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)CAVUTO: Senator Paul, you have already said, sir, that that would be a mistake in not talking to Vladimir Putin, or to rule it out. You\u2019ve argued that it\u2019s never a good idea to close down communication. With that in mind, do you think the same applies to administration efforts right now to include the Iranians in talks on Syria?PAUL: I\u2019d like first to respond to the acquisition, we should \u2014 I think it\u2019s particularly naive, particularly foolish to think that we\u2019re not going to talk to Russia. The idea of a no fly zone, realize that this is also something that Hillary Clinton agrees with several on our side with, you\u2019re asking for a no fly zone in an area in which Russia already flies.Russia flies in that zone at the invitation of Iraq. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing, but you better know at least what we\u2019re getting into. So, when you think it\u2019s going to be a good idea to have a no fly zone over Iraq, realize that means you are saying we are going to shoot down Russian planes. If you\u2019re ready for that, be ready to send your sons and daughters to another war in Iraq.I don\u2019t want to see that happen. I think the first war in Iraq was a mistake...(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)PAUL: You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the war...MALE: (INAUDIBLE)CAVUTO: ...Well, then how would you respond?PAUL: Ronald Reagan was strong, but Ronald Reagan didn\u2019t...FIORINA: ...Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik.PAUL: ...send troops into the Middle East...FIORINA: ...he walked away, he quit talks...PAUL: ...Can I finish...FIORINA: ...when it was time to quit talking...PAUL: ...Can I finish my time?PAUL: Could I finish with my time?TRUMP: Why does she keep interrupting everybody?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Terrible.(BOOING)PAUL: Yes, I would like to finish my response, basically.RUBIO: You know, if I may respond...PAUL: This is an important question. This is an incredibly important question. And the question goes to be, who do we want to be our commander-in-chief? Do you want a commander-in-chief who says something that we never did throughout the entire Cold War, to discontinue having conversations with the Russians?I am not happy about them flying over there. But I\u2019m not naive enough to say, well, Iraq has them flying over their airspace, we\u2019re just going to announce that we\u2019re shooting them down?That is naive to the point of being something you might hear in junior high. But it\u2019s scary...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: But if you\u2019re not going to respond in a no-fly zone strategy, what would yours be?PAUL: The first thing I would do is I wouldn\u2019t arm our enemies. I wouldn\u2019t arm ISIS.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)Most of the people who want to the no-fly zone also favored arming the allies of al Qaeda, which became ISIS. That was the dumbest, most foolhardy notion. And most of the people up here supported it. They wanted to arm the allies of al Qaeda. Some of them still do.That\u2019s how ISIS grew. We pushed back Assad, and ISIS was allowed to grow in the vacuum. So the first thing you do is don\u2019t arm your enemies. (CROSSTALK)RUBIO: I need to add a couple of points to this. The first is, I\u2019ve never met Vladimir Putin, but I know enough about him to know he is a gangster. He is basically an organized crime figure that runs a country, controls a $2 trillion economy. And is using to build up his military in a rapid way despite the fact his economy is a disaster.He understands only geopolitical strength. And every time he has acted anywhere in the world, whether it\u2019s in Ukraine or Georgia before that, or now in the Middle East, it\u2019s because he is trusting in weakness.His calculation in the Middle East is that he has seen what this president has done, which is nothing, the president has no strategy, our allies in the region do not trust us. For goodness sake, there is only one pro-American free enterprise democracy in the Middle East, it is the state of Israel.And we have a president that treats the prime minister of Israel with less respect than what he gives the ayatollah in Iran. And so our allies in the region don\u2019t trust us.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)Vladimir Putin is exploiting that weakness, for purposes of edging the Americans out as the most important geopolitical power broker in the region. And we do have a vested interest. And here\u2019s why.Because all those radical terrorist groups that, by the way, are not just in Syria and in Iraq, ISIS is now in Libya. They are a significant presence in Libya, and in Afghanistan, and a growing presence in Pakistan.Soon they will be in Turkey. They will try Jordan. They will try Saudi Arabia. They are coming to us. They recruit Americans using social media. And they don\u2019t hate us simply because we support Israel. They hate us because of our values. They hate us because our girls go to school. They hate us because women drive in the United States.Either they win or we win, and we had better take this risk seriously, it is not going away on its own.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you, Senator.Governor Kasich, I want to ask you about China, in particular hundreds of American companies have been subjected to cyber attacks from the Chinese military, yet state-backed Chinese companies, growing their presence in the United States, Chinese investments in U.S., which were nearly nonexistent a few years ago, are now over $50 billion. And as my newspaper recently reported, Chinese companies are planning to bid for one of the largest hotel chains in the United States, what would be the largest ever Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Would you stop them?KASICH: Let me tell you this, Mr. Baker, in terms of the cyber attacks, we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture, but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks, we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us.I want to give you a little trip around the world. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years. In the Ukraine, arm the people there so they can fight for themselves. In the eastern part of Europe, make sure that Finland and the Baltics know that if the Russians move, we move.In Syria, yes, a no-fly zone in the north on the Turkish border, a no-fly zone on the south on the Jordanian border. Anybody flies in the first time, maybe they can fly out. They fly in there a second time, they will not fly out.And it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be. And it also sends many messages in the Middle East that we\u2019re still involved.Saudi Arabia, cut off the funding for the radical clerics, the ones that preach against us. But they\u2019re fundamentally our friends. Jordan, we want the king to reign for 1,000 years. Egypt, they have been our ally and a moderating force in the Middle East throughout their history.In the groups \u2014 in the countries of the Gulf states of Bahrain, the Cleveland Clinic is opening an operation. Clearly we see the same with them. And in Israel, we have no better ally in the world, and no more criticizing them in public, we should support them.And finally China, China doesn\u2019t own the South China Sea, and I give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the Chinese know that we\u2019re not going to put up with it any more.And in the trade agreement, the TPP, it\u2019s critical to us, not only for economic reasons and for jobs, because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade, but it allows us to create not only economy alliances, but also potentially strategic alliances against the Chinese. They are not our enemy, but they are certainly not our friend.And finally, I will say to everyone in this room, we have been talking about taxes and economics. When the fall comes, and we run against Hillary, which will be a disaster if she got elected. I have two 16-year-old girls, and I want this country to be strong.We make promises we can\u2019t keep under the bright light of the fall, we will have trouble. We must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid. I served in Washington as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and we got the budget balanced.And in Ohio, as the CEO, and guess what, we have got to have a CEO mentality and a way to beat Hillary Clinton and the Democracies in the fall. And our ideas have to add up. They have to be solid. And people have to know we have the confidence to lead America.And as president, I will lead this country, as I have before in Washington and in Ohio, and will return both on domestic and international affairs. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak this time, Gerry.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you, Governor. Plenty of opportunities. Thank you.Neil?CAVUTO: All right. And look at the time, look at the time. You are watching FOX Business, we\u2019ll take a break. Stick around.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAKER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, live from Milwaukee.Now let\u2019s get straight back to the questions, and Governor Bush.Governor, Hillary Clinton recently said that if we had another financial crisis like the one in 2008, she wouldn\u2019t bail out the banks. Would you?BUSH: We\u2019re not \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t have another financial crisis. What we ought to do is raise the capital requirements so banks aren\u2019t too big to fail. Dodd-Frank has actually done the opposite, totally the opposite, where banks now have higher concentration of risk in assets and the capital requirements aren\u2019t high enough. If we were serious about it, we would raise the capital requirements and lessen the load on the community banks and other financial institutions. This vast overreach has created a huge problem for our country, and Hillary Clinton wants to double down on that.I was in Washington, Iowa, about three months ago talking about how bad Washington, D.C., is. It was \u2014 get the \u2014 kind of the \u2014 anyway. We had...(LAUGHTER)It \u2014 and I talked to a banker there. This is a bank that had $125 million of assets, four branches. Their compliance costs because of Dodd-Frank went from $100,000 to $600,000 in a two-year period. The net effect of that is \u2014 and they had \u2014 they had not one loan that went bad during the financial crisis. They knew \u2014 they knew their borrowers. They gave back to the community. They were engaged in the community. And imagine America without its community banks. Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening because of Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s my worry. My worry is that the real economy has been hurt by the vast overreach of the Obama administration.And Hillary Clinton, she wants to double down on that. She wants to create even more so. She is a captive of the left of her party to the point now where she is \u2014 she was for the trade agreement in \u2014 the Pacific agreement. Now she\u2019s against it. She was \u2014 hinted she was for the XL pipeline. Now she\u2019s opposed to it. All the things that would create sustained economic growth she\u2019s now doubling down against it.BAKER: But, Governor, but can I just quickly \u2014 did \u2014 you can\u2019t seriously guarantee that there won\u2019t be another financial crisis, can you?BUSH: You could, if you were serious about...BAKER: Ever? There will never be another financial crisis?BUSH: No, I can\u2019t say that. But I can say, if you created higher capital requirements, that\u2019s the solution to this, not having concentration of assets. The bigger banks now have more and more control over \u2014 over the financial assets of this country. And that is the wrong approach to take.BAKER: Dr. Carson, if I may, just on that point, despite measures taken, as the governor says, since the crisis to make the financial system safer, the major banks in the U.S., many of them are actually bigger than ever. Asset held by JPMorgan Chase, for example, the very largest bank, have increased by nearly 40 percent to over $2.6 trillion. Do you think JPMorgan and the other big banks should be broken up?CARSON: Well, I think we should have policies that don\u2019t allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities. And certainly some of the policies, some of the monetary and Fed policies that we\u2019re using makes it very easy for them, makes it very easy for the big corporations, quite frankly, at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially. Those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place.And I think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation. This country was \u2014 declared its independence in 1776. In less than 100 years, it was the number-one economic power in the world. And the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk- taking and capital investment. Those are the fuels that drive it.And what we\u2019ve done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations, which is involved in every aspect of our lives. If we can get that out, it makes a big difference. And even for the average person, every single regulation costs money. And it\u2019s shifted to the individual.So \u2014 and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich. They go into the store and they buy a bar of soap, it costs 10 cents more, they notice it. And the middle class, when they come to the cash register, have a whole cart full of things that cost 5, 10 or 15 cents more, they notice it. It is hurting the poor.Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won\u2019t tell you that that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s really hurting middle class in the core. They\u2019ll say it\u2019s the rich, take their money, but that won\u2019t help. You can take all of the rich\u2019s money and it won\u2019t make a dent in the problem that we\u2019re having. We have to come back to the fundamental principles that made America great.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: But just to be clear, just \u2014 just to be clear, then, you wouldn\u2019t \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t favor breaking up the big banks? You think they\u2019re big enough \u2014 they\u2019re OK as they are, as big as they are?CARSON: I would have policies that wouldn\u2019t allow that to occur. I don\u2019t want to go in and tear anybody down. I mean, that doesn\u2019t help us. But what does help us is stop tinkering around the edges and fix the actual problems that exist that are creating the problem in the first place.BAKER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.RUBIO: Can I just add what \u2014 he\u2019s right on point there. Do you know why these banks are so big? The government made them big. The government made them big by adding thousands and thousands of pages of regulations. So the big banks, they have an army of lawyers, they have an army of compliance officers. They can deal with all these things. The small banks, like Governor Bush was saying, they can\u2019t deal with all these regulations. They can\u2019t deal with all \u2014 they cannot hire the fanciest law firm in Washington or the best lobbying firm to deal with all these regulations. And so the result is, the big banks get bigger, the small banks struggle to lend or even exist, and the result is what you have today.And in Dodd-Frank, you have actually codified too big to fail. We have actually created a category of systemically important institutions, and these banks go around bragging about it. You know what they say to people with a wink and a nod? We are so big, we are so important that if we get in trouble, the government has to bail us out. This is an outrage. We need to repeal Dodd-Frank as soon as possible.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Let me \u2014 let me also say, Gary \u2014 Gary, let me also say, Jeb is \u2014 what Jeb is talking about with the big banks is to force them to reserve their capital, people who invest it and they hold their capital, so that if the bank goes down, the people who are invested in the bank are the ones that pay. That\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to say.Secondly, I\u2019ll tell you about Wall Street: There\u2019s too much greed. And the fact is, a free enterprise system is a system that\u2019s produced the greatest wealth for the world. But you know Michael Novak, the great Catholic theologian, says that a free enterprise system that is not underlaid with values \u2014 and we should all think about the way we conduct our lives \u2014 yes, free enterprise is great, profits are great, but there have to be some values that underlay it, and they need a good ethics lesson on Wall Street on a regular basis to keep them in check so we, the people, do not lose.BAKER: Thank you.PAUL: Gerard, can I comment...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Senator Cruz \u2014 and I will get to you \u2014 but, Senator Cruz, on that theme, Facebook data shows that over the last month alone, nearly 1 million people \u2014 nearly 1 million \u2014 have been concerned about reining in Wall Street, apparently believing that some have not been punished enough.So, as an accomplished litigator yourself and a former solicitor general, would you go after the very people who believe and fear that Wall Street has ignored, in other words, the crooks that Bernie Sanders say have gotten away with a financial murder?CRUZ: Absolutely yes. You know, I have spent much of my adult life enforcing the law and defending the Constitution. And the problem that underlies all of this is the cronyism and corruption of Washington.You know, the opening question Jerry asked, would you bail out the big banks again? Nobody gave you an answer to that. I\u2019ll give you an answer. Absolutely not.(APPLAUSE)And what we have right now is we have Washington \u2014 as government gets bigger and bigger, you know, the biggest lie in all of Washington and in all of politics is that Republicans are the party of the rich. The truth is, the rich do great with big government. They get in bed with big government. The big banks get bigger and bigger and bigger under Dodd-Frank and community banks are going out of business. And, by the way, the consequence of that is small businesses can\u2019t get business loans, and it is that fundamental corruption that is why six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, D.C.And let me give you a contrast to Washington cronyism. Some weeks ago, a woman named Sabina Loving testified at a hearing that I chaired in the Senate. Sabina Loving is an African-American single mom who started a tax preparation business in the south side of Chicago. She found a store front, she wanted to have her own business. She started a business.But then the IRS promulgated new regulations targeting tax preparers. They did it under a more than 100-year-old statute called the Dead Horse Act. Now, this statute and the IRS in classic Washington crony fashion had exemptions for lawyers and big fancy accountants, but Sabina had to pay $1,000 an employee. It would have driven her out of business, and Ms. Loving sued the IRS. She took the Obama IRS to court, and she won, and they struck down the rule for picking the big guys over the little guys.CAVUTO: Senator...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Senator, I really want to be clear here. Are you saying, sir, that if Bank of America were on the brink, you would let it fail?CRUZ: Yes. Now, let\u2019s be clear, there is a role for the Federal Reserve \u2014 what the Fed is doing now is it is a series of philosopher- kings trying to guess what\u2019s happening with the economy. You look at the Fed, one of the reasons we had the financial crash is throughout the 2000s, we had loose money, we had an asset bubble, it drove up the price of real estate, drove up the price of commodities, and then in the third quarter of 2008, the Fed tightened the money and crashed those asset prices, which caused a cascading collapse. That\u2019s why I am supporting getting back to rules-based monetary system not with a bunch of philosopher-kings deciding, but tied...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Sir, I understand that. I just want to be clear, if you don\u2019t mind, that millions of depositors would be on the line with that decision. And I just want to be clear. If it were to happen again, for whatever the reason, you would let it go, you would let a Bank of America go?CRUZ: So let me be clear. I would not bail them out, but instead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, number one, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold, and, number two, serving as a lender of last resort.That\u2019s what central banks do. So if you have a run on the bank, the Fed can serve as a lender of last resort, but it\u2019s not a bailout. It is a loan at higher interest rates. That\u2019s how central banks have worked.And I\u2019ll point out \u2014 look, we had a gold standard under Bretton Woods, we had it for about 170 years of our nation\u2019s history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now.We need to get back to sound money, which helps, in particular, working men and women. What Washington does \u2014 the people who are doing well in the Obama economy are those with power and influence in the Obama government. The people who (inaudible) working men and women...(CROSSTALK)KASICH: Neil, that\u2019s the difference of being an executive. And let me just explain: when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don\u2019t say we believe in philosophical concerns. You know what an executive has to decide? When there\u2019s a water crisis, how do we get water to the city? When there\u2019s a school shooting, how do you get there and help heal a community? When there are financial crisis, or a crisis with ebola, you got to go there and try to fix it.Philosophy doesn\u2019t work when you run something. And I gotta tell you, on-the-job training for president of the United States doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ve done it for 8 years, \u2014 and almost 8 years now. It does not work.(APPLAUSE)We need an executive who\u2019s been tried, has been tested, and judge the decisions that that executive makes. I don\u2019t like what the Fed is doing, but I\u2019ll tell you what worries me more than anything else: turning the Fed over to the Congress of the United States...BARTIROMO: Thank you, governor.CRUZ: So, Governor Kasich...KASICH: ...so they can print the money. That would be a very bad approach.BARTIROMO: Senator Rubio.CRUZ: ...why would you then bail out rich Wall Street banks, but not Main street, not Mom and Pop, not Sabina Loving?KASICH: I wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t.CRUZ: But you just said an executive...KASICH: No. No, I didn\u2019t say that.CRUZ: ...knows to step in and bail out a bank.KASICH: They were \u2014 they were talking about what you would do with depositors. Would you let these banks shut down?My argument is, going forward, the banks have to reserve the capital, so that the \u2014 so that the people who own the capital start pressuring the banks to not take these risky approaches, Ted.But at the end of the day...CRUZ: So you said you\u2019d abandon philosophy and abandon principle...KASICH: ... I\u2019m gonna tell you this. Let me tell you this. If during \u2014 if during...CRUZ: ...but what would you do if the bank was failing?KASICH: ...because if during \u2014 well, I\u2019ll tell you what (ph). CRUZ: What would you do if the bank was failing?KASICH: I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down.CRUZ: So you \u2014 you would bail them out.KASICH: As an executive \u2014 no. As an executive, I would figure out how to separate those people who can afford it versus those people, or the hard-working folks who put those money in those institutions...(BOOING)... let me \u2014 no, no. Let me say another thing. Here\u2019s what I mean by that. Here\u2019s what I mean by that.(UNKNOWN): Oh, great.KASICH: When you are faced \u2014 when you are faced, in the last financial crisis, with banks going under \u2014 with banks going under, and people, people who put their \u2014 their life savings in there, you got to deal with it. You can\u2019t turn a blind eye to it.Now, going forward, that\u2019s one thing. If you had another financial crisis, perhaps there would be an effort to make sure that we do (ph).BARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor Kasich.FIORINA: Can I just \u2014 could I just say, as a chief executive who\u2019s had to make tough calls to save jobs and to grow jobs, I think what\u2019s interesting about Dodd-Frank is it\u2019s a great example of how socialism starts.Socialism starts when government creates a problem, and then government steps in to solve the problem. Government created the problem.(APPLAUSE)Government created the problem of a real estate boom. How did we create it? Under Republican and Democrats alike, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, everybody gathered together, Republicans and Democrats, and said, \u201chome ownership is part of the American dream. Let\u2019s create a bubble,\u201d and then government stepped in \u2014 by the way, under president George W. Bush, banks were told \u2014 encouraged \u2014 told, really \u2014 to buy other banks, to take money.And now what do we have with Dodd-Frank? The classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we\u2019ve created something called the Consumer Financial Production Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that\u2019s digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud.This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: More questions \u2014 more questions coming up, when the Republican presidential debate comes right back, live from Milwaukee. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO: Welcome back to the fourth Republican presidential debate.Senator Rubio, Hillary Clinton is the clear front runner for the Democratic nomination. If she is indeed the nominee, you will be facing a candidate with an impressive resume.She was the first lady of the United States, a U.S. senator from New York, and secretary of state under Barack Obama. She has arguably more experience, certainly more time in government than almost all of you on stage tonight.Why should the American people trust you to lead this country, even though she has been so much closer to the office?RUBIO: Well, that\u2019s a great question, and let me begin by answering it.(LAUGHTER)This election is about the future, about what kind of country this nation is gonna be in the 21st century. This next (ph) election is actually a generational choice. A choice about what kind of nation we will be in the 21st century.For over 2.5 centuries, America\u2019s been a special country, the one place on earth where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything, a nation that\u2019s been a force for good on this planet.But now, a growing number of Americans feel out of place in their own country. We have a society that stigmatizes those that hold cultural values that are traditional.We have a society where people \u2014 millions of people \u2014 are living paycheck to paycheck. They\u2019re working as hard as they ever have, but they\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck because the economy has changed underneath their feet.We have young Americans who owe thousands of dollars in student loans for a degree that doesn\u2019t lead to a job. For the first time in 35 years, we have more businesses dying than starting, and around the world, every day brings news of a new humiliation for America \u2014 many the direct response \u2014 direct consequence of decisions made when Hillary Clinton was the secretary of the \u2014 of state.And so here\u2019s the truth: this election is about the future, and the Democratic Party, and the political left has no ideas about the future. All their ideas are the same, tired ideas of the past. More government, more spending. For every issue for America, their answer is a new tax on someone, and a new government program. This nation is going to turn the page, and that\u2019s what this election should be about, and, as I said at the first debate...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ...If I am our nominee, they will be the party of the past, we will be the party of the 21st century.(CHEERING)CRUZ: And, Maria, I will note, she\u2019s got a lot of experience, but her policies have proven disastrous. If you look at foreign policy, every region in the world has gotten worse. Under her leadership, we abandon the nation of Israel. Under her leadership, radical Islamic terrorism has been on to the rise. Under her leadership, and Obama\u2019s leadership, Iran is getting $100 billion dollars, and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon.Everything she\u2019s put her hand to, or has touched \u2014 and when we talk about the cronyism of Washington, Hillary Clinton embodies the cronyism...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ...of Washington. And, I\u2019ll give you an example of that, which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare, which is fundamentally wrong, and I\u2019ll tell you this, if I\u2019m elected president, I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress. The law should apply evenly to every American.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: OK, I think it\u2019s fair to say you\u2019re not fans of Hillary Clinton\u2019s resume. Alright, Mr. Trump....TRUMP: We are not.CAVUTO: I had a feeling. Perhaps the most successful capitalist on this stage tonight, you\u2019ve acknowledged that some give capitalism a bad name. You\u2019ve been particularly critical of businesses that find all sorts of ways of paying their taxes by keeping money abroad, but your own plan includes an incentive to bring \u2014 that more the $2 trillion dollars home.Isn\u2019t that, like, a one-time bounty...TRUMP: ...No, no, no...CAVUTO: ...Some of the guys you all but call pirates, so they still keep the loot, and pay only a price to bring it back.TRUMP: Well, what\u2019s happening right now, Neil, is something that not been a subject of conversation by politicians. As primarily the only politician, I guess other than Carly on the stage, they haven\u2019t talked about a corporate inversion. A corporate inversion \u2014 companies are leaving. You know, we used to leave New York to go to Florida. We got better taxes, we got, maybe, something else.Now, they\u2019re the United States to go to other countries. They have trillions of dollars in those other countries. They\u2019re going for two reasons, they can\u2019t get their money back in. It\u2019s something where the democrats and the republicans both agree, it\u2019s the only thing I can think of. They both agree, let the money come back in.Three and a half years, they still can\u2019t make a deal. They can\u2019t get the money in. It\u2019s probably two and a half trillion, but, I think it\u2019s much more than that. All of that money could become \u2014 could come right in and be used to rebuild our country, and investments in our country. They can\u2019t do it. What we have to do, and what I\u2019ve done, is made the tax rate \u2014 and one of the reasons they don\u2019t (INAUDIBLE) the taxes so obnoxious, they can\u2019t do it.Where, I made it a 10% number, as you know. I\u2019ve been very highly praised for it. A lot of money\u2019s going to come back in, we\u2019re going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems, and roadblocks, because that\u2019s also a problem. And, we\u2019re going to have all of this money pour back into the United States. It\u2019s going to be used to build businesses, for jobs, and everything else.And, as I say, my expression is, let\u2019s make America great again.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Paul, you were one of 15 republicans to vote for an amendment which states that human activity contributed to climate change. President Obama has announced an aggressive plan to cut carbon emissions. At the same time, energy production in America has boomed. Is it possible to continue this boom, and move toward energy self-sufficiency, while at the same time pursuing a meaningful climate change program?PAUL: The first thing I would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the President has put in place.(APPLAUSE)PAUL: Including the Clean Power Act. While I do think that man may have a role in our climate, I think nature also has a role. The planet\u2019s 4.5 billion years old, we\u2019ve been through geologic age after geologic age. We\u2019ve had times when the temperatures been warmer, we\u2019ve had times when the temperatures been colder. We\u2019ve had times when the carbon in the atmosphere\u2019s been higher. So, I think before we \u2014 we need to look before we leap.President\u2019s often fond of saying he wants a balance solution, but, really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean, and we will have some rules for that. We got to balance that with the economy.He\u2019s devastated my state. I say the President\u2019s not only destroying Kentucky, he\u2019s destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him. So, what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms, and that means we will have solar, and wind, and hydro, but we will still have coal, and we still will have natural gas. And, we\u2019ve got to have an all of the above policy.But, it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields, and shut down the coal power plants. If we did so we\u2019re going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold, or very hot. So, I think it\u2019s a big danger, and we shouldn\u2019t do it. And, what we should do is say we want all of the above...(BELL RINGING)PAUL: ...We want to free up the energy sector, and let people produce, let them drill, let them explore.BUSH: Maria?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Maria, critically, when it comes to climate change...BUSH: ...We\u2019ve had a 10% reduction in carbon emissions, and it isn\u2019t because of Solyndra. It isn\u2019t because of the central planners in Washington D.C. It\u2019s because we\u2019ve had a great American success story, the explosion of natural gas.Taking two existing technologies, and applying it through innovation has created lower carbon emissions, lower energy costs \u2014 40% of all the economic activity in the age of Obama has come from the energy sector, and Hillary Clinton wants to suppress that. We \u2014 I think we ought to be expanding this. High growth is the path to lower carbon, and more jobs.I know for a fact, as Governor of the State of Florida, we created the largest land purchasing programs, and environment clean-up programs because we had a growing economy. Our revenues were growing at 4.4%. It allowed for resources to be able to protect the natural system.We got to get to a conservation...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ...in environmental policy that goes beyond just carbon...CRUZ: ...Our \u2014 our...CAVUTO: ...Alright, gentlemen, I know you want to \u2014 and I want to, be we also promised to get people home tonight, and we are going to take a quick break here. I think it is fair to say at this juncture that you can discuss these issues, and only business issues, but still keep it interesting. Stick around for these candidates closing statements. (MUSIC)(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAKER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate. And now, candidates, it\u2019s time for your closing statements. You get 30 seconds each, and, Senator Paul, we will begin with you.PAUL: We\u2019re the richest, freest, most humanitarian nation in the history of mankind. But we also borrow a million dollars a minute. And the question I have for all Americans is, think about it, can you be a fiscal conservative if you don\u2019t conserve all of the money? If you\u2019re a profligate spender, you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military, is that a conservative notion? We have to be conservative with all spending, domestic spending and welfare spending. I\u2019m the only fiscal conservative on the stage.(APPLAUSE)BAKER: Thank you, Senator. Governor Kasich?KASICH: Well, ladies and gentlemen, if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders were to win this election, my 16-year-olds, I \u2014 I worry about what their life is going to be like.You know, the conservative movement is all about opportunity. It is about lower taxes. It\u2019s about balanced budgets. It\u2019s about less regulation. And it\u2019s about sending power, money and influence back to where we live so we can run America from the bottom up.In addition to that, once we have the power and the money and the influence with programs we shift out, that each of us have a responsibility to reach out and to rebuild our families, make them stronger, and connect our neighborhoods. All that together \u2014 wealth, connection, family \u2014 America\u2019s greatest days are ahead. We must win this election.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Carly Fiorina?FIORINA: Imagine a Clinton presidency. Our military will continue to deteriorate. Our veterans will not be cared for. And, no, Mrs. Clinton, that situation is not exaggerated. The rich will get richer. The poor will get poorer. The middle class will continue to get crushed.And as bad as that picture is, what\u2019s even worse is that a Clinton presidency will corrode the character of this nation. Why? Because of the Clinton way: Say whatever you have to, lie as long as you can get away with it.We must beat Hillary Clinton. Carly Fiorina can beat Hillary Clinton. I will beat Hillary Clinton. And under a President Fiorina, we will restore the character of this nation, the security of this nation, the prosperity of this nation, because as citizens, we will take our government back.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Former Governor Jeb Bush?BUSH: Jane Horton is sitting with my wife here today. Her husband, Chris, was killed in action in Afghanistan. And Jane spends her time now defending and fighting for military families. They\u2019re both heroes.I don\u2019t think we need an agitator-in-chief or a divider-in-chief. We need a commander-in-chief that will rebuild our military and restore respect to our veterans by revamping and fixing a broken Veterans Administration, That\u2019s my pledge to you. I ask for your support. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: Senator Ted Cruz?CRUZ: Fifty-eight years ago, my father fled Cuba. As he stood on the deck of that ferryboat with the wind and salt air blowing, he looked back at the oppression and torture he was escaping. And yet he looked forward to the promise of America. His story is our story. What ties Americans together is we are all the children of those who risked everything for freedom.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Senator Marco Rubio?RUBIO: Ours \u2014 the story of America is an extraordinary story. It is the story of a nation that for over two centuries each generation has left the next better off than themselves. But now, because Washington is out of touch, for the fault of both political parties, for the first time in our history, that is in doubt.And that is what this election must be about, because if the next four years are anything like the last eight years, our children will be the first Americans ever left worse off by their parents. This election is about making a different choice, about applying our principles of limited government and free enterprise to the unique issues of our time. And if we do, we will not just save the American dream. We will expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And the 21st century can be a new American century.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)BARTIROMO: He\u2019s funny.CAVUTO: Dr. Ben Carson?CARSON: In the two hours of this \u2014 of this debate, five people have died from drug-related deaths, $100 million has been added to our national debt, 200 babies have been killed by abortionists, and two veterans have taken their lives out of despair. This is a narrative that we can change, not we the Democrats, not we the Republicans, but we the people of America, because there is something special about this nation, and we must embrace it and be proud of it and never give it away for the sake of political correctness.(APPLAUSE)CAVUTO: Donald Trump?TRUMP: Thank you. Over the years, I\u2019ve created tens of thousands of jobs and a great company. It\u2019s a company I\u2019m very proud of. Some of the most iconic assets anywhere in the world. And I will tell you, I don\u2019t have to give you a website because I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m putting up my own money.I want to do something really special. I want to make our country greater than it\u2019s ever been. I think we have that potential. We cannot lose this election. We cannot let Hillary Clinton, who is the worst secretary of state in the history of our country, win this election.We will fight. We will win. And we truly will make this even more special. We have to make it better than ever before. And I will tell you, the United States can actually be better than ever before. Thank you.CAVUTO: Candidates, we want to thank you all. We also appreciate your helping save time by talking over one another at times. That was welcomed. But by all means, it was a very riveting debate. Business issues can be \u2014 can be riveting, because it wasn\u2019t about us, it\u2019s about them.BARTIROMO: Thank you.CAVUTO: That\u2019ll do it. Thank you for joining us.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unilever Finds That Shrinking Its Footprint Is a Giant Task", "Date": "2015-11-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHellmann\u2019s mayonnaise is known for many things \u2014 making egg salad delicious, being loaded with fat, that old \u201cbring out the best\u201d jingle. To date, however, it hasn\u2019t been associated with sustainability. Mayo is a processed food made by huge conglomerates, not a symbol of environmentalism.Paul Polman would like that to change. As chief executive of Unilever, Mr. Polman has made sustainable production \u2014 of Hellmann\u2019s, Lipton tea, Dove soap, Axe body spray and all the other products Unilever makes \u2014 the company\u2019s top priority. Detergents are being reformulated to use less water. Packaging is becoming more efficient. And Unilever is taking preliminary steps to make soybean oil, a main ingredient in mayonnaise, more eco-friendly.Mr. Polman, 59, is hardly the only chief executive claiming his corporation will become a better steward of the planet and an outstanding global citizen. The chief of Walmart is buying clean energy, PepsiCo\u2019s leader is promoting healthier snacks, and Apple\u2019s boss is into recycling. But Mr. Polman\u2019s plan is unique in its audacious ambition. Not only does the Unilever sustainable living plan pledge to cut the company\u2019s environmental impact in half by 2020, it also vows to improve the health of one billion people and enhance livelihoods for millions, all while doubling Unilever\u2019s sales.None of this is easy to achieve. In broad terms, sustainability means meeting the needs of today while preserving resources for tomorrow. But selling more products means consuming more energy and more natural resources \u2014 not exactly the way to shrink an environmental footprint.Six years into his tenure, however, Mr. Polman is starting to make good on some of his promises. Unilever\u2019s factories are emitting 37 percent less emissions than in 2008, even while producing more goods. Waste going to landfills is down 85 percent. Those things please environmentalists, while shareholders are happy that revenue is up 22 percent since Mr. Polman took over, though profits are up less.\u201cIf there is a standout company in sustainability, it is Unilever,\u201d said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a nonprofit that advocates social and environmental responsibility in the business world. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make them perfect. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a long way to go. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a lot to accomplish. But Paul Polman sees these issues in a very comprehensive and visionary way.\u201dBorn in the Netherlands, Mr. Polman spent 27 years climbing through the ranks of Procter & Gamble and was chief financial officer at Nestl\u00e9 before going to Unilever, which is based in London. While a cynic might question any chief executive\u2019s embrace of sustainability, Mr. Polman, who considered becoming a priest before going into business, brings a moral fire to his case. He argues that corporations have the capacity \u2014 and the obligation \u2014 to combat climate change and \u201cirreversibly eradicate poverty in a more sustainable and equitable way.\u201d Failing to confront these challenges, he says, will lead to ever more catastrophic natural disasters and spiraling social disruption.But translating this vision into action is another matter. Unilever is, after all, a multinational corporation worth more than $126 billion. Cutting carbon emissions grows harder after doing the obvious things, like buying more clean power and upgrading energy efficiency in buildings. Some of the goals, Mr. Polman acknowledges, will be nearly impossible to achieve.And even as Unilever rushes headlong into this brave new world, a big question remains: What is sustainability, anyway? Despite its righteous timbre, it\u2019s a fuzzy term that means different things to different people. When applied to the ingredients and processes in the 1,000 different mass-market brands Unilever makes, the complications multiply endlessly. Scores of issues arise in just one jar of Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, starting with the soybean oil. Dig into the specifics of that one ingredient, and it becomes clear that what Unilever calls sustainable sometimes doesn\u2019t mean all that much.On a humid day in late September, as the skies unleashed an occasional downpour, Kenny Sutter navigated his red Ford F-350 along gravel roads near Pleasantville, Iowa, assessing the coming harvest. His soybean fields were golden, almost ready for the combines.Mr. Sutter, who grows soy, corn and alfalfa on 4,000 acres spread across an area homesteaded by his family in the mid-1800s, is not a Unilever employee. Yet Mr. Polman is counting on him, and other farmers around the globe, to help carry out the sustainable living plan.Unilever buys more soy in the United States than any other crop, and among Mr. Polman\u2019s many goals is ensuring that all its soy oil \u2014 used in Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter spread \u2014 is sourced from sustainable farms by 2017. But when Unilever began looking into the matter in 2012, it hit a roadblock: No one was really certifying sustainable soybeans in the United States.Elsewhere in the world, third-party groups like the Rainforest Alliance certify sustainable cocoa and coffee. And in South America, soybeans are certified by the Round Table on Sustainable Soy. If Unilever wanted certified sustainable soybeans in the United States, however, it was going to have to create a system for certifying them.The first step was contacting Archer Daniels Midland, a huge commodities trader. ADM buys soybeans from hundreds of farms, including Mr. Sutter\u2019s, and turns the beans into soy oil at a plant in Des Moines. ADM then sells the soy oil to Unilever. Aiming to promote sustainability (and keep Unilever\u2019s gargantuan business), ADM agreed to help, and the Iowa sustainable soy program was born.Unilever brought on the United Soybean Board and the Iowa Soybean Association, two trade groups, to give the program bona fides. The World Wildlife Fund signed up as a scientific consultant. Practical Farmers of Iowa, a nonprofit that focuses on farm ecology, joined in, as did Field to Market, an alliance of agricultural companies that has developed software to measure farming practices. This ad hoc coalition then began reaching out to Iowa farmers.The pitch to soybean growers is simple. By participating in the program, they receive an extra 10 cents a bushel of soybeans from ADM, have access to additional state subsidies for certain eco-friendly farming techniques and receive education about sustainability. Three years into the program, 250 farmers responsible for 285,000 acres have signed up.Mr. Sutter was initially reluctant to participate in the program, worried that data about his farm he was required to share might be obtained by big seed suppliers like Monsanto. But he ultimately joined.As he surveyed his fields, he saw that heavy rains and stiff winds had recently flattened a few acres of his soybeans. That would mean a loss of several thousand dollars. But Mr. Sutter said that changes he made to improve sustainability would mitigate the damage.During the winter months when soy won\u2019t grow, Mr. Sutter has begun planting cover crops, like cereal rye, that can improve soil health, prevent erosion and keep nutrients near the surface for the next season\u2019s soy crop. Around his soybeans, Mr. Sutter had also installed contour strips \u2014 grassy barriers that improve irrigation and water quality. Between the cover crops and the contour strips, Mr. Sutter said his soy was stronger and more resilient, and that his overall harvest would be fuller this year, helping make up for the lost acres.He has made other changes, too. To cut down on fuel for his trucks, he now stores his harvested soybeans in a silo on the north end of his farm, closer to their ultimate destination in Des Moines, rather than in their usual silo to the southeast.\u201cWithout sustainability we\u2019re not going to be here,\u201d Mr. Sutter said. \u201cWe as a people.\u201dFor his efforts, Mr. Sutter has become the face of the sustainable soy program, opening his farm up to curious executives and reporters, and appearing in television ads for Hellmann\u2019s. But he\u2019s not really representative of farmers in the program.In fact, Unilever doesn\u2019t ask the farmers to change much at all. All that the program requires is that farmers pledge to become more ecologically sound and use the Field to Market software to share voluminous data about how they run their farms. The software then calculates things like the efficiency of water use, greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon levels. These metrics are compared with benchmarks set by the United Soybean Board and endorsed by Unilever. As long as the farmer\u2019s total practices meet some minimum thresholds, the crops are certified sustainable.So far, Unilever and ADM aren\u2019t even enforcing these rules. Even though little has changed on most of the soy farms in the Iowa program, Unilever counts their crops toward the 28 percent of soy it says is now \u201csustainable.\u201dUnilever says it is instead focused on enrolling farmers in the program, rather than holding them to high standards that they might not be able to meet.\u201cWe aren\u2019t telling them they\u2019re not sustainable or kicking them out of the program,\u201d said Clint Piper, the general manager for North American soybean processing at ADM. \u201cRight now it\u2019s about getting people in the program and sharing knowledge.\u201dWhile Unilever performs random audits on participating farms, the loose criteria and absence of enforcement have left even some of those who created the program dissatisfied. Sarah Carlson, a researcher with Practical Farmers of Iowa, said that while things like fuel conservation and better irrigation were well and good, the real key to sustainable soy was the use of cover crops. Without cover crops, she said, \u201cthose soybeans are no more sustainable than anyone else\u2019s soybeans.\u201dNot many of the farms meet Ms. Carlson\u2019s definition of sustainability. Fewer than 75 farmers have received state subsidies to use cover crops, which amounts to less than a quarter of 1 percent of all the 40,000 soybean growers in Iowa.The conflicting views about the soy program\u2019s worthiness underscore one of the fundamental challenges of Unilever\u2019s sustainable living plan: the word \u201csustainable.\u201d Like \u201cnatural,\u201d the word \u201csustainable\u201d is sufficiently vague to mean quite a lot or nothing at all.\u201cThe challenge in setting standards and measuring progress is that there is no universally agreed definition for sustainability,\u201d said Aron Cramer, chief executive of BSR, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd the standards that do apply vary by industry, commodity and even product line.\u201dAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, sustainability means \u201cthe conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony to support present and future generations.\u201d To the Rainforest Alliance, which Unilever uses to certify its tea, cocoa and vanilla, sustainability means \u201cenvironmental protection, social equity and economic viability.\u201d To the Round Table on Sustainable Soy, which certifies the crop in South America, sustainability means avoiding deforestation, protecting indigenous people\u2019s land and not using child labor \u2014 important issues, but not ones that resonate in Iowa. For Unilever, it\u2019s about \u201ccontinuous improvement.\u201d\u201cThere is no absolute measure of farm sustainability. It\u2019s a moving target,\u201d the company said in a statement, responding to questions about the soy program. \u201cWe take the long view. This means continuous improvement over time.\u201dAs Jeff Malcolm, the director of private sector engagement at the World Wildlife Fund, who is helping with the sustainable soy program, put it, \u201cIt\u2019s better to think about sustainability as a journey rather than a destination.\u201dEven if Unilever could get every farmer in Iowa to plant cover crops, that wouldn\u2019t make its mayonnaise sustainable. Soy is just one ingredient. There are eggs (goal: 100 percent from cage-free hens by 2020, certified by the American Humane Association). There is the container (Unilever introduced new eco-friendly plastic jars and encourages recycling). There is the energy needed for production (Unilever is buying carbon offsets, but it has not installed wind or solar power at the factory in Chicago).And Hellmann\u2019s is just one brand in Unilever\u2019s vast portfolio. Cover crops on Iowa farms don\u2019t help Unilever make Dove soap sustainable, reduce its carbon footprint, improve livelihoods or meet any of the sustainable living plan\u2019s other goals. Mr. Polman himself acknowledges that change in the heartland is incremental at best.\u201cWe recognize that with our U.S. sustainable soybean program, it is still early days,\u201d Mr. Polman said. \u201cOver the coming years we expect to be able to report more confidently on some of the improvements on the ground.\u201dUnilever\u2019s work in Iowa is a microcosm of the monumental challenges it faces as it tries to overhaul the manufacturing and distribution of 1,000 soaps, ice creams and spreads that it sells in 190 countries.In Vietnam, Unilever introduced Comfort One Rinse, a fabric softener meant to use much less water. In Nigeria, it\u2019s testing Sunlight dishwashing detergent in a powder that requires less energy to distribute and less water to work. In Brazil, it\u2019s selling more efficient Omo laundry detergent.Selling products that use less water is necessary if Unilever is to achieve Mr. Polman\u2019s goals. As part of the sustainable living plan, Unilever has pledged to take responsibility for the behavior of its consumers, who account for 70 percent of its environmental impact. There simply is no easy way to heat a gallon of water with half as much fuel, or to wash a load of clothes with drastically less water.This, as Mr. Polman sees it, is the hardest part. \u201cA lot of the water usage in our value chain comes from cooking and showering, from heating up water,\u201d Mr. Polman said. \u201cHow do you halve that? It\u2019s very difficult.\u201dIndeed, consumer habits aren\u2019t changing. Unilever estimates that the greenhouse gas impact from people using its products has actually increased by about 4 percent since 2010 and that their water use has gone down just 2 percent. In other words, Unilever\u2019s goal of halving its environmental impact by 2020 is impossible.But Mr. Polman hasn\u2019t pulled back on his pledges. As he tells it, they are part of Unilever\u2019s DNA.When he became chief executive in 2009, Mr. Polman drew inspiration from William Lever, the founder of the company that eventually became Unilever. Lever began making soap in 1884 near Liverpool, England. The soap, called Sunlight, was a hit, and with the profits, he bought cheap land on the marshy banks of the River Mersey. There, he built Port Sunlight, a company town where soap factory workers lived in pleasant houses near the improving influences of libraries and museums.By the paternalistic standards of Victorian England, Lever\u2019s business practices were exceptionally enlightened. The son of a grocer, he was made a lord. Today, Mr. Polman is trying recapture Lord Lever\u2019s business spirit, updated for 21st-century challenges.\u201cThe sustainable living plan is much broader than the sustainable sourcing of agricultural materials,\u201d Mr. Polman said. \u201cIt\u2019s really using your business model to address big issues in society and make a positive contribution.\u201dMr. Polman says the sustainable living plan is profitable as well as ethical. The company claims that efficiency upgrades to Unilever factories have created savings of 400 million euros, or $430 million, since 2008. It is also aggressively marketing sustainable brands in the hope of increasing sales (including a paid post from Ben & Jerry\u2019s on the website of The New York Times).Unilever\u2019s sustainability measures can have ripple effects. The Rainforest Alliance, which has been certifying farmers in the developing world for decades, now certifies the chocolate for Magnum ice cream bars, the vanilla in Breyers ice cream, and the leaves in Lipton tea bags. After Unilever began using certified tea, other big tea producers including Twinings and Tata followed suit.\u201cIt\u2019s more effective than anything else going on out there,\u201d said Ana Paula Taveres, interim president of the Rainforest Alliance. \u201cIn a capitalist world, Unilever is using the global market to drive sustainability.\u201dWhen it comes to improving health and well-being and creating jobs, Unilever also claims to be making gains. Nearly 400 million people have benefited from Unilever\u2019s efforts to promote health and hygiene, the company says. More than a quarter-million women have received job training through Unilever-backed programs. Big claims like this, of course, are hard to verify.But these issues (along with the fact that Lord Lever used forced labor in the Belgian Congo to supply palm oil for Sunlight soap) go largely unmentioned as Mr. Polman spreads his gospel of conscientious capitalism.If Unilever can actually double revenue and simultaneously cut its environmental impact in half, it will have made progress toward one of the most important sustainability milestones. It would have unlinked economic growth from resource consumption, reconciling the expanding needs of a growing population with the fact that natural resources are finite.\u201cIt is essential that economic growth and natural resource use be decoupled,\u201d Mr. Cramer of BSR said. \u201cSimply replicating Western consumption patterns as they are today would require more natural resources than are available.\u201dMr. Polman knows he is aiming high, and contemplating these existential conundrums has led him to the frontiers of environmental thinking. He speaks of \u201cplanetary boundaries,\u201d a concept developed by European academics that describes a set of tipping points that, if hit, could cause \u201cabrupt or irreversible environmental changes.\u201d And he promotes the \u201ccircular economy,\u201d a version of radical sustainability that imagines a world without waste.Before Mr. Polman can transform the world, however, he must focus on more modest changes at his own company. To even come close to delivering on the sustainable living plan, he will need suppliers to become vastly more efficient. He will need governments to incentivize conservation efforts and set stringent new regulations. He will need consumers to change deeply ingrained habits. And as he is discovering, even modest goals, like sourcing sustainable soy, are inordinately complicated tasks.\u201cWe still have a ways to go, honestly,\u201d Mr. Polman said.It is a vastly different set of challenges from those Lord Lever faced a century ago in Victorian Britain. But Mr. Polman is betting that sustainability \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 is as essential for Unilever as it is for the planet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Partisan Growth Gaps", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWell, we can agree on that much.Partisan positioning on the economy is actually quite strange. Republicans talk about economic growth all the time. They attack Democrats for \u201cjob-killing\u201d government regulations, they promise great things if elected, they predicate their tax plans on the assumption that growth will soar and raise revenues. Democrats are far more cautious. Yet Mrs. Clinton is completely right about the record: historically, the economy has indeed done better under Democrats.This contrast raises two big questions. First, why has the economy performed better under Democrats? Second, given that record, why are Republicans so much more inclined than Democrats to boast about their ability to deliver growth?Before I get to those questions, let\u2019s talk about the facts.Why is the Democratic record so much better? The short answer is that we don\u2019t know.Mr. Blinder and Mr. Watson look at a variety of possible explanations, and find all of them wanting. There\u2019s no indication that the Democratic advantage can be explained by better monetary and fiscal policies. Democrats seem, on average, to have had better luck than Republicans on oil prices and technological progress. Overall, however, the pattern remains mysterious. Certainly no Democratic candidate would be justified in promising dramatically higher growth if elected. And in fact, Democrats never do.Republicans, however, always make such claims: Every candidate with a real chance of getting the G.O.P. nomination is claiming that his tax plan would produce a huge growth surge \u2014 a claim that has no basis in historical experience. Why?Part of the answer is epistemic closure: modern conservatives generally live in a bubble into which inconvenient facts can\u2019t penetrate. One constantly hears assertions that Ronald Reagan achieved economic and job growth never matched before or since, when the reality is that Bill Clinton surpassed him on both measures. Right-wing news media trumpet the economic disappointments of the Obama years, while hardly ever mentioning the good news. So the myth of conservative economic superiority goes unchallenged.Beyond that, however, Republicans need to promise economic miracles as a way to sell policies that overwhelmingly favor the donor class.It would be nice, for variety\u2019s sake, if even one major G.O.P. candidate would come out against big tax cuts for the 1 percent. But none have, and all of the major players have called for cuts that would subtract trillions from revenue. To make up for this lost revenue, it would be necessary to make sharp cuts in big programs \u2014 that is, in Social Security and/or Medicare.Hence the asymmetry between the parties. Democrats can afford to be cautious in their economic promises precisely because their policies can be sold on their merits. Republicans must sell an essentially unpopular agenda by confidently declaring that they have the ultimate recipe for prosperity \u2014 and hope that nobody points out their historically poor track record.And if someone does point to that record, you know what they\u2019ll do: Start yelling about media bias.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great News! We\u2019re Not Doomed to Soaring Health Care Costs", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt really matters who the next president is. But there are other things that matter just as much to the nation\u2019s future prosperity. One of them is: What is happening to health care costs?If health care costs start to rise again the way they did before, then health care spending will swallow the economy and bankrupt the federal government. If they are contained, then suddenly there\u2019s a lot more money for everything else, like schools, antipoverty efforts and wages.As a result of the slowdown in health care inflation, the Congressional Budget Office keeps reducing its projections of the future cost of federal health programs like Medicare. As of October, projections for federal health care spending in the year 2020 were $175 billion lower than the projections made in August 2010. That would be a huge budget improvement.The big question is whether these trends will continue. Many people believe that health care inflation came down for entirely temporary reasons and that over the long run we\u2019re still doomed.One group in this camp emphasizes that the economy went into the tank, so of course people went to the doctor less often. As history demonstrates, it can take up to six years for a recession\u2019s impact to work its way through the system; then health care costs shoot up just as before.Another group emphasizes that health care inflation is down because general inflation is down, and once general inflation is back to normal, health care costs will shoot upward.A third group argues that we\u2019ve recently had a decline in technological innovation. Not many useful but costly new drugs or machines have come on the market over the past few years, but if innovation resumes then so will rising costs.Members of the Obama administration like to argue that Obamacare has pushed things along. For example, the Affordable Care Act pushed providers into Accountable Care Organizations. Instead of getting paid for doing more tests and procedures, providers have a greater incentive to just keep people healthy.The law also encouraged bundling. If you go in to get a hip replacement, the government makes a single payment for all services associated with that episode of care. The law also penalizes hospitals when patients have to be readmitted. There\u2019s been a significant drop in readmissions.And yet the weight of the evidence suggests that part of the change is permanent. Moving away from the bad old fee-for-service system has got to be a good thing. The greater pressures providers feel to reduce costs have got to be a good thing, at least fiscally.In the past, most innovation involved improving quality of care at high cost. Rauch described many entrepreneurs who are providing innovations that maintain current quality of care but at lower cost.We seem to be making at least some incremental progress toward a structural reduction in health care inflation. Many Americans are feeling gloomy about accomplishing anything these days, but progress is possible. We haven\u2019t whipped health care inflation, or defeated our intractable budget issues. But the evidence suggests we\u2019re landing a few serious blows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Botches Wall Street Questions", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHillary Clinton should have seen that Wall Street shot coming. Instead, she compounded the damage.The former secretary of state was off to a sound outing in Saturday night\u2019s debate against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland. Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris dominated at first, allowing her to highlight her superior experience in world affairs. But it was those attacks that made her badly muffed response to questions about her fealty to Wall Street all the more jarring. Here\u2019s the exchange:Mr. Sanders: \u201cI have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military-industrial complex, not one candidate say, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me. I\u2019m going to be independent. Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions? They expect to get something. Everybody knows that. Once again, I am running a campaign differently than any other candidate. We are relying on small campaign donors, 750,000 of them, 30 bucks apiece. That\u2019s who I\u2019m indebted to.\u201dMrs. Clinton: \u201cWell John, [John Dickerson, the moderator] wait a minute. Wait a minute, he has basically used his answer to impugn my integrity. Let\u2019s be frank here.\u201dMr. Sanders: \u201cNo, I have not.\u201dMrs. Clinton: \u201cOh, wait a minute, senator. You know, not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors, most of them small. And I\u2019m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women, 60 percent. So, I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.\u201dPredictably, Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York\u2019s recovery from 9/11. Answer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups. That does not account for the millions given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11.Middle-class Americans associate Wall Street with the 2008 meltdown of the economy that cost so many their homes and savings. In the debate Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her plan for reining in banks, but offered precious few specifics. This is what happens when Hillary Clinton the candidate gets complacent. The debate moderator, Mr. Dickerson, had even tipped her off before a commercial break that the next topic was Wall Street.Her effort to tug on Americans\u2019 heartstrings instead of explaining her Wall Street ties \u2014 on a day that the scars of 9/11 were exposed anew \u2014 was at best botched rhetoric. At worst it was the type of cynical move that Mrs. Clinton would have condemned in Republicans.She should make a fast, thorough effort to explain herself by providing a detailed plan for how she would promote measures protecting middle-class Americans from another financial crisis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First President George Bush Swings at Son\u2019s Aides, Rattling Clan", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President George Bush\u2019s unusually sharp indictment of his son\u2019s presidential advisers touched off a round of recriminations on Thursday that exposed rifts within America\u2019s leading political dynasty and complicated its efforts to recapture the White House.Mr. Bush\u2019s assertion in a new biography that Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld undercut George W. Bush\u2019s presidency rattled the extended Bush political world, and forced the second Bush son now seeking the presidency, Jeb, to straddle an awkward line between family and politics.At 91 and in the twilight of a long and storied public life, the first President Bush evidently felt free to express views he had long suppressed in the interest of family harmony. Mr. Cheney, he said, was \u201cvery hard-line\u201d and too eager to \u201cuse force to get our way\u201d; Mr. Rumsfeld was an \u201carrogant fellow\u201d full of \u201cswagger.\u201d He used the same phrase, \u201ciron-ass,\u201d to describe both men.The comments, included in Jon Meacham\u2019s \u201cDestiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush,\u201d to be published by Random House next week, drew a biting retort from Mr. Rumsfeld on Thursday. \u201cBush 41 is getting up in years and misjudges Bush 43, who I found made his own decisions,\u201d Mr. Rumsfeld said in a statement.The father\u2019s comments also prompted the son to come to his advisers\u2019 defense. \u201cI am proud to have served with Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld,\u201d said George W. Bush. \u201cDick Cheney did a superb job as vice president and I was fortunate to have him by my side throughout my presidency. Don Rumsfeld ably led the Pentagon and was an effective secretary of defense.\u201dBut no one was put in a more uncomfortable position than Jeb Bush, who has labored to define his own identity separate from his famous father and brother while mounting his own campaign for the White House this year. Once again he was compelled on Thursday to talk about his family rather than his own plans for the country. On the campaign trail, he suggested his father was trying to find a way to take the heat off George W. Bush by faulting advisers for troubles in his administration.\u201cMy brother is a big boy,\u201d Jeb Bush told NBC News. \u201cHis administration was shaped by his thinking, his reaction to the attack on 9/11. I think my dad, like a lot of people that love George, want to try to create a different narrative, perhaps, just because that\u2019s natural to do.\u201dJeb Bush said that Mr. Cheney \u201cserved my brother well as vice president and he served my dad extraordinarily well as secretary of defense.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have to get beyond, I think, this feeling that somehow 1991 is the same as 2001.\u201dThe seemingly divergent messages from different corners of the Bush family represented the latest chapter in a long-running and at times operatic drama. For years, the relationship between the two Bush presidents has captivated the nation, generating endless speculation, articles, books, television reports and even a big-screen movie \u2014 \u201cW.\u201d \u2014 that starred Josh Brolin and was directed by Oliver Stone.Caught in the middle now is the next son, who is trying to accomplish what no family has done in American history with a third Bush administration.Those who have worked for either of the two presidents strongly testify to their deep love and scoff at what they call overwrought Oedipal theories of rivalry and resentment. Just last year, George W. Bush published his own biography of his father, venerating him in loving terms. The elder George Bush has often bristled at criticism of his son. Both men hate being \u201cput on the couch,\u201d to use a phrase each one employs.Yet few who know them well would assert that they see the world exactly the same way. The younger, brasher and more conservative George W. Bush has made clear that he shaped some of his policies in the White House based on the lessons of what he saw as his father\u2019s mistakes. Friends of the older, more genteel and moderate President Bush have often said he was deeply uncomfortable with the more hawkish elements of his son\u2019s administration.In the new book, the first President Bush expresses his love and support for his son and sticks by his decisions to go to war in Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein from power. But he gently chides his son for \u201chot rhetoric\u201d like his \u201caxis of evil\u201d speech, and says that the real responsibility for the way Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld operated belonged to the president. \u201cThe buck stops there,\u201d he said.What was so surprising about the comments was not their sentiment, but rather that the older Mr. Bush would express them in public. When Mr. Meacham went back to show him a transcript of his remarks and ask if he wanted to clarify, the ex-president took none of it back. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d he told Mr. Meacham.The remarks reflect a long history with both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld. The elder Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld were rivals going back to the 1970s, and although Mr. Cheney served as his defense secretary, Mr. Bush told Mr. Meacham that Mr. Cheney had changed as vice president.Speaking with Fox News on Thursday, Mr. Cheney took the comments in stride, saying he viewed \u201ciron-ass\u201d as a compliment. \u201cI took it as a mark of pride,\u201d he said. Given the devastating losses on Sept. 11, 2001, he said many would agree that \u201cI was aggressive in defending, in carrying out what I thought were the right policies.\u201dHaving never written a true memoir of his own, Mr. Bush effectively decided to use Mr. Meacham\u2019s book as a last chance to make his case for history.The elder Mr. Bush opened up to Mr. Meacham in a series of interviews from 2006 to 2015 in which he spoke more candidly than many politicians would. He described his youth, when he \u201clusted\u201d after pretty girls, including a couple who \u201chad nice racks.\u201d He also mused about his friend Bill Clinton\u2019s marriage. \u201cI don\u2019t feel close to Hillary at all,\u201d Mr. Bush said, \u201cbut I do to Bill and I can\u2019t read their relationship even today.\u201dLike so many former presidents, he measured himself against the 42 other men who have held his office. \u201cI feel like an asterisk,\u201d he told Mr. Meacham wistfully one day at the family\u2019s cliffside house in Kennebunkport, Me.\u201cI am lost between the glory of Reagan \u2014 monuments everywhere, trumpets, the great hero \u2014 and the trials and tribulations of my sons,\u201d Mr. Bush reflected on another day in Houston, where he also has a home. On still another occasion, he fretted about the judgment of historians. \u201cWhat if they just find an empty deck of cards?\u201d he asked.Diaries that Mr. Bush gave to Mr. Meacham opened a contemporaneous window into his time in office. Even in private, Mr. Bush seemed determined through the first war with Iraq in 1991, but afterward fell into an emotional despondency, a \u201cletdown,\u201d once he was no longer at the center of a profound mission. He considered not running for a second term.\u201cI\u2019m not in a good frame of mind now,\u201d he dictated into his diary shortly after American troops vanquished Iraqi forces and expelled them from Kuwait. \u201cMy whole point is, I really don\u2019t care and that\u2019s bad \u2014 that\u2019s bad. But I\u2019ll get in there and try.\u201dFor a president who lost re-election in 1992 after being perceived as out of touch, Mr. Bush sensed his political doom even when he was at the peak of his postwar popularity.On that, at least, he proved prescient.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paris Climate Talks Avoid Scientists\u2019 Idea of \u2018Carbon Budget\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet the negotiators gathering in Paris will not be discussing any plan that comes close to meeting their own stated goal of limiting the increase of global temperatures to a reasonably safe level.Most countries have pledged their greenhouse gas emissions goals. The pledges are the biggest cut ever achieved, but are still not enough.They have pointedly declined to take up a recommendation from scientists, made several years ago, that they set a cap on total greenhouse gases as a way to achieve that goal, and then figure out how to allocate the emissions fairly. The pledges countries are making are voluntary, and were established in most nations as a compromise between the desire to be ambitious and the perceived cost and political difficulty of emissions cutbacks.In effect, the countries are vowing to make changes that collectively still fall far short of the necessary goal, much like a patient who, upon hearing from his doctor that he must lose 50 pounds to avoid life-threatening health risks, takes pride in cutting out fries but not cake and ice cream.The scientists argue that there is only so much carbon \u2014 in the form of exhaust from coal-burning power plants, automobile tailpipes, forest fires and the like \u2014 that the atmosphere can absorb before the planet suffers profound damage, with swaths of it potentially becoming uninhabitable.After years of studying the issue, the experts recommended to climate diplomats in 2013 that they consider the concept of a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d to help frame the talks. Yet the idea was quickly dismissed as politically impractical, and more recent pleas from countries like Bolivia to consider it have been ignored.If any serious push had been made ahead of Paris to divvy up the emissions budget, the negotiators \u201cwould have all run screaming from the room,\u201d said Michael A. Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, in New York. \u201cSo that\u2019s not a real alternative.\u201dThe carbon budget will probably not get much attention in Paris for simple reasons.Wrestling with a budget would, for instance, throw into stark relief the global inequities at the heart of the climate crisis. And it would underscore just how big the problem really is, how costly the delay in tackling it has been and how inadequate the plans being discussed in Paris are for limiting the risks.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Consider, for example, that Europe, the United States and China have offered emissions-reduction pledges that are their most ambitious ever. And yet, if their plans are carried out, a recent analysis suggests those regions will use up most of the remaining room for emissions in the atmosphere, leaving relatively little for the other five billion people on the planet or their descendants.To change that equation, the biggest polluters would have to commit to cutting their emissions at rates that would be difficult to achieve, potentially disruptive to their economies and politically unrealistic.Moreover, any serious discussion of the carbon budget would amplify a point of serious contention, known as \u201cclimate injustice,\u201d in the talks. It refers to the idea that poor countries bear little past responsibility for climate change but are first in line to suffer its consequences, without much capacity to protect themselves.Many of those same countries want to develop their economies by burning some fossil fuels, but because decades of high emissions by richer countries have created such profound risks, they are under pressure to adopt costlier green energy instead.Many scientists do not believe that such a limit would be particularly safe \u2014 it may still cause the sea to rise 20 feet or more, for instance, over a long period \u2014 but they agree that going beyond it would certainly be disastrous, precipitating an even larger rise of the sea, catastrophic heat waves, difficulty producing enough food and many other problems.The group calculated a budget that can be thought of as something like \u2014 to use another food metaphor \u2014 a carbon pie, with the central question being: How can it be carved up fairly?The problem is that about two-thirds of the pie has already been eaten by a handful of rich countries, plus China. At current rates, the remainder of it will be gone in 30 years or less. Many poor countries are crowding around the table, pleading for a sliver, but the big emitting countries insist on laying claim to most of the rest of the pie.Given the political realities, some of the scientists involved in devising the budget have resigned themselves to seeing it ignored in this round of negotiations, with the hope that countries will accelerate their efforts in coming years.Myles R. Allen, a climate scientist at Oxford University and a leading proponent of the budget idea, said it was better for countries to keep negotiating than not. \u201cIt was probably the right call to brush it under the carpet for now,\u201d he said.Yet, within a month of the adoption of the carbon budget, as part of the Stockholm report two years ago, the idea of using it in the global negotiations had been dismissed out of hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible,\u201d Ms. Figueres, of the Framework Convention on Climate Change, told The Guardian newspaper that fall. \u201cPolitically it would be very difficult.\u201dSome country or group of countries may well try to inject the carbon budget into the Paris talks. But most delegates are so unenthusiastic about the concept that it is likely to be quickly dismissed. Dr. Levi, of the Council on Foreign Relations, is among the realists about what can be achieved in the negotiations.\u201cThe only way you can assess foreign policy is by asking, is what we\u2019re getting better than something else?\u201d Dr. Levi said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t see a better deal out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the summit meeting in Paris beginning Nov. 30 and sponsored by the United Nations, Mr. Obama will try to broker a historic accord that would commit every nation to policies to halt climate change. The strength of the American position at the talks lies in the enactment of the emission-curbing E.P.A. rule \u2014 the first major climate change policy put forth by the United States.

But under a Republican president, Congress could enact other policies to slow or weaken the climate change regulations.Much of any deal reached in Paris will rely on enactment of policies by future presidents. Many of the climate negotiators are working to build in a requirement that countries reconvene every five years to ensure enforcement of their domestic climate change plans.

{"Headline": "Macquarie Sets Up Brazil Infrastructure Fund", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The Macquarie Group, the Australian investment bank, has raised over 600 million reais, or $159 million, from Brazilian investors and is nearing a first close for its debut Brazil infrastructure fund, according to a person briefed on the bank\u2019s plans.The first close is expected to take place by the end of next month, at which time capital commitments will likely surpass 800 million reais, the person said. He spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Asset group, or MIRA, which falls within Macquarie Asset Management, a unit of the Macquarie Group, is leading the effort.It is a time of almost daily dismal economic developments in Brazil, from a shrinking economy and rising inflation to growing worries over unemployment and a possible second downgrade from credit ratings agencies. A battle over whether and how to put fiscal austerity measures into place is fostering uncertainty among investors.The corruption scandal engulfing the state-owned oil giant Petrobras and the country\u2019s main construction companies also continues to deepen.For some, however, this presents an opportunity for foreign investors interested in backing infrastructure projects in Brazil, particularly those who previously stayed away.Their rationale is that the corruption investigation has weakened Brazil\u2019s construction conglomerates and the country now has an even greater need for foreign investors to help finance its underdeveloped infrastructure. Brazil ranked 77th in transport infrastructure in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report for 2015-16.The government has long sought to lure investors to finance infrastructure. Yet a 2012 government initiative of concessions drew less interest than expected. This June, it announced a new program of concessions, with the goal of drawing 198 billion reais from the private sector. The market took to that more kindly.Those concessions are expected to include projects to upgrade the country\u2019s airports, highways, and ports, as well as work on an ambitious railroad connecting Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Coast to Peru\u2019s Pacific Coast that the Chinese are also backing.Once Macquarie\u2019s fund closes, it will most likely bid for some of these concessions.Late last year, Macquarie Capital, distinct from MIRA but part of the Macquarie Group, formed an investment vehicle with Rio de Janeiro-based Banco Modal and the China Construction Communication Company to invest in infrastructure in Latin America.Separately Macquarie, through MIRA, is also currently raising a Latin America regional infrastructure fund, hoping to obtain about $500 million, one individual said.A Macquarie representative declined to comment.Advertisement"}

The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, fell 5 percent, as did Kohl\u2019s. Burlington Stores fell about 7 percent.\u201cWe\u2019re clearly disappointed,\u201d Terry J. Lundgren, Macy\u2019s chief executive, said in a call with investors. \u201cWe believe the retail industry is going through a tough period. We seem to experience something like this every five to seven years or so.\u201dAggressive discounting from one of the country\u2019s biggest merchants is bad news for retailers this holiday sales season, which is shaping up to be highly discount-driven. It also raises questions about the strength of the economic recovery, and of consumer sentiment.But a shift in the way Americans shop because of the proliferation of e-commerce, and the power to compare prices at a click of the mouse, has meant that a brightening economy is no longer a tide that raises all retailers, said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen.\u201cThe only tide that\u2019s raising all ships is online and mobile,\u201d Mr. Chen said.Still, the outlook for some merchants is better, analysts say. Winners, and losers, are emerging.Retailers that go head-to-head in the mall with Macy\u2019s are likely to take a hit from its heavy promotions, including J. C. Penney, Gap and Kohl\u2019s, said Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst at Citigroup.But off-price stores like Ross Stores or TJX, which runs T.J.Maxx and Marshalls, are expected to do well again this year as \u201ctreasure hunting\u201d for rock-bottom deals on national brands becomes the norm. These off-price businesses also source their wares from retailers with excess inventory.Over all, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, predicts sales in November and December will rise 3.7 percent to $630 billion, slightly under last year\u2019s 4.1 percent gain.Once laser-focused on price, Walmart has been investing in wage increases for its workers, and in improving stocking and presentation to try to revamp the shopping experience in its stores.So while Walmart is offering so-called doorbusters \u2014 a Samsung curved 55-inch, 4K flat-screen TV for $999, for example \u2014 a focus this holiday season will be execution, Walmart\u2019s United States chief executive, Greg Foran, told reporters.For Walmart, that means stocking up to avoid shortages on the most popular products \u2014 more than a million TVs, and more than 10 million pajamas \u2014 as well as helping shoppers navigate the store with an integrated shopping app, and speeding up the checkout process.Simplicity is a big theme this year, Mr. Foran said. Almost all deals available in stores will be available online.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more frustrating than getting to the store in search of a deal and finding out: Gee, how many did the store have? Just four of them,\u201d Mr. Foran said.Mr. Chen said Walmart would benefit this holiday season because of the breadth of its offerings, like pharmacy products and electronics, which makes it less dependent on winter fashion and the weather.Still, all retailers are fighting another big shift for the American consumer: away from buying things, period.\u201cThe big issue is what are consumers spending money on?\u201d Mr. Lejuez of Citi said. \u201cThey\u2019re spending it to eat out, they\u2019re spending it on iPhones, on Netflix and Spotify,\u201d he said.\u201cThe consumer is fine,\u201d Mr. Lejuez said, \u201cbut retailers are not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Middle Class Means in Malaysia", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of my earliest memories of the place where my father grew up, Kelantan \u2014 a predominantly rural state on Malaysia\u2019s far northeastern coast \u2014 is of its famous flood-measuring point. Built around 1929 and known as Tangga Krai, it consists of a series of flood markers beside a set of steps that rise steeply from the banks of the Kelantan River to a height of about 100 feet \u2014 a simple but effective warning in the country\u2019s most flood-prone region.Malaysia\u2019s rapid rate of economic growth \u2014 averaging around 6 percent annually for the last 25 years \u2014 has created an expanding middle class concentrated in major cities like Kuala Lumpur and Penang, and in the prosperous states of Selangor and Johor. Here, luxury apartment buildings dominate the city centers \u2014 apartments in the glitzy Norman Foster-designed Troika development in downtown Kuala Lumpur, for example, cost as much as $450 per square foot \u2014 while in the suburbs, fee-paying schools with sprawling campuses offer an international curriculum to tap into the middle class\u2019s aspirations for higher education and access to foreign universities. Leisure, too, comes at a price: The Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club has a long waiting list of people willing to pay the $57,000 membership fee.The polarizing effect of unevenly distributed growth has created not only a wider gap between rich and poor, but also a large group of disgruntled people \u2014 particularly in the cities \u2014 who remain trapped in salaries of between $200 and $400 a month. That is not enough to live comfortably in Kuala Lumpur or Penang.These entrenched divisions threaten to thwart the government\u2019s ambition to achieve the World Bank\u2019s High Income status in just over four years. The government recognizes that its final push to join the world\u2019s elite depends on its society\u2019s being seen as fair and supportive of the poor.The new tax regime, together with the widening disparity of incomes, means that Malaysians are having to question the template of economic development that has ruled over recent decades \u2014 and, in turn, the aspirations driving it. The long-held belief that a new bourgeoisie would naturally expand and create incentives for others to strive and rise has underpinned the model of Malaysian growth until now: Thriving free markets were supposed to reward individual effort. But it has become difficult to avoid the fact that without greater government intervention, a large proportion of the population is falling behind.Tash Aw is the author of three novels, including, most recently, \u201cFive Star Billionaire,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chasing Endorsements, Chris Christie Showers New Hampshire With Calls and Texts", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 The pleading phone calls, solicitous text messages and eager dinner invitations come at all hours, even on holidays \u2014 an unrelenting wave of attention from a governor never known for offering small doses of himself.\u201cHe\u2019s calling me,\u201d said Mr. Bradley, \u201call the time.\u201dOver the next few days, his determination will yield still more prizes: the endorsements of a widely courted former speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Donna Sytek, and two powerful and wealthy local real estate developers, Renee and Dan Plummer.As Mr. Christie tries to revive a presidential candidacy that seemed all but doomed, his assiduous courtship of civic and political figures across New Hampshire, the first state to hold a Republican primary, is emerging as potentially potent, unseen force. Behind the scenes, Mr. Christie is deploying every available tool of persuasion, lavishing a level of contact and engagement that elected officials and business leaders say they have not received (or endured) from anybody else in the 2016 field.\u201cPlease tell me what I have to do to earn your support,\u201d Mr. Christie wrote in a text message to Sheriff Scott Hilliard of Merrimack County, the sheriff recalled.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.It was the start of an intense, monthslong pursuit. Mr. Christie invited Sheriff Hilliard to an intimate round-table discussion. Then to a meal. After Sheriff Hilliard mentioned how important the heroin epidemic had become to him, as a law enforcement official, Mr. Christie set up a tour of a local drug rehabilitation center in New Hampshire and asked the sheriff to come along.Sheriff Hilliard was sold. He sent a text to one Mr. Christie\u2019s aides, informing him that he intended to endorse the governor.\u201cI caved in sooner than I had anticipated,\u201d Sheriff Hilliard said.But the endorsements of him are increasingly hard to ignore: The Union Leader, a venerable voice for Republicans in state politics, portrayed Mr. Christie as the most prepared Republican seeking the party\u2019s nomination.For many, the motivation to endorse a candidate who remains such a long shot is a mix of conviction, exposure and flattery.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be wanted,\u201d said Ms. Sytek, the former House speaker.And wanted she was. Mr. Christie, a dedicated but playful texter who seems to prefer the medium\u2019s blunt brevity to endless phone conversations, has showered Ms. Sytek with messages. When she told the governor after a meeting that he was among her top three choices for president, he shot her a message as he headed to the airport.\u201cHappy to be in your top three. I want to be No. 1,\u201d Mr. Christie wrote.Follow-up messages soon arrived. \u201cTime to talk?\u201d he asked.Over all, more than 100 state leaders have endorsed Mr. Christie. Those who remain on the fence withstand a seemingly nonstop campaign to publicly side with him. During a house party in Bedford a few days ago, as he shook hands with voters standing around bowls of hummus and pita chips, Mr. Christie seized on a former mayor of Manchester, Raymond Wieczorek, whose endorsement is still up for grabs.\u201cMr. Mayor,\u201d he said, grasping Mr. Wieczorek\u2019s shoulders and smiling mischievously. The governor invoked his wife, Mary Pat Christie, who has wooed potential endorsers on her husband\u2019s behalf, with phone calls and meetings. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky the missis isn\u2019t here,\u201d Mr. Christie told him. \u201cShe asks about you aaalll the time. She\u2019s scouting for you.\u201dMr. Wieczorek laughed. Afterward, he explained that both Mr. and Mrs. Christie and his wife had courted him. \u201cShe\u2019s after me,\u201d he said dryly.Mr. Christie\u2019s attentions, however welcome, are not always reciprocated, at least not right away. Mr. Bradley said he had not yet replied to the governor\u2019s message from Thanksgiving, which arrived while the state senator was hiking.\u201cI\u2019ve been rude,\u201d he said, sheepishly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tensions in Iran After Nuclear Deal Grow in Hostility", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rouhani is insisting that the nuclear deal signed in July not only will create the basis for an end to Iran\u2019s prolonged economic isolation, but could be the start of new relations with the United States under certain conditions. Yet even his cautious statement of optimism has provoked a stormy reaction.The losing side\u2019s reaction has been harsh, as seen in a series of arrests of Iranian journalists and at least one Iranian-American accused of collaborating with Western powers or worse. Even some prominent conservatives who mistrust the United States but see practical benefits in having a better relationship with it have been criticized.The reaction has been stoked in some ways by Ayatollah Khamenei, who while endorsing the accord has also warned of what he calls an American desire to infiltrate Iran\u2019s culture, economics and politics.\u201cKhamenei is pre-empting any possible attempt to improve the official image of the U.S., which would threaten his and the regime\u2019s identity,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an Iran specialist and chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington, in an advisory to clients emailed last week. Mr. Kupchan said in the advisory that, at least for the next several months, he expected that \u201cthe surge in arrests, anti-U.S. rhetoric and possible new discrimination against U.S. consumer goods will hurt Iran\u2019s investment climate.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of entities that have a vested interest in the status quo,\u201d said Farhad Alavi, managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group in Washington, which specializes in trade sanctions law and has received many client inquiries about doing business in Iran once the nuclear agreement takes effect.Gary G. Sick, a Middle East scholar at Columbia University who was the White House\u2019s principal Iran aide during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and American hostage crisis that led to severed diplomatic relations, said he was not surprised by the heightened tensions.The Revolutionary Guards and other conservative elements that control the media, judiciary and the police, he said, \u201care really terrified that this agreement between the United States and Iran is a precursor to a breakdown in the old revolutionary leadership.\u201dMany of the figures who were in positions of power three decades ago, Mr. Sick said, are still around today, and they embrace anti-Americanism as a fundamental tenet.\u201cThis has become their dominant ideology they live by, and it\u2019s been very generous to them,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s face it. The Revolutionary Guard has a huge financial portfolio.\u201dThe political standoff created by the nuclear agreement, Mr. Sick said, \u201cis really very nasty.\u201dA major test of political will is expected in the February parliamentary elections, when supporters of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s approach will have an opportunity to express their preferences at the ballot box.Mr. Rouhani, elected two years ago on promises to end Iran\u2019s prolonged isolation and create a more open society, is regarded as a shrewd politician who knows his boundaries in the Iranian system. At the same time, perhaps sensing a showdown, Mr. Rouhani has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of the other side as the elections loom.In a speech on Nov. 8, Mr. Rouhani rebuked the conservative news media, saying its members acted as \u201cundercover police\u201d and enjoyed near impunity from the judiciary. He also called for more press freedom.His remarks were quickly denounced by hard-line adversaries.The Friday Prayer leader in Tehran, Kazem Sedighi, criticized government officials for their failure to create a \u201cresistance economy\u201d in Iran and end the country\u2019s \u201cdependence on foreigners.\u201dMr. Sedighi also accused Mr. Rouhani of inappropriate friendliness to foreigners. \u201cHe uses a different tone when he wants to attack people on our side, believers and those who serve the people,\u201d Mr. Sedighi said. \u201cWe also think that this kind of language does not befit a president.\u201dIn a sign that Mr. Rouhani\u2019s critics are widening their net, they have also unexpectedly targeted Ali Larijani, the Parliament leader, long considered a hard-liner himself.Mr. Larijani, who visited the United States in September to attend a conference, was among those who have suggested a possible prisoner exchange with the Americans that would free at least three Iranian-Americans, including Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post\u2019s Tehran correspondent.On Thursday, protesters painted an American flag on the street in front of Mr. Larijani\u2019s office.Mr. Alavi, a lawyer of Iranian-American descent, said he had received \u201call kinds of inquiries\u201d about doing business in Iran once the nuclear agreement takes effect and sanctions tied to the nuclear issue are lifted. He advised caution, partly because many other American sanctions limiting business with Iran will remain in place.The mood of anti-Americanism in Iran does not help, either.\u201cI\u2019m a little surprised at the severity of it,\u201d Mr. Alavi said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect \u2018Death to America\u2019 to stop, but I did expect the supreme leader to be a little less anti-U.S. He has a patent mistrust of the United States.\u201dThomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investing in Racehorses, Despite the Long Odds", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth Special SectionOne morning this past summer, Ahmed Zayat was in a stall at Del Mar racetrack in California alongside the 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.\u201cI was kind of cuddling with him, lying down on my back, giggling, and he starts licking me \u2026 it was hilarious,\u201d he said.For Mr. Zayat, 53, \u201clife is about moments, moments that go beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of those.\u201dYou could forgive Mr. Zayat his giddiness. After all, American Pharoah, a 3-year-old colt nurtured in Kentucky by his Zayat Stables had made the owner the envy of the racing world just weeks before at Belmont Park by becoming the first horse to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978.And at the end of October, American Pharoah won the $5 million Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, his final race before retirement.He earned a total of $8,650,300 for Mr. Zayat and was a boon for horse racing this year.Yet success in racing to Mr. Zayat isn\u2019t all about American Pharoah. He is among a handful of investors, wealthy and less so, who see diversification as the key to profits, or at least as a way to mitigate risk \u2014 hedging bets by owning multiple horses or through shared ownership. These hard-nosed owners are bucking the odds in what is usually seen as a fun and status-enhancing sport for people of means, but not a very good investment.It helps that sales of thoroughbreds are strong in a brightening economy, especially since American\u2019s Pharoah\u2019s victory, offering hope to an industry facing mortal competitive threats from lotteries and casino gambling in recent decades.Like others in the new crop of business-minded owners, Mr. Zayat is financing his passion for horse-racing with business acumen, not an inheritance. In 2002, Mr. Zayat sold the Al Ahram Beverages Company, the formerly Egyptian state-held beer company that he had privatized, to Heineken for $280 million, or four times what he paid for it in 1997. Mr. Zayat is the founder and still a major shareholder in Egypt\u2019s largest glass manufacturing company, MGM (Misr Glass Manufacturing).Other owners who believe they can flout the odds through diversification include Mike Repole, 46, a food and beverage entrepreneur and Vitaminwater co-founder, who owns dozens of thoroughbreds; the celebrity chef Bobby Flay, 50, who owns numerous horses; and the Under Armour founder Kevin Plank, 43, whose Sagamore Racing is \u201ca vast breeding operation with a team of 100 thoroughbreds and growing,\u201d said Hunter Rankin, its president.There is another way to diversify even if you don\u2019t have deep pockets. You might say the sport of kings has morphed into the sport of partnerships. Winnings and losses are increasingly shared by racing partnerships run by management firms like West Point Thoroughbreds, Team Valor International, Centennial Farms, Donegal Racing and Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners, which typically offer shares of racehorses starting at 5 percent.\u201cPartnerships are the core of the thoroughbred racing business,\u201d said Terry Finley, West Point Thoroughbreds founder and president. \u201cThe vast majority of our horses are syndicated with people who buy 5 or 10 percent of the horse, with an investment that ranges from $15,000 to $35,000.\u201dThat type of arrangement was vividly illustrated in the winner\u2019s circle at the 2011 Kentucky Derby when the wreath of brilliant red roses was thrown over the winner Animal Kingdom\u2019s damp neck. His owners making up Team Valor \u2014 all 20 of them \u2014 and family and friends, all stood laughing as the famous trophy was awarded, along with a check for $1,411,800. Animal Kingdom also won the 2013 Dubai World Cup and earned a total of $8.3 million in his racing career.At West Point Thoroughbreds, for example, the initial capital contribution covers the partner\u2019s interest in the horse, all acquisition expenses, equine mortality insurance, and training and maintenance costs through the end of the horse\u2019s 2-year-old season. The initial capital contribution does not cover expenses incurred in racing.Owners are billed quarterly for their percentage of an estimated $50,000 a year per horse stabled at a major racetrack for feed, stables, training, entry fees, farriers, insurance and transportation. Partners receive quarterly reports and statements detailing the income and expenses for their horses. And individual partnerships are generally set up as limited liability companies. In most cases, a partner wishing to sell his or her interest must be prepared to find a buyer.One of West Point Thoroughbred\u2019s stars, Liam\u2019s Map, owned in partnership with Teresa and Vincent Viola, for example, ended his career with a win in the $1,000,000 Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile.The partners were in Kentucky on race day to cheer on the 4-year-old. They received free admission to the owners\u2019 boxes and paddock privileges. \u201cWe encourage clients to visit the horses, meet the trainers and jockeys, and enjoy the behind-the-scenes happenings of the thoroughbred racing world. Many of our partners especially cherish time spent with their horses during morning training,\u201d Mr. Finley said.The size of syndicates and partnerships varies significantly among companies, but most partnerships usually have eight to 15 members, and the length of the investment typically runs two to five years.\u201cThere is no doubt we have had a surge of people coming to us since American Pharoah won the Triple Crown and getting involved,\u201d said Mr. Finley, who operates around 70 partnerships with 500 clients. \u201cIn the last eight years, our business has almost doubled in terms of clients and partnerships, and we will see residual effect for years to come of this year\u2019s Triple Crown victory.\u201d\u201cPeople who have sold a company or had a big score in the stock market will come into the business because they will think back to the electricity that was exhibited in the crowd on Belmont Stakes day, and they will say let me investigate that,\u201d he said.Partnerships can make money the same way anyone in the business does, through the sale of the horse, purse earnings, or by selling shares in the syndication of a stallion.And, of course, there are tax incentives. A provision of the law allows taxpayers to depreciate on a three-year schedule, as opposed to a seven-year schedule, racehorses 2 years old and younger when purchased and placed into service.In addition, there\u2019s \u201cbonus depreciation\u201d at 50 percent, which permits taxpayers to depreciate in the first year 50 percent of qualified property (in this case, thoroughbred racehorses) purchased and placed into service.\u201cThe owner/buyer of the horse must be actively involved in racing with the intention to make a profit and should have a business plan for doing so,\u201d said Joel B. Turner, a specialist in equine law at Frost Brown Todd in Louisville, Ky.\u201cThere are many hoops, though, to be jumped through in order to take advantage of those deductions. People who are high-net-worth individuals who are generating significant ordinary income can deduct a variety of expenses incurred in operating in a trade or business pursuant to the I.R.S. code, but they must be running it like a business, trying to make a profit, which is very challenging in the horse business.\u201dBut turning a profit is tricky. \u201cIt is so challenging to train and race a horse that is as delicate as a piece of fine crystal,\u201d Mr. Turner said.\u201cWe don\u2019t represent it as a tax investment,\u201d said Mr. Finley of West Point Thoroughbreds. \u201cThat should not be the reason you get in. People come to me and say \u2018I want to make money,\u2019 or \u2018I want to use this as a tax write-off,\u2019 and I say, \u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t advise this investment for either one.\u2019 \u201d\u201cYou have to be an optimist, and you\u2019ve got to be a dreamer in order to own horses,\u201d Mr. Finley added. \u201cWe are finding when we look at the demographics of people who are coming to us and inquiring about partnerships, we\u2019re seeing people who are getting a little bit older and have the wherewithal and have always loved the horse business. They watched the Derby and might have gone to the races when they were a kid with their mother, father, uncle or aunt and had an introduction, now they are looking for a whole new world to get into.\u201dConsider George Waldron, 72, of Hamden, Conn. Two years ago, Mr. Waldron, a retired lawyer and workers\u2019 compensation commissioner, paid about $13,000 for a 5 percent share in Commanding Curve, a 2-year-old colt, along with 14 other investors via a West Point Thoroughbred partnership.In the 1950s, he started watching horse races with his father. His father had emigrated from Ireland and had a passion for horses. He passed that feeling along to his son. \u201cI never thought I would be involved in horse racing. My friends and I would talk about getting a horse, but we never did.\u201dAfter Mr. Waldron retired in 2008, though, he spent considerable time researching various partnerships until he finally decided to give it a try in 2013.About a year later, Mr. Waldron stood in disbelief on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs, watching Commanding Curve finish second to California Chrome in the Kentucky Derby.In many ways, the 2014 Kentucky Derby shone a spotlight on partnerships. Aside from Commanding Curve\u2019s runner-up finish for West Point Thoroughbreds, the third-place finisher, Danza, was owned by Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners, and Wicked Strong was fourth for Centennial Farms, a partnership formed in 1982.The check for running second: $400,000. The partners ended up with about $300,000 after trainer, jockey and entry fees.Mr. Waldron now owns a small percentage of four horses and has spent roughly $40,000 upfront. And his racing luck has continued. This year, for the first time he stood in the winner\u2019s circle at Saratoga, with the 2-year-old Heated Verdict and a bunch of his friends who came to watch the race.\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream to be involved with a modest investment at the highest level of the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so thrilling, but for me, it is a hobby. I wouldn\u2019t think you would go into it for the money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb and Uber Mobilize Vast User Base to Sway Policy ", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the last few years, so-called sharing companies like Airbnb and Uber \u2014 online platforms that allow strangers to pay one another for a room or a ride \u2014 have established footholds in thousands of communities well before local regulators have figured out how to deal with them.Now, as cities grapple with the growth of these services and try to pass rules for how they should operate, the companies are fighting back by turning their users into a vast political operation that can be mobilized at any sign of a threat.Airbnb offered the latest and most vociferous example of this on Wednesday. Fresh off defeating a San Francisco measure that would have severely curtailed the company\u2019s business in its hometown, Airbnb staged a news conference that functioned as a warning shot to other cities thinking about proposing new regulations.The event was billed as a debriefing to discuss the defeat of Proposition F, which would have toughened existing rules for the service by, among other things, cutting the number of nights people could rent out rooms in their homes.But the briefing was less about the actual election than an attempt to turn the results into a mandate for the sharing economy.Chris Lehane, a Washington political operative who now serves as Airbnb\u2019s head of global policy and public affairs, framed Proposition F as a hotel-industry-led attack on the middle class.In this city of about 840,000 people, roughly $8 million was raised by groups opposed to Proposition F \u2014 about eight times the amount raised by the proposition\u2019s backers, according to records filed with the San Francisco Ethics Commission.Much of that money was spent mobilizing Airbnb hosts and users, Mr. Lehane said. Still, he repeatedly homed in on one of the company\u2019s most important talking points: Airbnb\u2019s victory was a win for the middle class.\u201cCities recognize where the world is going, right, they understand that you\u2019re either going to go forward or you\u2019re going to go backward,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand that in a time of economic inequality, this is a question of whose side are you on: Do you want to be on the side of the middle class, or do you want to be opposed to the middle class?\u201dAirbnb is preparing for more fights. Mr. Lehane said the company was working to organize voting blocs in other cities where it operates. By the end of next year, he said, the company has a goal of creating 100 \u201cclubs\u201d made up of Airbnb home-sharers \u2014 sort of like local unions.Companies like Airbnb and Uber have become multibillion-dollar companies by employing a kind of guerrilla growth strategy in which they set up a modest team of workers in a city and immediately start providing their services to the public, whether local laws allow them to or not.Uber, the ride-hailing behemoth now valued at more than $50 billion, operates in more than 300 cities around the world. Airbnb is available in 34,000 cities, and more than 60 million people have used the service. Investors value the company at $24 billion \u2014 higher than the hotel giant Marriott International\u2019s valuation.Those billions are predicated on lots of future growth. So both companies have hired seasoned political operatives to woo legislators and beat back regulatory threats.Mr. Lehane, a former political operative in the Clinton administration, was nicknamed the Master of Disaster for his no-holds-barred approach to winning political fights. David Plouffe, a former adviser to President Obama, is now a senior adviser to Uber and a member of its board.Mr. Lehane and Mr. Plouffe have both tried to frame their companies as middle-class saviors in a moment of economic anxiety and income inequality \u2014 themes that are playing out in the presidential election as well. Jeb Bush and other Republicans have bragged about their Uber rides on the campaign trail, praising these companies as the future of self-sufficient employment.Democrats have taken a more cautious approach. Hillary Rodham Clinton has repeatedly questioned what such employment means for workers\u2019 rights. Liberal economists who advise Mrs. Clinton have criticized such part-time labor as yet another means to chip away at workers\u2019 benefits.But such companies have a potent tool in the form of their platforms and smartphone apps, and they have shown little hesitation in using it to encourage their users to protest or vote.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio backed a proposal this year that would cap the number of Uber drivers on the road in Manhattan. Uber fought back by tweaking its smartphone app with a special \u201cde Blasio\u201d feature to show users in New York how hard it would be to get an Uber ride under those caps.\u201cThis is what Uber will look like in NYC if Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Uber cap bill passes,\u201d the app said.In the news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Lehane used a slide show to portray people who rent their property on Airbnb as a potent voting bloc that, like the members of a labor union, will reliably show up to vote, even in low-turnout elections like Tuesday\u2019s.\u201cThere is going to be more people doing home-sharing tomorrow than there are today, there is going to be more the day after that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is now a movement.\u201dMovement or not, some have already tried to curb these companies\u2019 growing political power. One of the other measures in Tuesday\u2019s election was Proposition C, a complicated proposal that would, among other things, make companies like Airbnb disclose any money they use to encourage hosts to show up at city meetings.And it is unlikely the Airbnb debate in San Francisco has ended with the election.On Tuesday, San Franciscans also elected Aaron Peskin, a longtime San Francisco progressive, to its Board of Supervisors. In an interview, Mr. Peskin promised the Airbnb issue would not go away.\u201cI think Airbnb would be well served to negotiate a workable, enforceable compromise\u201d to curb \u201cthe most egregious excesses that result in the loss of permanent, affordable rental housing stock,\u201d he said. \u201cOr this is likely to be a perennial issue at the ballot.\u201dAmy Chozick contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smaller Overseas Entrepreneurs Find China Too Frustrating", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 With the blessing of local officials, Amir Porat, an Israeli entrepreneur, set up a surgical supply factory in 2013 in China\u2019s coastal Jiangsu Province, training workers and taking orders. All he needed to start production was $250,000 of specially designed molding equipment from Israel.More than two years and $1 million in costs later, he is still waiting for the shipment. Chinese customs officials have demanded a permit for importing medical devices, although Mr. Porat insisted the equipment was ordinary manufacturing machinery. Last year, he decided to close the factory before it ever opened.\u201cWe had to pay salaries and rent,\u201d Mr. Porat said by telephone from Israel. \u201cWe\u2019re not a big company and we just couldn\u2019t afford to lose and lose.\u201dAt a time of slowing economic growth, Beijing has sought to assure foreign companies that China is a welcoming place to do business. In a speech to American business leaders in September, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, pledged to protect the rights of overseas investors and to provide \u201ca level playing field.\u201dBut the plight of Mr. Porat and other overseas entrepreneurs underscores some of the challenges small and midsize businesses face once they arrive. While China beckons with opportunity, cheaper labor and a huge market, it often frustrates with bewildering bureaucracy, entrenched corruption and a byzantine legal system, experts say.\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that fewer S.M.E.\u2019s are taking the jump and coming to China,\u201d said Chet Scheltema, a managing partner at Dezan Shira & Associates, a consulting firm that specializes in foreign direct investment in Asia, referring to small and medium-size enterprises. \u201cThey\u2019re a little more cautious and we\u2019re closing a surprising number of companies.\u201dBig cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have in recent years drawn thousands of expatriate entrepreneurs who have opened restaurants, branding consultancies and start-ups. They have helped transform an economy that had long been dominated by manufacturing, real estate development and government infrastructure spending.While China is generally a challenging environment in which to navigate, overseas entrepreneurs can be more vulnerable. Many lack the political muscle and deep pockets of multinational corporations or their domestic peers. They also may lack the guanxi, or personal connections, needed to overcome unforeseen bureaucratic hurdles.The problems run deep. In a recent survey of its members, the U.S.-China Business Council found that 97 percent of companies, including large multinationals, said they lacked the financing advantages, access to contracts and ease of licensing that state-owned enterprises received.\u201cWhen you talk to other expats about setting up a business, one of the first things they tell you is \u2018be careful,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Reza Afshar, the British founder of an e-commerce company in China that sells face masks, air purifiers and other pollution protection products. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got a story of someone who\u2019s been burned in the Chinese business world.\u201dMr. Afshar said he failed to to see the warning signs. The joint venture with a Chinese friend, he later discovered, was actually a fully Chinese-owned business. Mr. Afshar was listed as the minority shareholder, though he paid 70 percent of the registration costs.As the business grew, his partner, according to Mr. Afshar, began removing himself from daily operations and then departed on a string of overseas vacations. Mr. Afshar was left to deal with clients, suppliers and employees, he said.\u201cIt was like if we were a couple and when the baby was six months old he goes to the pub every day and then eventually runs off,\u201d he said. Then, Mr. Afshar said, the partner threatened to sabotage the company unless he was bought out \u2014 while still receiving 50 percent of future profits.The partner, AJ Song, described their partnership in more equitable terms, but confirmed that he used his advantages as a Chinese national to bargain hard for what he felt he deserved. \u201cI said if he wants to end ugly, I can take it all away because all the connections are mine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that much for me because if I want to do the same business again, I can.\u201dMr. Afshar eventually sold the company and has since moved back to London. He has no plans to return. \u201cThe risk of getting played in China is just too high,\u201d he said.The Chinese government has tried in recent years to improve the business environment by upgrading legal protections. But critics say political connections and corruption continue to undermine the law.James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said concerns remained about interference by the authorities in court proceedings. \u201cFull accountability will only come with an independent judiciary that provides effective oversight and renders decisions without fear of retaliation or without influence by the political process,\u201d he wrote in an email.For many international business owners, legal disputes do not always resolve favorably, even with clear legal protections in place.Neil Schmid had high hopes when, in 2012, he arrived in Beijing to start a Chinese social enterprise under DKT, a global health organization that provides contraceptives to more than 50 million people in the developing world. But instead of focusing on selling condoms, Mr. Schmid had to deal with a series of disputes involving employees.He said he was forced to fire a sales manager whom he suspected of embezzling $60,000, as well as her replacement, who he believed forged documents. The company\u2019s marketing manager later admitted to Mr. Schmid that he had used the editing software Adobe Photoshop to disguise his true identity and to falsify his transcript from an elite American university after Mr. Schmid noticed discrepancies.\u201cIt was like living with a snake under your desk,\u201d Mr. Schmid said.Resolving the embezzlement case through China\u2019s legal system, he quickly learned, was not simply a matter of providing evidence. The Chinese authorities have wide discretion over whether to accept a case and there are no clear standards regulating what kinds of cases they must investigate.\u201cChinese police seldom accept cases like ours, in which the amount of money involved is not too much and there is no pressure or attention to it,\u201d said Sun Wenjie, a lawyer hired by Mr. Schmid to handle the matter.Mr. Sun urged Mr. Schmid to pressure the sales manager to \u201crepent\u201d and return the money. The sales manager ultimately agreed to do so, but was left with her reputation intact. She still lists DKT on her LinkedIn profile.Reached by phone, Li Shiying, the former sales manager, declined to answer questions about the dispute. \u201cThe case is closed,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I lost, I lost.\u201dWhile companies can turn to arbitration, this form of dispute resolution has its own issues.Though arbitration is required by law to conclude within 60 days, many cases take up to eight months. \u201cWhen you ask them why it takes this long, they simply answer \u2018too many cases to handle,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Shen Binti, a labor lawyer in Beijing.For many entrepreneurs, the shifting legal terrain is proving increasingly difficult to navigate. \u201cPolice don\u2019t want to write up a report, courts don\u2019t want any more cases and the government encourages arbitration,\u201d said Mark Natkin, an American business consultant in Beijing. \u201cIn that respect it can be an uncomfortable environment for a company that\u2019s not ready to adapt to legal uncertainties.\u201dJennifer Eden, an Australian restaurateur, said she had lost three businesses to locals when contracts were not enforced. In one instance, she said, a landlord doubled the rent in a lease for a coffee shop she and her Brazilian business partner opened.\u201cThe police came and said, \u2018If you can\u2019t afford double the rent then you shouldn\u2019t be in business,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Eden said. At another restaurant they owned \u2014 with a five-year contract \u2014 the landlady drilled through the locks. \u201cShe leased it to someone else and gave them the key with all our equipment inside,\u201d she said. \u201cOur contract meant nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Choice Facing China as Its Currency Becomes More Global", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsBut they will soon find that the step raises more questions than it answers about China\u2019s role among nations and that the hardest decisions lie ahead. Being a world financial hegemon comes with meaningful costs, in addition to benefits.The direct implications of the I.M.F. decision are narrow. The renminbi (also known as the yuan) will join the dollar, euro, yen and pound in an elite group of currencies. But if you\u2019re not a reserve manager for some national treasury, seeking to build emergency savings to buffer the vicissitudes of global finance, the direct impact of China\u2019s inclusion in \u201cspecial drawing rights\u201d is limited.The big question for the future is whether this is akin to what happened about a century ago, when the United States dollar was gradually supplanting the British pound as the predominant currency for global trade and finance. This development was a crucial piece of the nation\u2019s rise to superpower status. Conversely, China\u2019s leaders in the years ahead could decide that being a world financial hegemon carries too many costs, in which case the renminbi will be more like the British pound or Japanese yen \u2014 important currencies, certainly, but not so important as to create continuing political and economic burdens on their nations.The decision for China is whether it is content to have a global reserve currency, or if it aspires for the renminbi to one day be as important to trade and finance as the dollar is now. There are both benefits and costs in being the leading global reserve currency \u2014 the default currency for world trade and financial transactions, the most widely used unit for savings, and so on. Understanding these pluses and minuses is essential to understanding the tensions China faces as it decides how far it wishes to go down the road of financial liberalization and leadership in the world economy.Remember when the global financial system nearly melted down in 2008 because of problems centered in the United States housing market and banking system? That\u2019s the kind of crisis that in most countries would prompt a currency crisis and sharp outflow of capital, making a dire situation worse.In that miserable fall of 2008, though, the dollar actually soared. Treasury bonds were in such hot demand that American interest rates plummeted. The United States\u2019 role as the bedrock of the global financial system was a crucial reason that a terrible situation didn\u2019t become worse; when things went bad, the United States \u2014 and especially its government debt \u2014 were a beacon of safety.Even in times of noncrisis, the country that is the leading global reserve currency will tend to have a stronger currency and lower interest rates than it would otherwise, thanks to continuing purchases of its assets by individuals, companies and other nations.Then there\u2019s geopolitics. Ownership of the premier global reserve currency gives a country sway in global politics and security that are hard to obtain any other way. In the last few years, the United States has enforced economic sanctions on countries including Russia, Iran and North Korea, and has waged outright financial war against what it considered to be terrorist groups.Surely China might like to have a similar scale of influence in global affairs, but to do so it would need the renminbi to be as fundamental to finance as the dollar. Which raises the reasons not to do that.Essentially, the price the United States pays for that role is having fewer tools to manage its domestic economy.China has long restricted the ability of businesses and individuals to transfer funds in and out of the country, helping it prevent huge economic swings as investors\u2019 interest in investing in China waxes and wanes. It has made exports central to its economic development strategy, using market interventions and those capital controls to keep its currency undervalued relative to fundamentals, at least until recently.Contrast that with the United States. Pretty much anyone, anywhere can buy a United States Treasury bond, for any reason. The dollar rises or falls based on market forces, and on net is probably stronger than it otherwise would be because of the reserve currency role. That leaves American exporters at a perpetual disadvantage.Chinese officials seemed caught by surprise this summer when decisions to liberalize trading in their currency and prop up their domestic stock market caused widespread ripples through global markets. This is one of the more subtle costs of becoming a major player on the global financial scene: Your actions don\u2019t affect just you.Part of the reason the United States dollar is so important is that the United States has legal, political and monetary institutions that make international investors and business people feel confident they can always get easy access to money traded in dollars. The United States government has control in some areas (economic sanctions for geopolitical foes, for example) because it gives up control in many others (exchange rate, capital flows, legal protections for foreign investors).The question for China\u2019s political leaders is whether that trade-off is worth it.Still, financial history moves slowly, and Monday\u2019s action from the I.M.F. is one more baby step toward China\u2019s financial pre-eminence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s Rise, China and Myanmar Face New Relationship", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn the June visit, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was polite, paid deference to China as an important country and did not live up to fears that she might refer to democratic principles or her fellow Nobel Peace laureate, Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese writer who is serving 11 years in prison.But whether China, which deftly read the pre-election tea leaves, can arrange a new relationship with Myanmar under the newly elected government is another matter.Even Myanmar\u2019s military-dominated government has not done China many favors. It canceled the building of the partly constructed dam, and to the annoyance of Beijing, it has in the past four years turned increasingly toward the United States.As of Thursday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party, the National League for Democracy, had won most of the 491 seats contested in the election, with results still trickling in. After the election\u2019s results were clear, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, apparently seeking to put the best face on the outcome, said on Wednesday that Beijing was pleased the election had gone smoothly and that China would continue to support Myanmar. China is Myanmar\u2019s largest trading partner, by far.In response, Myanmar\u2019s foreign minister, U Wunna Maung Lwin, who met with Mr. Wang in southern China on Wednesday, said that Myanmar would maintain its friendly stance toward China.Beneath the diplomatic courtesies of the two foreign ministers lies an awkward situation for China.Myanmar, also known as Burma, has traditionally hewed to a neutral, nonaligned foreign policy. That changed under the brunt of more than two decades of economic sanctions from the United States and other Western countries, forcing Myanmar to tilt closer to Beijing.However, since 2011, the military-dominated government has turned toward the United States, although falling far short of embracing Washington\u2019s demands on improving human rights and ending war against ethnic rebels.The shift away from China came after some particularly heavy-handed tactics from Beijing \u2014 including the unpopular plans for the dam \u2014 and the contrasting appeal of the West. Myanmar indicated it did not want business as usual with Beijing.President Obama has visited Myanmar twice; Mr. Xi, perhaps China\u2019s best-traveled leader, has not been there since assuming office in 2012, a telling sign of the cool relations.\u201cChina may feel that Myanmar has not shown the kind of respect it deserves, and that the current government has become too close to the West,\u201d said Thant Myint-U, author of \u201cWhere China Meets India: Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia.\u201dThe new government, he said, would most likely seek improved relations all around, including with the United States, and especially with China, its large and wealthy neighbor.In the last year, China has been disappointed that Myanmar has not shown more enthusiasm for its new infrastructure initiative, called \u201cOne Belt, One Road,\u201d which encompasses the financing of railroads, roads and pipelines that would connect China with most of the globe via Southeast Asia and Central Asia.Instead of viewing the program as a boost for its underdeveloped economy, Mr. Thant said, Myanmar has viewed the Chinese overtures as infringements on its northern border with China.\u201cThere has been a longstanding reluctance by Myanmar to open up its borders \u2014 there are a mix of security concerns, inertia and more excitement about developing relations with the rest of the world,\u201d he said.Most recently, China proved to be unhelpful to Myanmar\u2019s government by derailing a nationwide cease-fire among a mix of ethnic rebel groups. Leaders in the nominally civilian but military-dominated leadership of Myanmar had backed the deal in an effort to end decades of conflict in the north of the country and to improve its prospects in the recent elections.China has long supported two of the rebel groups, the United Wa State Army and the Kachin Independence Organization, as a way of retaining influence in the northern part of Myanmar and keeping illicit timber and jade flowing across the border into the southern province of Yunnan. Militia and criminal networks move freely between the two countries while trafficking in narcotics, minerals and animals.Last month, the Wa and Kachin fighters refused to sign a cease-fire agreement involving a range of rebel groups. Western diplomats in Myanmar said that China had pushed the two groups to stay out of the deal as a way to keep leverage over whoever gained power in the elections. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry denied that the two rebel groups had acted on instructions from Beijing.During the election campaign in Myanmar, foreign affairs were rarely mentioned, and China was not an issue.Although Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was diplomatic during her June visit, she is not popular or trusted among the Chinese leadership, one Chinese expert on Myanmar said.\u201cChina does not like her, and there are reasons,\u201d said Lin Xixing, a professor at Jinan University in Guangdong Province in southern China. \u201cHer father helped the Japanese fight the Chinese military in World War II. She has been close to the West, grew up in India and married a foreigner in Europe.\u201dEven so, the Chinese leadership may be inclined to take a pragmatic view of the relationship. More than anything else, Myanmar needs economic growth, and China is best positioned to provide it, Mr. Lin said. Moreover, he added, she had become more of a politician and less of an idealist.\u201cShe has to fix ties with China because she needs the economy to work,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cThose who voted for her are poor people, and they won\u2019t have any patience with her if she screws up the economy.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}

He was 85.The cause was heart failure, his daughter Martha Samuelson said.Professor Scarf\u2019s most enduring legacy was an algorithm \u2014 named for him \u2014 that enables economists to evaluate how markets, companies and even households would respond to fundamental changes in tax policy or trade strategies.\u201cEconomists and policy makers have long been interested in assessing the economic impacts on gross domestic product or incomes from major policy initiatives such as fundamental tax reform or trade liberalization,\u201d Professor Hubbard wrote. \u201cThe Scarf algorithm made much of modern policy analysis possible.\u201dProfessor Scarf had a comparable impact on the business sector. Over five decades, he devised pioneering theories on how adjusting prices, inventory and other variables could maximize profits.Professor Scarf\u2019s first exposure to the economy was far from abstract: His father\u2019s clothing store went bust during the Depression.Herbert Eli Scarf was born in Philadelphia on July 25, 1930, the son of Louis Scarf and the former Lene Elkman, Jewish immigrants from Ukraine and Russia.Motivated by that book, he began studying higher math on his own, astounding his high school teachers when he won a statewide math tournament run by Temple University in 1947.He went on to enroll at Temple, receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1951.

Or Burberry Prorsum (the name of the runway line, which most consumers could neither pronounce nor spell)! No more separate design teams!Soon it will all be Burberry, period.(Of course, it\u2019s very likely you never realized there was a difference, but that\u2019s the point.)Mr. Bailey also announced the construction of a factory in Leeds, England. Due for completion in 2019 and at a cost of 50 million pounds ($77 million), it is expected to employ more than 1,000 people, clearly a boon to the local economy and to Burberry\u2019s identification as the dominant British luxury brand. But, it\u2019s the one-line thing that I think has the most far-reaching implications.It\u2019s kind of a big deal, not just because of the logistical transformation involved, but also because it is a repudiation of a strategy that has shaped fashion since the \u201cbridge\u201d line became a \u201csecond\u201d line around the turn of the millennium.\u201cWe will still have the wide range of products that we have today \u2014 they will all just be known as Burberry, as part of a unified, consistent luxury brand,\u201d Mr. Bailey said in a speech. \u201cWe believe that this will make us simpler and more intuitive for our customers. And we are confident that this will make us both more productive and more efficient as a business.\u201dIt is an eerily familiar rationale after the one offered by Sebastian Suhl, chief executive of Marc Jacobs, about the Marc by Marc Jacobs decision. To paraphrase: 1) People shop high/low, elitist/accessible, these days, especially online, so why should we create and organize our offerings differently? 2) They were confused by all the different names anyway.Julian Payne, a spokesman for Burberry said that despite the consolidation of Brit, London and Prorsum, no layoffs are planned, and the overall size of the product offerings and the price mix would not change; just the names (and the names of stores \u2014 there are a few Burberry Brit-only stores, which will now become Burberry stores).If you are finding it hard to get your head around all of this \u2014 or if, in fact, you had not even realized that Burberry had three collections for both women and men \u2014 just take a gander at the holiday campaign.Mr. Corden and Romeo Beckham are in Burberry London, for example; Ms. Campbell, Michelle Dockery and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are in Burberry Prorsum gowns; and James Bay is in a Burberry Brit leather jacket and denim trousers \u2014 though I defy anyone to figure it out for themselves. I know only because I asked the brand what was what, not because I could tell the difference.As it happened, earlier in the day I had called Mr. Corden to talk about his role in the campaign, and he said something that supports the idea that the shift to a single line is consistent with the perception of Burberry in the public eye. (He said a lot more, but while quite pointed, it was a little off topic; the outtakes from our conversation will appear in another piece.)Mr. Corden said that he had agreed to do the campaign because he was a friend of Mr. Bailey\u2019s, and that he actually mostly wears Burberry on \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d he hosts on CBS, since, \u201cit is one of two brands that don\u2019t discriminate against people of size.\u201d (The other brand, because I know you want to know, is Lanvin.)One brand, one label \u2014 many derivations. This increasingly looks less like a trend and more like the industry\u2019s future.Advertisement"}

Witnesses said the attacker had then tried to force his way into the prayer room, but worshipers blocked the door.Soon after, in the Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank, a Palestinian man opened fire with a submachine gun from a car as he passed vehicles stopped in traffic. He then crashed his car into another vehicle, according to witnesses and police reports. Three people were killed and several others were injured.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote on his Facebook page, \u201cBehind these terrorist attacks stands radical Islam, which seeks to destroy us, the same radical Islam that struck in Paris and threatens Europe.\u201dThe victims of the Tel Aviv attack were identified as Aharon Yesayev, 32, and Reuven Aviram, 51, both from central Israel.Of the three victims in the West Bank, an Israeli man who died was identified as Yaakov Don, 51, a resident of a nearby settlement who worked in education and was a father of four. The Palestinian victim was named as Shadi Arafa, 24, an employee of a Palestinian cellphone company.Acquaintances of the American victim, Ezra Schwartz, from Sharon, Mass., said he had been spending a gap year in Israel between high school and college and was participating in a program of study and volunteering at a yeshiva in the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh. On the day he was killed, according to Ynet, an Israeli news site, Mr. Schwartz and fellow students had distributed food and candy to Israeli soldiers in the Etzion district and visited a memorial for three Israeli teenagers who were kidnapped and killed in June 2014 after they hitched a ride near where Thursday\u2019s shooting attack took place.The police identified the assailant in the Tel Aviv stabbing as a father of five from the village of Dura in the southern West Bank. The Israeli news media said he had a permit to work in Israel and was employed at a restaurant near the scene of the attack. He was overpowered by passers-by and taken into custody.Shimon Vaknin, who was praying in the synagogue at the time, told Israeli television that a victim fell inside the room, covered in blood. He said that 15 worshipers blocked the door as the attacker tried to get inside, shouting in Arabic.\u201cWe always agreed to confidence-building measures with the Palestinians and to help with their economy,\u201d an Israeli minister, Yuval Steinitz, said in a briefing with foreign reporters this month. But Mr. Steinitz said Israel expected action from Palestinian leaders to end what he described as incitement to violence in the news media.West Bank cities have many smartphone users and a burgeoning high-tech industry, but Palestinian carriers have been forced to make do with 2G data bandwidth, which was introduced to the area in 1998.Under the interim peace accords of the mid-1990s, Israel controls the allocation of radio frequencies in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule. For the Palestinians, the lack of 3G service has been a sore point and, they say, a symbol of how the Israeli occupation has held them back.Israeli officials said that 3G services would most likely be available to Palestinian carriers within the next few weeks. It was not clear when, or if, the same service would be made available in Gaza, the Palestinian coastal territory dominated by Hamas, the Islamic militant group.Two Palestinian cellular companies, Jawwal and Wataniya, operate in the Palestinian areas.Durgham Maraee, the chief executive of Wataniya Mobile, welcomed the news and said that the company had held a license to operate 3G services since its inception in 2006. \u201cHowever we were not able to offer these services,\u201d he said, \u201cdue to the fact that the frequencies were not assigned by the Israeli side until now.\u201dAmmar Akel, the chief executive of Palestine Telecommunications Group, of which Jawwal is a subsidiary, said, \u201cWe have been asking for this for more than five years.\u201d Israel estimates that the introduction of 3G will increase investment in the West Bank by $120 million.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mauricio Macri Took Detour From Life as Scion to Argentine Presidency", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut then rogue police officers kidnapped him and placed him in a coffin on their way to a hide-out.Likening the experience to surviving a terminal illness, Mr. Macri, now 56, credits the kidnapping with an awakening, putting him on a course that would ultimately lead him to politics.He eventually became the mayor of Buenos Aires, and on Sunday, he defied early expectations by winning Argentina\u2019s presidential race, upending the nation by defeating the Peronists, who have dominated politics here for decades.At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Macri emphasized how his administration would differ from that of Mrs. Kirchner on foreign policy. He announced an effort to get Venezuela \u2014 a close ally of Argentina under the Kirchners \u2014 suspended from the Mercosur regional trade bloc over claims of the infringement of civil liberties there.And he made clear his desire to revoke an agreement struck under Mrs. Kirchner with Iran to jointly investigate the 1994 bombing here of a Jewish center, which killed 85 people. Some investigators have accused senior Iranian officials, including a former Iranian president, of planning and financing the attack, making the agreement to give Iran a direct role in the investigation a political lightning rod.Mr. Macri has also announced plans to improve diplomatic ties with the United States, which became strained in recent years over Argentina\u2019s international debts and Washington\u2019s sway in the hemisphere.\u201cThere is little doubt that Argentina\u2019s relations with the U.S. under a Macri administration will become friendlier,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington.Mrs. Kirchner stepped down because of term limits, but her divisive governing style had enraged many voters, one of the factors that appeared to hurt her party\u2019s candidate, Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer.After winning by a narrow margin, Mr. Macri vowed to \u201cbuild bridges\u201d with rivals in an effort to achieve a more conciliatory leadership approach.For one of his most pressing challenges, overhauling a sluggish economy, Mr. Macri said he would form a six-member economic cabinet to unwind currency controls and reduce export tariffs.Before entering politics with the formation of a center-right party in 2003, Mr. Macri cut his teeth in the cutthroat world of Argentine soccer. After his kidnapping, he remained for a few years in leadership roles in the construction and auto manufacturing business empire assembled by his Italian-born father, Franco Macri, before winning an election as the president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina\u2019s most popular soccer teams.The team, which allows fans who pay for membership to vote for a president every four years, was mired in financial troubles when he took over in 1995. But he pressured the leadership to reduce the team\u2019s debts and start promoting promising younger players.\u201cAt Boca, it didn\u2019t go well at first,\u201d said Orlando Salvestrini, 67, a businessman who met Mr. Macri when the president-elect was an 18-year-old summer office worker in Franco Macri\u2019s holding company. Later, Mr. Salvestrini went on to accompany Mauricio Macri during his 12-year tenure at Boca Juniors, chiefly occupying the post of the team\u2019s treasurer.\u201cHe was the arbiter, and it translated into one of the team\u2019s most famous triumphs,\u201d Mr. Salvestrini said of the eventual victory over Spain\u2019s Real Madrid during one of the most glory-laden periods of Boca Juniors, setting the stage for Mr. Macri\u2019s successful mayoral campaign in 2007. \u201cBoca helped him mature and grow as a manager.\u201dWhile presiding over Boca Juniors gave Mr. Macri a chance to establish his own name, he still has to contend with claims that his privileged upbringing makes him unaware of the challenges faced by ordinary Argentines. At a televised debate with Mr. Scioli, critics accused him of dismissively smirking at his opponent.\u201cIt provokes fear when you see Mauricio Macri expressing himself quite so arrogantly,\u201d Maurice Closs, the governor of Misiones Province and an opponent of Mr. Macri, said in an interview.Mr. Macri has sought to soften his image by explaining that he plans to maintain popular antipoverty programs introduced by the Kirchners since 2003.\u201cIt is one of the best books I have read in my life,\u201d Mr. Macri said.In his personal life, Mr. Macri also mixes in exclusive circles, driving perceptions of him as out of touch with some voters.\u201cI don\u2019t like Macri at all,\u201d said Guadalupe Berlanga, 33, an English teacher here in Buenos Aires. \u201cPrivileges should not be for just a chosen few,\u201d she said, saying she feared a wave of privatizations. \u201cMacri voters don\u2019t understand the reality because they come from money.\u201dIn his personal life, Mr. Macri married his third wife, Juliana Awada, 41, a fashion designer of Lebanese and Syrian descent, in 2010; they have one young daughter.

Children, the elderly and communities living in poverty are among the most vulnerable.Science shows that climate change will affect human health across the world. From diminished air quality and degradation of food and water supplies to increasing levels of allergens and catastrophic weather events, we will experience a number of worsening health threats during our lifetimes. Click ahead to learn more about specific risks.While many infectious diseases were once all but eliminated from the U.S., climate change could help them make a comeback. As temperatures rise, rainfall patterns change and summers become longer, disease-carrying insects remain active longer, across wider areas.For example, though once rare, nearly 4,000 cases of Dengue Fever \u2014 a mosquito-borne tropical disease \u2014 were reported in the U.S. between 1995 and 2005. Lyme disease \u2014 transmitted primarily via certain tick species \u2014 could expand throughout the U.S. and into Canada, as temperatures warm. West Nile virus, which first entered the U.S. in 1999, expanded rapidly westward across the country. By 2005, over 16,000 cases had been reported.Climate change is making summer days hotter and stretching the duration of heat waves. As temperatures rise, so are the number of heat-related illnesses, emergency room visits and deaths. Extreme heat causes the most harm among elderly people and young children.In the U.S., an average of 400 deaths per year are directly related to heat, and an estimated 1,800 die from illnesses made worse by heat, including heat exhaustion, heat stroke, cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. In 2006, for example, deadly heat waves swept across most of the nation, hitting California the hardest. The state saw an additional 16,000 emergency room visits during the two-week heat wave. Air Pollution: Smog, Smoke and Pollen Rising temperatures can make smog pollution worse and increase the number of \u201cbad air days\u201d. This puts many at risk for irritated eyes, noses and lungs and is particularly dangerous for people with respiratory diseases such as asthma.Ozone smog forms when pollution from vehicles, factories and other sources reacts with sunlight and heat. Increasing temperatures speed this process and result in more smog. Added to the mix are ragweed and other airborne allergens, which are expected to worsen as rising CO2 levels cause plants to produce more pollen. Also, as dry areas get dryer, wildfire risks go up and smoke from burning landscapes worsens air quality.Climate change has contributed to a rise in extreme weather events such as higher-intensity hurricanes and heavier rainfalls, putting more regions at risk for devastating floods. Flooding can cause a range of health impacts: death and injury, contaminated drinking water, hazardous material spills, increased populations of disease-carrying insects and rodents, moldy houses, and community disruption and displacement.As rains become heavier, streams, rivers, and lakes can overflow, increasing the risk of water-borne pathogens flowing into drinking water sources. Downpours can also damage critical infrastructure like sewer and solid waste systems, triggering sewage overflows that can spread into local waters.Climate change has contributed to a rise in extreme weather events such as higher-intensity hurricanes and heavier rainfalls, putting more regions at risk for devastating floods.

Downpours can also damage critical infrastructure like sewer and solid waste systems, triggering sewage overflows that can spread into local waters.Hurricane Sandy was not only notable for the devastation it wreaked across New York and New Jersey. It also prompted public statements by political leaders such as Michael Bloomberg, then New York City\u2019s mayor, about the link between climate change and severe storms such as Sandy.\u201cIntense storms are likely to increase,\u201d and sea level rise means more dangerous storm surges, Mr. Bloomberg wrote in a 2013 essay for CNN.com. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just storms,\u201d he added. Longer, hotter heat waves and worse droughts add to the risks, too.As the catalog of perils grows longer, it is also emerging that in the United States, as in many parts of the world, the poorest and most underserved communities tend to be at higher risk. They are less able to invest in resilience measures and disproportionately hit by the effects of a changing climate.As the catalog of climate perils grows\u2026 the poorest and most underserved communities tend to face higher risks.For example, new data from Climate Central, a New Jersey-based research group, shows that the poorest residents in the Gulf states \u2014 Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama \u2014 are exposed to a disproportionate threat from coastal flooding as a result of rising sea levels, with 75,000 people in vulnerable communities living in areas unprotected by levees.In 2011 and 2012, most of the extreme weather \u2014 from floods and droughts to wildfires and tornadoes \u2014 hurt people in counties where annual household incomes are below the US median of $51,914, according to the Center for American Progress, a think tank.For David Burke, the evidence is clear. As director of field operations at Team Rubicon, a national network of veterans that provide volunteer relief support after natural disasters, Mr. Burke has seen at first hand how severe weather events affect low-income communities.\u201cTheir homes are less ready to withstand the severity of the disasters we\u2019re seeing and in some cases the frequency has increased to the point where you see multiple floods in one area,\u201d says Mr. Burke. \u201cSome might make it through the first but then the second is what causes the major impact.\u201dAs the catalog of climate perils grows\u2026 the poorest and most underserved communities tend to face higher risks.He says that while severe storms are what hit the headlines, climate change is also leading to an increase in smaller but nevertheless devastating weather events across the US. In 2014, for example, a wildfire in the town of Pateros, Washington, destroyed more than 250,000 acres and 300 homes. \u201cSmaller disasters that don\u2019t get attention are impacting populations with a frequency that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he says.While low-income communities are often the worst affected, investments in climate resilience such as levee fortification may be focused on areas of economic importance.\u201cRight away that discounts the value of the people who are low income and communities of color,\u201d says Jacqui Patterson, director of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program at the NAACP, the civil rights organization. \u201cThe economic impact might not be as great, but on them it will be total.\u201dLoss of income is the first risk. Long-term changes in climate that affect agricultural yields are likely to lead to job losses for farm workers. Meanwhile, low-income communities may take bigger economic hits than others during a climate-related disaster.\u201cIf you have difficultly getting to your place of employment because transportation is down or your housing situation has changed and you don\u2019t have a permanent relationship with an employer, it\u2019s more likely that you would lose income,\u201d says Danielle Baussan, managing director of energy policy at the Center for American ProgressWhile more affluent residents might choose to live elsewhere, relocating is harder for low-income communities. And those with lower levels of disposable income are also less well equipped to become more resilient in the face of climate threats.Many, for example, struggle to afford the heating and air-conditioning needed to help them survive more extreme temperatures. For older people with pre-existing conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, this puts them at higher risk of illness or death.People with lower incomes may also put off making household repairs that could better prepare them for extreme weather. \u201cYou have a roof with a 10-year lifespan and you can\u2019t afford to fix it right now,\u201d says Ms. Baussan, \u201cThen a hurricane comes along and the house is more damaged than the houses of people who can afford regular maintenance.\u201dInability to afford insurance also leads to greater difficulties in recovering from climate-related events. \u201cUsually when we go into a community we find pockets of folks that don\u2019t have any insurance and no other way to get their lives back together,\u201d says Mr. Burke.Cities are where climate change poses the greatest risk to human and economic well-being, because that\u2019s where most Americans live. Urban areas are home to about four in five of us, and continue to outgrow suburban and rural areas.Cities are also home to most of the nation\u2019s poor and minority communities, putting these populations at greater risk to heat waves, extreme storms, sea level rise and other climate impacts. Explore how climate change will impact these cities:Cities are where climate change poses the greatest risk to human and economic well-being, because that\u2019s where most Americans live.

Explore how climate change will impact these cities:When it comes to climate change, the impacts are twofold. First, as temperatures rise, they increase the frequency and intensity of severe weather events that bring with them the destruction homes and businesses.What\u2019s more, the industrial activity driving those temperature increases \u2014 the carbon emissions of manufacturing facilities, power plants and transport hubs such as rail networks and ports \u2014 also generate pollution that has immediate and ongoing effects and that disproportionately affect low-income communities and minority groups.\u201cConnecting the dots between climate change and people\u2019s health and the health of the most vulnerable among us is super important,\u201d says Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist with the health and environment program of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cAnd far too many people don\u2019t realize that right now, climate change is affecting people\u2019s health.\u201dIn disadvantaged communities, there may already be high rates of asthma, obesity and diabetes. \u201cAll which make anyone more vulnerable to the effects of heat and air pollution,\u201d she says.For example, as a share of total population, more African Americans live within a 30-mile radius of a coal-fired power plant than others \u2014 68 percent versus about 56 percent of the white population \u2014 which can have a devastating effect on health. \u201cAfrican American children are three times as likely to enter hospital and twice as likely to die from asthma attacks [as whites],\u201d says Ms. Patterson.The presence of these families in polluted areas is no coincidence. These are the neighborhoods where accommodation tends to be more affordable.Other factors can lead to greater exposure for these communities, says Ms. Patterson. \u201cSome of the polluting facilities come into these communities because there\u2019s a perception that they\u2019ll get less pushback,\u201d she says.Among minority groups such as blacks and Latinos this is exacerbated by the fact that they are underrepresented in local politics, so their views may not be considered when it comes to permitting decisions for power plants and other industrial facilities.For this reason, she stresses the importance of equipping communities to advocate for themselves. And part of this involves highlighting the current effects of climate change on daily life rather than limiting the conversation to melting ice caps or the plight of polar bears.\u201cIt needs to be couched in real life challenges people are already facing,\u201d says Ms. Patterson. \u201cWe talk about existing problems and how climate change exacerbates those problems.\u201dDr. Knowlton argues that action now will save lives. She cites a recent study estimating that, of 200,000 heat-related deaths occurring in big U.S. cities by the end of the century as a result of climate change, 22,000 could be avoided by working to lower greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cSo we\u2019ll get the future benefit and the benefit right now,\u201d she says.\u201cSmaller disasters that don\u2019t get attention are impacting populations with a frequency that we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d \u2014David Burke, director of field operations at Team RubiconIn addition, solutions need to be designed to meet the incomes of those affected by climate change. This might include the expansion of affordable flood insurance, new micro-finance, micro-insurance and health insurance products.Subsidies and incentives will also be essential to help families cope with higher utility bills due to extreme heat and cold as well as to afford measures that will build resilience into their housing and other local infrastructure.Climate change also presents economic opportunities, including new jobs for technicians in installing energy efficiency equipment in residential and office buildings and for those working on the construction of climate-resilient infrastructure or carbon-neutral housing. Investments in renewable energy, such as solar and wind power installations, in low-income communities provide similar potential.Explore the other panels to browse solutionsBetter information about the risks communities face and the links between climate change and security, health and income can equip residents to advocate for themselves.Affordable flood insurance as well as innovative microfinance, micro-insurance and health insurance products can provide a safety net for low-income communities that makes it easier to recover after disaster strikes.Subsidies and incentives can help families cope with the higher utility bills arising from greater need for heating and air-conditioning. Financial support can also make it easier to invest in domestic and community-based climate resilience infrastructure, such as green roofs, insulation and flood protection measures.With the right training programs in place, the installation of energy efficiency upgrades, renewable energy equipment and climate-resilient infrastructure can become a source of new jobs.Low-carbon and energy efficiency investments that are targeted at low-income communities therefore have a dual benefit, generating economic opportunities as well as the ability to reduce pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases. And, of course, a priority must be to lower the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.To prevent poor communities from being disproportionately hit by everything from storms and droughts to toxic pollution, attention should not focus only on meeting immediate needs. It also requires investing in measures that can build long-term resilience and foster \u201cgreen\u201d jobs. Failing to do so could not only increase climate risks \u2014 it could also widen the U.S.\u2019s already problematic economic and racial disparities.Photography provided by T Brand Studio unless otherwise stated.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation.`"}

Hemingway was also a war reporter with an unerring eye.Later in the story Hemingway writes of the \u201cguns hidden under screens of mulberry leaves to the left of the road,\u201d visible \u201cby the heat-waves in the air above the leaves where the sun hit the metal.\u201d With almost adjective-free economy, he has placed you there, in the carnage of a century ago, where the hot weather, indifferent to corpse of friend or foe, has \u201cswollen them all alike regardless of nationality.\u201dAround the dead are \u201cstick bombs, helmets, rifles, intrenching tools, ammunition boxes, star-shell pistols, their shells scattered about, medical kits, gas masks, empty gas-mask cans, a squat, tripodded machine gun in a nest of empty shells, full belts protruding from the boxes, the water-cooling can empty and on its side, the breech block gone, the crew in odd positions, and around them, in the grass, more of the typical papers.\u201dShow, don\u2019t tell, goes the old writer\u2019s maxim.The papers \u2014 in this case prayer books, smutty postcards and \u201cletters, letters, letters\u201d \u2014 stopped me. \u201cThere was always much paper about the dead,\u201d Hemingway writes, \u201cand the debris of this attack was no exception.\u201dMy late uncle, Capt. Bert Cohen of the Dental Unit of the Sixth South African Armored Division, 19th Field Ambulance, had said the same of the dead he encountered as he fought his way up the Italian peninsula in World War II.I guess there won\u2019t be any letters in the next war, just cellphones in the dust, the sand or the mud, their batteries dying.\u201cIntestines of gutted animals ballooned from their carcasses. A squad of South African infantry marched through the ruins, bringing a bullet of mercy to animals that still agonized. One dead German in particular caught Bert\u2019s eye: a blond, square-jawed young man with a long straight nose, hair flecked with blood and smoke, legs twisted grotesquely, abdomen ripped open, coils of gut spilling through a ragged gash into the dust, sightless blue eyes gazing at infinity. Beside the corpse lay scattered letters from the soldier\u2019s mother in Hamburg. She wrote about Der Angriff, the Allied bombardment of the city that killed more than 42,000 people. Uncertain what to do, Bert returned the letters to the dead man\u2019s pocket.\u201dUntil his death last year at the age of 95, my uncle remained haunted by that single dead German and his letters. He dwelt on them as if he, a Jew from South Africa, might somehow have brought this handsome young man, Hitler\u2019s model Aryan, back to life, and he wondered if he should have kept the letters to return them to a bereaved mother in Hamburg. He was a link in a circle that never closed.I\u2019ve been thinking of young lives interrupted, of the papers fluttering from the twin towers toward my Brooklyn Heights apartment 14 years ago, of the young Parisian who did not go to the Bataclan on Nov. 13 because his wife was pregnant and a dead friend who did, of the ways luck can run out. As a war correspondent I always thought you did not need good luck. You needed the absence of bad luck.Perhaps if Bert had returned the letters he would have made a friend in Hamburg and seen something of the rebirth of that handsome city.It seems, as we grow older, that we are haunted less by what we have done than by what we failed to do, whether through lack of courage, or inattention, or insufficient readiness to cast caution to the winds. The impossible love abandoned, the gesture unmade, the heedless voyage untaken, the parting that should not have been \u2014 these chimera always beckon.What\u2019s done is done but the undone is another matter.There are too many words today, too much emotion, and too few letters. Truth is more often the fruit of diligence than revelation, of discipline than inebriation, of discarding than accumulation.Advertisement"}

Berger, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a co-author of \u201cISIS: The State of Terror.\u201d \u201cThe West can certainly go in militarily and take ISIS\u2019 territory away from it, if it is willing to bear the costs of a ground war.\u201dBut, J.M.

A better solution, he argued, would be for regional powers to take on the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh.\u201cISIS is, after all, a greater threat to them than to us, and it would undercut their ideological appeal if they were defeated by Muslims,\u201d Mr. Berger said.

{"Headline": "Safety Lapses and Deaths Amid a Building Boom in New York", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "An increase in fatalities and injuries has mostly affected undocumented immigrant laborers and far exceeds the rate of new construction.Supported byManuel Colorado, a 36-year-old construction worker, was installing decking last year at a new building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, when he lost his balance and fell 19 feet to his death.A few weeks later, a guest at the Dream Hotel in Midtown Manhattan heard someone screaming outside. Gurmeet Singh, a 58-year-old Indian immigrant doing facade work on the building, had tumbled eight stories off a scaffold and landed atop a sidewalk shed.Twelve days after Mr. Singh\u2019s death, Lukasz Stolarski, 33, plummeted 110 feet from the roof of an office building in Midtown where he had been attaching plywood to the parapet ledge.New York City is experiencing a building boom that has transformed barren blocks and led to a frenzy of construction on commercial and residential buildings across all five boroughs. But that activity has come at a sobering cost: In the last two years, the number of workers hurt and killed in construction accidents has surged.The rise in deaths and injuries \u2014 mostly among undocumented immigrant laborers \u2014 far exceeds the rate of new construction over the same period. It is stark evidence of the view increasingly held by safety inspectors, government officials and prosecutors, that safety measures at these job sites are woefully inadequate.A review of every construction fatality in the past two years by The New York Times has found that many could have been, as a federal investigation into one accident put it, \u201ccompletely avoidable.\u201d Time and again, in thousands of pages of safety reports, handwritten notes, crude drawings, lawsuits and other documents, as well as interviews with the workers\u2019 relatives and friends, the same issues emerged.Most construction sites where workers died failed to take basic steps to prevent them from falling. Workers frequently did not wear harnesses or helmets, as required by law. Supervision was often lacking. In many of the projects, a premium was placed on speed, causing workers to take dangerous shortcuts.About a quarter of the deaths took place in Midtown, attracting a vast majority of news media attention for such accidents. But the rest occurred, largely unnoticed, all over the city. They usually involved smaller projects, using nonunion workers, who were often poorly trained. Often the contractors had been previously cited for safety violations and failed to pay penalties.Seven workers have died on the job since July, including three in a nine-day stretch before Labor Day, according to records of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.The city\u2019s Buildings Department keeps its own count of construction deaths, injuries and accidents, offering a broader look at safety year over year. There were 10 construction-related fatalities in the most recent fiscal year, from July 2014 to July 2015, according to city figures. In contrast, the annual average over the previous four years was 5.5.Meanwhile, 324 workers were injured in the last fiscal year, a jump of 53 percent, and the Buildings Department recorded 314 accidents over all, an increase of 52 percent from the year before. The total was more than two and a half times what the city tallied in 2011. In comparison, permits for new construction projects grew by only 11 percent in the last fiscal year and permits for renovation and other work by 6 percent.\u201cThere is absolutely no doubt that there is a real problem with construction safety,\u201d said Mark G. Peters, the commissioner of the city\u2019s Investigation Department, which looks into construction fatalities.The deaths make clear that the city is being built, or in some cases rebuilt, heavily on the backs of recent immigrants, particularly from Latin America, most of them not authorized to work in this country.Immigrants, of course, have long dominated the construction trade, from the Irish in earlier generations to Eastern Europeans more recently. But among those who have died over the past two years, many were especially vulnerable because of their legal status. They were frequently poorly trained, paid in cash and afraid of speaking up about unsafe conditions, according to records and interviews with friends and relatives. Having largely existed on society\u2019s margins, in death, there was often little to mark that they ever lived.Such was the story with Mr. Colorado, who arrived from Veracruz, Mexico, about 15 years ago, and is survived by his girlfriend, Haydee Vazquez, and their two sons.Mr. Colorado\u2019s shoulders chronically ached from lifting heavy wooden beams, Ms. Vazquez said, but he felt that he needed to keep working, or some other worker would just take his place. After his fatal fall in March 2014, she was unable to learn anything more about the accident from his former employer.\u201cI still don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d she said, wiping tears from her eyes, in an interview at her apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he had any last words.\u201dGurmeet Singh came to America on a tourist visa about 13 years ago from a farming village near Kapurthala, in the Punjab region of northern India. He did not return home until his body was shipped back in April 2014.Mr. Singh, a former soldier in the Indian Army, found brick-pointing and other construction work in New York. For a time, he shared an apartment in Richmond Hill, Queens, with a rotating cast of three or four men, usually fellow Sikhs. He eventually began sending money back to his family in monthly installments of around $2,000, according to receipts provided by relatives.\u201cThe boss said: \u2018Can you just finish this job? I\u2019ll give you $10,000 and a free ticket to India,\u2019\u201d his other daughter, Palwinder Kaur, said in a telephone interview from India.That boss, Mr. Singh\u2019s family said, was Adalat Khan, a Pakistani-American businessman and fellow Punjabi speaker. Mr. Singh considered Mr. Khan a friend, having long worked for him, Mr. Singh\u2019s family said. But Mr. Khan told investigators after the Dream Hotel accident: \u201cI do not know the name of the deceased.\u201dMr. Khan was a subcontractor for a Queens firm, Alpha General Contracting. And though he said he had been in business for five or six years, he admitted to investigators that he did not know much about construction.\u201cI have no education for reading drawings,\u201d he said, according to interview notes by safety administration investigators released under a federal Freedom of Information Act request.Medical issues also limited Mr. Khan. \u201cI do not work on the scaffold myself because I have a stent,\u201d he said. \u201cI did no inspections on site.\u201dThe safety administration concluded that Mr. Khan ordered the employees \u201cto remove planks\u201d and modify the scaffolding in order to \u201cfinish the job\u201d quickly. No guardrails were installed, and Mr. Singh, who was a sturdy 5-foot-8 and 190 pounds, had to climb a makeshift array of frames and cross-braces to get to workers\u2019 platforms some 140 feet off the ground. But those platforms did not reach the wall, the agency found. As a result, Mr. Singh had two options to get the work done: lean over a gap and stretch several feet to reach the wall, or step on a thin, monkey-bar-like piece of metal.After Mr. Singh fell, the other workers fled, according to records.Mr. Singh was not wearing a harness, as required, investigators found. He also had a fake government safety card certifying he had completed mandatory safety training. The card listed the name of a trainer who had died several years earlier, according to people briefed on the investigation.The agency later concluded that the scaffold had been \u201caltered by untrained employees that were not supervised by a competent person.\u201d It imposed a $42,000 fine against Mr. Khan\u2019s company, Pak National Gen. CorporationIn February, Mr. Singh\u2019s family filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Queens, alleging negligence. Mr. Singh had also not been paid in three months, his daughters said.\u201cIn this type of business, time is money, and there is only one way to be more profitable, and that is to cut corners on safety,\u201d said Pat James Crispi, the lawyer for Mr. Singh\u2019s family.Mr. Khan did not return calls or answer text messages, and the residents of the Brooklyn apartment listed as Pak National Gen.\u2019s headquarters said no one by that name had ever lived there. A lawyer for the company, Kamilla Mishiyeva, declined to answer written questions, saying litigation was still pending.Mr. Khan has forged ahead in the construction business since Mr. Singh\u2019s death. Four months after the accident, another of Mr. Khan\u2019s companies, Tower General Construction, was granted a permit to renovate a six-story rent-stabilized building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.While the Dream Hotel accident attracted a fair amount of news coverage, most of the workers died the way they lived: anonymously.There was Jorge Juca, 29, an Ecuadorean immigrant, who fell last year from a ladder while doing demolition and renovation work at a supermarket in the Bronx. Federal investigators concluded that his employer, R.S. Ecua Contracting, \u201cwanted job done fast\u201d and \u201cgrabbed\u201d as many \u201coff the books\u201d workers as possible, even though the laborers were \u201cnot provided with general safety training.\u201dSeveral months later, another Ecuadorean, Francisco Quizhpi Quizhpi, 40, was installing siding on a house in Far Rockaway, Queens, when he plunged more than 14 feet and died. There were no guardrails and no supervision on site, according to federal records.Many of the accidents were set against the backdrop of neighborhoods that have undergone rapid gentrification, where construction has been ubiquitous.At 124 Ridge Street on the Lower East Side last December, workers were remodeling a pair of connected five-story walk-up buildings when Claudio Pati\u00f1o, 32, fell through an opening to the floor below. His widow, Lourdes Gordillo, said her husband had been scared that the site was getting too slippery as winter approached but felt pressured to keep working.\u201cHe told me it was all wrong, that any moment something could go wrong,\u201d she said in an interview in a three-bedroom apartment in Corona, Queens, which she and her children share with two roommates. \u201cHe told me, \u2018It\u2019s a miracle we\u2019re alive.\u2019\u201dThe owner of the Ridge Street buildings, Croman Real Estate, had been moving out longtime, rent-stabilized tenants to make way for ones willing to pay much more. (The company is now being investigated by Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general, on allegations of improperly evicting tenants at its properties.)Croman had long worked with the building contractor, Casur Management & Maintenance, from Long Island, even though it had a spotty safety record. In August 2014, OSHA fined Casur $2,400 for \u201cno guardrail around opening\u201d at 124 Ridge and warned that a \u201cperson could fall.\u201dFour months later, Mr. Pati\u00f1o did.Casur, which declined to comment, delayed reporting the episode for 48 hours, violating an OSHA rule that all fatalities be reported within eight hours.The company agreed in late June to pay $9,750 in federal fines related to the accident. But just one week earlier, the company was cited by the Buildings Department for leaving a worker in an eight-foot-deep trench, without adequate protection, at the Ridge Street site. Two months later, at another renovation project just three blocks away, on Suffolk Street, Casur was fined again by the city for unsafe conditions.Another company with a long history of safety problems was Adar Steel of Brooklyn.In 2012 and 2013, the safety administration fined Adar for violations at two work sites in Far Rockaway, Queens, and Midwood, Brooklyn, for failing to provide basic protections, such as ladders or safety nets. Workers with no training were also used. But the company ignored almost $20,000 in fines, causing regulators to issue a debt collection notice.On March 6, 2014, disaster struck at another Adar project, at 105 Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg. Manuel Colorado was passing some corrugated metal to a co-worker three stories above the ground, according to federal records, when he jumped from an I-beam to some scaffolding and fell two stories. Several workers, including Mr. Colorado, were not wearing harnesses, inspectors later found. They also discovered three beer cans at the site, though employees told investigators Mr. Colorado had not been drinking.Adar, which federal regulators penalized $53,200, promised to provide extension ladders and remove the unsafe scaffolding. But the company did not pay, and the safety administration placed the company on its \u201csevere violators\u201d watch list.Even so, Adar continued to work. The next month, a safety inspector who was making random checks noticed an \u201cimminent danger condition\u201d at a site in Harlem that lacked guardrails, safety nets or other protection. The company was fined another $11,800, which it again did not pay.In September 2014, the company was hit with a $2,400 fine \u2014 this time by the Buildings Department \u2014 for safety failures while demolishing a two-story house at a site in Kensington, Brooklyn.The next month, the New York State Workers Compensation Board canceled the company\u2019s insurance policy for nonpayment, records show.Despite all of this, Adar Steel\u2019s owner, Daniel Adar, has \u201cno disciplinary history\u201d with the Buildings Department, a spokesman said, and is therefore not barred from construction work.In a statement, the department pointed out that another company had been issued a permit at the Williamsburg project where Mr. Colorado was killed, so the city could not take any action against Adar. But the department pledged that \u201cin direct recognition of the recent increases in worker injuries,\u201d it would \u201cwork with OSHA to proactively share information about bad actors to enhance both agencies\u2019 enforcement strategies.\u201dMr. Adar referred questions to his brother-in-law, Alad Danino. In response to written questions, he said: \u201cWe are working out payment plans for any open violations as we are a small company. I wish I can be more helpful but at this point that\u2019s all I could tell you.\u201dThe sheer volume of construction activity in the city makes regulating it challenging.The Buildings Department breaks down complaints it receives into dozens of categories. Code 91 means \u201csite conditions endangering workers.\u201dSo far in 2015, the number of Code 91 complaints stands at more than 2,000, which represents about 6 percent of all construction-related complaints the department has received. In 2005, the comparable figure for dangerous conditions complaints was 682, or less than 2 percent of the total.Since January 2014, there have been more than 40 complaints at the location. In one case, an employee told the department: \u201cI was working on a construction site yesterday. Two people were injured. They were advised NOT to call E.M.S.\u201dBut there have been no fatalities, and the project is proceeding in earnest.The de Blasio administration, concerned about safety, plans to hire about 100 additional building inspectors, and is investing in better data tools to identify and remove troublesome contractors. It has also unveiled a new code of conduct for the construction industry.At the federal level, the safety administration has just 33 inspectors covering the city and 66 inspectors in the entire state \u2014 the agency\u2019s lowest numbers in at least five years.There have been attempts in the past to improve worker safety, but that often simply gave rise to new methods of thwarting regulators. After a spate of crane and scaffolding accidents in 2007 and 2008, the city required workers to obtain photo identification cards testifying to the completion of safety courses approved by the safety administration. But most workers must pay the $300 fee themselves and take time off, usually two days, for training.As a result, fraudulent cards have proliferated, investigators say; the going rate is now $25 to $80. Mr. Colorado had a fake card, OSHA records show.As a deterrent, the city\u2019s Investigation Department has conducted random inspections of the cards on construction sites since 2012. This year, more than 20 people have been arrested. During a sweep in early October in northern Manhattan, witnessed by The Times, investigators inspected the OSHA cards of 74 workers. Three fake cards were confiscated, while 10 other workers lacked documentation.Private inspectors had repeatedly warned the company of treacherous conditions, only to be ignored, prosecutors said.The accident prompted the Buildings Department to post a new warning, reminding inspectors to call either 911 or the agency\u2019s emergency hotline immediately \u2014 not the company \u2014 if they noticed any \u201cuncorrected hazardous conditions.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do it this way five years ago?\u201d Mr. Peters, of the Investigation Department, said at a news conference. \u201cHonestly we should have. We didn\u2019t.\u201dReporting was contributed by Kim Barker, Veera Kaur, Ken Schwencke and Isvett Verde, and research by Susan C. Beachy.Advertisement"}

To the east is the raging civil war of Syria, the brutality of the Islamic State and the violence of Turkey\u2019s own conflict with Kurdish militants.\u201cThanks to Obama, Antalya has had a face-lift and looks like a first-world city,\u201d said Mehmet Kibar, who drives a cab in the Belek area of town, where the meeting will be held. \u201cIt feels more like Florida; I can barely recognize it. The roads were full of potholes and they would flood in the rain, but thanks to Obama they have been smoothed out and my wheels now glide as if they are spinning on caramel.\u201dThe stepped-up security operations underscore the challenge of hosting such a high-powered event in a city that is nestled in a region convulsed by war, and in a country that has faced rising turmoil and instability.Last week, dawn raids in Antalya netted 20 suspected Islamic State militants, and operations have continued across the country, including one Thursday morning in Istanbul that included helicopters and led to the arrest of 11 alleged members of the Islamic State.\u201cUntil the election, everyone was concerned about the timing of the G-20 because they expected a similar result to June, which would mean hosting the summit with a government in limbo,\u201d said Emre Deliveli, a Turkish economist and columnist. \u201cBut after the A.K.P.\u2019s astounding victory, both the party and President Erdogan are likely to use the environment as a platform to show off.\u201dAnalysts say world leaders will face an emboldened Mr. Erdogan, fresh from his party\u2019s stunning victory, who will probably be aggressive in trying to reassert himself on the international stage. Customarily, Group of 20 meetings are focused on economic issues, but this year the war in Syria and the migrant crisis \u2014 two issues with Turkey at the center \u2014 are likely to dominate.Speaking in Ankara on Wednesday, Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cThe result of the Nov. 1 election completely removed political uncertainty in Turkey and gave us the opportunity to take stronger steps on regional issues.\u201dMr. Erdogan has long pushed for a safe zone in northern Syria, and in advance of the meeting this week, he said he believed that Western allies were moving closer to agreement, even though there has been little indication that the Obama administration, long opposed to the idea, has changed its calculus.Verda Ozer, an analyst and columnist for the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, said that Mr. Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu \u201cnow have the upper hand in the international arena since they hold the golden key to solve the migrant crisis, making Europe dependent on Turkey.\u201dShe added, \u201cThe political agenda of the G-20 will be two-dimensional, and Turkey is the only common denominator of these two fronts: On the one hand European countries will try to make progress on the migrant crisis, whereas the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey will focus on Syria.\u201dIn an area so dependent on visitors for its economy, hosting the world\u2019s most powerful leaders \u2014 even if they are protected by a no-fly zone and 12,000 security officers \u2014 could help restore Turkey\u2019s image as a safe place for tourists, locals say.\u201cMany Western countries issued travel advisories to Turkey, which curbed the healthy flow of tourists,\u201d said Geylan Dursunoglu, the general manager of the Regnum Carya Golf and Spa Resort. \u201cBut now world leaders from those countries are all coming to Turkey, and their presence will restore confidence among tourists.\u201dAlthough most local businesses will be locked out of the security zone \u2014 which includes 28 five-star hotels and is accessible only to those credentialed for the summit meeting \u2014 locals say the summit meeting will restore prestige to the city, and to Turkey.\u201cI can\u2019t even see past the barriers in front of my shop, but people tell me it\u2019s like Las Vegas inside with bright lights and state-of-the-art technology,\u201d said Kerem Edemen, who owns a market near the security zone. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful to God that the A.K.P. is back in power.

{"Headline": "Tibetans Fight to Salvage Fading Culture in China", "Date": "2015-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYUSHU, China \u2014 When officials forced an informal school run by monks near here to stop offering language classes for laypeople, Tashi Wangchuk looked for a place where his two teenage nieces could continue studying Tibetan.To his surprise, he could not find one, even though nearly everyone living in this market town on the Tibetan plateau here is Tibetan. Officials had also ordered other monasteries and a private school in the area not to teach the language to laypeople. And public schools had dropped true bilingual education in Chinese and Tibetan, teaching Tibetan only in a single class, like a foreign language, if they taught it at all.\u201cThis directly harms the culture of Tibetans,\u201d said Mr. Tashi, 30, a shopkeeper who is trying to file a lawsuit to compel the authorities to provide more Tibetan education. \u201cOur people\u2019s culture is fading and being wiped out.\u201dMany schools in these areas \u2014 home to nearly 60 percent of China\u2019s Tibetan population \u2014 had taught mainly in the Tibetan language for decades, especially in the countryside. Chinese was taught too, but sometimes not until later grades.Schools were ordered to use Chinese as the main language of instruction, which led to layoffs of Tibetan teachers with weak Chinese-language skills. And new Chinese-language textbooks were adopted that critics said lacked detailed material on Tibetan history or culture.This month, a petition circulated on WeChat, the Chinese messaging app, calling on officials to open a Tibetan-language primary school in Qinghai\u2019s provincial capital, Xining, which has had no such schools under Communist rule.\u201cLetting 30,000 Tibetan children learn their mother tongue so they can carry on their own traditional culture is a very important matter,\u201d said the petition, which got more than 61,000 signatures before censors blocked it.But Tibetan attitudes are complicated by the practical reality of living in a country where the Chinese language is dominant, and where parents and children sometimes prefer English as a second language of education, not a minority language. Some Tibetan parents worry that their native language and culture are dying but nevertheless tell their children to prioritize Chinese studies, in part because the national university entrance exam is administered only in Chinese.\u201cThe parents think that Chinese is most important for their children\u2019s future,\u201d said Phuntsok, a monk at a Yushu monastery told by officials to close its Tibetan classes this year.The government says it supports bilingual education. In practice, though, bilingual education now generally means using Chinese as the main language of instruction, while a minority language is taught as a separate subject.\u201cA lot of Tibetan people realize this is a problem, and they know they need to protect their language,\u201d said Ms. Woeser, who studied Tibetan on her own after years of schooling in Chinese. She and others estimate that the literacy rate in Tibetan among Tibetans in China has fallen well below 20 percent, and continues to decline.The only thing that will stave off the extinction of Tibetan and other minority languages is allowing ethnic regions in China more self-governance, which would create an environment for the languages to be used in government, business and schools, Ms. Woeser said. \u201cThis is all a consequence of ethnic minorities not enjoying real autonomy,\u201d she said.The Chinese Constitution promises autonomy in ethnic regions and says local governments there should use the languages in common use. In 1987, the Tibetan Autonomous Region, which encompasses central Tibet, published more explicit regulations calling for Tibetan to be the main language in schools, government offices and shops.But those regulations were eliminated in 2002. These days, across Tibetan areas, official affairs are conducted mostly in Chinese, and it is common to see banners promoting the use of Chinese.\u201cThe government thinks people who go to ethnic schools have a stronger Tibetan nationalist identity,\u201d Ms. Woeser said. \u201cThe government thinks if they switch the instruction to Chinese, then people will change their views.\u201dMonasteries have long served as educational institutions in Tibetan society, with monks and nuns among the elite few who could read and write before Tibet came under Chinese Communist rule in 1951. Until recently, many monasteries held classes on the written language for ordinary people, and monks often gave lessons while traveling.But over the past two years, officials in many parts of the plateau have ordered monasteries to end the classes, though Tibetan can still be taught to young monks.Mr. Tashi said he first learned to read and write Tibetan in primary school and from older brothers who had studied with a monk. He continued studying as a monk himself for three years, and in 2012, he took private classes in Yushu for a few months.He thought he might take his nieces to those classes, but found they had been shut down. \u201cMy nieces want to become fluent in Tibetan but don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d he said. \u201cOur words will be lost to them.\u201dMia Li, Sarah Li and Jonah Kessel contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Near-Impossibility of Assimilation in Belgium", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome years ago, I was invited to sit on a panel in Antwerp \u2014 \u201ctogether with other distinguished foreigners,\u201d in the words of the panel organizer \u2014 to discuss language and culture in Flanders. I had, by then, become a naturalized Belgian, but I had never felt accepted enough to claim that identity; when people asked where I was from, I still said Nigeria. I had come to Belgium as an adult. Neither my Dutch nor my French was as fluent as the average Belgian\u2019s. Perhaps, I reasoned, people had every right to deny me access to that identity.When the biographies of my co-panelists were read, though, I was stunned to learn that all three of them had been born and raised in Belgium. One was a newscaster whose Dutch might even have been considered posh, whose only relationship with his parents\u2019 country was as a visiting tourist. Yet he had shown up at the panel as an immigrant! When I asked the moderator what made my co-panelists \u201cforeign,\u201d his answer used the Flemish word \u201callochtonen\u201d \u2014 the opposite of indigenous, a word that means, literally, \u201coriginating from another country.\u201d My co-panelists were of North African and Turkish origins; their names and their skin ensured that they would always be classified as allochtonen. Growing up in Belgium, they had internalized the label: once an allochtoon, always an allochtoon.Or almost always. Another writer once told me the word was simply a way of identifying one\u2019s cultural roots. But when someone else waded into the conversation to ask if her son, who was half-British, should be considered allochtoon, the writer said no: \u201cHe\u2019s Caucasian. How is anyone going to know he\u2019s half anything?\u201dI thought of this when I ran into Toon two years later. Toon had been in my oldest\u2019s second-grade class, except he was not called Toon then, and his Dutch was heavily accented and hesitant; he and his mother had just arrived from Poland. As far as his teacher was concerned, this made him one of two foreigners in the class \u2014 the other being my son, whose father is Flemish, whose last name is Flemish, who had only ever vacationed in Nigeria for a few weeks. (When she spoke of Africans, she made sure to point him out as one.) The day I ran into Toon, I called him by his Polish name, but he smiled and said, \u201cMa\u2019am. I am now called Toon\u201d \u2014 a very Flemish name. His accent was gone. A change of name and accent were all Toon needed to bridge a gap that the Belgian-born children of \u201cother-colored\u201d immigrants will never be able to.The Igbo say that no one knows how water entered the stem of the pumpkin leaf, but one can hazard a guess. In 1964, Belgium made agreements with Morocco and Turkey to attract migrant workers to the coal mines of Wallonia; Turkish and Moroccan immigrants began to populate Brussels. Soon after these conventions were signed, though, the demand for mine workers fell. The economy deteriorated, mines shut, unemployment rose and very little was done to help the new arrivals assimilate.That Molenbeek is impoverished, that Molenbeek youth have long had a fractious relationship with the police, that Molenbeek needs help: These facts have been known to the Belgian government for years. There is a Dutch saying, \u201cDat is ver van mijn bed\u201d: \u201cThat is far from my bed.\u201d As long as Molenbeek\u2019s many issues inconvenienced only its residents, the government was willing to ignore it. Belgium\u2019s complex structure of government makes it even easier to neglect problems. Brussels has 19 municipalities, each with its own council and mayor. It has six police departments, which do not always cooperate. There is a tendency to pass the buck.Chika Unigwe is the author of the novels \u201cOn Black Sisters Street\u201d and \u201cNight Dancer.\u201d She recently moved to the United States from Belgium.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Global Academy\u2019s Crash Course Makes Angels Out of Investors", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly every week, all around the world, wealthy people, self-made business owners and senior executives in a range of industries gather at private clubs, cultural centers or five-star hotels for free, invitation-only angel investing \u201cboot camps\u201d intended to help them size up fledgling business ideas and the people behind them.The events are organized by Angel Labs, a global angel investor academy based in San Francisco whose mission is to widen the influence of angel investing, a field in which the relatively affluent put money into start-ups, usually in the tech industry.Since it started in early 2014, Angel Labs has organized workshops in more than 38 countries, in places like Brunei and Uruguay. While its initial focus was on emerging markets, the group has staged events throughout Europe and, more recently, in the United States. All told, more than 3,500 people have participated in Angel Labs\u2019 flagship one-day workshop, and many have gone on to form angel investing groups and to help organize events in their regions.The problem was not a lack of interest, a dearth of capital or capable business executives, she said, but \u201ca lack of understanding about how to value these deals and add value beyond just the cash.\u201dOnce the Startup Labs fund was fully invested, Ms. Ergul and her colleagues mapped out a strategy to identify would-be angel investors around the world, find local sponsors and demystify angel investing. Today, Ms. Ergul and her four partners have expanded their offerings to include private gatherings, multiday programs and a monthly digital digest started in May.To cover costs \u2014 which include a fee paid to Angel Labs for orchestrating the event \u2014 and tap into local expertise, Angel Labs teams up with banks, development organizations, government offices and many other groups interested in promoting entrepreneurship.\u201cWe have a strong entrepreneurial community, but we\u2019re not as good in financing these companies,\u201d said Mariano Mayer, the general director of entrepreneurship for the city of Buenos Aires, which hosted its first Angel Labs event late last year. Roughly 150 attendees gathered at the city\u2019s General San Mart\u00edn Cultural Center. Angel Labs is developing five-day boot camps in other cities in Argentina for 2016.Like many places around the world, Argentina hopes that by supporting entrepreneurs, it can help diversify an economy that is largely dependent on natural resources. No doubt angel investing is trendy right now, Mr. Mayer said, but it can have a real impact. \u201cWe need entrepreneurs, and they need financing from locals,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking on educating angels is a big piece of the puzzle.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t just a lack of expertise, but a lack of willingness to jump in,\u201d Mr. McClure said. \u201cDeals take longer\u201d outside Silicon Valley, \u201cand investors want more control,\u201d he said. That can sometimes work against fledgling companies.For new angel investors, the learning curve can be steep, which is why experienced angels lead the charge. New investors typically \u201cdon\u2019t understand what it means to invest in early-stage technology, even in developed markets like the U.K. and Australia,\u201d Mr. Chung said. Even so, \u201cyou\u2019re seeing a lot of these markets starting to catch up.\u201dAnother challenge: \u201cExit strategies are hard to come by,\u201d Mr. Dantus said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to do an I.P.O., and there isn\u2019t a lot of activity in mergers and acquisitions.\u201dYet \u201cin the last five years, there has been a big change in Mexico and all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2008, there were two venture capital funds here in Mexico, and now there are nearly 50.\u201d Angel Labs has organized five events throughout Mexico, attracting investors from a wide range of backgrounds, including cattle ranchers and real estate tycoons. \u201cTen years ago, if you were to approach somebody with the idea of an angel club, they would think you are a crazy guy,\u201d Mr. Dantus said. \u201cNow that entrepreneurship is so fashionable, people want to get involved, but they don\u2019t know how.\u201dBy giving investors a crash course in angel investing and, more important, connecting them with others interested in making investments, Angel Labs thinks it can nudge people to become involved and, in many cases, form their own investing clubs. Angel Labs has helped start a dozen new investor networks, Ms. Ergul said, and has supported more than 40 existing groups.Many Angel Labs participants say the thrill of taking an active role in the process, and not just a desire for returns, is at the root of their interest in early-stage investing. Some could simply write a check to a venture capital fund or hire advisers to size up deals on their behalf, but they prefer a more hands-on approach.\u201cFor many of these investors, they want to be part of the process, to feel the pleasure of creating something new,\u201d said Recep Bildik, private market director at the Borsa Istanbul, which hosted a 70-person event organized by Angel Labs last January and has a second one planned for early 2016. \u201cThat may be more valuable than the return they\u2019re expecting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Someone is always writing the rules of the market. Reich\u2019s concern is that over the last three decades, the lead authors have been Wall Street, big corporations and the wealthy elite. His fear is that \u201cwe are lurching toward a capitalism so top-heavy it cannot be sustained.\u201dAs treatises on inequality go, much of this one is familiar. Reich, who served as secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, criticizes the Citizens United decision, corporate lobbying, tax rates on capital gains and the accrual of \u201cdynastic wealth.\u201d But he also hints at another culprit for modern political and economic distortions, less obvious than the superrich and thereby all the more insidious: a na\u00efve faith in the American dream. Myths and legends, as Hunter S. Thompson observed, die hard in America, but perhaps none so hard as this one. Reich, raised in South Salem, N.Y., remembers when \u201cwork hard, get ahead\u201d was still very much achievable. His father sold clothes to the wives of factory workers, the first shop eventually yielding a second. \u201cWe weren\u2019t rich,\u201d Reich writes, \u201cbut never felt poor.\u201d For 30 years after World War II, the family\u2019s income and purchasing power grew in lock step with the American economy, as did that of the broader middle class.In the decades since, however, upward mobility has largely vanished. Sometime in the 1970s, wages began to stagnate, though productivity gains and economic growth continued. By 2013, the median American household, after adjusting for inflation, was earning less than it did in 1989. Last year, more than two-thirds of Americans were living from paycheck to paycheck. The winnings at the top, meanwhile, have piled up. In 1978, the chief executives of America\u2019s big companies took home 30 times the pay of their average workers; in 2013, that multiplier was 296. Most people don\u2019t have a shot at even getting close to such wealth. Middle-income children are half as likely to climb to the top quintile as those born there are to stay; for children of the poorest families, the odds of reaching the financial top are just 6 percent.In spite of this, Horatio Alger\u2019s creed remains strong. As of early 2014, two-thirds of Americans agreed that hard work would get most people ahead, and a full 80 percent felt that \u201ceveryone has it in their own power to succeed,\u201d according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Yet in today\u2019s economy, those adages have become perverse, more inclined to depress than to inspire. \u201cThe notion that you\u2019re paid what you\u2019re \u2018worth,\u2019\u200a\u201d Reich writes, \u201cis by now so deeply ingrained in the public consciousness that many who earn very little assume it\u2019s their own fault.\u201d\u201cSaving Capitalism\u201d is loaded with broad proclamations, while at times frustratingly spare on the particulars. What\u2019s left is an exhaustive, if repetitive, outpouring of Reich\u2019s indignations with politics, with free-market ideals, with the proverbial system. A smorgasbord of reforms he proposes in the final pages includes reversing Citizens United, tying corporate tax rates to C.E.O. pay ratios and creating a basic minimum income. But those ideas are less important than what \u201cSaving Capitalism\u201d is at its core: a rallying call, Reich\u2019s attempt to be a modern Thomas Paine. The irony is that this appeal to the many is far more likely to be read by the few.SAVING CAPITALISM For the Many, Not the FewBy Robert B. Reich279 pp. Alfred A.

{"Headline": "Large Companies Game H-1B Visa Program, Costing the U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTh\u00e9o N\u00e9gri, a young software engineer from France, had come up with so many novel ideas at his job at an Internet start-up in San Francisco that the American entrepreneur who hired him wanted to keep him on.So he helped Mr. N\u00e9gri apply for a three-year work visa for foreign professionals with college degrees and specialized skills, mainly in technology and science. With his master\u2019s degree from a French university and advanced computer abilities, Mr. N\u00e9gri seemed to fill the bill.The answer was simple: Many of the visas are given out through a lottery, and a small number of giant global outsourcing companies had flooded the system with applications, significantly increasing their chances of success. While he had one application in last year\u2019s lottery and lost, one of the outsourcing companies applied for at least 14,000. The companies were squeezing out American employers like his boss.\u201cI had this great American dream that got broken,\u201d Mr. N\u00e9gri said, speaking by telephone from Lyon, France.How 20 companies took more than a third of the H-1B visas available in 2014.Congress set up the H-1B program to help American companies hire foreigners with exceptional skills, to fill open jobs and to help their businesses grow.But the program has been failing many American employers who cannot get visas for foreigners with the special skills they need.Instead, the outsourcing firms are increasingly dominating the program, federal records show. In recent years, they have obtained many thousands of the visas \u2014 which are limited to 85,000 a year \u2014 by learning to game the H-1B system without breaking the rules, researchers and lawyers said.In some years, an American employer could snag one of these coveted visas almost anytime. But recently, with the economy picking up, the outsourcing companies have sent in tens of thousands of visa requests right after the application window opens on April 1. Employers who apply after a week are out of luck.\u201cThe H-1B program is critical as a way for employers to fill skill gaps and for really talented people to come to the United States,\u201d said Ronil Hira, a professor at Howard University who studies visa programs. \u201cBut the outsourcing companies are squeezing out legitimate users of the program,\u201d he said. \u201cThe H-1Bs are actually pushing jobs offshore.\u201dOf the 20 companies that received the most H-1B visas in 2014, 13 were global outsourcing operations, according to an analysis of federal records by Professor Hira. The top 20 companies took about 40 percent of the visas available \u2014 about 32,000 \u2014 while more than 10,000 other employers received far fewer visas each. And about half of the applications in 2014 were rejected entirely because the quota had been met.The top companies receiving H-1B visas in recent years, Professor Hira found, include Tata Consultancy Services, known as TCS, Infosys and Wipro, all outsourcing giants based in India; Cognizant, with headquarters in New Jersey; and Accenture, a global operation incorporated in Ireland.\u201cThey have spent a lot of time and money creating a business model that fits within the rules so they can use the visas to offer cheaper labor,\u201d said Bruce Morrison, a lawyer representing an association of American engineers.Congress set up the H-1B visa program to help American companies hire foreigners with specialized skills. But in recent years, many H-1B visas have gone to temporary immigrants who lacked special skills and displaced American workers from jobs.For example, federal law requires global companies employing large numbers of H-1B workers to sign a declaration saying they will not displace Americans. But there is a loophole: An exemption cancels that requirement if employers pay H-1B workers at least $60,000 a year \u2014 significantly less than an experienced technology worker\u2019s salary in many parts of the country.Many of the outsourcing firms\u2019 temporary workers earn $60,000 or just a little more, according to federal data compiled by Professor Hira.Federal officials allow only one application for each foreign worker. But there is no limit on the number of visas a company can seek. A company with thousands of employees can submit many applications. By law, if applications quickly exceed the quota, officials use a computer-run lottery to select the visa recipients.Recently, demand for the visas has soared; each year since 2013 the selection went to the lottery. This year, 233,000 applications were received in just seven days, and about two-thirds were denied because the quota was met.Immigration officials do not acknowledge the outsourcing firms\u2019 advantage. \u201cThe selection process is completely random,\u201d said Shinichi Inouye, a spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency in charge of the visa program. \u201cWe cannot speculate as to why one company has more petitions selected in the cap.\u201dBut Mr. N\u00e9gri, who is now 27, wanted to understand it. He had been hired by David Petersen through an open job search after he posted his professional profile online. Mr. Petersen was looking for engineers to expand his start-up, BuildZoom, which helps people find construction contractors.\u201cI was just looking for great people,\u201d said Mr. Petersen, in San Francisco. \u201cAnd Th\u00e9o had been building cool stuff since he was a 13-year-old.\u201d Mr. Petersen said he had hired several local tech workers at the same time, and Mr. N\u00e9gri, rather than displacing Americans, brought in more.Together the top five outsourcing companies had prepared as many as 55,000 H-1B applications. TCS, the company that had prepared applications for at least 14,000 visas, won 5,650 of them.Mr. N\u00e9gri is now working on a tech start-up of his own \u2014 in France.American titans like IBM, Microsoft, Facebook and Google also use H-1B visas and have pressed Congress to increase the annual quota.A representative of The New York Times Company said it had about 70 employees on visas, most of them skilled technology workers. This year, the company obtained an H-1B visa for Mark Thompson, the president and chief executive, who is British.Lawmakers have largely overlooked the outsourcing companies\u2019 role in the visa process. On Sept. 30, Congress allowed an extra fee of $2,000, which it imposed five years ago on H-1B applications from the biggest outsourcing companies, to lapse.On Tuesday, Senators Richard Durbin of Illinois, a Democrat, and Charles H. Grassley of Iowa, a Republican, introduced a bill to change the H-1B program and another temporary work visa, the L-1B, to raise wage requirements, increase monitoring and enforcement and add other protections for American workers. \u201cThe H-1B visa program was never meant to replace qualified American workers,\u201d the senators said.Most of the global firms focus on technology, offering services to American companies to upgrade their systems and help them compete amid rapid change in the international marketplace.The Department of Homeland Security denies a temporary worker visa.The companies say they follow all of the rules when they apply for the visas. Benjamin Trounson, a spokesman for TCS, one of the largest consultants, with 325,000 employees worldwide, said the company serves its customers \u201cusing our U.S. and global talent pool that most effectively meets their needs.\u201dSeveral consulting companies said H-1B workers were only a small part of their work force in the United States. Cognizant said in a statement that it regularly recruits experienced American workers and qualified students, and uses H-1B visas only \u201cto supplement our U.S. hiring in order to fill talent gaps in the market.\u201dStill, Cognizant was the second-largest recipient of H-1B visas in 2014, getting more than 4,200.The outsourcing companies say they are hiring more Americans and contributing to the economy. In August, TCS announced a $35 million donation to Carnegie Mellon University for a new research center on its campus in Pittsburgh.But Mr. Pandey, after losing out in the H-1B lottery, had to set up shop back in Nepal to try to manage a growing company based in New York.As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Pandey befriended an American classmate from Arizona, Vincent Sanchez-Gomez. By their junior year, they were running a start-up. In 2013, after graduating, they turned full time to their venture, Pagevamp, which helps small businesses create and run their own websites.The H-1B denial was a blow. \u201cIt was quite stressful, for me and for the entire company, because it\u2019s what we were counting on,\u201d Mr. Pandey, 25, said during a brief stop in New York last month; now he can come to the United States only on a visitor\u2019s visa.Mr. Sanchez-Gomez, 24, has to handle investors, a staff of 10 and the company\u2019s plans for expansion through video calls with a business partner halfway around the globe.\u201cI would expect most people would feel Atulya was making a positive contribution to the U.S. economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no American who could do his job.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Renminbi Is Approved by I.M.F. as a Main World Currency", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Chinese renminbi was anointed as one of the world\u2019s elite currencies on Monday, a milestone decision by the International Monetary Fund that underscores the country\u2019s rising financial and economic heft.But the path to the I.M.F. decision, a bumpy process that stretches back years, also introduced new uncertainty into China\u2019s economy and financial system.To meet the I.M.F. requirements, China was forced to give up some of its tight control over the currency, culminating in the abrupt devaluation of the renminbi that shook global markets in August. The changes could inject fresh volatility into the country, at a time when its economy is already slowing.The I.M.F. designation, an accounting unit known as the special drawing rights, bestows global importance.Many central banks follow this benchmark in measuring their reserves, which countries hold to help protect their economies in times of trouble. By adding the renminbi to this group, the I.M.F. effectively says that it considers the currency to be safe, reliable and freely usable.The designation is a point of pride for Beijing, which had made it one of its highest economic policy priorities.In the months before the fund\u2019s decision, China moved aggressively to expand the currency\u2019s standing on a global stage, building trading hubs in Europe and developing a raft of renminbi-denominated bonds and commodity contracts. In devaluing the currency, China changed the way it sets the value of the renminbi each morning, allowing market forces to play a bigger role.The I.M.F. decision also says a lot about the waning influence of Europe: The renminbi is mainly replacing part of the euro\u2019s role in the special drawing rights. Assessing currencies for the accounting system, the fund put a greater emphasis on their different roles in international finance. The dollar still dominates in finance and trade, while the renminbi is quickly gaining ground on the euro.The United States Treasury said it \u201csupported\u201d the I.M.F. decision.Besides its symbolic weight, the I.M.F. label, which will take effect at the end of September next year, carries specific benefits. The renminbi will become one of the currencies used in the disbursement and repayment of international bailouts denominated in the fund\u2019s accounting unit, like Greece\u2019s debt deal.The renminbi\u2019s new status \u201cwill improve the international monetary system and safeguard global financial stability,\u201d President Xi Jinping of China said in mid-November.While the renminbi may gain favor internationally, the I.M.F. designation does not mean that China\u2019s economic overhaul is complete. China maintains heavy regulatory control over the country\u2019s financial system. The country also falls short in legal protections, with the Communist Party continuing to play a strong role in deciding court cases.Such issues could limit the overall appeal of the renminbi \u2014 and China\u2019s ambitions.\u201cIt is a historic moment in international finance for an emerging market economy, with a per-capita income barely a quarter that of other reserve currency economies, to be anointed as the issuer of one of the world\u2019s major reserve currencies,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a former head of the I.M.F.\u2019s China division who is now the Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University. But \u201cthe most likely scenario is that the renminbi will erode but not seriously rival the dollar\u2019s status as the dominant global reserve currency.\u201dThe changing currency dynamics also create new geopolitical concerns.As the renminbi becomes more deeply woven into the global economy, it undermines the ability of the West to impose financial sanctions on countries accused of human rights abuses and other violations, like Sudan and North Korea. Such countries can increasingly carry out transactions in renminbi. China contends that it is crucial to respect nations\u2019 sovereignty and that leaders should be allowed to set policy without fearing international criticism or intervention. China remains a close business and financial partner of Sudan and North Korea. Mr. Xi invited the president of Sudan to a recent military parade in Beijing.\u201cAs the renminbi rises, countries will have more choices about where they do their banking \u2014 and how to potentially circumvent sanctions,\u201d said Christopher Brummer, a Georgetown University law professor specializing in currencies. Beijing\u2019s effort to position the renminbi as a rival to the dollar traces back to the innocuously named \u201cDocument 217.\u201dThe Chinese central bank posted the document on its website with little fanfare in August 2010. But buried in the document\u2019s technical jargon was an important measure with global implications.Under a new rule, China would start allowing other countries\u2019 central banks to begin buying its bonds in Shanghai. Officials in other countries just had to get permission first from the People\u2019s Bank of China.Nigeria was paying close attention. Lamido Sanusi, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, had already been mulling whether to park part of the country\u2019s $40 billion in foreign exchange reserves in renminbi.A prominent Islamic scholar, he was the son of an influential Nigerian prince who served as his country\u2019s ambassador to China during the Cultural Revolution. Back then, his father advocated a shift by Africa away from Western dominance and toward closer relations with China.When Mr. Sanusi became the central bank chief in 2009, Nigeria had extensive trade ties with China. In shifting a portion of reserves, he bet \u2014 correctly, as it turned out \u2014 that the renminbi would appreciate. Interest rates on renminbi-denominated bonds were also several percentage points higher than yields on comparable Treasuries.Nigeria started purchasing large sums of renminbi in the little-regulated Hong Kong market in 2010, rather than Shanghai as the Chinese rules prescribed, and without seeking Beijing\u2019s permission. Mr. Sanusi then stunned the Chinese government by mentioning at a conference a few weeks later in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, that his country was ready to put up to a tenth of its entire reserves, or $4 billion, into renminbi.\u201cThe Chinese Embassy came over and met me,\u201d said Mr. Sanusi, who last year was crowned Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, the traditional and religious leader of Kano State in northern Nigeria. \u201cThey just wanted to have clarity.\u201dChinese officials, he said, were pleased that a major trading partner in Africa liked the renminbi. But Nigeria\u2019s move also posed a dilemma. Large-scale purchases of renminbi by overseas central banks would make it more difficult for China to prevent the renminbi from appreciating, which in turn would make exports less competitive.When Nigeria eventually requested permission to buy bonds in Shanghai, the Chinese central bank agreed, although it tightly capped the purchases. \u201cWe got something less than what we applied for,\u201d said Lamido Yuguda, the director of reserve management at the Central Bank of Nigeria, declining to provide precise figures. \u201cIt was something we could live with.\u201dAfter the experience with Nigeria, China moved slowly and cautiously on further currency liberalization over the next four years. The government did not encourage other central banks to buy large sums of renminbi. Instead, China entered into a series of swap agreements with dozens of countries like Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Germany and Iceland.Under these agreements, China said it would provide billions of renminbi if the other country needed them in a crisis. But China would keep the renminbi until that point, so that any interim purchases would not be sufficient to push up the value of the currency.Beijing\u2019s cautious strategy backfired this year, when China ramped up its campaign for I.M.F. reserve status. One of the I.M.F.\u2019s main considerations is that the currency be \u201cfreely usable.\u201dThe People\u2019s Bank of China acknowledged last spring that other central banks held a modest $108 billion worth of renminbi, about 1 percent of total foreign exchange holdings by central banks. By contrast, central banks had $500 billion worth of swap agreements to obtain renminbi, more than for any other currency, including the dollar.Beijing lobbied hard through the spring to persuade the I.M.F. to consider the swaps as evidence that the renminbi was \u201cfreely usable.\u201d But the United States and other countries opposed bending I.M.F. rules.The fund decided during the summer to stick to more traditional criteria, like the amount of currency that central banks had been able to buy and how easily the renminbi could be traded. After that, the I.M.F. pressed the Chinese central bank to make its currency more responsive to market forces.China had to move fast. After this year, the next chance to push the renminbi into the fund\u2019s accounting system would not come until 2020.During the summer, Chinese officials made a series of rapid-fire moves, most notably devaluing the currency by 4.4 percent against the dollar as part of a new method for setting the daily trading range of the renminbi. The process would give the market more influence over the daily value of the renminbi, which is set each morning by the central bank.The aftermath of the devaluation has been a shock to China\u2019s system, providing a window into the uncertainty the country now faces with a more globally oriented currency.After the devaluation, many Chinese companies moved to pay off foreign debts for fear the renminbi would fall further. Investors also sold huge sums of renminbi and switched into other currencies. China\u2019s central bank spent nearly $100 billion in August alone to prop up the renminbi.\u201cMaking it more market-based makes it more difficult to manage,\u201d said Larry Hu, the chief China economist in the Hong Kong office of Macquarie Capital Securities. \u201cBut making it more market-based also makes it more efficient.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China and U.S. Say They\u2019ve Made Strides in Trade Talks", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 In their first top-level trade talks since President Obama hosted China\u2019s leader in September, the United States and China said on Monday that they had made progress on sticking points, including preventing the theft of trade secrets and opening the Chinese market more broadly to American multinationals.Still, the lack of larger breakthroughs on bigger issues \u2014 like negotiations for a broad trade deal \u2014 contrasted with America\u2019s improving economic ties with the rest of Asia.The two countries have been eyeing each other cautiously.President Xi Jinping is pushing for China, with its newfound financial muscle, to play a greater role in the global economy. But his sometimes nationalistic stance has squeezed Western multinationals operating in China.Two days of trade talks in this southern port city yielded modest commitments from China to address some issues.Officials agreed to extend better legal protections to American companies that have lost trade secrets to theft, including clarifying their ability to seek preliminary injunctions in Chinese courts. They also made progress on opening the Chinese market wider to American manufacturers of drugs and medical devices, specifically easing the path to clinical trials.China also appeared to step back further from regulations that were proposed this year \u2014 but shelved \u2014 that would have encouraged its huge banking sector to favor locally made technology and communication products.\u201cWe\u2019re tackling these issues in a fairly open, frank and candid manner that I think is allowing us to make progress,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary of the United States, said on Monday in an interview after the annual talks, which have been held since the 1980s and are known as the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade.Given the often-technical nature of the negotiations between the United States and China, \u201cthe expectations weren\u2019t real high,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who was here for the talks. \u201cBut it was important that the forum addressed issues raised by Obama and Xi.\u201dChina is on track this year to surpass Canada as the biggest single trading partner of the United States. But as trade has ballooned in recent years, tensions have grown. China sells far more goods to the United States than it buys, resulting in a Chinese trade surplus with the United States of $218 billion in the first 10 months of this year.Despite an overall slump in China\u2019s exports and imports this year, Chinese factories continue to do brisk business selling goods to Americans. China\u2019s merchandise exports to the United States rose 5.2 percent in the first 10 months of the year to a record $340 billion, according to Chinese customs data. China\u2019s overall exports, by contrast, have declined 2.5 percent over the same period.American companies as varied as soybean farms and shampoo manufacturers are also making fast progress in tapping the rapidly changing Chinese consumer market. Matthew Price, the greater China chairman of Procter & Gamble, noted in a speech Sunday to American and Chinese business leaders on the sidelines of the trade talks how Chinese women on average use more skin moisturizers than their American counterparts. More than a third of the company\u2019s sales in China take place online, compared with only about 10 percent in the United States, he added.Among the more controversial issues in the trade relationship have been Beijing\u2019s many limits on foreign services companies, which in America contribute the biggest share of economic output.On the Chinese side, officials want broader access to acquisitions in the United States, especially when it comes to American regulatory treatment of China\u2019s tens of thousands of state-owned enterprises. Of particular concern to the Chinese has been the transparency of the review process for deals carried out by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which involves many government agencies and is led by the Treasury Department.Zhang Xiangchen, the deputy China international trade representative at China\u2019s ministry of commerce, said on Monday after the talks that the United States and China hoped to expand trade, but obstacles remained.\u201cChina\u2019s investments in the U.S. are subject to some barriers, such as uncertain and untransparent security checks,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cOn the other hand, the U.S. hopes China can open up its market more. Both these concerns are legitimate.\u201dBeyond the services sector, another area of intense American interest has been greater access to the Chinese market for American agricultural products, and seeking greater clarity on the regulatory and scientific standards that Beijing imposes on imports.Despite lobbying here by American officials, including Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, China appeared ready to give little immediate ground on this issue.\u201cWe need to be open to importing advanced technology and enriching the variety of food offered to the people,\u201d Wang Yang, the vice premier in charge of trade issues who led the Chinese delegation, said at a briefing on Sunday.\u201cAt the same time, we must protect the interests of our 700 million farmers,\u201d Mr. Wang added. \u201cIn recent years, our agricultural costs have been rising, but prices have hit a ceiling caused by the decline in international commodity prices. We face a lot of challenges in terms of how to increase farmers\u2019 incomes and achieve sustainable agricultural development.\u201dMs. Pritzker said that, in response to concerns raised by Mr. Wang, the United States would revise how it handles controls on exports to China of civilian technologies it now deems delicate.\u201cWe have agreed to develop a mechanism to improve the exchange of information on individual cases of commercial high-tech items exported to China,\u201d Ms. Pritzker said.A picture caption with an article on Tuesday about trade negotiations between the United States and China, using information from Agence France-Presse, misspelled the surname of a Chinese Communist Party official who was shown with Penny Pritzker, the American commerce secretary. He is Wang Huning, not Hunig.Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Austerity\u2019s Grim Legacy", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen economic crisis struck in 2008, policy makers by and large did the right thing. The Federal Reserve and other central banks realized that supporting the financial system took priority over conventional notions of monetary prudence. The Obama administration and its counterparts realized that in a slumping economy budget deficits were helpful, not harmful. And the money-printing and borrowing worked: A repeat of the Great Depression, which seemed all too possible at the time, was avoided.Then it all went wrong. And the consequences of the wrong turn we took look worse now than the harshest critics of conventional wisdom ever imagined.For those who don\u2019t remember (it\u2019s hard to believe how long this has gone on): In 2010, more or less suddenly, the policy elite on both sides of the Atlantic decided to stop worrying about unemployment and start worrying about budget deficits instead.This shift wasn\u2019t driven by evidence or careful analysis. In fact, it was very much at odds with basic economics. Yet ominous talk about the dangers of deficits became something everyone said because everyone else was saying it, and dissenters were no longer considered respectable \u2014 which is why I began describing those parroting the orthodoxy of the moment as Very Serious People.Yet there\u2019s growing evidence that we critics actually underestimated just how destructive the turn to austerity would be. Specifically, it now looks as if austerity policies didn\u2019t just impose short-term losses of jobs and output, but they also crippled long-run growth.What this suggests is that the turn to austerity had truly catastrophic effects, going far beyond the jobs and income lost in the first few years. In fact, the long-run damage suggested by the Fat\u00e1s-Summers estimates is easily big enough to make austerity a self-defeating policy even in purely fiscal terms: Governments that slashed spending in the face of depression hurt their economies, and hence their future tax receipts, so much that even their debt will end up higher than it would have been without the cuts.And the bitter irony of the story is that this catastrophic policy was undertaken in the name of long-run responsibility, that those who protested against the wrong turn were dismissed as feckless.There are a few obvious lessons from this debacle. \u201cAll the important people say so\u201d is not, it turns out, a good way to decide on policy; groupthink is no substitute for clear analysis. Also, calling for sacrifice (by other people, of course) doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re tough-minded.But will these lessons sink in? Past economic troubles, like the stagflation of the 1970s, led to widespread reconsideration of economic orthodoxy. But one striking aspect of the past few years has been how few people are willing to admit having been wrong about anything. It seems all too possible that the Very Serious People who cheered on disastrous policies will learn nothing from the experience. And that is, in its own way, as scary as the economic outlook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Aeroflot, It\u2019s Patriotism Over Profits as Russia Pressures Industry", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 All smiles and cheery banter, the flight attendants greeted travelers on board Russia\u2019s newest passenger jet.\u201cWelcome aboard and watch your head,\u201d one attendant chirped courteously, holding her gloved hand atop the airplane\u2019s diminutive door frame, lest passengers knock their heads.As Aeroflot folds Russian-made jets back into its fleet, cramped doorways are just one of its challenges.To help support homegrown companies in the midst of a downturn and Western sanctions, the government is pushing Aeroflot to buy the new Russian Superjets by Sukhoi. The manufacturer is best known for building the fighters and bombers now streaking over Syria.Across Russia, companies are being forced to prioritize patriotism over profits.Worried about unemployment and political unrest, the government pushed back when Avtovaz, the maker of Lada cars, moved quickly to cut workers as the economy slowed. To save money, the company instead announced a lengthy Christmas holiday, from Dec. 18 until Jan. 17.For years, Sberbank tried to transform itself into a global, customer-friendly institution. But those efforts were blunted by Western sanctions over Russia\u2019s interventions in Ukraine, which limit Sberbank\u2019s overseas business dealings.In recent years, Aeroflot, the Russian national airline, which is 51 percent state-owned, has overcome its reputation for abrasive service, poor safety and weak financial returns. Since the turnaround, the airline has come to be considered one of the country\u2019s corporate champions.But that lofty position now means the Russian government is turning to Aeroflot for help. Aeroflot, which flies 118 Airbuses and 25 Boeings, has 21 Sukhoi Superjets in its fleet. An additional 29 Superjets are on order.Judging by passenger chatter, the squat, chubby Superjet is not many travelers\u2019 first choice for getting around. \u201cAn idiotic plane,\u201d one customer wrote on Aeroflot\u2019s website after taking a flight on the Superjet. \u201cFor me, all routes this tub flies are off limits. Once was enough.\u201dAs the Kremlin has taken a more hands-on role in the downturn, investors have reassessed their thinking on Russian businesses once considered emerging-market darlings.Shares in the MSCI Russia Index are now trading at a minuscule 5.4 price-to-earnings ratio, a common gauge of investor confidence in future profits. By comparison, the price-earnings ratio on the broad MSCI emerging market index is 11.1.\u201cClearly, this is one reason the Russian market is very cheap,\u201d Daniel Salter, head of equity strategy at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank, said of government pressure on businesses. \u201cInvestors are well aware of that kind of risk.\u201dAeroflot is dealing with a long list of government demands.Along with buying Russian-made planes, Aeroflot stepped in this fall to fly passengers stranded by the bankruptcy of its largest rival, Transaero. Aeroflot also paid for the fuel for Transaero\u2019s remaining flights. Altogether, Aeroflot estimates this has cost it at least 5 billion rubles, or around $75 million.Aeroflot is also being pressured by the government to fly unprofitable routes to far-flung Siberian cities, so people in these places have at least some means of transportation. The company receives state subsidies for ticket sales to certain destinations.Even in Russia, the Superjet remains a rarity for now. Sukhoi says about 66 planes are in operation altogether.Even with the added obligations, Aeroflot is still reporting operating profits, albeit a net loss over all. Executives also indicate that the national flag carrier should be flying domestically made airplanes.\u201cEvery big company carries out activities to show it is acting responsibly toward the people it serves, and we do this, too, and we are proud of it,\u201d said Aleksandr F. Lukashin, Aeroflot\u2019s spokesman.Aeroflot is an outlier in the Russian economy, which is expected to shrink by about 4 percent this year.The number of passengers flying Aeroflot is growing even as passenger volumes broadly are declining. In the first nine months of this year, Aeroflot\u2019s passenger volume was up 10.3 percent while overall air travel was down 3.4 percent in Russia, according to company and transport ministry figures.It\u2019s a riddle explained partly by the luck of geography.As part of its strategy, Aeroflot has been promoting its hub in Moscow as a steppingstone between Europe, North America and Asia. Moscow is farther north than the hubs of other airlines trying this strategy, like Turkish Airlines in Istanbul or Emirates in Dubai.In that sense, Aeroflot has a time advantage as it tries to capture a swelling number of Chinese passengers. Aeroflot says a flight from New York to Shanghai via Moscow, for example, is two hours shorter than via Dubai, the hub of Emirates. Aeroflot\u2019s Moscow-to-Rome flight is now 80 percent filled with Chinese, all of them connecting through Russia for European trips.Aeroflot responded by ramping up safety.The airline now has among the youngest fleet of airplanes of all the major carriers. As of December 2014, Aeroflot\u2019s fleet was 4.3 years old on average, surpassed by the Brazilian airline Azul, with an average aircraft age of 4.1. By comparison, the average age of Delta\u2019s fleet is 17; at British Airways, it is 12.6.For years, Aeroflot, a carrier with close political ties to the family of former President Boris N. Yeltsin, had shunned pleas from Russia\u2019s beleaguered aircraft manufacturers to buy domestically, citing safety concerns. Looking to solidify its own reputation, the carrier assembled a fleet of Boeings and Airbuses.Now, Aeroflot is relenting.It increased Superjet orders just this year; when delivered, those jets will bring its total to 50. Aeroflot has also ordered 50 planes of a new midrange model, still under development, called the MS-21 and made by United Aircraft Corporation, a Russian company.Still, Aeroflot is not taking chances. The company has put special emphasis on pilot training.At its training center near the Sheremetyevo International Airport, Vladimir N. Ponomarev, a gruff, chiseled flight instructor at Aeroflot, has made a career of killing Russian pilots in midair disasters \u2014 all simulated, of course.On a recent day, he stood, arms folded, watching a gigantic cockpit simulator that imitates a Superjet in flight gyrate and vibrate on its hydraulic legs.Clearly, the pilots had encountered a problem in the simulated flight. Pilots get 48 hours of simulator training to fly the Superjet after flying Boeing, Airbus or other airplanes. The boxy, plastic cabin veered violently, and then came to rest. A door opened and two pilots emerged, wide-eyed.Mr. Ponomarev said he teaches the basic skills. \u201cIf you can fly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can fly any airplane.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There\u2019s a long list of Republicans and Democrats who think he could.But our biggest beef with the review is the assertion that Kemp\u2019s signal achievement \u2014 the across-the-board supply-side tax cut proposal (\u201cKemp-Roth\u201d) that became the basis of Reaganomics \u2014 \u201cwas a disaster.\u201d According to Noah, Reaganomics produced bigger deficits, more inequality and nothing to ease the recession. He ignores the Reagan recovery as if it never occurred and barely mentions what it replaced, the miserable era of high unemployment, inflation and interest rates in the 1970s. The tax cuts, by the way, didn\u2019t take full effect until after the recession.Afterward, there was a boom, not a disaster. The economy grew 7.8 percent in 1983, 5.6 percent in 1984, 4.3 percent in 1985, and averaged 4.5 percent for the rest of Reagan\u2019s presidency and 3.7 percent through 2000. Sixteen million jobs were created during the Reagan years. Deficits grew, but falling revenues don\u2019t account for it. A big increase in spending \u2014 from 20 percent of G.D.P. in the 1970s to 22.2 percent under Reagan \u2014 does.Reagan\u2019s increased outlays were mainly for defense \u2014 part of the \u201cpeace through strength\u201d strategy that eventually toppled the Soviet Union \u2014 and for interest on the national debt, which had to be repaid in non-inflated dollars.As to income inequality, the Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler recently addressed Elizabeth Warren\u2019s claim that the bottom 90 percent got \u201czero percent\u201d of wage growth after Reagan. He points out that while the rich got richer from 1970 to 2011, \u201cother groups also saw a sizable improvement in household incomes\u201d when taxes and income transfers are counted. The Congressional Budget Office found that Americans in the bottom fifth of income gained 50 percent, those in the middle fifth, 36 percent by those measures.The bottom line for us is that Kemp-Roth and Reaganomics worked \u2014 economically, politically and geopolitically. Indeed, the public did not feel a disaster had occurred. In 1979, only 13 percent of Americans were satisfied with the way things were going; that number reached 66 percent in 1986, its highest point ever.Now we\u2019re in trouble again as we were in the 1970s. Incomes are flat. Growth is glacial. Voters are furious. Washington is paralyzed. What we need is ideas, not insults and more division.

It thereby becomes a criticism of Catholicism and secular culture where loss of meaning is paramount and the intolerance and uniformity of Islam become attractive. The threat of Islamic extremism is real, yet the real problem is the ennui and disillusionment of contemporary European culture. The central theme is that we are vulnerable to the extremes of Islam (or any intolerant ideology) and will readily submit as it fills a cultural and, in the case of the book, a personal void.LARRY HOFFNERNEW YORKAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Outcry, Ireland Adjusts Its Corporate Tax Draw", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCORK, Ireland \u2014 As lord mayor of this quiet seaside city in southern Ireland, Chris O\u2019Leary seems to have a situation most other local politicians can only dream about.Blue-chip international companies like Apple, Dell and IBM have all set up shop in and around this city, filling newly built office blocks near the city\u2019s port and sprawling office parks in the suburbs. The companies set up shop here for the cheap workers, business-friendly lawmakers and \u2014 above all \u2014 Ireland\u2019s low corporate tax rate. Since the height of the financial crisis in 2011, the region\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen by more than four percentage points, to 9.9 percent, or roughly the national average, according to government statistics.\u201cWhat has made us different is how we\u2019ve gone about our business,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Leary, 55, in his City Hall office, decorated with a black-and-white photo of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s visit here in 1963 and a copy of the city\u2019s centuries-old charter.That way of business is now under attack, though \u2014 and the potential benefit of Ireland\u2019s most recent tax strategy for attracting companies is in doubt.But many tax experts say the benefits will be significantly smaller than many had expected, particularly for global tech giants.Because of recent changes to global agreements, Ireland must limit what type of intellectual property can be included in these low-tax structures, known locally as a \u201cknowledge development box.\u201d Such restrictions have been demanded by several European countries, particularly Germany, which raised concerns that Ireland and other countries would turn to such structures to unfairly bring down corporate tax rates.Under international law, Ireland and other countries like Britain and potentially the United States can offer the tax breaks only on intellectual property derived from research carried out in their national borders. Much of the research and development for technology companies is done outside Ireland. So revenue from global patents like those linked to Google\u2019s search algorithm, many of which were developed in the United States, will not be eligible for the reduced tax.\u201cIt won\u2019t be much help to many international companies,\u201d said Anna Scally, head of the technology, media and telecom practice in Ireland at KPMG, an accounting company that has helped global companies with their Irish tax arrangements.Some local policy makers are concerned that Ireland\u2019s ability to entice international companies may be hampered by the restrictions on the country\u2019s latest tax proposals. But others cite Ireland\u2019s flexible (and increasingly multicultural) work force and its close ties to the United States as the reasons global companies, particularly those from the tech industry, will continue to knock on Ireland\u2019s door.\u201cWe\u2019re closer to Boston than we are to Berlin,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Leary, Cork\u2019s mayor. \u201cCompanies aren\u2019t just coming for the corporate tax rate.\u201dWhile lawmakers often play down its importance, Ireland\u2019s 12.5 percent tax rate (versus 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States) has been a mainstay in the country\u2019s decades-long strategy to attract the world\u2019s largest companies. With few natural and manufacturing resources, Ireland and its politicians instead have turned to one of the world\u2019s lowest corporate tax rates as the country\u2019s primary competitive advantage in the global economy.\u201cWe see tax as just part of the overall package that we can offer companies,\u201d Richard Bruton, Ireland\u2019s minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation, said in an interview.Companies do not appear to be shying away from the country. Representatives from Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook declined to comment on Ireland\u2019s new tax mechanism. But just last week, for instance, Apple said it would increase its work force in Cork by 20 percent, to 6,000 employees, by 2017. IBM and Pfizer, the drug maker, also recently announced plans to expand their Irish operations.Mark Redmond, head of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, a lobbying group that represents many of the companies, said there were other incentives, including tax breaks of up to 25 percent on research and development conducted in Ireland, that still were available to international companies.\u201cThe knowledge development box is not the only show in town,\u201d Mr. Redmond said.And experts say global pharmaceutical companies, many of which operate research and development facilities in Ireland, could benefit from the country\u2019s 6.25 percent tax rate on revenue derived from locally held intellectual property more than their counterparts in the tech industry.\u201cThe low rate eventually could encourage companies to carry out R.&D. here in Ireland,\u201d said Joe Tynan, head of tax at PricewaterhouseCoopers in the accountancy firm\u2019s Dublin office.Still, for regulators who have tried to limit Ireland\u2019s tax advantage, the restrictions placed on the country\u2019s knowledge development box represent a victory in the global push to close unfair tax loopholes. Some companies in Ireland had lobbied for a wider definition of what type of intellectual property, especially linked to online advertising and search patents moved from other countries to Ireland, could be included in the tax mechanism. Those efforts, though, failed.Pascal Saint-Amans, tax director at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has been charged with drafting new standards to avoid multinational tax avoidance, said these low-tax mechanisms had to be linked solely to intellectual property from research and development conducted within a country\u2019s borders.Otherwise, Mr. Saint-Amans added, international companies could unfairly move patents between countries in a bid to pay the lowest amount of tax.\u201cThe greater amount of global intellectual property you include in these mechanisms, the more likely it is that they will be harmful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal should be to attract real R.&D. to a country, not to compete just on tax rates.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s New Leadership Reverses Course on Climate Change", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 In less than a month, Canada has executed a complete about-face on global climate change.With the defeat of the Conservatives in the October general election, out went nearly a decade of Canada making itself something of a global outcast on the issue. The record of the former prime minister, Stephen Harper, on climate change was marked by retreat, foot-dragging, and hand-wringing over the economic consequences of moving too quickly.The swift about-face put Ed Whittingham, one of the country\u2019s most prominent environmentalists, briefly at a loss for words in a recent interview. \u201cWhat adjective can I use?\u201d Mr. Whittingham, the executive director of the Pembina Institute, asked after a moment. \u201cMarked? Dramatic? Significant? They all apply.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll demonstrate that we are serious about climate change,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said after a four-hour dinner with the premiers. \u201cThis means making decisions based on science; it means reducing carbon emissions, including through carbon pricing towards a climate-resilient economy.\u201d Several of the provincial leaders voiced similar sentiments.Mr. Harper would never have said that. Though he acknowledged a need for some action during his decade in power, he withdrew Canada from the Kyoto accord on climate change and warned about the economic consequences of moving faster than the United States.Canada has made a bit of progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but most of it has come from the provinces: Ontario has stopped burning coal to produce electricity, for instance, and Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta have introduced carbon taxes of varying effectiveness. At the federal level, though, Mr. Harper lowered emission-reduction targets that had been set by an earlier Liberal government, calling them unrealistic, and then failed to meet even the lowered targets.Overall emissions have been rising in Canada in recent years, after dipping during the 2008 recession. The latest available figures show the country emitting 726 million metric tons of carbon in 2013 \u2014 and given that, Mr. Harper\u2019s critics argued that his government\u2019s policies could not possibly get them down to the goal of 611 million by 2020.So far, Mr. Trudeau has been careful not to attach specifics numbers to his promises, saying only that the goals will be more ambitious and that they must be developed in cooperation with the provinces. The federal government can regulate emissions from factories and vehicles, but the provinces have control over natural resources and many areas of business regulation, making their participation vital to any national plan\u2019s success.With Alberta now in the hands of the New Democrats, it should be much easier for Mr. Trudeau to reach an agreement. Alberta did have a carbon tax before the election, but it was widely viewed as inadequate, and the former governing party, the Progressive Conservatives, who ran the province for four decades, seemed unwilling to press the oil and gas industry on the issue; energy royalties are a major source of provincial revenue.Most countries have pledged their greenhouse gas emissions goals. The pledges are the biggest cut ever achieved, but are still not enough.\u201cThe Alberta announcement takes away the biggest barrier Canada has had on climate action,\u201d said Dale Marshall, national program manager at Environmental Defence, an environmental group based in Toronto.The new government\u2019s efforts on climate change are something of a vindication for St\u00e9phane Dion, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s foreign affairs minister and a key adviser on climate issues. When Mr. Dion led the Liberals in the 2008 election, he based his unsuccessful campaign against Mr. Harper around an environmental platform that included carbon taxes.Without time to develop a detailed plan, Mr. Trudeau and his colleagues will not be able to present much more than their good intentions in Paris. Mr. Trudeau has given himself and the provincial premiers 90 days after the conference to work out specifics.Mr. Marshall expects Mr. Trudeau to offer the provinces incentives to set and meet emission reduction targets \u2014 for example, extra money for transit projects.Mr. Trudeau has told the provinces they will be free to reach their emissions targets by whatever means they prefer. That will preserve the current situation, with some provinces using carbon taxes and others a cap-and-trade system to hold emissions down.Mr. Marshall said he hoped that the province-by-province approach will eventually evolve toward a single national system.Working out the specifics will not be easy. \u201cIn some ways, the task is quite daunting,\u201d Mr. Marshall said.Mr. Thomas-Muller said that while his group was not entirely in sync with Mr. Trudeau on the issue, the new prime minister had certainly changed the conversation in Canada on climate change.\u201cThis government has certainly taken positive, hopeful actions in its first few weeks of government,\u201d he said by telephone from Winnipeg, Manitoba. \u201cThere is some kind of a renaissance happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mennonite\u2019s Knack for Fine Goat Cheese", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosBLOOMSDALE, Mo. \u2014 A Mennonite woman with a used 2001 Porsche Boxster and a Hello Kitty collection is making some of the most delicious French-style goat cheese in America.The affection for Hello Kitty is a holdover from Veronica Baetje\u2019s childhood. So is the Porsche. She got a taste for foreign cars helping her father in his south St. Louis repair shop. A few years ago, she figured there was no real harm in shedding the plain dark sedans favored by the Mennonites for something more fun.The car doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the quality of her velvet rounds of aged goat cheese or her pine ash-coated pyramids, which have won major competitions and enchanted cheesemongers from California to England. But racing through the back roads of this pocket of eastern Missouri with Ms. Baetje, her traditional head covering blowing in the wind and a Diet Pepsi in the cupholder, whatever one may think about American goat cheese and its relationship to God begins to shift.\u201cI\u2019m not saying, \u2018Eat this cheese and you\u2019ll become spiritual,\u2019 \u201d she said, taking a curve and heading toward Ste. Genevieve, Mo., a little town on the Mississippi River started by French Canadian colonists almost 300 years ago. \u201cI just promised God that if he would allow us to have this business, I would talk about him whenever I could.\u201dGoat\u2019s milk is delicate, filled with tiny, fragile fat globules. It\u2019s harder to work with than the milk from a sheep or a cow. Slosh it around too much, and the protein strands break down. Get the slightest bit rough with the soft curds, and they won\u2019t hold as much moisture. Without moisture, the cheese won\u2019t cooperate in the aging room.\u201cThe care with which they ladle this milk out of the vats and into the forms is extraordinary,\u201d said Kate Arding, a British-born dairy consultant who founded Culture, a cheese magazine, and is a co-owner of the cheese and food shop Talbott & Arding in Hudson, N.Y. She first met Ms. Baetje when they were speakers at a conference for Amish cheese makers.\u201cHer cheese is just in a different league,\u201d Ms. Arding said. \u201cThere is a quality to them which comes from a lightness of touch. A lot of it lies not in the flavor but in the texture.\u201dMost people who start making goat cheese are happy if they can produce a decent fresh ch\u00e9vre. But early on, Mrs. Baetje began punching above her weight.\u201cWhen you start making goat cheese, you don\u2019t go for a washed rind disk or these cheeses that have this kind of complexity and are so fraught with opportunities to go south,\u201d said Matt Rubiner, who owns a specialty cheese shop in Great Barrington, N.Y.That\u2019s not to say Mrs. Baetje\u2019s cheese is always perfect, he said. They are so delicate that shipping can be risky. Sometimes they are too crumbly or break down too quickly under the rind. But when they are perfect, he said, \u201cthey are very, very special.\u201dThey are also rare. Mrs. Baetje tries to turn out at least 750 pounds a week, which includes a lot of hand-shaped hearts of fresh ch\u00e9vre flavored with herbs or, this time of year, pumpkin. She sells a few other versions, including a nutty aged cheese called Amoureux, with a vein of ash inspired by Morbier, that uses a blend of goat\u2019s and sheep\u2019s milk.Sometimes Mrs. Baetje and her cheese show up in New York City. Shops, including Saxelby Cheesemongers, Lucy\u2019s Whey and Campbell Cheese & Grocery, often carry it. She even hands out samples at places like Zabar\u2019s. Her plain dress and religious devotion sometimes make her a target.In a recent encounter on the Upper West Side, a shopper told her: \u201c \u2018When you tell me you\u2019re from Missouri, that tells me you\u2019re na\u00efve,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Baetje said, recalling the episode. \u201cI thought, \u2018Yeah, and I just rode in here on my cow.\u2019 But I just asked her if she\u2019d like to try some cheese, and she loved it.\u201dThey tried mightily to have children. Mrs. Baetje had a handful of miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy that nearly killed her. They both began seeking a deeper spiritual connection. She started wearing a head covering because she read a Bible passage that urges women to cover their heads when they pray. A group of Mennonite women noticed.\u201cWe were really searching for healing and a deeper religious experience to bring us comfort and understanding in our situation, and here come the Mennonites,\u201d she said.Soon, the couple moved to a rural Mennonite community in southern Illinois, taking up a life light on technology and filled with farming, prayer and hard work.\u201cI don\u2019t think living in the age of the Jetsons is so great,\u201d she said. \u201cI just like doing these peaceful, Heidi-like things.\u201dThey got their first goat in 1998. \u201cShe wanted a cow but we didn\u2019t need that much milk,\u201d said Mr. Baetje, who is often up by 3 a.m. to milk their herd. She talked librarians into ordering books on cheese-making and learned how to care for her goats.An early mentor, the Canadian cheesemaker Margaret Peters-Morris, told her the process of turning milk from her own animals into cheese made her feel as if she were part of the cycle of life.\u201cThat was the first time I realized that, yeah, I don\u2019t have children but this is really a connection for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt a little robbed that I didn\u2019t get to have my own family and my own children. But here I was able to take of this goat, harvest her milk, help her birth her kids, and then I felt like I wasn\u2019t left out.\u201dStill, they felt out of place in the Mennonite community, where families with 10 children were common. The economy in southern Illinois was depressed. So were they. After seven years with the Mennonites, they moved their 40 beloved goats to this farm, about an hour\u2019s drive south of St. Louis, and got serious about the cheese business.She tinkers constantly with her cheeses, worrying over every detail. Especially, she prays that she will have enough of the silky milk she depends on. Her label includes a Bible quote: And thou shalt have goat\u2019s milk enough. Her invoices and website and even her barn hold more Bible quotes. It is off-putting to some cheese mongers, who won\u2019t sell her cheese.\u201cAs a small-business person I try to have a pretty big separation of church and state and business and politics,\u201d said Steve Jones, who owns Cheese Bar and Chizu in Portland, Ore. (He notes that he is a fan of the cheese, even though he won\u2019t sell it.)But cheese making owes much to religion, particularly the cheese developed by European monastic orders, said Gordon Edgar, the longtime cheese buyer for San Francisco\u2019s Rainbow Grocery Cooperative and the author of the new book \u201cCheddar: A Journey to the Heart of America\u2019s Most Iconic Cheese.\u201d He is a big fan of Mrs. Baetje and her cheese.\u201cSome people praise the terroir for the cheese, and other people praise God for the cheese,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there really a difference?\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Administration Plans Forum on High Drug Prices", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Trying to turn up the political heat on the pharmaceutical industry, the Obama administration announced on Tuesday that it would hold a forum this month on the high prices of some prescription drugs.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said Tuesday that she would hold a daylong conference on Nov. 20 to consider ways of speeding up the discovery of innovative drug treatments while making them more affordable.In an invitation to the forum, the government said: \u201cIn general, the development of new, innovative medicines has been good for both patients and our economy. However, the high and growing cost of drugs has created hardship for families, employers and states. Specialty medications represent only 1 percent of all prescriptions but, in 2014, these medications resulted in over 31 percent of all drug spending.\u201dMs. Burwell sent the invitation to pharmaceutical executives, patients\u2019 advocates, doctors and hospital executives, employers, insurance carriers and state officials. Participants, she said, will discuss proposals to increase access to prescription drugs, reduce costs, encourage innovation and promote competition among makers of traditional drugs and biotechnology medicines.The agenda makes no mention of price controls, but the program is scheduled to begin with a panel on \u201cthe impact of rising pharmaceutical costs.\u201d The federal government pays some of those costs through Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for older Americans, people with disabilities and those with low incomes.Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said the forum would focus on \u201can incredibly important issue.\u201d\u201cWe have a broken market for drugs,\u201d said Dr. Bach, a frequent critic of pricing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cUnconstrained price increases are being translated into unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for patients. Patients are not taking medicines that would help them because we can\u2019t figure out how to get drugs priced according to their value.\u201dNew drugs to treat cancer, including some that are highly effective, often cost more than $50,000 or even $100,000 a year. Effective new drugs to treat hepatitis C can cost up to $1,000 a pill, though in recent months purchasers have often been able to negotiate significant discounts.Consumer groups and many hospital executives have complained about recent large increases in the cost of some generic drugs that have been on the market for years.In his budget request in February, President Obama asked Congress to let Medicare officials negotiate prices with drug manufacturers \u2014 a practice forbidden by current law. Republicans, though concerned about projected increases in Medicare spending, have resisted efforts to allow the government to negotiate or regulate drug prices.At the same time, Mr. Obama proposed a major new initiative to develop drugs tailored to the genetic characteristics of individual patients. The \u201cprecision medicine\u201d initiative, led by the National Institutes of Health, has received bipartisan support in Congress. If it succeeds, it could lead to many more high-cost medications, like those already available to treat some forms of cancer and cystic fibrosis.The pharmaceutical industry has opposed government price-setting for prescription drugs and has challenged the view that drugs fuel the growth of national health spending.\u201cEven with new treatments and cures for hepatitis C, high cholesterol and cancer, spending on retail prescription medicines is projected to remain approximately 10 percent of U.S. health care spending through 2024, the same percentage as in 1960,\u201d said Robert E. Zirkelbach, a spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobby for drug makers. He added that in the last two decades, the death rate from cancer has fallen 22 percent, thanks in part to new medicines.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Needed for Paris Climate Talks: Handwarmers, Sleeping Bag, Stamina", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen packing to cover the Paris climate talks, I brought the standard reporter gear: laptop, iPhone, backup chargers, dozens of notebooks and pens, comfortable shoes. But also: a backpack, sleeping bag, handwarmers, and a case of Clif bars.I know from experience that covering the United Nations climate change negotiations can be the most physically grueling work you can do in a suit.During the 2009 Copenhagen climate change talks \u2014 held in December in a city on the edge of the Arctic Circle \u2014 the security lines were so long and slow that people stood outside the venue for up to eight hours on some days, waiting to get in (thus the handwarmers).Attendees in Paris feared similar waits in the wake of the recent terrorist attacks. But in a welcome surprise, the security lines here have been swift, efficient and friendly. There is evidence of beefed-up security, but it\u2019s not overwhelming.Once inside, reporting often requires athletic prowess. Tracking key negotiators as they are coming and going from private meetings \u2014 inevitably at opposite ends of a vast convention center \u2014 means regular sprints from one end corner to the other of a stadium-size venue to catch your subjects for fresh quotes and updatesInevitably the talks go into overtime. Much like college students and the United States Congress, United Nations negotiators are notorious for leaving everything to the last minute.Officially, the two-week Paris negotiating session is scheduled to conclude on the afternoon of Friday, Dec. 11. In the 23 years that the organization has held annual climate summits, they have not once concluded on time. Invariably, negotiators spend two weeks sketching up the outlines of a deal, but only start the serious brinkmanship \u2014 with high stakes, lines that can\u2019t be crossed and wild cards thrown into the mix \u2014 once the clock runs down on the last official day.And once the climate talks go into overtime, they do not stop. The diplomats keep negotiating through the night, the morning, the next day, the next night, the next morning until they finish or concede failure.That means the reporters who cover the negotiators stay too. After all, at any moment \u2014 say, 6 a.m. after 70 straight hours of negotiating \u2014 they could walk out with an announcement of a deal, or of failure.Either way, that moment is the biggest news story of the entire event, and a reporter covering it needs to be outside the rooms where the talks are happening, night after day after night. During the overnight sessions, there may be time for catnaps \u2014 but only at the risk of missing news.Once the talks head into overtime, the food venues in the centers often shut down (thus the Clif bars), and the temperature goes down, too.There can be some journalistic benefits to this process. At those talks in Lima, negotiators worked on Friday night through about 3 a.m. and then announced a 4-hour break. Bleary and delirious delegates staggered out of their meetings, many too exhausted to avoid reporters, and those of us who had been lying in wait were able to elicit punchy and candid quotes from typically cautious and reticent delegates.Is it possible that this method is not the best for forging sweeping \u2014 and complicated \u2014 legal deals designed to save the planet and reshape the global economy?This time President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France has demanded that negotiators agree on a near-final working text by the first weekend of the talks so that they will have a conclusive deal in time for the scheduled Friday closing ceremony.But the French government has quietly booked the convention center through the weekend after the talks are supposed to close.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Debate With Bernanke Over the Fed\u2019s Easy Money Policies", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneBy the end of our recent conversation, Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and I had a gentleman\u2019s bet. I believe the easy money policies he pushed for and put in place while serving as Fed chairman starting in 2008 (and that remain in place under his successor, Janet L. Yellen) will lead inevitably to a near-term financial crisis; he thinks that idea is beyond ridiculous.In the resulting investor melee, risk has been mispriced, creating a bubble and inflating the price of financial assets, such as those for debt and equity securities, corporate loans and leveraged loans \u2014 to say nothing of real estate, art and college tuition.Mr. Bernanke would have none of it, and seemed irritated at the very suggestion that the policies he introduced while Federal Reserve chairman would come to a bad end. Rather, he argued, the Fed\u2019s easy money policies kept a bad financial situation from getting worse. In effect, he is saying, he deserves praise, not criticism.He dismissed Mr. Druckenmiller as a mere \u201cgreat investor\u201d who should be disqualified from further comment because he predicted that the Fed\u2019s policies in 2008 and 2009 would lead to \u201chyperinflation,\u201d which has not happened. He dismissed Mr. Warsh, a former Wall Street investment banker, as \u201cnot an economist.\u201d He seemed generally dismissive of noneconomists. One can only imagine what he thinks of me.By this point, our pleasant conversation had turned a little testy. \u201cThe low rate of interest isn\u2019t something that God gave us here,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is a feature of the economy. There\u2019s a lot of savings in the world looking for a relatively small number of good-return investments, and so the equilibrium real interest rate in the economy is very, very low.\u201dHe said the Fed could have done two things: It could have moved interest rates toward \u201cthe equilibrium rate,\u201d which is the rate that encourages job creation and full employment, or it could have raised rates above the equilibrium rate, which he argued would have pushed the economy back into recession.\u201cThink about what is the Fed\u2019s alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed could raise interest rates prematurely \u2014 could\u2019ve raised rates in 2009 \u2014 but the economy would\u2019ve gone back into recession. They would\u2019ve had to cut rates again. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to sustain higher rates. The only way to get higher rates is if the economy is recovering.\u201dI suggested that perhaps the zero interest rate policy had gone on for too long, because the unemployment rate, now 5 percent, was below the 6.5 percent target rate that Mr. Bernanke himself had set for the Fed to consider ending the policy.That set him off, too. \u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no, we never did that,\u201d he countered. \u201cWe said we would not raise rates at least \u2013 very clearly, many times \u2013 at least until unemployment got to 6.5 percent. We never said we would when it got to 6.5 percent. We never said that.\u201dHe then explained \u201cthe correct way\u201d to look at the situation: There is a target interest rate that is consistent with full employment. \u201cAnd for most of the recovery,\u201d he said, \u201cthat number was actually negative. Any economist can explain why it would\u2019ve been negative at that point. So what the Fed was trying to do was get market rates down towards the interest rate that was consistent with full employment.\u201cThat\u2019s why, yes, the policy did lower interest rates \u2014 that\u2019s right \u2014 but even after lowering them, they were still too high. They were too high because of the zero lower bound. They were too high to get to the rate that was consistent with growth and recovery. If the Fed had not done what it did, we would still be in a much worse position.\u201dHe said that it was \u201ca red herring\u201d that quantitative easing or the zero interest rate policy helped make the rich richer and hurt the 45 million Americans who rely on their savings to get by. \u201cI think it helped everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular, if we hadn\u2019t done it, then we wouldn\u2019t have gotten whatever 11 or 12 million jobs created, and that helps the middle class and the working class. That\u2019s the most important thing you can do for them.\u201dHe conceded there was too much inequality in the United States today but denied that the Fed was to blame.\u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been increasing since the 1970s. It\u2019s due to globalization, technical change \u2014 a whole bunch of long-term trends. The Fed\u2019s effects on inequality are modest and temporary, and the fact that the Fed\u2019s policies created jobs means that the absolute benefits for the working class are very substantial.\u201dHe said the blame for the extended period of low interest rates belonged with Congress, not with the Fed.\u201cGo complain to Congress because the fiscal policy turned very contractionary, which meant the Fed had to bear the entire burden of creating a recovery,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf fiscal policy had been more balanced, then we could\u2019ve had the same recovery with higher interest rates. But because fiscal policy was contractionary, and Congress said essentially, \u2018The Fed will take care of it,\u2019 then the Fed could use the only tool it had.\u201dEven if quantitative easing and the zero interest rate policy did benefit the wealthy, \u201cwhat should the Fed have done?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot kept interest rates low? So, increase rates early on? I don\u2019t understand what the alternative would be.\u201dAnd what about the asset-price bubble, the subject of our wager? He said he was not worried that prices of some assets had increased. What he does worry about, he said, is that when the Fed inevitably raises interest rates, the economic recovery in the United States could \u201cfalter\u201d in the face of \u201cheadwinds\u201d from the still weak global economy.\u201cThe concerns I would have are not about asset bubbles or inequality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concerns I would have is, what\u2019s the right moment to raise rates from the point of view of sustaining the economic recovery? That\u2019s the tough call that Janet and her team there are trying to make. Fortunately for me, I\u2019m no longer required to make it.\u201dBut he will owe me a beer when the next financial crisis hits, sooner than anyone would like.William D.

{"Headline": "Victims of Debt Collection Scheme in New York Win $59 Million in Settlement", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTens of thousands of New Yorkers who had their wages garnished or bank accounts frozen in a surreptitious debt-collection scheme will receive $59 million in a class-action settlement that also bars a major network of collectors from continuing the practice.The settlement, which was filed late on Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, deals a significant blow to an industry that in recent years fed off a recessionary rise in consumer debt actions as companies bought up charged-off debt at low rates and then sought to recover the full debt for themselves.It also gives hope to a larger group of mainly low-income, minority New Yorkers who are under a cloud of about $800 million in default judgments that the collectors won using fraudulent documents in court, according to legal filings. The plaintiffs will probably have those judgments vacated, and a major network of firms will be forced to stop buying and collecting debt, according to the settlement terms.\u201cI\u2019m happy that it\u2019s finished \u2014 that these companies pay for what they did, and they will not be able to do that again,\u201d said Rea Veerabadren, 63, a plaintiff who had her bank account restrained after a default judgment in 2006. \u201cMaybe one day I will be able to forget, but this was the worst time of my life.\u201dIn Ms. Veerabadren\u2019s case, the lawsuit says a process server swore in an affidavit to leaving papers with a man at her Queens home whom she had never heard of. Ms. Veerabadren, a nanny from Mauritius, said she panicked and did not know where to turn when the bank froze her account and charged her a $125 legal processing fee.Consumer advocates say victims often first learn they are being targeted when property is seized. A default judgment on its own can follow someone for decades, making it difficult for that person to rent an apartment, open a bank account or get a job.\u201cThere\u2019s wealth being systematically extracted, which will be restored through this settlement,\u201d said Sarah Ludwig, the founder and a co-director of the advocacy group the New Economy Project, which filed the lawsuit along with MFY Legal Services and the law firm of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady.The settlement, which advocates say is unprecedented in its scale, curtails the activity of companies along the whole debt-collection chain, including the debt-buying companies, the law firm hired to collect the debt and the process-serving firm that is supposed to notify debtors.The law firm that had collected the debt, Mel S. Harris & Associates, went out of business in September.The process-serving company named in the lawsuit, Samserv Inc., of Brooklyn, agreed to stop serving process in consumer debt-collection cases and to start paying process servers as much money for unsuccessful attempts as for successful ones, according to the settlement. Advocates say unbalanced rates put pressure on servers to lie about whether they had actually served notice, and state inquiries have suggested that servers sometimes claim to be in several places at once.Advocates said the monetary scale of the settlement would probably reverberate across the industry. Debt collectors have already become more constrained by state reforms enacted after the suit was filed that require them to provide more evidence in cases, said Carolyn Coffey, the supervising attorney at MFY.Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, of the law firm, said, \u201cThis sends a huge message to other debt buyers and other debt collection firms.\u201d Mr. Brinckerhoff said the firm\u2019s projections showed that people who participated in the settlement would get all of their money back, and maybe more. About 75,000 people are expected to receive monetary compensation under the settlement, which also sets in motion the vacating of about 115,000 additional default judgments.Representatives for Samserv could not be reached for comment on Friday. A person who answered the phone at the law firm Stephen Einstein & Associates, which is now processing the accounts, declined to comment.Advertisement"}

One reason is that the capital controls the government imposed on banks over the summer were less damaging to the Greek economy than had been feared.And next year, the government said, the economy will shrink by only 0.7 percent as it continues carrying out cost cuts required by its 86 billion euro, or $92 billion, international bailout package. As recently as last month, the government had predicted an economic contraction of 1.3 percent in 2016.Also on Friday, the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, presented the budget to Parliament, which is to vote on the package early next month.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.\u201cThe Greek economy endured, disproving disaster scenarios,\u201d according to a statement by the finance ministry that accompanied the budget.The budget outlined a total of \u20ac5.7 billion in additional spending cuts and tax increases \u2014 with \u20ac1.5 billion of that still to come this year and the remaining \u20ac4.2 billion set for 2016. Some of the economic changes detailed in the document, including increases to taxes on farmers, have yet to be approved by the Greek Parliament.On Thursday, lawmakers narrowly passed a package of economic changes required by international creditors to unlock up to \u20ac12 billion in loan money from the bailout program.The defections were a sign of the challenge that the leftist prime minister Alexis Tsipras faces in maintaining unity in his coalition, while honoring the terms of the country\u2019s bailout \u2014 its third international rescue since 2010.Also Friday, the Eurogroup Working Group said that it had reached \u201ca broad agreement\u201d on measures, including those to shore up Greece\u2019s financial sector. \u201cSome further details need to be clarified, and the final agreement probably will be communicated tomorrow,\u201d said Michel Reijns, the spokesman for Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup.Advertisement"}

But if we\u2019re honest with ourselves, the view ahead of us has never been murkier. That\u2019s because the problems that most haunt our world today \u2014 climate change and pollution, inequality and war \u2014 are problems for which technology, long our spur to envisioning better futures, looks more like a cause than a solution. Our future is hard to imagine because we have trouble imagining how we can possibly act to improve it.In that spirit, this Future Issue is offered less as a crystal ball than as a meditation on how to think about the future at all. Below, we\u2019ve asked eight experts (through first-person testimonials, compiled by the journalist Ryan Bradley) to describe how they and their industries look forward.Rade Musulin, chief executive, FBAlliance Insurance The key is to quantify risk in a numerical or descriptive manner that people can measure and act on. But there\u2019s a continuum of things we can put precise estimates around. For example, car accidents are fairly routine, and we have been estimating the rate for decades, but we lack data for some of the more esoteric risks. Terrorism is a good example. Or something else I\u2019m working on, which is trying to estimate the potential cost to the federal government of rising sea levels. That type of exercise requires a lot more creative thinking and assumptions. We have to review the science, look at things like how much FEMA spent on Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. When you get into the cost of extreme events, you have to use a bit more judgment. We have to apply a lot of art in addition to science.Jessica Gigot, farmer We don\u2019t really plan for the weather short-term. That makes me sound like a bad farmer, but I\u2019ve been surprised so many times that I don\u2019t want to get too attached to one scenario. That\u2019s what old farmers tell you: Be open to unpredictability. The drought will continue, that seems to be the consensus. And I may adjust my planting dates, putting in crops early to harvest early, and putting more in late to harvest again late. I kind of go with instincts. There are great farm planners out there and a lot of spreadsheets to follow, but I honestly don\u2019t do that for every crop. You just get in a time bind and could spend all winter doing that and nothing else. Sometimes, it\u2019s scary looking forward as a farmer. From our farm, we can see Mount Baker and the Puget Sound, a volcano and a rising sea. We\u2019re kind of living for the moment, in a geological sense.Doyne Farmer, co-founder, the Prediction Company If you have a prediction without any notion of how good it is, it\u2019s worthless. Lately, I\u2019ve been gathering data on what the cost of certain technologies has been, then applying fairly simple forecasting methods to make predictions. You have to pretend we are in the past and don\u2019t know the future. Say we were in 1975, and we\u2019re looking at 2005. Or go back further. Look at solar energy. Ask how much you should invest in solar energy versus nuclear power. The two technologies happened to have come into existence in the 1950s. But follow the forecasting models, and you see that the cost of generating a kilowatt-hour of nuclear power has gone up by a factor of three, while the cost for solar has gone down by a factor of 2,500. If you\u2019re thinking about what to invest in, I\u2019d say solar.Christina Agapakis, synthetic biologist There has been a shift in the way we make food and ingredients. It used to be a more chemical approach, breaking things down into discrete parts. But now it\u2019s a more biological approach, building things from the bottom up. One way I think about what might be coming next is to look at the various pressures on agricultural systems and supply chains. For example, take Turkish rose oil: There was a late frost this year, and there is a real shortage of rose petals. It takes thousands of petals to produce just a few drops of the oil. We looked at the chemistry of those scents. What are all the components and the biology of how the rose creates those scents? What do humans smell? And we take those genes and transfer them into a yeast, and it does its own yeasty things to make those same smells.Jim O\u2019Sullivan, economist, high frequency economicsIn market forecasting, you look for a consistent pattern over time. A number that\u2019s standing alone, you have to dismiss it, and you have to take into account that some numbers are notoriously volatile. The monthly employment report is hugely important, and if you look at the last two months of data, it looks as if there\u2019s a slowing, but is this a significant slowdown or noise? I look for corroboration. Look at weekly jobless claims. Almost invariably, net employment slows down as jobless claims trend up, but in October the four-week moving average of claims was the lowest since 1973. So maybe there\u2019s no slowing. Momentum is important. It\u2019s a bit like when you\u2019re using a map to figure out where you\u2019re going: Your first task is to determine where you are.Skrillex, musicianThe future is an accident. It\u2019s an accident because you explore. You have to go through with a machete and just hack away and find it. You can\u2019t see it \u2014 you just have to go somewhere you haven\u2019t been before. It\u2019s not even about being so far into the future; it\u2019s \u201cHow do you say what people want to hear next?\u201d I\u2019m always listening to what the younger kids are doing. The most inspiring stuff is what you find young kids doing online. It\u2019s so raw. It\u2019s, like, the singularity, the way children are interfacing with different technologies so seamlessly. I was in South Africa and went to this township, and the kids there had really cheap smartphones, and they could still build a window into another world, then adapt that to their culture. Some kids had D.J. gear in a little shack, and they were making this hack between house and African, like African house. Kids! Like, 8 years old. That\u2019s where I\u2019m getting ideas.Ian Duncan, professor of actuarial scienceThe courses I teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara, are foundational: compound interest and life contingencies. Compound interest is about the time value of money. A dollar in 20 years will not be worth what it is today, so what\u2019s the value today of a dollar in the future? Life contingencies introduces probabilities: Instead of thinking about it as a dollar in 20 years\u2019 time, it\u2019s a dollar in 20 years if you\u2019re still alive. We\u2019re very concerned with people outliving their assets: If you ask the average person his or her life expectancy, they\u2019ll significantly underestimate it. The profession is very data driven. The good aspect is that it\u2019s rigorous; the bad aspect is that it trains you to believe there\u2019s a right and wrong answer to every question and no shades of gray.Leatrice Eiseman, executive director, Pantone Color InstituteForecasting in color is not throwing darts.

The other places are not as obvious but are in pop culture too. We look at what films are in production and even earlier: What\u2019s on the drawing board? That may have a color story that\u2019s attached to it, a mood. \u201cShrek\u201d is an example. I can remember seeing the early drawings in Variety, and seeing that bright yellow green. That\u2019s a color that hasn\u2019t been prominent, I thought. We need to pay attention to that. And then in \u201cMonsters, Inc.,\u201d too, that bright yellow green again.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen, Offering Amnesty, Asks Workers to Come Forward on Emissions Cheating", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a letter to employees on Thursday, Herbert Diess, chief executive of the division that produces Volkswagen brand cars, said people who provided information would not be fired or face damage claims. Mr. Diess cautioned, though, that the company could not shield employees from criminal charges.The amnesty offer is valid through Nov. 30, Mr. Diess wrote, according to excerpts from the letter reviewed by The New York Times. The offer applies only to workers who are covered by collective bargaining agreements; it excludes top management.Legal experts said it is unclear how often corporations in the United States offer job amnesty to employees in investigations. That is because, typically, there is little public reporting about the inquiry, the investigations are conducted quietly within the company, and there is often an effort not to alert large numbers of employees to avoid the possible destruction of evidence.\u201cIt is not a common practice,\u201d said Alexandra Wrage, president of Trace International, a company in Annapolis, Md., that provides advice to companies on compliance issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a tacit admission, however, that the usual reporting channels have been ineffective.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.By offering job amnesty, Volkswagen might accomplish two things, said Mike Koehler, a law professor at Southern Illinois University who conducted internal investigations for nearly a decade while in private practice: Demonstrate to law-enforcement agencies that it is pursuing all avenues in its internal investigation, and reach out beyond the company\u2019s executive ranks to better understand what happened.\u201cThe amnesty program is not so much designed for the people who are viewed as culpable actors, but rather, for the midlevel people who may have, without even knowing it, some relevant information,\u201d Mr. Koehler said. \u201cThat kind of information may be minor in scope, but it\u2019s the cumulative effect \u2014 the pieces of minor information put together lead to a more defined picture for the company.\u201dAt Volkswagen, an internal whistle-blower was responsible for uncovering the exaggerated carbon-dioxide and fuel-economy claims, which the company disclosed last week. German news media reports have said that internal investigators looking into the emissions-cheating software, which came to light in September, have been hampered by a reluctance among employees to come forward.By setting a tight deadline, Volkswagen may be trying to pressure people with knowledge to speak up soon. The internal investigation is being conducted by Jones Day, a law firm.Volkswagen previously had an internal ombudsman\u2019s office that employees could go to with concerns. The company did not have a formal amnesty program until Thursday.Analysts and people with knowledge of the investigation said it was likely that a substantial number of people were involved in creating and installing the software, and that a larger group may have been aware of it and failed to take action. The software was installed on several generations and types of diesel engines from the 2009-15 model years.Prosecutors in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen\u2019s base in Wolfsburg, have been investigating the case, and have not made any arrests.Although the company said it could not offer amnesty from criminal prosecution, if employees who come forward later faced criminal charges, \u201cwe will draw the attention of the authorities to the willingness to cooperate,\u201d Mr. Diess wrote. \u201cPast experience has shown this speaks in the employee\u2019s favor.\u201dHe also said that Volkswagen reserved the right to transfer employees who come forward to another job, or to give them different responsibilities.Mr. Winterkorn, who stepped down in September, maintained that he had been unaware that software in the diesel vehicles was designed to deceive regulators. The software could recognize when a car was being tested and turn up emissions controls.At the other times, the cars emitted up to 40 times the amount of nitrogen oxide allowed by United States regulations. The cars had better performance and fuel economy when the emissions controls were turned down.Under German law, members of a company\u2019s supervisory board can be removed only by shareholders, so it would have been legally cumbersome to force Mr. Winterkorn to leave the Audi board. Volkswagen owns 99.5 percent of Audi shares, but a small number are still held by outside investors. As a result, Audi must fulfill the legal requirements for companies listed on the stock market. Audi would have had to call a shareholders meeting to remove Mr. Winterkorn.Volkswagen formed Audi in 1969 by combining two other carmakers, Auto Union and NSU Motorenwerke, which earlier in their histories had been independent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Transformative Election", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEven by the operatic standards of Argentine politics, the upset victory of Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, on Sunday was a stunner that is likely to set in motion a transformational era at home and in the region. Long considered the underdog, Mr. Macri narrowly beat Daniel Scioli, the Peronist candidate endorsed by President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Mr. Macri\u2019s motto, \u201cLet\u2019s Change,\u201d gained traction as Argentines soured on Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s bumbling management of the economy and abrasive style.Mr. Macri\u2019s most urgent task is to untangle the web of economic controls and unsustainable subsidies established by Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner. Mr. Kirchner governed from 2003 until 2007, when his wife was elected. The couple dug Argentina out of an economic crisis, buoyed by a commodities boom, and adopted protectionist policies popular with the working poor.Reforming the stagnant economy will be painful in the short run, but could make Argentina more attractive to foreign investors. Inflation has been soaring in recent years and the country is running low on foreign reserves. Borrowing abroad to make reforms palatable will be tough until Argentina manages to restructure its foreign debt.Mr. Macri needs to level with Argentines about the depth of the economic problems, which the Kirchners went to great lengths to hide, and offer a sensible path forward. Weaning Argentina from its decades-long habit of spending more than it earns will require deftness, because Peronists and other opposition parties that dominate Congress are likely to stand in the way of reforms.On foreign policy, Mr. Macri could have an immediate and profound impact. The Kirchners aligned Argentina with the leftist flank in Latin America, supporting authoritarian leaders in Cuba and Venezuela, and cultivated strong ties with China, Russia and Iran. Mr. Macri has signaled he intends to chart a new course by expanding trade with the United States and Europe. American officials are eager for cooperation on law enforcement and energy policy and are hopeful the president can be an ally, or at least a reasonable actor, in regional diplomacy.On Monday, Mr. Macri took a bold and principled stance against Venezuela\u2019s despotic leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, vowing to seek Venezuela\u2019s ouster from the regional trade group Mercosur if Venezuela keeps opposition politicians in prison. By taking on Mr. Maduro so forcefully in a region where leaders, by tradition, tend to air grievances privately, Mr. Macri could galvanize the political opposition in Venezuela in the leadup to the Dec. 6 parliamentary election there and embolden other leaders to isolate Mr. Maduro. That would be healthy for a region where entrenched leaders and systems of patronage have made victories like Mr. Macri\u2019s relatively rare lately.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Run-Up to Olympics, Rio\u2019s Property Market Already Looks Hung Over", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO JournalRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Home buyers in Rio de Janeiro used to get into intense bidding wars as they tried to secure even a modest apartment in one of the city\u2019s exclusive beachfront districts. Not anymore.It was not supposed to be like this. Officials promoted Rio\u2019s hosting of the Olympics as a way to lift the city\u2019s spirits and fortunes.\u201cThis was supposed to be Rio\u2019s moment of splendor on the global stage,\u201d said Rubem Vasconcelos, the president of Patrim\u00f3vel, one of the city\u2019s largest real estate agencies. \u201cInstead, properties are going for the price of a banana.\u201dBut Rio is adding a new twist to this model as the economy here sharply deteriorates in the months ahead of the Games, with the oversupply of properties built for the Olympics exacerbating shocks from a national recession and low oil prices. Moreover, activists claim that the emphasis on high-end buildings for the Olympics is making a housing crisis here worse by flooding the market with costly apartments while a shortage of affordable housing persists in poor areas.\u201cIt\u2019s almost nothing, not even 10 percent of what we have,\u201d Carlos Fernando de Carvalho, 91, the tycoon spearheading the development, told Veja, a newsmagazine. \u201cWe were ready to launch the entire project, but there\u2019s no way to do that. Buyers are in short supply.\u201dBeyond the Olympic Village\u2019s sales fiasco, prices of residential properties in Rio have dropped as much as 12 percent in the past year. With annual inflation soaring to nearly 10 percent, that means property prices in some areas here have declined more than 20 percent in real terms over the past year. And after the plunge in Brazil\u2019s currency in 2015 is priced in, many apartments cost about half of what they did a year ago in dollars.Rio led declines among all Brazilian cities in residential real estate prices in October, with average prices falling 0.44 percent from the previous month, according to FipeZap, a real estate index.Then there is the dismal jobs picture: The Labor Ministry estimates that Rio lost 48,500 jobs so far this year, the second-highest number of any Brazilian city, as graft scandals hobble construction giants and Petrobras, the national oil company.Making matters worse, economists say that Rio\u2019s plunging real estate prices may be the harbinger of a much more severe economic crisis in the city, with unemployment here about to surge even further as construction of Olympic venues, hotels and roadways starts winding down in the months ahead.The gloom in the real estate sector stands in contrast to the exuberance marking previous ventures around major sports events in Rio. Ahead of the 2007 Pan-American Games, for instance, real estate agents sold all 1,480 apartments in the Vila do Pan, a complex built to house athletes, in just a few hours.Rio\u2019s simmering real estate crisis is a delicate issue for the authorities scrambling to prepare for the Olympics.Eyeing the broader economy in the city, Mayor Eduardo Paes said in an interview that the Olympics still offered an opportunity to overhaul Rio, which went into a long decline after the transfer of Brazil\u2019s capital to Bras\u00edlia in 1960. Seeking to prevent a more intense jobs crisis, Mr. Paes said he was preparing to advance new infrastructure projects after the Games.Mr. Paes also contended that the situation could be worse. While a huge government-controlled bank, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, was crucial in getting projects started, private investors are thought to be facing the more immediate burden of plunging real estate prices. The mayor attributed this to the way in which he sought to finance property ventures with relatively little investment coming directly from the municipal or federal governments.\u201cI\u2019d be screwed if it were the other way around,\u201d Mr. Paes said.Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the president of the organizing committee for the 2016 Olympic Games, expressed irritation in an interview when asked about the unsold properties, contending, \u201cThe city is not experiencing a difficult situation.\u201d\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, \u201cthe city is marvelous, functioning normally, carrying out the construction of venues and necessary projects.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to talk about the real estate market,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen the Olympic Games are finished, my obligation is to hand over the keys\u201d to the Olympic Village.But a day later, at the urging of members of his staff, Mr. Nuzman sought to add to that view. \u201cReal estate is a market that involves risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to point out that it\u2019s a market for the long term. After the Games, I have no doubt the market will rise again.\u201d\u201cWe imagined this crisis would occur only after the Olympics in 2016,\u201d said Leonardo Schneider, vice president of Secovi, an association of real estate agencies. \u201cBut it\u2019s happening now, calling into question the aggressive bets made on projects in the lead-up to the Games.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The pipeline, when completed, would have carried about 800,000 barrels of oil a day from tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast.So Mr. Obama chose to draw a line. As he put it, \u201cUltimately, if we\u2019re going to prevent large parts of this earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we\u2019re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them and release more dangerous pollution into the sky.\u201dMr. Obama touched on several other factors that played into his decision. One is that the United States does not need the oil. For various reasons, including big discoveries in Texas and North Dakota as well as stronger fuel economy standards, oil imports have dropped substantially over the last few years. Canada\u2019s tar sands oil would thus add little to America\u2019s energy security and make very little difference in the price of gasoline at the pump, which is already falling and is, in any case, determined largely by the global price of oil.Rejecting the Keystone pipeline should further enhance his credibility and that of the United States on this issue. \u201cAmerica is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Slowdown Raises Questions About Long-Term Growth", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The short-term economic signals out of China have not been reassuring.Policy makers bungled a stock market bailout over the summer. The central bank made a surprise devaluation of the currency. Growth slipped to its slowest pace since 2009.These developments rattled global markets and unnerved investors. But the bigger question is, what, if anything, has changed in the long-term outlook for China\u2019s growth?Some experts on emerging markets look at China\u2019s sputtering growth rate and see signs of deeper problems ahead. Others are undeterred, taking China\u2019s current economic deceleration in stride. To them, it is a natural and necessary part of the switch to a more sustainable development path.\u201cThe last couple of decades were all about ever-faster growth in everything in China, and the next couple of decades will be about slower growth rates in almost everything,\u201d said Andy Rothman, a San Francisco-based strategist at Matthews Asia, one of the biggest investment firms in the United States dedicated to Asia.\u201cWe need to get comfortable with that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Communist Party is comfortable with that, but over here, we\u2019re freaking out about it.\u201dBob Browne, the chief investment officer at Northern Trust in Chicago, describes the question of the Chinese consumer as \u201cone of the fundamental long-term decisions an investor has to make about China.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be agnostic or neutral on it: Is that transition to a services-based economy, as the middle class expands, going to continue inexorably \u2014 with bumps along the way \u2014 or not?\u201dGiven the volatile short-term outlook, investors have been cashing out of Chinese-related stocks in recent months, part of a broader sell-off that has affected most emerging markets.Selling pressure appears to have stabilized in recent weeks, but as of late October, the one-year estimated flow out of emerging market stocks totaled nearly $70 billion, according to data from EPFR Global, a fund tracker, as cited by Citigroup. Of that global total, money flowing out of funds in China and Hong Kong was more than $30 billion.In the near term, investors are worried about China\u2019s growth. In recent monthly surveys of fund managers conducted by Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit, a potential recession in China was cited as the biggest outlying risk to the global economy. In the bank\u2019s October survey, 39 percent of respondents said China was the biggest such risk, though that was down from 54 percent in September.Mr. Browne is among those who see China\u2019s slowdown as a near-term risk, but his longer-term faith in its ability to make the transition to a consumption-led growth model is unchanged.\u201cClearly with China, it\u2019s more of a top-down-driven economy, but so were Korea and Japan for much of their postwar development,\u201d he said. \u201cThat transition from a manufacturing- and investment-dependent economy to a services and consumer-led economy is fairly consistent.\u201dChina has a long way to go. Its state-directed economic model has overemphasized investment for years, and this has made growth increasingly unbalanced. The result is that private consumption today accounts for only around 38 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product. That is a sharp contrast to the industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where consumption on average accounts for more than 60 percent of G.D.P.Addressing this imbalance poses pressing risks for China. Because of a reliance on state investment \u2014 often in wasteful projects or loss-making industries \u2014 the country accrued record levels of debt, which stands at nearly 300 percent of G.D.P.That debt burden looks increasingly precarious as economic growth slows, raising the risk of deflation, or falling prices, which can lead companies to curtail investing and individuals to spend less. Deflation also makes debt relatively more expensive to repay \u2014 even at a time when revenue and profit at many businesses are crumpling.\u201cGiven the economy is slowing down and deflation is a major risk, if the government cannot push through necessary reforms, China may well follow the Japanese path of having a balance-sheet recession,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation in Hong Kong. He was referring to a type of recession in which spending on debt repayment takes priority over making new purchases or investments.Mr. Liu forecasts that private consumption will rise to about 44 percent of G.D.P. in the next five years \u2014 a slow but significant shift because consumption is expected to outpace the economy\u2019s general growth rate, replacing investment as the key engine.This forecast, like others that see China making the gradual shift to a consumption-led growth model, rests in part on changes underway in how ordinary citizens manage their finances.On average, Chinese households save roughly 30 percent of their disposable income, the most of any major country. By comparison, the net saving rate is nearly 6 percent in the United States, 7 percent in Europe and just over 2 percent in Japan.But there are signs that a younger, urbanized generation \u2014 one that has not experienced the privation of the past \u2014 is taking a less conservative approach to spending than their parents or grandparents did.That includes people like Yu Ying, 22, who dyes her hair blond and works as a hostess and greeter for corporate functions and other events, making as much as 6,000 renminbi, or about $940, a month.Asked about her saving and spending habits while on a recent shopping trip to Sanlitun, a popular Beijing neighborhood of cafes and shops, Ms. Yu said: \u201cI don\u2019t save. I can\u2019t save any.\u201dMs. Yu moved to Beijing from the northeastern province of Jilin three years ago, and says she spends about half of her income on cosmetics and clothes. She spends a further 1,800 renminbi a month on rent in an apartment that she shares with friends.\u201cI also spend money on going out with friends and having dinner with them,\u201d she added.But even if younger Chinese are more free-spending, analysts say getting most Chinese to open their wallets more will require financial and other regulatory overhauls that Beijing has so far shied from undertaking. Among the priorities are easing or abolishing the nationwide system of household registration, or hukou.The system as it stands generally prevents new migrants from the countryside from gaining access to urban school placements, health care and other social services, which can be provided only in one\u2019s official place of residence. Analysts say liberalizing this system would deliver a tremendous stimulus to labor mobility and also help reduce the need for migrants to save so much to meet health care and other costs.\u201cChina needs to let people live where they can make the most money, which obviously they don\u2019t do now,\u201d said Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.The risk of failing to execute on these and other reforms, he said, is falling into a phenomenon known as the middle-income trap, where growth and earnings reach a plateau before a country can become broadly wealthy and achieve developed-nation status.\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean by stagnation: China doesn\u2019t continue to climb the ladder of prosperity; it stalls,\u201d he said.\u201cOf course, the Chinese have the capacity to reinvigorate the economy,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they\u2019re not implementing those kinds of reforms, and you cannot be a heavily indebted, aging middle-income country and continue to do well.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders reject suggestions that the economy could stagnate, pledging to remain watchful against an even faster downturn by undertaking interest rate cuts, infrastructure spending and targeted loans to favored projects.\u201cWe will be fully capable to deal with the situation once signs indicate that the economy is sliding out of the reasonable range,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not making an empty promise when I say that the Chinese economy will not head for a \u2018hard landing.\u2019\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

That was ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, according to Reuters.As part of its results, HSBC sought to reassure investors on the quality of its loan portfolio in Asia, given a recent slowdown in the region, particularly in China.\u201cDespite slowing growth in the mainland Chinese economy and market volatility in Asia, there has been no visible impact on our Asian credit quality\u201d in the third quarter, the lender said.\u201cWhilst the target for completion of the review was initially set as by the end of 2015, this is a self-imposed deadline that can be moved should the board require further work to be performed,\u201d the bank said. \u201cAn announcement will be made when the board makes its final decision and, if necessary, a further update will be provided at the time of the full-year results announcement.\u201dHSBC, which was founded as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865 in Hong Kong, moved its headquarters to Britain in 1993 after its acquisition of Midland Bank. The lender has reviewed whether to shift its headquarters in the past, but has chosen to stay in Britain.Revenue declined 4 percent to $15.1 billion in the third quarter, from $15.8 billion in the period a year earlier.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined 8 percent to $8.03 billion in the period, from $8.75 billion in the third quarter of 2014.Operating expenses fell 19 percent to $9.04 billion in the third quarter, from $11.1 billion in the same period a year earlier.During the quarter, the bank recorded $202 million in costs for legal settlements and fines and to compensate consumers in Britain for improperly sold products, including so-called payment protection insurance. That compared with $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2014.The bank also recorded $28 million in costs in connection with regulatory requirements that the bank change its structure to shield retail banking operations from the effects of investment banking and other activities in the event of another financial crisis \u2014 a process known as ring fencing. Those requirements take effect in 2019.Pretax profit in HSBC\u2019s investment bank, known as global banking and markets, rose to $2.14 billion in the third quarter, from $941 million in the same period a year earlier.

{"Headline": "Electing to Ignore the Poorest of the Poor", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe first few primary debates of the presidential election season are in. We can see where the economic policy discussion is going.Republicans remain wedded to the fantasy that there is no problem tax cuts can\u2019t fix. Democrats offer a more varied policy tool kit, hoping to lean against widening inequality and give a leg up to struggling workers.But both parties, focusing most of their concern on the middle class, appear to be ignoring the Americans who need their attention most: the deeply, persistently poor.It is not a small number. Even after accounting for every government assistance program \u2014 housing subsidies, food stamps, help with the electricity bill \u2014 nearly 16 million Americans still fall below 50 percent of the poverty line, measured by the Census Bureau\u2019s revamped poverty measure that includes the effect of government support. That translates to roughly $8.60 per person per day for a family of four. That group is six million people larger than half a century ago.No other advanced nation tolerates this depth of deprivation. It amounts to one in 20 Americans \u2014 a share that has refused to shrink despite five decades of economic growth.\u201cThis should become a major issue,\u201d the eminent Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson told me. \u201cUnfortunately nobody has organized for these poor people. There is not a mobilization of political resources among the poor.\u201dWhat\u2019s perhaps most surprising is how the apparatus of government assistance has turned its back on these people, not just failing to offer new strategies to help overcome the deepest deprivation but even removing critical programs that used to keep many of them afloat.How can this be possible, given that support for low-income families has grown substantially since the 1980s? The answer is that even as the government increased its assistance to the poor, it became pickier about which poor it supported.Many of the poorest ended up on the wrong side.From 1983 to 2004, government benefits dropped by more than a third for 2.5 million single-parent families with the absolute lowest levels of income. For single parents with private income just above the poverty line, by contrast, they increased 74 percent, and even faster for those who made just under two times the poverty level.All in all, in the early 1980s more than half of government transfers to low-income families went to the very poorest. Thirty years later these families received less than one-third of the government\u2019s help.This choice, as a society, to target most of our help only to those who can help themselves exhibits a blinkered understanding of what perpetuates the deep, intractable poverty that affects many communities. But it serves a purpose. By believing the poor are not exerting enough effort, we allow ourselves not to care. This permits politicians \u2014 and voters \u2014 to go normally about their business while 16 million Americans live on $8.60 or less a day.It exposes the inadequacy of viewing poverty as personal failure and the limitations of relying so heavily on providing low-income working Americans with a tax break to encourage better behavior, get a job and just stop being poor.Deep poverty, according to the scholars who contributed to the journal, is an ecosystem, where bad individual decisions occur within broken environments, where the social glue has come unstuck. Cognitive abilities and character are important at the individual level, but they can\u2019t be cleanly separated from their environment. Indeed, deep poverty has no single, or most important cause \u2014 not family, neighborhood, job or education. Plucking at one or the other, alone, won\u2019t do.\u201cDeprivations come bundled, packaged, and may reinforce each other over time,\u201d said Robert J. Sampson, a Harvard sociologist who is the co-author of an essay in the journal with his doctoral student Kristin L. Perkins. \u201cThe implication for policy is that one can\u2019t just think of extracting out individual causes for policy action.\u201dWitnessing the presidential campaign debates, I am not optimistic that deep poverty is going to become anybody\u2019s priority. If anything, the very poor seem to recede into the background.I could be wrong. Just a few days ago, Arthur C. Brooks, president of the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute told me \u201cthe time is ripe for a new conservative anti-poverty agenda.\u201dHe argued that such an agenda would be \u201crooted in core conservative principles like earned success through work and a sustainable safety net for the needy,\u201d and that it could \u201ccut across the supposed schism within the movement.\u201dProfessor Wilson, a progressive, argues there is space for a bipartisan effort against poverty, which could be built around the theme of helping people help themselves. \u201cThere are ways to talk about it,\u201d he said. One needs \u201ca message that makes people aware that they are better off in a more inclusive society.\u201dThe American Enterprise Institute and the left-leaning Brookings Institution have even sponsored a group of scholars across the political spectrum to put together a comprehensive anti-poverty plan that all of them could support. The document will be released in two weeks.There\u2019s a reason. Even as the Black Lives Matter campaign and the movement to raise the minimum wage gain steam, the deeply poor remain politically unorganized. They may not even rate a tax cut.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018India at War,\u2019 by Yasmin Khan", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In October and November 1962, India and China fought a brief war in the high Himalayas. That conflict is still a large part of the Indian consciousness, with dozens of scholarly works and popular accounts being written about it. It is seen as a moment of humiliation, both personal and national, when Jawaharlal Nehru lost his credibility as prime minister and India lost the leadership of Asia to its archrival, China. In fact, when reckoned in terms of modern warfare the encounter was a trifling affair. Fewer than 1,500 Indian soldiers died. The battles were restricted to the mountains; the vast plains and coastlands of the peninsula were unaffected. Far more significant to India\u2019s history was World War II, in which some 2.5 million Indian soldiers fought, of whom some 90,000 were casualties. The war transformed social and economic life on the subcontinent, and fundamentally altered its political history too. Yet until very recently, historians paid scant attention to its impact on India, or to the part played by India and Indians in its outcome.With \u201cIndia at War,\u201d Yasmin Khan joins a growing group of scholars (including Indivar Kamtekar, Tim Harper and Christopher Bayly) who have begun to address this huge gap in modern histories of India. Khan, the author of \u201cThe Great Partition,\u201d explores how peasants were recruited to serve in distant locations, and the fears of the families and loved ones they left behind. She profiles Indian soldiers who won Victoria Crosses, and Indian units that played a key role in battles in the Middle East and North Africa. She writes movingly of laborers who were press-ganged into building roads for the Allied forces, and of the back-room boys who kept this (like any army) going: \u201cthe washermen, tailors and boot-makers who maintained, repaired and replaced uniforms, the barbers and cooks who looked after the needs of the men, the nursing orderlies and the sweepers, who mopped up the camp and latrines.\u201dAlso peeping in and out of Khan\u2019s narrative are the political actors of the time. The members of the main nationalist party, the Congress, were torn by the conflict in Europe. Their sympathies were with the Allies, but they wanted a commitment that when this war for freedom ended, the British would grant India independence. When the British viceroy (a stiff-necked Scot, Lord Linlithgow) declined to give this assurance, Gandhi launched his Quit India movement, in which tens of thousands of young patriots courted arrest. Meanwhile, the charismatic Subhas Chandra Bose had crossed over to the other side, raising an Indian National Army that sought to liberate his country with the help of the Japanese. While Gandhi and Bose were alienating the British, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his Muslim League were quietly building up their base, with a view to securing a solid stake in a future dispensation. Khan\u2019s book is particularly informative about the profound demographic shifts of the war years. Not only were peasants sent as soldiers to North Africa, the Middle East and Europe, but as war demand boosted industrial production, a wave of migrants left the countryside for the cities. (In some cases, there was also a reverse migration, with townsmen fleeing to interior villages for safety.) Add to that a large-scale influx of refugees from Burma \u2014 mostly people of Indian origin who had left their homeland for better prospects in the British colonies of Southeast Asia \u2014 and a smaller influx of refugees from Europe, Jews fleeing Nazi persecution and Poles escaping both the Nazis and the Soviets. Finally, there were the British and American soldiers who had come to India to conduct ground and air operations against the Japanese. The events narrated in \u201cIndia at War\u201d amount to a devastating indictment of empire. At the best of times, colonial rule delivered little to its subjects. The people of India were poor, uneducated and lacking access to health facilities. In 1939, a mere 12.5 percent of Indians could read and write, while an average life span was 26 years.Once the conflict started, the rulers turned actively coercive. Money for a war fund was extracted from village shopkeepers and city businessmen alike. The officials who directed the collections were very energetic, and seemed not at all guilty about living pleasant lives in bungalows and cantonments while their compatriots were being bombed out of their homes in England or fighting on the Continent. To hamper a possible Japanese invasion of eastern India, the British destroyed some 20,000 small boats, used to catch fish and transport essential commodities to villages not connected by road. This greatly undermined the rural economy, and may have contributed to the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, in which several million perished.Imperial bias was also evident in how the flow of refugees was managed. When Burma fell to the Japanese, the available ships were used to transport Europeans, leaving Indians to trek hundreds of miles over hills and through forests to reach their homeland (many died along the way). Meanwhile, the thousands of foreign soldiers living in India led to a damaging sex trade. \u201cPimps and touts abounded wherever the troops were stationed or on leave,\u201d one British official said. Calcutta was left with one of the world\u2019s highest rates of venereal disease. And women in villages near airfields were not immune from predatory troops either. Khan refers in passing to deforestation in Burma. In fact, the forests of the heartland were also devastated. India was the sole source of timber for the Middle Eastern and North African theaters. More than a million tons of wood were supplied by the forest department to the defense department. As one historian has remarked, to meet the ever-\u00adincreasing war demand \u201cfellings and sawings were pushed to the remotest corners of the Himalayas and the densest forests of the Western Ghats.\u201d Much of this destruction was carried out without proper regulation, so that in several areas, rich natural forests were converted into man-made deserts. One class of Indians prospered from the war: big-business men. They made boots and uniforms, guns and sandbags, for the troops. As everyday commodities grew more scarce, producers of sugar, paper and textiles reaped windfall profits. Among the few Englishmen to emerge with any credit from this narrative is Lord Wavell, who in 1943 succeeded Linlithgow as viceroy. He urged prompt relief to \u00adfamine-struck Bengal and worked actively to transfer political power. Wavell\u2019s empathy for Indians has been acknowledged by previous historians, but we must be grateful to Khan for drawing our attention to other dissenting voices. One, the wife of an army officer, wrote to her husband after the suppression of the Quit India movement that \u201cwe have taken this jolly old war too bally casually here at Simla, picnics, dances and poddle-faking and now comes this Indian trouble. Because Simla has seen little of it does any one of us give a hoot? Do any of us women know who has been locked up or why?\u201dThe last word must be an Indian\u2019s. When the war finally ended, the journalist Frank Moraes (father of the poet Dom) found himself listening to Churchill\u2019s victory speech, with its sonorous proclamations of \u201cAdvance Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom! God save the King!\u201d Moraes considered this \u201cincongruous to Indian ears. .\u2008.\u2008.

Instead of partaking of gourmet meals and donning my kalla/bridal trousseau, chaos and turmoil, sprinkled with vicious gossip became my daily food and clothing.\u201dThe requests continued.Sponsorship for a child\u2019s figure skating lessons from a mother who, according to the friend who got daily reminders to donate, just renovated her kitchen.Money for a power generator for a guy in Brooklyn who holds parties for artists, writers and musicians in a shack in his backyard, who said he is doing a project on \u201cthe history of shacks.\u201dA talented writer who was having a rough patch put up a \u201cbirthday plea\u201d for $2,000 \u2013 no, make that $200,000. A guy who needs a new MacBook after someone spilled a drink on his. The woman who just asked for $20,000 for plastic surgery because she had children early and \u201cstruggles with body image issues.\u201dOr take the recent page of Larry Paciotti, a.k.a. the famous pornographic film director/drag queen Chi Chi LaRue, who was asking for $40,000 to extend his stay in rehab at Betty Ford. One non-funder on his funding page called the request \u201ca gross abuse of fame \u2026 Larry has plenty of personal resources available to secure this funding on his own.\u201dAnd that, of course, is at the heart of the backlash: the sneaking suspicion that someone of considerable (or at least ample) means and/or connections is asking for help.Or as one friend who forwarded me her site put it, \u201cI just got this from a multimillionaire.\u201d\u201cThis is not a rich lady asking her readers to give her money for a vanity project,\u201d said Christy Fletcher, Ms. Green\u2019s agent. (Ms. Green declined to speak.)\u201cShe started because she is very creative and she wanted creative control,\u201d Ms. Fletcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, if you want it, order it; if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t. It\u2019s just asking people to buy your work, only on Kickstarter instead of in a store.\u201dWell, not quite.Given the frequency of the email solicitations, and the level of intimacy expected in the exchanges (another would-be author offered \u201cimmortality\u201d to one lucky donor by writing her into her novel for $1,000), it\u2019s not quite like ordering on Amazon. It\u2019s more like Amazon stops by your house for a drink and at midnight is still chatting, while you try not to glance at your watch.I wanted to find a sociologist to comment on this phenomenon. When I searched for \u201csociologist\u201d and \u201cGoFundMe,\u201d I came across this: \u201cSend a sociologist to GDC!\u201d Apparently a gamer working toward her Ph.D. in sociology needed money to attend a conference to complete her work on gender performance in rock music video games. That wasn\u2019t what I was looking for.\u201cOne of the surprises of reward-based crowdfunding is that money is only one piece of this,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople use platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo not just to raise money for a project, but to gauge whether there\u2019s an audience, to build a community \u2013 and to get attention. No one has really studied the personal donation sites, but I suspect the exact same thing holds true there.\u201dIndeed, Professor Mollick argues, personal sites may be even more about getting attention than getting money. A quick survey of sites shows that many people seem as interested in being the next guest on Ellen DeGeneres as in getting funds. (Meeting Ellen DeGeneres is a surprisingly common request on GoFundMe.)Here\u2019s the question I can\u2019t stop asking myself: Has social media made our craving for attention and validation overwhelm all other considerations? There is nothing new about asking your friends for help (remember rent parties?), but that help was confined to a small group of people you actually knew.Now, no such boundaries exist. Your 4,000 Facebook friends should know if you can\u2019t pay your rent \u2014 or your plastic surgery bill. And who knows? They may just pay up.There was a time when there were needs, and there were wants, and we knew the difference. Now?Now I\u2019m not so sure.Advertisement"}

North, a Nobel laureate whose work in applying economic theory to history offered a new understanding of how societies coordinate people\u2019s behavior, died on Monday at his home in Benzonia, Mich. He was 95.The cause was esophageal cancer, his niece Julie Case said.The son of a high school dropout, Professor North traced an unlikely path to academic renown and the halls of government in China, Latin America, Eastern Europe and elsewhere, where he was a sought-after consultant.In academia, where his teaching career spanned seven decades, and in his many books and articles as an economics historian, he became known for challenging traditional methods of economic analysis, in which markets hold sway, finding that they often fell short of explaining long-term economic growth.In casting his net wider, he took into account, among other things, the economic impact of social and political institutions, of laws and customs regarding property rights, and of religious beliefs and human cognition.He hypothesized, for example, that when various economic groups \u2014 farmers or bankers or railroad companies \u2014 find that institutions inhibit them from making bigger profits, they will come together to change the institutions.\u201cNorth\u2019s genius is figuring out what question to ask next, which often comes as an answer to the question \u2018What can\u2019t I explain with my current conceptual framework?\u2019\u201d John Joseph Wallis, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland and a North prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and collaborator, wrote in a paper he delivered in celebration of Professor North\u2019s 90th birthday. \u201cTo do this requires a very unusual combination of humility and confidence.\u201dWhile at the University of Washington, in Seattle, where he taught for 33 years, Professor North helped found a branch of inquiry called cliometrics, named for the muse of history, Clio, after he and others had concluded that traditional market-oriented economics faltered in measuring some aspects of economic performance quantitatively.Professor North contended that traditional economics did not fully recognize that markets are embedded in institutions, which evolve slowly and can be understood only by studying the cultural phenomena behind them.When he examined why the cost of ocean transportation had fallen sharply from 1750 to 1910, for example, he found that it was not because it had become cheaper to operate ships. Rather, the main reasons were an increase in trade, a decline in piracy and privateering and an improvement of ports. The line of study came to be called \u201cthe new institutional economics.\u201dBut when he turned his attention to Europe, as he did in \u201cThe Rise of the Western World\u201d (1973), written with Robert Paul Thomas, he found the challenge unexpectedly severe and began rethinking his methods.\u201cRetooling turned out to change my life radically,\u201d he wrote in an autobiographical sketch for the Nobel ceremony, \u201csince I quickly became convinced that the tools of neo-classical economic theory were not up to the task of explaining the kind of fundamental societal change that had characterized European economies from medieval times onward.\u201dIn one instance he studied the economic effects of the Black Death, perhaps the most devastating pandemic in history, a plague that peaked in the 14th century, wiping out tens of millions of people in Europe and Asia and shriveling the labor force.Professor North found that classical theory could not account for the fact that wages rose in Western Europe after that scourge but not in Eastern Europe, much of which remained in serfdom. \u201cWe needed new tools, but they simply did not exist,\u201d he wrote.So he and his fellow cliometricians began creating them, using vast amounts of quantitative data.One of Professor North\u2019s conclusions was that England and the Netherlands industrialized faster than other countries because guilds, with their strict workplace rules and hiring restrictions, were weaker there.Professor North\u2019s own work led to another level of inquiry \u2014 not followed by other cliometricians \u2014 which drew on cognitive science to understand why people make the choices they do, often in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity. What, for instance, prompts people to give blood when there is no financial incentive to do so?Much of this latter research was conducted at Washington University in St. Louis, where he spent 28 years in a second long stretch of teaching.\u201cDoug North has always challenged the adequacy of the current intellectual consensus about how history and social science explained long-term social change,\u201d Professor Wallis said in an interview.Barry R. Weingast, a former colleague who is now a professor of political science at Stanford, said Professor North had been \u201cat the forefront of several revolutions\u201d in economic theory, involving the application of traditional economics and statistics to history, the importance of specifying and enforcing property rights and, most important, the crucial role of a culture\u2019s institutions in economic performance.When taking a consulting job overseas, Professor North insisted on spending at least six months in a country, absorbing its belief systems and its organization and institutional framework before offering his advice.Outside the classroom, Professor North, a diminutive, effervescent bon vivant, indulged his interests in haute cuisine, photography, fast cars, flying his own plane, hunting, fishing, tennis, hiking and swimming, pursuing some of them into advanced age.At various times he owned two ranches. One, comprising 160 acres in a remote stretch of Northern California, was bought for $10 an acre. The money, he said, came from his winnings at poker.Douglass Cecil North was born on Nov. 5, 1920, in Cambridge, Mass., and though he grew up in the shadow of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there was little in his background to suggest that he would become a renowned economics historian. His father, he said, had left high school to work for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as an office boy, and Professor North did not know if his mother had finished secondary school.He himself had been an indifferent student, making only \u201cslightly better than a C average,\u201d he said, as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became an avowed Marxist and a radical activist who did little classwork. For a time he refused to join his young Communist friends in shifting their support to the American war effort after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941.On graduation, Professor North, who was morally opposed to combat, joined the merchant marine as a deckhand. He was thrust into navigation when his ship, with officers who had only rudimentary education, lost its way on a voyage to Australia and the captain summoned him to the bridge.\u201cWe are lost, and I\u2019ll give you 24 hours to learn to navigate,\u201d the captain said, as Professor North recalled the episode in an interview for this obituary in 2011 at his home in Benzonia, in northern Michigan. He crammed all night, then guided the ship to Melbourne and remained a navigator.Two years in the South Pacific and a year teaching navigation in California allowed for continuous reading that led him to decide to become an economist.In his Nobel essay he wrote, \u201cI went back to graduate school with the clear intention that what I wanted to do with my life was to improve societies, and the way to do that was to find out what made economies work the way they did \u2014 or fail to work.\u201dHe earned straight A\u2019s at Berkeley and landed a job at the University of Washington, where he formed a pivotal friendship with Donald Gordon, a colleague and daily chess opponent.\u201cI beat him at chess, and he taught me theory,\u201d Professor North said in the 2011 interview. \u201cThat was where we invented cliometrics.\u201dIn 1944 Professor North married Lois Hiester, with whom he had three sons. She became a prominent member of the Washington State Legislature. The marriage ended in divorce, and in 1972 he married Elisabeth W. Case, who survives him.Other survivors include his sons, Douglass, Christopher and Malcolm; a half sister, Sheila; and four grandchildren. He also had a home in St. Louis.After officially retiring from Washington University, Professor North continued to teach classes there and at Stanford University into his early 90s.Professor North spent a lifetime studying what separates prosperous societies from poor ones, but he shunned political dogmatism, having long abandoned Marxism, saying he was neither wholly liberal nor wholly conservative.He also had no particular view about the proper size of government.\u201cEconomic history has taught us that the world is an evolving complex system, always changing,\u201d he said. \u201cMy contribution is to make people aware of this dynamic process.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about Douglass C. North, a Nobel laureate in economics, misstated the location of the University of Washington, where he taught for 33 years. It is in Seattle, not St. Louis. (He later taught for 28 years at Washington University in St. Louis.)Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "VW Looks at Cost Cuts and Offers Money to Diesel Car Owners", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonday\u2019s carefully worded statement on cost-cutting does not mention layoffs, but nevertheless raises the specter of job reductions at a company with some 614,000 employees, nearly twice as many as Toyota, which produces roughly the same number of vehicles. \u201cIn the present difficult situation we must jointly make decisions that factor in economics just as much as employment,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in the joint statement with the company\u2019s labor leadership.The combined statement with Bernd Osterloh, the powerful head of the Volkswagen works council, was intended as a show of solidarity between the two sides. There have been signs of tension between Mr. M\u00fcller and labor leaders, which is unusual at Volkswagen.In a letter to employees on Friday, Mr. Osterloh complained that top executives had no clear strategy for addressing the emissions crisis. He also accused Volkswagen managers of making proposals to cut costs without consulting worker representatives. That is taboo at Volkswagen, where according to a special law, workers have veto power over decisions to move or close factories.While manufacturers in the United States have typically tried to keep unions out of factories, Volkswagen encouraged the United Automobile Workers to organize its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., over the objections of local political leaders.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\u201cThe work force will stand behind the company,\u201d Mr. Osterloh said in his Monday joint statement with Mr. M\u00fcller. But he also said that the support of workers was conditional on \u201cagreeing on a balanced package of investments, economy measures and forward-looking projects.\u201dVolkswagen has already allocated nearly 9 billion euros to cover costs stemming from deceiving regulators and customers. That figure does not include future fines that Volkswagen may be required to pay to national authorities or legal judgments from the hundreds of lawsuits filed by disgruntled customers. Nor does it include other financial fallout, like lost sales.Because of the financial toll, Fitch Ratings said on Monday that it lowered its view of Volkswagen\u2019s creditworthiness. If other ratings agencies follow suit, the company will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money.The offer of up to $1,000 in compensation will be applicable to owners and lessees of 2-liter TDI models affected by the problem in the United States, the company said. The customers would be eligible for a $500 cash card to spend as they wish and another $500 to spend at Volkswagen dealerships, and free 24-hour roadside assistance for three years.Car owners who accept the offer will not be asked to waive future rights to sue or claim other compensation, a Volkswagen spokeswoman said.Volkswagen has already promised to make changes to cars so they comply with emissions limits. The repairs are likely to be costly and complicated, and Volkswagen has not said how they will be carried out.Volkswagen, which called the offer a \u201cgood-will package,\u201d also came under criticism from two lawmakers. In a joint statement, Senators Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, called the offer \u201cinsultingly inadequate\u201d and a \u201cfig leaf attempting to hide the true depths of Volkswagen\u2019s deception.\u201d The lawmakers said Volkswagen should offer car owners a buyback option if they wanted to get rid of their cars, or a compensation for the loss of resale value, fuel economy and other damages.Jack R. Nerad of Kelley Blue Book, an auto research organization, said there was a precedent for payments like these. A few years ago, he pointed out, Hyundai agreed to pay a lump sum of $353 to car owners after it admitted to inflating the mileage on some of its models.Volkswagen is at the center of multiple investigations in the United States and Europe over the emissions-testing fraud. In the United States, the company faces lawsuits from owners seeking compensation for the decreased resale value of vehicles that were equipped with the illegal software.As Volkswagen contends with the crisis, any job reductions will be particularly tricky to achieve because of the strong voice that worker representatives have in management decisions. Worker representatives hold half of the 20 seats on the supervisory board, in line with laws that apply to all large companies. In addition, the German state of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, has another two seats on the board and generally votes with labor. That means no major decision can be made without worker support.As a result, Volkswagen is likely to do everything possible to avoid forced layoffs of permanent workers. The company could, for example, reduce use of temporary workers, who under German laws have fewer protections against being fired.In addition, Volkswagen could shorten the number of hours worked. In the early 1990s, when a slump in auto sales pushed the company close to bankruptcy, Volkswagen introduced a four-day workweek rather than lay off workers.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of employees at Volkswagen. It is 614,000, not 670,000.Barry Meier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is the Economy Overheating? Here\u2019s Why It\u2019s So Hard to Say", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyThe point is, no one really knows if unemployment is above or below its natural rate. Given this, the best that policy makers can do is to look for symptoms that the economy is overheating.The Phillips curve tells policy makers what symptoms to look for: If the unemployment rate is below its natural rate, then wage growth will be higher.Sounds simple, right? Not so fast.In the original formulation of the Phillips curve \u2014 which was popular through the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 lower unemployment would yield higher wage growth and hence higher inflation.If future inflation was expected to be like past inflation, then an overheated economy would lead inflation to be higher, relative to its recent history. This interpretation is commonly called the \u201caccelerationist\u201d view, because it suggests that persistently low unemployment will cause inflation to take off. As such, to accelerationists, the first hint of an overheating economy is that wage growth will be higher than it has been recently. The key variable then is whether wage growth is increasing or decreasing.The next revolution came when another University of Chicago Nobel Laureate, Robert Lucas, suggested that inflation expectations were unlikely to simply reflect an extrapolation of past trends. By his view, expectations were rational, reflecting a richer understanding of the economy than simply past trends. This led a generation of central bankers \u2014 and most notably, Ben Bernanke during his tenure as Fed chairman \u2014 to focus on shaping inflation expectations. The idea is that if the Fed truly committed to keeping inflation at 2 percent, then people would rationally come to expect 2 percent inflation. And because inflation expectations help determine inflation, this yields a virtuous cycle in which actual inflation would be close to 2 percent, because people expect inflation to be close to 2 percent. Out of this intellectual foment, the Fed\u2019s inflation target was born.And the early warning signals \u2014 developments in wage growth \u2014 tell a similar story. A 2 percent inflation target roughly translates into a 3 to 3.5 percent target for wage growth in an economy experiencing 1 to 1.5 percent productivity growth. This suggests that annual wage growth of 2.5 percent should be interpreted as workers telling us that unemployment remains above its natural rate.So, should policy makers be pleased by current low levels of inflation \u2014 as the inflation targeters would suggest \u2014 or are the accelerationists right to be worried by the fact that wage growth may be rising?However, while a couple of decades is a long time in human years, it\u2019s not much in statistician years, and so it bears emphasizing that the data aren\u2019t entirely conclusive.What does this mean for the Fed? It\u2019s too simple to characterize the current debate as one between hawks who dislike inflation and doves who are more concerned about unemployment. Rather, the main divide may be between accelerationists worried that rising wage growth signals an economy at full capacity, versus inflation targeters, who argue that weak wage growth signals that unemployment remains too high. And in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll find out who\u2019s winning that argument.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Authoritarian Drift", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey\u2019s Nov. 1 election gave the ruling Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., a major victory that nobody expected. The period of political uncertainty that began in June, when the A.K.P. lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years, has ended. In other words, the past five months did not mark the beginning of the end of A.K.P. dominance, as the opposition hoped. They were merely a short intermission in the long-lasting dominance of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.How did the A.K.P. surge from 40.8 percent of the vote in June to 49.5 percent in just five months \u2014 without any fraud, as independent observers testified? One answer is the electorate\u2019s concern for \u201cstability.\u201d In June, some previous A.K.P. supporters decided to punish the party for its arrogance, corruption and authoritarianism. Very soon, however, they began to worry that the country would become mired in instability. The resurgence of terrorism \u2014 by both the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., and the Islamic State \u2014 solidified the conviction that Turkey needs a firm hand at the helm.Many critics, both in Turkey and the West, interpreted this recent wave of terror as a conspiracy by Mr. Erdogan to garner more votes. His supporters, on the other hand, interpreted it as a conspiracy against the president and his glorious \u201cNew Turkey.\u201d Arguably, it was mostly unplanned chaos, created by the failure of the peace process between the government and the P.K.K., for which both sides are responsible, as well as the spillover of the war in northern Syria into Turkey, with Islamic State suicide bombings on pro-Kurdish gatherings.Yet the government carefully exploited the chaos for its own propaganda purposes. Meanwhile, the P.K.K.\u2019s relentless attacks on security forces discredited the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, or H.D.P., whose liberal-left narrative got overshadowed by its assumed ties with the P.K.K. Consequently, the H.D.P. lost more than a million votes from terror-wary Kurds, most of which went to the A.K.P. At the other end of the spectrum, the M.H.P., the party of Turkish nationalists, also lost two million votes to Mr. Erdogan, mainly because of the astoundingly dull performance of its leader, Devlet Bahceli.The key question now is whether A.K.P. dominance is a temporary phenomenon or an enduring revolution. Since 2007, when the A.K.P. first sought re-election, the party\u2019s support has fluctuated between 40 and 50 percent. There is no reason to expect this will change in the years ahead. The next elections, for both the presidency and the parliament, will be in 2019, and current circumstances suggest that Mr. Erdogan and his party could easily win. This would solidify their hold on power beyond the landmark centennial of the Turkish Republic in 2023.To outside observers, the A.K.P.\u2019s success, which brings joy to Erdogan\u2019s supporters and fear to his opponents, may seem baffling. Yet it has an understandable societal basis. Roughly half of Turkey\u2019s population is made up of religious conservatives who had long been excluded, ridiculed and oppressed by a smaller urban secular elite that followed in the footsteps of the Republic\u2019s founder, Kemal Ataturk. It is Mr. Erdogan who defeated this secular elite and brought \u201cthe people\u201d to power after 90 years of marginalization. For the first time, the religious conservatives gained power, dignity and wealth. Moreover, Mr. Erdogan offered them an inspiring grand narrative \u2014 Turkey\u2019s restoration as a neo-Ottoman Empire, as the leader and protector of all Muslims around the world.This power transfer from the secular minority to the religious majority could have been a historic accomplishment, had it taken the form of national reconciliation \u2014 as many liberals, including me, na\u00efvely hoped. Yet gradually, especially in the past three years, it took the form of revenge, intoxication with power and paranoia. There was a series of witch hunts, relentless intimidation, and even confiscation of critical media outlets. (Just days before the election, four media outlets that were related to the Gulen Movement and which strongly opposed the government were confiscated and transmuted overnight into pro-government mouthpieces.) As a result, Turkey has become the textbook case of illiberal democracy, where ballots rule but free speech and the rule of law are fading.So far, Mr. Erdogan has adroitly mastered this situation and made himself the most powerful Turkish leader since Ataturk. How he will act in the decade ahead is the most crucial question for the nation. Optimists tend to assume that, having crushed all challengers, Mr. Erdogan will feel more secure and show a bit of magnanimity. He could also leave some room to the more moderate and less controversial prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who, in his mild victory speech, promised \u201can end to polarization and tension.\u201dBut there\u2019s a more pessimistic scenario. Mr. Erdogan could simply keep accumulating power, leading to a system with an all-powerful Russian-style presidency without checks and balances. (The A.K.P. has so far failed to get the parliamentary supermajority it needs to make constitutional amendments, but nothing is impossible in the ever-volatile Turkish parliament.)If recent trends continue, more critical newspapers and TV channels could be crushed or taken over by government sympathizers, turning all Turkish media into different versions of the same Pravda. The judiciary could become a mere handmaiden to the government, and even universities, which are all tied to the recently strengthened \u201cHigher Board of Education,\u201d could be disciplined by the state. Turkey could easily become a tyranny of the majority, embodied in the rule of an all-powerful man.For some of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s hard-core supporters, this dark scenario seems attractive \u2014 a nation recreated in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s image, just like Ataturk tried to do a century ago, only in reverse. Such a scenario would have disastrous consequences. It would deepen the already ugly culture of nepotism, corruption and sycophancy within the ruling elite. It would turn secular Turks into second-class citizens, leading to a brain drain among elites and radicalization among the hopeless. And it would harm the economy as the rule of law disintegrates.The only way out is the sort of liberal, pluralist democracy that Mr. Erdogan promised in the early stages of his rule.

Trump had just finished a breezy, boastful and hard-to-follow explanation of how he would take on the Islamic State, tossing in a curiously admiring aside about Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s performance on television.Suddenly a voice rose from his right.Mr. Bush said it again, more emphatically. \u201cHe is absolutely wrong on this.\u201dMr. Trump had blithely suggested that he would happily stand aside and let others, such as Mr. Putin, Russia\u2019s president, sort out the messy Middle East.Mr. Bush looked into the camera and did what he has long resisted: He ridiculed Mr. Trump as na\u00efve and unsophisticated.\u201cI mean, that\u2019s like a board game,\u201d said Mr. Bush, theatrically waving his hand as if he were moving chess pieces. \u201cThat\u2019s like playing Monopoly or something.\u201d\u201cThat,\u201d he added, as the crowd erupted into applause, \u201cis not how the real world works.\u201dOn Tuesday night, Mr. Bush, whose chronic struggles on the debate stage have unnerved his supporters and dragged down his standing in the polls, was a feistier and more assertive combatant, demanding more time from moderators, offering flashes of improvised humor and delivering crisper answers than he has in the past.Whether it will be enough to turn around his flagging campaign is uncertain: Mr. Bush has a well-documented gift for gaffes and his creaky candidacy feels out of sync with the furious mood of the electorate.But on Tuesday, unlike in earlier debates, he no longer seemed as desperate to be somewhere else.In fact, he pleaded for more questions.When Gov. John Kasich of Ohio tried to horn in on an inquiry directed at Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida cut him off.\u201cYou\u2019ve already made two comments, John,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201dMr. Bush had stood by as rivals talked over him during the last Republican debate, a decision he regretted. But in intensive practice sessions in the weeks since, he had focused on squeezing out every last minute of time on camera.\u201cI got about four minutes in the last debate,\u201d he said at one point on Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my question right now.\u201dUnder intense pressure, after apologizing for his poor showings in the past, Mr. Bush hired a debate guru to refine his performance style. The changes were sometimes obvious. His gestures were less jangling. His answers were more concrete. He seemed, at times, more commanding.Of course, it was not a total success \u2014 and Mr. Bush, the 62-year-old scion of an American political dynasty, did not entirely rid himself of awkward behaviors.We checked the accuracy of candidates\u2019 remarks in the Republican debate in Milwaukee.There were clenched smiles, obscure geographical references and hands that reflexively darted into his pockets. And after aggressively demanding that Mr. Kasich yield, Mr. Bush suffered a temporary setback: The Ohio governor talked over him anyway, at least temporarily.At one point, Mr. Bush tartly thanked Mr. Trump for allowing him a chance to participate in a verbal rumpus.\u201cThank you, Donald, for allowing me to speak at the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really nice of you. Really appreciate that. What a generous man you are.\u201dHe repeatedly mocked Mr. Trump for what he said were pie-in-the-sky policy plans that could not possibly work and would play into Democratic plans to cast Republicans as the enemy of minority voters. After Mr. Trump reiterated his support for deporting 11 million illegal immigrants, Mr. Bush looked exasperated.\u201cThey\u2019re doing high-fives in the Clinton campaign right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way you win the presidency is to have practical plans.\u201dMr. Bush swallowed his long-held distaste for sound bites and managed to fire off a few of them. Asked which regulations he would cut to improve the economy, Mr. Bush pivoted, turning instead to a claim by Hillary Rodham Clinton that President Obama\u2019s economic record should earn an A grade. He then lobbed a practiced-sounding barb.\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Bush asked. He ticked off a series of grim figures and wondered how Mrs. Clinton could say they were worthy of such a high grade.\u201cIt may be the best that Hillary Clinton can do,\u201d Mr. Bush said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the best America can do.\u201dAs improved as Mr. Bush seemed, he still lacked the virtuoso skills and camera-ready ease of Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Bush reluctantly hired a debate coach last month, turning to a trusted family image maker, Jon Kraushar, who had polished the speaking skills of Mr. Bush\u2019s father, President George H.W. Bush, who suffered from his own lapses in syntax.During sessions held in Miami and Milwaukee, Mr. Kraushar and Mr. Bush\u2019s aides counseled him to talk about real people and aim his fire at Mrs. Clinton, after an attempt to joust with Mr. Rubio badly backfired. And Mr. Bush vowed to embrace a philosophy long practiced by his more agile peers: Answer the question you want, not the one you were asked.Moments after the debate, Mr. Bush\u2019s top aides seemed palpably relieved that they would not, at least for a night, have to make excuses for him again.In a midnight conference call with donors, Sally Bradshaw, a longtime Bush adviser, summed up the sentiment.\u201cGosh, what a difference a week makes,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fox Business Network\u2019s Debate Is a Step Up, in Some Ways", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe first question going into Fox Business Network\u2019s Republican debate in Milwaukee: Would the moderators learn the lessons of last month\u2019s CNBC debate? The second: Which ones?If you asked the candidates \u2014 actually, they were happy to tell you, anyway \u2014 that debate was a disaster because the moderators were insulting and fixated on asking trivial questions. But there were other issues: The panel often seemed unprepared and lost control of the proceedings, turning the debate into a free-for-all.The Fox Business debate, moderated by Maria Bartiromo, Neil Cavuto and the Wall Street Journal editor Gerard Baker, was a definite improvement on CNBC\u2019s, insofar as it was not bad in the same ways.There was no candidate insurrection on stage. The questions \u2014 largely, though not entirely, focused on the economy \u2014 were unshowy. Candidates were allowed a bit more time to speak, which cut down on squabbles over the clock. There were few gimmicks like an on-screen Twitter feed. And as opposed the last outing, when candidates like Jeb Bush practically vanished onstage, the panel assiduously spread the questions around.Less bad, though, does not mean great. True, the moderators did not become the story this time. (In case you missed that, Mr. Cavuto closed the debate saying pointedly, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about us, it\u2019s about them,\u201d which of course is a pretty good way of making it about you.)But they also did not do a tremendous amount of moderating. They asked questions, often good ones begging for specifics, then frequently receded while the eight primary candidates instead delivered parts of their stump speeches or answered the questions they preferred to be asked.Occasionally, they would press and follow up: asking Senator Ted Cruz to clarify if he would allow Bank of America to fail and Ben Carson if he supported eliminating the home mortgage tax deduction. But more often, it was up to the candidates to self-police, to decide if they wanted to challenge each other or point out evasions.Sometimes they did, spiritedly. Donald J. Trump, Gov. John Kasich and Mr. Bush sparred on immigration, Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Rand Paul on the military budget. Definite fissures emerged onstage: activist foreign policy vs. isolationism. But often it seemed as if each candidate existed in his or her own debate, setting his or her own tone and addressing his or her own niches.No one should blame them, of course. That is what candidates do \u2014 it is their job to pursue their strategy and deliver their message. Their objective is to survive the primary, control their narrative and not self-immolate. In that sense, a lot of candidates probably had the debate they wanted to have.The moderators\u2019 job, on the other hand, is a tricky one. During the primary campaigns, they need to let each party air the issues important to its voters. But they also need to help those voters choose a nominee for a general presidential election in which he or she will be strongly challenged by an opponent who does not accept his or her premises.Given the fallout from the last debate, maybe that was never likely this time, with candidates and supporters alike on a hair trigger. (At one point, the crowd began to grumble simply because Ms. Bartiromo said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had an extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.)But Fox Business probably had more leeway to keep the candidates more firmly on topic. It was easier, after all, for candidates to attack the CNBC moderators from the stage because of the media allegiances of their base. You do not lose many conservative votes bashing a network with \u201cNBC\u201d in its name.A network with \u201cFox\u201d in its name is a different story; few candidates or their handlers want to alienate the Republican king-making factory. This dynamic allowed Fox News to run the toughest debate of the cycle, with hardly a peep from anyone except Mr. Trump, who operates by his own media rules.Maybe everyone was ready for a duller debate this time around. The campaigns seemed to be. And Fox Business seemed most of all to want to brand itself against competitor CNBC. (Throughout the night, candidates and conservative guests told Fox Business anchors how happy they were with the network.)But now that Fox Business has gotten the favorable comparison to CNBC that it wanted, we can go back to drawing out comparisons between the candidates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Union Predicts Economic Gains From Influx of Migrants", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union officials on Thursday put a positive economic spin on the bloc\u2019s refugee crisis.With that prediction, the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, used one of its periodic economic forecasts to wade into one of the most divisive issues Europe has faced in decades: migration.The commission, in its autumn economic forecast, said \u201cthe arrival of large numbers of asylum seekers\u201d would require increases in public spending to manage the influx \u2014 spending that would provide a stimulus to the European economy.There would also be an additional positive impact from the increase in workers, \u201cprovided the right policies are in place to facilitate access to the labor market,\u201d the commission said in a news release.Some analysts questioned whether the European Commission was being too optimistic in its forecast \u2014 whether because too few of the newcomers will have the right job skills or be young enough to make long-term contributions to the economy, or because too few countries are ready to absorb the migrants.\u201cMember states have very different philosophies about how soon migrants can actually be integrated into the labor market,\u201d said Stephen Booth, the co-director of Open Europe, a research group in London. \u201cGermany has been willing to allow those seeking asylum to take jobs more quickly than, say, countries like France.\u2019\u2019The commission\u2019s report acknowledged that the European recovery has been slow. And it warned against expectations of a rapid turnaround because of challenges that include the slowdown in China and regional tensions created by a standoff with Russia over Ukraine.Still, the commission predicted that the economy of the 19-country eurozone would grow 1.6 percent for this year as a whole, followed by 1.8 percent in 2016 and 1.9 percent in 2017, aided in part by the impact of the migrant influx.The forecast predicted even slightly better growth in all three years for the broader 28-member European Union, which includes countries that do not use the euro, like Britain and Hungary. Those two nations are among those that have resisted the commission\u2019s urging that all European Union members share the burden of absorbing the migrants to relieve pressure on front-line states like Italy and Greece, where many of the refugees enter Europe.Thursday\u2019s forecast also acknowledged the benefits, at least temporarily, of low oil prices and of the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying stimulus program.Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission\u2019s vice president for the euro currency and social issues, said on Thursday in a statement accompanying the report that European governments needed to take \u201cadvantage of these temporary tailwinds\u201d to carry out overhauls and help stabilize national finances.\u201cThis is important,\u201d he said, \u201cparticularly against the backdrop of a slowing global economy, continuing tensions in our neighborhood and the need to manage the refugee crisis decisively and collectively.\u201dPierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, told a news conference shortly after the numbers were made public that migration would have only a \u201cweak\u201d impact on growth, but one that would be \u201cpositive for the E.U. as a whole.\u201dThe forecasts still needed to be checked over the coming months, Mr. Moscovici said. But the initial estimate \u201cchallenges some of our misconceptions\u201d about migration, he said, apparently referring to the idea that asylum seekers would add an economic burden.The commission expects asylum seekers this year to add about one million people to the European Union\u2019s population, which stood at 508.2 million in January. An additional 1.5 million will enter in 2016, and then a half-million more in 2017, the commission predicted. The total would increase in the European Union\u2019s population by 0.4 percent \u201cat most,\u201d assuming that some asylum applications are rejected, the commission said.In the other simulation, in which the new arrivals consisted only of low-skilled workers, the commission said the impact on German growth would be somewhat less.But growth in the German economy might not be completely positive for Germany\u2019s workers, the commission acknowledged. In either scenario, employment would increase about 1 percent by the end of the decade, but there would also be \u201cstronger downward pressure on real wages,\u201d according to the report.And Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist at ING-DiBa bank in Frankfurt, was dubious about the reliability of even the near-term growth forecast for the euro area. He noted, for example, that new data on Thursday for German industrial orders showed an unexpected decline, mainly on weaker foreign demand.\u201cIt is clear that the next months will be much more difficult for the eurozone economy than described by the commission\u2019s forecasts,\u201d said Mr. Brzeski. \u201cThere is a big portion of wishful thinking underlying the forecasts, and the downside risks should not be underestimated.\u201dAdvertisement"}

People, do you think this should be the end of Ted Cruz? True, he got around it by listing the Department of Commerce twice, which was a little slicker than \u201cOops.\u201d But still.Carly Fiorina kept touting her three-page tax code. Not a three-page tax form \u2014 three pages of laws to cover all the taxes paid by every individual and business in the country.

While making the ever-popular promise to get rid of loopholes, Carson actually volunteered that he\u2019d ax deductions for charitable contributions and home mortgages. Everybody liked them, Carson acknowledged, in his soft, calming voice. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is, people had homes before 1913, when we introduced the federal income tax, and later after that started deductions.\u201dProfile in courage or failure to think things through? Excellent topic for holiday discussion.The only two issues that sparked genuine debate were immigration and military affairs. On the immigration front, both Bush and John Kasich attempted to tear into Trump\u2019s plan to deport all the undocumented immigrants in the country. \u201cThink about the families, think about the children,\u201d Kasich begged, in an appeal unlikely to tug at the heartstrings of the Trump base.Trump, for his part, claimed that President Dwight Eisenhower deported 1.5 million illegal immigrants to Mexico and stayed popular. (\u201cDwight Eisenhower. You don\u2019t get nicer. You don\u2019t get friendlier.\u201d) This was a program titled \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d during which some deportees drowned.Trump and Bush tangled over American involvement in the Middle East. Trump quoted an unnamed general, who said: \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump? We\u2019re giving hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to these people, we have no idea who they are.\u201d Notice that in the Donald world, even generals call him \u201cMr. Trump.\u201dMeanwhile, Carson said America needed to make global jihadists \u201clook like losers\u201d by taking back a big oil field they control in Iraq. \u201cWe could do that, I believe, fairly easily. I\u2019ve learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.\u201dWho won? It\u2019s hard to imagine voters who\u2019ve stuck with Trump or Carson this long would be deterred by anything at this point. Many experts seem to think Cruz and Rubio did well, which I guess they did if you like illogical economic programs and totally terrifying views on foreign affairs. I guess Jeb felt encouraged.

{"Headline": "Greek Lenders Told to Raise $15.9 Billion to Cover Bad Loans", "Date": "2015-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe central bank\u2019s assessment was eagerly awaited by the financial world as a crucial step in determining how much money the Greek banks would require to achieve stability as the country tries to claw its way out of its deep economic hole.One of the biggest problems for the Greek banks is the high number of loans to businesses and consumers that are at risk of not being repaid \u2014 nearly 50 percent of the loans outstanding.The central bank report put a figure \u2014 14.4 billion euros, or about $15.9 billion \u2014 on what it would take to address the bad-loan problem and enable the Greek banks to operate once again as fully functioning lenders. Without healthy banks to provide the lending and liquidity an economy requires, Greece would struggle to resume economic growth.The Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, said on Saturday that he welcomed the European Central Bank\u2019s assessment. \u201cI am a lot happier today and a lot more optimistic than I was a month ago,\u201d he said.The report by the central bank was the result of its monthslong assessment of the health of the four major Greek banks: Alpha Bank, Eurobank, National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank.Greek banks have been relying on emergency loans from the European Central Bank since Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was elected in January with vows to end austerity in Greece.The good news for Greek banks is that, one way or another, the money should be available to make up the bad-loan shortfall.In the bailout package, as much as \u20ac25 billion was earmarked for helping the Greek banks cover their bad loans. Because the bailout package is money that the Greek government would eventually have to repay, though, the government is wary of relying solely on that money.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The government has proposed a plan that would require bank shareholders and bondholders to make up at least some of the shortfall before the banks could request public funds. The Greek Parliament approved that plan late Saturday.The Greek people and businesses have been directly feeling the effects of the banks\u2019 problems since the Tsipras government moved to help prop up the banks in July by imposing capital controls.Those limits were meant to keep people and businesses from draining too much money from the banking system because of fears that the banks might collapse.As part of those controls, banks capped withdrawals at A.T.M.s at \u20ac60 a day, creating hardship for many Greeks already hit by pension cuts, tax increases and other austerity requirements of Greece\u2019s international bailouts.The bad-loan problem is a reflection of the sorry state of the Greek economy. After six years of recession, tens of thousands of Greeks and businesses are unable to make payments on loans taken out for their companies, homes and cars. Nearly half of all loans issued by Greek banks are in arrears \u2014 a liability worth an estimated \u20ac107 billion. By comparison, in the United States, only about 2 percent of loans are at risk of not being repaid.In its stress test, the European Central Bank assumed that the Greek economy could remain in recession through at least 2017.The central bank\u2019s assessment found that at least \u20ac7 billion more in loans fell into arrears as the economy slumped this summer, on top of the existing amount of bad loans. That added to pressure on banks to raise new capital, which acts as a cushion against losses.Piraeus Bank needs \u20ac4.9 billion in fresh capital, the central bank found. The National Bank of Greece will need \u20ac4.6 billion, Alpha Bank \u20ac2.7 billion and Eurobank \u20ac2.1 billion.To raise at least part of the new capital, the banks and the European Central Bank are hoping that private investors will buy Greek bank shares, most of which plunged in value during the summer crisis.Big American investors who are sharing the pain include the billionaires Wilbur L. Ross and John A. Paulson, whose investment funds made big bets on Greek banks. They have already sustained sizable losses, and they could lose more if bad loans wipe out more bank capital.The Greek banks have until Nov. 6 to announce how they will raise the money.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The G.O.P.\u2019s Myopia on Coal", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIT\u2019S no secret that American coal companies are facing tough times.Shares of Peabody Energy, the world\u2019s largest private-sector coal company, have lost more than 90 percent of their value over the last year, and Arch Coal has seen its shares plummet to less than $2 from about $28 a year ago (and nearly $360 in 2011). Another major producer, Alpha Natural Resources, filed for bankruptcy protection in August.While it may not qualify for life support just yet, the American coal industry is decidedly unhealthy.Republicans in Congress like to blame what they call President Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d In particular, they single out for scorn the president\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which will set first-time emissions standards for carbon dioxide on coal-fired power plants by 2022. Many old, dirty plants will close as a result.The industry\u2019s self-described defenders seem to assume that without these rules, American coal would be financially sound into the foreseeable future because Americans \u2014 and people everywhere \u2014 still need cheap energy. If a hypothetical Republican president forgoes carbon regulations, they believe, the industry\u2019s problems will be solved and we can get back to business as usual.It\u2019s not that simple, and my colleagues help no one by pretending otherwise. Coal companies are struggling largely because domestic coal is not economically competitive with the country\u2019s cheap and abundant natural gas. That would be true no matter who was president or what climate quality standards we had in place.The \u201cblame Obama\u201d argument essentially boils down to ignoring economics and pretending that the implementation schedule for the Clean Power Plan, which requires mandatory emissions reductions beginning in 2022, is a bureaucratic overreach rather than the compromise it represents. (The original implementation date was 2020.)Coal\u2019s would-be friends in Washington have decided to bash the administration and defend the status quo rather than offer a way forward. They\u2019ve also largely ignored legislative attempts to help the industry comply with incoming climate standards. It\u2019s worth examining why.Companies will need advanced technologies to meet the new standards. Whether it is capturing carbon at the smokestack or some other method, breakthroughs will be required for coal to stay viable in a new world of emissions rules. If you\u2019re a lawmaker who wants to keep today\u2019s coal industry alive under the Clean Power Plan, standing pat is not an option.Given that reality, you\u2019d think that support for efforts to reduce coal\u2019s climate-changing emissions would be in the Republican Party\u2019s platform by now. But ask almost any Republican on an environmental committee \u2014 or better yet, ask the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of the coal state of Kentucky \u2014 where his or her bill is to support these options, and it\u2019s a good bet you\u2019ll get a blank stare.That\u2019s because, for all their sound and fury on the importance of American coal mining, some of my colleagues have boxed themselves in so tightly by denying the science of climate change that any solution is impossible for them to support. In the unusual world of climate politics, Republicans who help coal companies reduce their carbon emissions would have to admit that those emissions are a problem worth discussing \u2014 and for a variety of reasons, they can\u2019t do that.Endorsing federal funding for pilot projects for carbon capture, which the industry wants, or opening the door to new potential technologies for reducing coal\u2019s climate impact would qualify as caving in to the environmental lobby. Since Republicans control both the House and Senate, this upside-down political dynamic has become the biggest obstacle to the industry\u2019s getting what it wants most: assistance in meeting the new standards.Bills pending in the House and Senate would offer varying degrees of federal support for carbon capture technology. You can agree or disagree philosophically with spending taxpayer money to smooth the way forward for coal, but most of my Republican counterparts don\u2019t even want to discuss the issue. In fact, they certainly don\u2019t want to talk about the larger issue of why climate standards are necessary.By adopting a post-Obama political vision of lax federal regulation and a return to pre-Obama profit margins, some of my colleagues have made themselves irrelevant to serious discussions about the coal industry\u2019s future. Those of us who want to see coal company employees successfully navigate the rough waters ahead are more interested in providing economic opportunities than in posturing. But we can\u2019t have that discussion as long as climate change is treated as a hoax.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arne Duncan, Education Secretary, Sees Challenges for U.S. Colleges", "Date": "2015-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 American higher education is the envy of the world, with the most renowned universities attracting young men and women from around the globe.As Americans consider college possibilities, the choices are terrific: large and small, public and private, in every region, along with a robust community-college system that is a gateway for many immigrants and for training older workers.Mr. Duncan is proud of the sizable increases in investment and aid during the administration of President Obama, but he acknowledges that these have been outstripped by rising costs. Forty-seven of 50 states have cut back on per-student higher education spending in the past five years.At both public and private institutions, research shows, the number of administrators has increased far more than that of tenured faculty. Mr. Duncan says these higher administrative overhead costs are \u201cpretty stunning.\u201d Some of the solutions he and the president have proposed have been thwarted by the Republican-controlled Congress. These include tuition-free community colleges, which he considers the \u201cengines\u201d of the new economy. Other measures are taking effect. Starting next month, anyone with a student loan will not be assessed more than 10 percent of their monthly income for repayment, and there are moves to renegotiate lower interest rates.Graduating affects job opportunities and earning potential; graduates also are much less likely to default on student loans.He argues for more innovation and experimentation with different approaches and incentives as well as a greater appreciation for different kinds of students: Those in their 30s, 40s and older. The options, he says, certainly include for-profit colleges, though he has been a harsh critic of some that have \u201ctaken advantage of veterans and single moms.\u201d On the larger picture, Mr. Duncan, a former Harvard basketball star \u2014 he admits that may be an oxymoron \u2014 exudes optimism. He believes that over the next five to 10 years, the inexorable trends toward more transparency, innovation and the realization that \u201cthe nontraditional student today is traditional,\u201d will make higher education more accessible, affordable and better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Miami, the Brainy Side of the Beach", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerOn the kind of balmy February evening that draws snowbirds by the flocks to South Florida, I split from the flip-flop crowd clogging Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach and veered one block north to the New World Center. The Frank Gehry-designed glass and steel symphony hall opened in 2011, and at once established South Beach as a cultural destination. A cluster of patrons formed a white-haired clot in front of the box office where I learned that the evening\u2019s program, a recital by a third-year horn fellow with the center\u2019s New World Symphony, was sold out. True, it was a free event, but it required reservations and Dominic Rotella, the musician, was apparently the hottest ticket in town.\u201cGet in line,\u201d a reedy patron said, indicating the informal queue of unfortunates around him. \u201cYou\u2019re number seven.\u201dIf a sellout at a musical fellow\u2019s concert is any indication, Miami craves culture. Now, thanks to a robust economy and a legacy bestowed by Art Basel \u2014 the immensely popular art event established in 2002 that returns Dec. 3 to 6 this year \u2014 Miami has accrued a critical mass of cultural attractions. From the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami to the thriving muralist district of Wynwood, Miami has developed a brainy complement to its long-established beach allure. And there\u2019s more on the horizon. Faena Forum, a 50,000-square-foot exhibit space designed by Rem Koolhaas, is set to open in April, and the Bass Museum of Art, currently closed for renovation, will add 50 percent more space with four new galleries when it opens next fall. Together, the newcomers offer rich cultural fodder outside Art Basel season if courting skin cancer isn\u2019t your idea of vacation.It\u2019s not mine. In Miami visits past, I did what I could to dig into something deeper than a sand pail, including taking the South Beach architectural walking tour led by the Miami Design Preservation League, and going to the Wolfsonian Museum to peruse its decorative art collection \u2014 activities that, leisurely consumed, might take a day. When a friend, who lives in a gleaming high-rise in downtown\u2019s Brickell district, promised I\u2019d never miss the beach during a weekend last winter in what she called the \u201cnew Miami,\u201d I had to accept that challenge. Besides, it was 10 below at home.Aside from the pleasure of immediately defrosting on the 15-minute drive from the airport to the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, there was the welcome of the P\u00e9rez itself, which is ringed with a generous veranda that invited recent arrivals and other idlers to swing in hammock chairs and gaze at the Government Cut channel between gallery visits.The $131 million, 200,000-square-foot downtown museum, formerly Miami Art Museum, opened in late 2013 in a fluid building by the Swiss architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron that seems to invite visitors outdoors as well as in. It shares the 30-acre, once-derelict Museum Park with the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science, currently under construction and expected to open in the summer.Joining a free docent-led architectural tour of the recently LEED-gold-certified P\u00e9rez, I learned it was inspired by Stiltsville, a group of houses in Biscayne Bay built over the water. Chiseled concrete panels and floor-to-ceiling windows largely wrap the building. Inside, partly shaded windows flood second-story galleries with light and views of the giant hanging planters that ring the porch.\u201cThis is a very porous space,\u201d said the guide, Rosie Gordon-Wallace, who also runs an online gallery devoted to Caribbean and Latin artists. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to move in and out of the building. It\u2019s playful. You want to run around the veranda.\u201dDesigned to reflect the immigrant complexion of Miami, the P\u00e9rez focuses on modern and contemporary art from Atlantic Rim cultures, including Latin America, Africa and Europe. Inside, a group of schoolchildren sat on the floor drawing in front of \u201cWestern Sun,\u201d an orange sunrise rendered in light tubes by the artist Mark Handforth. A few individual artists such as Gary Simmons, whose commissioned mural \u201cFrozen in Time\u201d filled an entire wall, got their own spotlight galleries. In the larger rooms I enjoyed making the acquaintance of the collagist William Cordova via 100 small works mounted together in homage to the jumpy editing of the late Afro-Cuban filmmaker Nicol\u00e1s Guill\u00e9n Landri\u00e1n.As demonstrated by the outdoor-friendly P\u00e9rez, the weather isn\u2019t central only to Miami\u2019s beach allure. It helps shape the art scene. In the Wynwood neighborhood, north of downtown, Miami\u2019s sultry climate and tropical palette merge in Wynwood Walls, a constantly changing street art exhibit splashed across 80,000 square feet of exterior walls by more than 40 artists. The developer Tony Goldman, who is credited with reviving South Beach as well as SoHo in New York before his death, began the mural project in 2009, inviting street artists to use the area\u2019s squat industrial warehouses as canvases.\u201cHis goal in Wynwood was to make it an art center,\u201d said Jessica Goldman Srebnick, his daughter and chief executive of Goldman Properties, over tea at the neighborhood\u2019s mural-covered Wynwood Kitchen & Bar. \u201cIt\u2019s a museum of the streets. It\u2019s not intimidating. The scale is friendly.\u201dWynwood Walls fronts Second Avenue with a mural by Shepard Fairey depicting Mr. Goldman, arms outstretched in welcome, along with portraits of inspirational figures from the Dalai Lama to Jimi Hendrix. They face off with gleeful amorphous cartoon characters by Kenny Scharf on a nearby wall. Wynwood artists on the walls and on garage doors in an adjoining plot work in an astonishing range of styles, from the layered stencils of Aiko to the photorealism of a streetscape by Logan Hicks and the painterly portraits of fantastical flirts by Vanessa Alice Bensimon, a.k.a. Miss Van.As development tools, the murals have made the neighborhood a destination, attracting mostly locally owned shops, restaurants and microbreweries. The mix of entertainment and culture has married the party to the paintings, especially during Saturday night art walks, held monthly, which draw food trucks, musicians and thousands of gallery crawlers.Back in South Beach, the New World Center offers its own night-life spectacle via a giant video wall that screens outdoor movies and concert simulcasts. It also programs late night symphonic concerts with club lighting and D.J.s. Short and sometimes free concerts take aim at younger patrons who may be wary of an extended classical commitment, leaving time to dash over to the nearby Bodega Taqueria y Tequila, a taco stand with a nightclub hidden behind the faux port-a-potty doorFrom in-the-round seating in the main concert hall to its glassed-in lobby and practice rooms, the center seems designed to rejuvenate classical conventions, beginning with its chief tenant, the New World Symphony, led by the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas as a virtual finishing school for graduates of music programs around the country. The symphony\u2019s home, the New World Center, offers a variety of programming outside of symphony season. On a subsequent visit to O, Miami Poetry Festival \u2014 the annual event that expresses Miami\u2019s literary depth \u2014 I caught a quintet of French Baroque singers with stylish socialites listening indoors, and the Bill Murray movie \u201cSt. Vincent\u201d with the folding-chair-and-cooler crowd on the expansive lawn.When I managed to beg a ticket to the winter recital by the symphony\u2019s horn player, I joined a rapt crowd in listening to everything from Bach to the \u201cInterstellar Call,\u201d from Olivier Messiaen\u2019s \u201cFrom the Canyons to the Stars\u201d performed to a celestial slide show. Seated beside me at the concert, Hilary Glen, then a first-year cellist with the symphony and a newcomer to town, confessed her initial skepticism of the city\u2019s cultural hospitality.\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I would like Miami when I got here, but I have found it very interesting,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cand I never go to the beach.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. de Silva, an influential figure in auto design, is 64. No successor has been chosen, Volkswagen said.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Volkswagen is planning significant changes to its management structure in response to the recent turmoil. Volkswagen has announced plans to give company brands like Audi more autonomy, responding to criticism that Volkswagen\u2019s exceedingly centralized management may have helped breed the wrongdoing.The decentralization could reduce the influence of Mr. de Silva\u2019s position within Volkswagen either by empowering designers within the individual car brands or by cost-cutting. Matthias M\u00fcller, Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, has said that all company activities will be examined for possible savings after the scandal.Volkswagen has estimated the financial impact of the scandal so far at 9 billion euros ($9.78 billion). That does not include official penalties or the cost to deal with lawsuits by shareholders and owners. The figure also does not include the effect of lost auto sales.The company\u2019s problems widened this week after it admitted to understating carbon dioxide emissions and overstating fuel economy for 800,000 vehicles in Europe. Volkswagen admitted in September that 11 million cars in Europe and the United States had been programmed to cheat on tests for nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to lung ailments.Mr. M\u00fcller asked the finance ministers to make any legal changes necessary to ensure that Volkswagen, rather than Volkswagen owners, pays the additional taxes that might be due. It is not yet possible to estimate the size of the discrepancy between carbon dioxide levels that Volkswagen claimed and the real levels, Mr. M\u00fcller wrote.Mr. de Silva, who was born in Italy, began his career at Fiat and later became head of design for Alfa Romeo, a Fiat division widely admired for its styling. He joined Volkswagen in 1998 as head of design for SEAT, a Volkswagen brand based in Spain. In 2002, Mr. de Silva also became head of design for Audi and Lamborghini, which belong to Volkswagen. In 2007, he became head of design for the whole company.One of Mr. de Silva\u2019s best-known designs was the curvaceous look of the Audi A5.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Reproach of Hunger,\u2019 by David Rieff", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Hunger is probably the most salient consequence of poverty. This salience has some rationale: Hunger makes food a priority, and poor people spend about half of their income on it. But hunger is, nevertheless, a symptom of poverty, not a problem to be tackled in isolation \u2014 the solution to hunger may not have much to do with the supply of food. In this rambling book, David Rieff never quite recognizes this fundamental point. Positing that the 2008 spike in global food prices marked the start of structurally higher prices, his discussion revolves around whether we should look for the solution of extra food production in technocratic philanthropy, global agribusiness or revolutionary politics. Arriving at an answer that none look promising, he asks, \u201cWhere does this leave us?\u201dIf there is a \u201cdim candle,\u201d he finds it \u201cin the strengthening of the state and in the promise and the burden of democratic politics.\u201d He cites the success of Brazil\u2019s Zero Hunger program, which reduced malnutrition by framing the issue not as a technical one but as a political one, as \u201ca matter of social justice and a state\u2019s obligations to its citizens.\u201d Barring this, he foresees mass hunger in many parts of the world.If this is true, it won\u2019t be for the reasons Rieff provides. While spikes in food prices are likely to increase as a result of climate change, as he points out, the problem of hunger will continue not because food is too expensive (the current price of corn \u2014 $3.80 a bushel \u2014 has already dropped to half that of the price in 2012) but because incomes persist in being derisively low. The real challenge is to transform the incomes of poor people, enabling them to spend their way out of hunger and the other indignities of poverty. From his false premise, Rieff careers off into the swamps of agricultural debates that are passionate if rarely insightful. But if we were to reframe the challenge as how to raise incomes, the three touted solutions again present themselves, and Rieff\u2019s assessment of their limitations may well be right.Transforming the incomes of poor people requires transforming their productivity: People are poor because, despite working hard, they are unproductive. The miracle of productivity is performed every day by very well-run commercial organizations and many public ones. Mass poverty persists because in some countries such organizations are so rare that only a tiny minority of the work force is employed in them. The scarcity of those organizations is unlikely to be resolved by technocratic philanthropy or international business, barely present in failing states other than for resource extraction. Revolutionary politics has potential, but not of the form that its advocates imagine. Failing states, like failing families, each fail in their own way.Without a domestic politics that is focused on developing the economy, failing states will continue to flounder. Technocratic philanthropy can be a helpful prelude to international business, which does sometimes rush into states as soon as they are politically on the turn. Myanmar is a current example. But Myanmar has been a failed state in the world\u2019s most rapidly developing region. It benefited from regional reputation, just as an African state is held back by it. Rwanda still struggles to attract international business, mainly because it remains a small economy. It needs international philanthropy (whether private or public) to subsidize the entry of business. This does not happen because, for very different reasons, it is anathema to both left and right. For the left, international business is the enemy, and public money the direct solution. For the right, this is reversed: Public money is the enemy, and international business is the direct solution. Neither wants to recognize the reality that although business is essential to lifting people out of poverty, public money is needed to induce it to operate in these places. With his focus on food supply, Rieff misses an opportunity to wrestle with how such stale ideologies contribute to the persistence of hunger.THE REPROACH OF HUNGERFood, Justice, and Money in the Twenty-First CenturyBy David Rieff402 pp. Simon & Schuster. $27.Paul Collier is a professor of economics and public policy at Oxford University and a director of the International Growth Center.

{"Headline": "VW Cuts Its R.&D. Budget in Face of Costly Emissions Scandal", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 Scarred by an emissions-cheating scandal, Volkswagen on Friday said it would need to cut its budget next year for new technology and research \u2014 a reversal after years of increased spending aimed at becoming the world\u2019s biggest carmaker.The cutbacks represent the latest financial fallout from Volkswagen\u2019s admission this year that about 11 million diesel vehicles contained special software designed to deceive emissions tests. The company had already set aside about 9 billion euros ($9.6 billion) to cover costs related to making the cars compliant with pollution regulations, although those sums are unlikely to cover the costs of potential legal judgments or other fines.Late Friday, Volkswagen provided the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board its \u201cinitial proposal\u201d for fixing its 2.0 liter diesel vehicles, the E.P.A. said, without releasing any details. Regulators have said that a recall was not imminent because they wanted to test any technical fix first to ensure it complies with standards. The number of affected vehicles also widened on Friday when Volkswagen informed American regulators that it had determined that a greater number of its larger vehicles also contained the illicit software. VW\u2019s latest admission means that all diesel vehicles it sold in the United States since 2009 were equipped with illicit emissions software.The budget announcement here followed the annual investment planning meeting of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board, which oversees the chief executive and other top managers. The company said it would invest \u20ac12 billion next year on developing new cars, new technologies and other projects.That represents a decline of about \u20ac1 billion from 2014 and was the first time since the financial crisis of 2009 that Volkswagen had not increased investment. Among other things, the company said the cuts would affect the update of its Phaeton luxury vehicle and the modernization of a plant in Mexico.That figure does not include further spending cuts the company plans to make in its regular operations. Volkswagen has not said how deep those cuts will be. \u201cIn past years, we have regularly announced record new investments,\u201d Matthias M\u00fcller, Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, said in a brief appearance. \u201cToday, for good reasons, that has changed.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. M\u00fcller said the company would look for further savings, delaying or canceling projects deemed nonessential. For example, he said, the company will delay introduction of a new battery-powered version of the Phaeton, which has sold poorly.The reduction in investment spending was less than expected, though, leading analysts to question whether Volkswagen has confronted the full magnitude of the crisis. \u201cObviously the company still feels strong enough to avoid deep cuts,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Pieper, an analyst at Metzler Bank in Frankfurt who follows Volkswagen. \u201cThe complete cultural change VW has to make is very difficult to execute, especially in the top management,\u201d Mr. Pieper said in an email.And though Mr. M\u00fcller has indicated that job cuts may become necessary, on Friday he said Volkswagen was trying to avoid them, at least for now. The company will also review plans to build a new plant in Mexico to paint auto bodies and delay construction of a new design center in Wolfsburg.Since the mid-1990s, Volkswagen has expanded almost continuously, becoming Europe\u2019s largest carmaker by far and challenging Toyota as the biggest over all. But revelations in September that the company had for years programmed its cars to trick emissions tests plunged the company into the worst crisis in its history and exposed management failures. Some critics say those billions of euros in investments, rather than making Volkswagen a leader in innovation, funded an inefficient research and development apparatus and a bloated work force.After the two-day meetings, VW said it was cooperating with U.S. regulators to develop a remedy \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The latest disclosure covers 75,000 vehicles with 3.0-liter engines, in addition to the 10,000 that had been previously identified by road tests conducted by regulators in the United States and Canada. Volkswagen has denied that the devices in these larger vehicles were used to cheat emissions tests, and the company has said it believes these devices are not illegal in Europe. Regulators in the United States have said that regardless of whether it is used or not, any software that tampers with or affects emission control systems needs to be disclosed and approved. Those were not.Altogether, about 560,000 Volkswagen and Audi cars sold in the United States had the deceptive software. In Europe, the number was much greater \u2014 about 10.5 million.On Friday, in sharp contrast with previous years, Volkswagen did not present a five-year investment plan, because the eventual cost of the emissions scandal was still difficult to calculate. What is clear is that the company has little hope of carrying out the five-year plan it announced last year, in which the company said it would invest \u20ac85.6 billion through 2019 with an emphasis on technologies to make driving less harmful to the environment.Volkswagen\u2019s image as an environmentally friendly automaker is in tatters after its admission that it programmed the engine software in its diesel cars to produce artificially low emissions when they were being tested, but to turn off many of those controls when the cars were actually driven, to increase engine performance and fuel economy. The cheating resulted in emissions of nitrogen oxide, a harmful pollutant, up to 40 times the allowable level in the United States, where the deception was discovered.Besides the cost of somehow making 11 million vehicles compliant with regulations, Volkswagen potentially faces untold billions of dollars in penalties likely to be imposed by the E.P.A. and other state and national authorities. The company must also contend with dozens of lawsuits filed by customers and shareholders.Mr. M\u00fcller has suggested that all of the costs might make job cuts necessary in Germany, where the company employs 278,000 people out of a global work force of 614,000. Toyota, which produces slightly more cars than Volkswagen, has a total work force of 340,000.On Friday, he said the company would do everything possible to hang on to its core work force. Half of the money invested this year, about \u20ac6 billion, will be spent in Germany, he said.Job cuts would be exceptionally difficult to make at Volkswagen. Labor representatives have half of the 20 seats on the supervisory board and can usually count on the support of the state of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 percent of the voting shares in Volkswagen and has two seats on the board. If job cuts do occur, workers with temporary contracts would probably be the first to go. Volkswagen has about 17,000 temporary workers in Germany, who are typically paid less than permanent workers and have fewer protections against dismissal under German law. Jack Ewing reported from Wolfsburg, Germany, and Jad Mouawad from New York.Advertisement"}

He will start with Redpoint eventures, which is based in S\u00e3o Paulo, on Jan. 1, he said in an interview Monday.Mr. Rodrigues will become the firm\u2019s third current managing director and will work beside his compatriots Anderson Thees and Manoel Lemos. The three are close. Mr. Thees was at Naspers from 2006 to 2010, leading the acquisition of Buscap\u00e9.Buscap\u00e9 remains the most successful exit for a Brazilian Internet company, and stands in contrast to many of younger start-ups that have taken root in recent years and struggled to be acquired or go public.Young Brazilians treat Mr. Rodrigues and Buscap\u00e9\u2019s three other co-founders as celebrities. He has appeared in television commercials and has been an angel investor over the years.The Redpoint Ventures founding partner Jeff Brody, who first visited Brazil in 2010, said, \u201cI met Romero on my very first trip to Brazil, and I\u2019ve been recruiting him ever since.\u201dMr. Rodrigues was already an adviser to the firm and individually invested in its first fund here, which closed in 2012. Yet being chief executive of Naspers Buscap\u00e9 kept him from taking a larger role, until he stepped down in September.Many expect Redpoint eventures to have an even more formidable presence among entrepreneurs as competition among early stage venture capital firms intensifies. Monashees Capital of S\u00e3o Paulo has been operating longer and has raised more funds. The founding partners of Kaszek Ventures of Buenos Aires are revered by Latin American entrepreneurs because they helped start MercadoLibre.The move also underscores the optimism Redpoint eventures sees in Brazil.Beyond the tough economy, Internet start-ups here have struggled to become profitable even during the boom years. Part of that came about as foreign investors bet too heavily on so-called copycats of American e-commerce start-ups and assuming that enough verticals existed and were large enough for several successful companies to develop.Mr. Brody acknowledged as much in early 2013, when interest among foreign venture capital firms started to subside and the macroeconomic picture was already worsening.\u201cOne of the things we have learned is that you need to invest steadily through the cycles,\u201d he added.Redpoint eventures seems to have done that. The 11 investments it has made in new companies this year already exceeds the six it made in all of 2014. It sees good opportunities in payments, financial technology, marketplaces and education as it has broadened its investment thesis.It is betting on continued digital growth. EMarketer predicts that the number of smartphone users in Brazil will grow to 72.5 million by 2018 from 49.1 million this year.The difficulties faced by Brazil\u2019s larger companies, which typically are more affected by macroeconomics, could have a silver lining. Most are delaying long-term projects, including research and development, and letting those employees go.Yet for Mr. Rodrigues, \u201cthat results in quality entrepreneurs.\u201dRedpoint eventures also plans to raise new funds in Brazil. When Mr. Brody was asked Monday if that should be expected, he responded, \u201cYes, we are in it for the long term.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Augustine: Conversions to Confessions,\u2019 by Robin Lane Fox", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Mihi quaestio factus sum. This Latin phrase bounces around the screen of my sleeping laptop, reminding me of something I know only too well: \u201cI have become a problem to myself.\u201d It comes from St. Augustine\u2019s \u201cConfessions,\u201d his powerful spiritual autobiography that has shaped how Christians and non-Christians in the West have conceived of their life journeys for over 1,500 years. So successful is the book in making readers identify with the author that it has never gone out of print and never seems to age.The book presents itself as one long continuous prayer, inviting readers to think they are listening in on a spontaneous unguarded monologue. In fact, Augustine had mastered the rhetoric of sincerity, and the work is composed with great artistry. First we are charmed with stories about his youthful transgressions, which don\u2019t seem so terrible \u2014 most memorably, his throwing away pears he had just stolen. Yet this tale leads to a profound digression on the nature of sin. \u201cI had no motive for my wickedness except wickedness itself,\u201d he writes. And we realize that the triviality of the example reveals the real core of evil: its gratuitousness.Augustine then presents himself as a relentless seeker after truth. A change comes over him when reading a book by Cicero, and he experiences an inner conversion to the philosophical life, now seeking out teachers and companions with whom he can discuss God and the good life. Eventually he comes across the teachings of Mani, the mystical sort-of Christian guru prone to captivating dualistic visions of a cosmic battle between the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Darkness, and whose influence stretched from Spain to China. Augustine would remain with the sect for nine years, converting many of his friends along the way.Up to this point \u201cConfessions\u201d resembles other books that circulated in antiquity, describing philosophical quests for the truth or laying out spiritual exercises for reaching inner serenity. But then the story takes an unexpected turn. Augustine had been brought up nominally Christian by his devoted and overbearing mother, St. Monica, but had never been baptized, to her great regret. The reason, he told himself, was that the Bible seemed preposterous and no Christian could explain to him how a good God could have created evil. But while teaching in Milan he began listening to the sermons of St. Ambrose, then the city\u2019s bishop, who proposed an altogether fresh way of understanding Scripture. Think of the stories in it, he said, as allegories, not literal accounts of events. Who knows if creation took six days or 60 million years? The first chapter of Genesis is there only to provoke meditation on the goodness of the natural world God created and our place in it. A major stumbling block to baptism disappeared.Yet still he couldn\u2019t make the step. And he began to realize why: His quest for knowledge was really a dodge to avoid experiencing the overwhelming anxiety and despair he felt inside. He was unhappy, and, after the death of a friend, unhappier than he had ever been. Pursuing philosophical truth was one way of avoiding this existential truth. Another was to lose himself in physical pleasures that did nothing to fill the emptiness inside. (He kept a concubine and had a child with her.) And yet he couldn\u2019t give them up. He was a living contradiction. \u201cGrant me chastity and continence,\u201d he prays to God, \u201cbut not yet.\u201dA crisis was brewing. And when it arrived, God in his grace made the first move. \u201cYou took me up from behind my own back,\u201d Augustine prays, \u201cwhere I had placed myself because I did not wish to observe myself.\u201d An extraordinary image, as if Augustine\u2019s true visage was laminated to the back of his head, so that no matter which way he turned he could not see it. What confronted him when God peeled it off was horrifying, unbearable. Something in him said: Enough. At that moment an inner muscle grasping his old life relaxed and he could finally let God in. And a new life began.\u201cConfessions\u201d is so perfect that one can\u2019t help wondering why anyone would accept the challenge of writing a biography of its author. What could a historian possibly add to this unforgettable story? Fifty years ago we learned how much more there was to say when Peter Brown published his magnificent life, \u201cAugustine of Hippo.\u201d Brown placed Augustine squarely in the world of late antiquity, the first few centuries of the Common Era when Roman and Greek pagans, Christian sectarians and mystics of every stripe competed for allegiance, and individuals floated from one community to another or mixed their own eclectic spiritual cocktails. In the popular imagination the advent of Christianity ended the classical age and inaugurated the medieval period, as if one day people woke up to find the old temples gone and crucifixes everywhere. In fact, the transition was a long one, confused, and in retrospect quite fascinating. Brown\u2019s approach made \u201cConfessions\u201d appear even more remarkable.Robin Lane Fox, a British historian retired from Oxford, has now done Brown one better. The author of \u201cPagans and Christians,\u201d a superb and accessible study of late antiquity, he has now given us a massive book on roughly the first half of \u00adAugustine\u2019s life, running from his youth to the writing of \u201cConfessions.\u201d Brown managed to tell the whole story, from birth to death, with great economy and flair. Fox aims for full immersion, and he conjures the intellectual and social life of the late Roman empire with an almost Proustian relish for detail. Augustine left behind dozens of books and hundreds of letters, all of which Fox seems to have consulted. He also provides vivid sketches of the saint\u2019s friends, acquaintances, correspondents, patrons and spiritual enemies. Less might surely have been more. At points I had the sense of being in an American restaurant where each portion is large enough to feed an entire family. But Fox is such a good writer that interest never flags, and you always feel that \u201cyou are there.\u201dThe most absorbing and rewarding chapters are those devoted to Augustine\u2019s intellectual quest and, in particular, the ones about Manichaeism. Fox gives the clearest short exposition of Mani\u2019s bizarre doctrines that I have ever read, no easy task given that his visions involved things like divine messengers who appear as beautiful naked girls, causing demons caught in the zodiac to ejaculate into the sea, producing monsters. But he also explains plausibly why someone like Augustine might have been attracted to this teeming myth. Christians could never explain adequately why God permitted evil. Mani claimed that evil was never created, it was always there, even before God. Next question, please.The weakest chapters of this excellent book are, oddly, those devoted to Augustine\u2019s actual conversion. Fox is rather obsessed with sex, in the way erudite English scholars tend to get as they age. (No one knows why.) The problem of wayward desire was obviously urgent for Augustine, and indeed sexual renunciation was something of a competitive sport among the religious sects of his time. But Fox makes it so central to Augustine\u2019s inner struggles that the future saint comes off as an insatiable, guilt-ridden pickup artist. This approach culminates in the flat emphatic statement that Augustine\u2019s \u201cis not a conversion to Christian faith. .\u2008.\u2008. It is a conversion away from sex and ambition.\u201d As if celibacy were all Augustine really needed to open himself to God.But this is not the way Augustine tells his story. The problem of sex is just the shell around a much deeper mystery, the workings of the human will. It is a subject Augustine turned to time and again in his sermons and books. The mind commands the body but cannot command itself. Why can\u2019t we will ourselves to will? Or, often we decide to do something, but the will proves too weak to follow through. How, if the will is one thing, can that be possible? To explain these puzzles, Augustine hit upon an idea that would shape Western consciousness for centuries: the notion that human beings have two wills within, a defiant one that wants autonomy and a chastened one that wants to serve God. The only way to achieve happiness, Augustine believed, was to subordinate the former to the latter.For a millennium Augustine\u2019s portrait of himself served as a model for self-\u00adcultivation in Christian civilization. The imitation of Christ was the ideal, but those falling short could turn to \u201cConfessions\u201d for help getting there. It was during the Renaissance that this conception of the self came under serious challenge, most powerfully in Montaigne\u2019s \u00ad\u201cEssays,\u201d which mocked the idea of sin and preached self-acceptance. To Augustine\u2019s anxious admission that he was a problem to himself, Montaigne simply responded, So what\u2019s the problem? Don\u2019t worry, be happy. As modern people we have chosen Montaigne over Augustine. We traded pious self-\u00adcultivation for undemanding self-e\u00adsteem. But is love of self really enough to be happy? You know the answer to that, dear reader. And so did Augustine.AUGUSTINEConversions to ConfessionsBy Robin Lane FoxIllustrated. 657 pp. Basic Books. $35.Mark Lilla is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Stillborn God: Religion, Politics, and the Modern West.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Treasury Chief Drops Plan to Cut Welfare", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, abandoned a plan on Wednesday to cut welfare benefits, making a significant tactical retreat in his drive to shrink the British state and balance its budget.Confronted by formidable political opposition, Mr. Osborne scrapped his proposed limits on payments available to millions of people in low-paid work. He acknowledged that for now, at least, government welfare spending would be higher as a result.But the move was a switch in tactics, not in strategy, from one of Britain\u2019s most ambitious politicians. Mr. Osborne promised to stick to his overall financial targets, and he said that a windfall of 27 billion pounds (about $41 billion) from unexpectedly strong tax receipts and low borrowing costs would help the country avoid cutting front-line services like the police.Britain\u2019s economy is growing faster than those of other major European nations, so Mr. Osborne has some big advantages over his continental counterparts in shaping his spending plans. But Britain still has a large budget deficit, relatively high public debt and low productivity.While it has not had to impose the harsh austerity measures seen in nations like Greece or Spain, the British government has been constraining its spending for years as ministers tried to stabilize public finances after the global financial crisis.Mr. Osborne has also tried to reshape the way the government spends, reducing the size of the state and its welfare payments.On Wednesday, Mr. Osborne acknowledged that his plans had aroused widespread opposition and said he had decided not to try to impose them, even gradually.\u201cI\u2019ve had representations that these changes to tax credits should be phased in,\u201d Mr. Osborne told lawmakers. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to the concerns. I hear and understand them. And because I\u2019ve been able to announce today an improvement in the public finances, the simplest thing to do is not to phase these changes in, but to avoid them altogether.\u201dThe decision was a victory for the opposition Labour Party, which had campaigned vigorously against the cuts, saying they would harm about three million people. The party also accused Mr. Osborne of leaving a \u00a31 billion gap in the budget that would be paid for by \u201cworking families.\u201dBut the moment was marred for Labour by criticism of John McDonnell, the party\u2019s spokesman on economic and financial matters. During the parliamentary debate on Wednesday, Mr. McDonnell quoted from Mao Zedong\u2019s \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d prompting laughter. Aides to Mr. McDonnell said he had intended the reference as a joke, to highlight the risks of selling British assets to Chinese investors.The tax credit episode has been a setback for Mr. Osborne, who is seen as a potential successor to Prime Minister David Cameron. But he did succeed in presenting a budget that stuck to his overall goals.\u201cThe chancellor appears to have achieved the impossible \u2014 easing the squeeze on public spending, dumping cuts to tax credits and sticking to his deficit reduction plans,\u201d said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, the business advisory firm. \u201cDecent U.K. growth and a better outlook for tax receipts have saved the day, enabling Mr. Osborne to cut less and shrink the deficit much as planned.\u201dOther measures announced by Mr. Osborne include significantly higher taxes on the purchase of second homes and rental properties, and new freedom for local governments to sell off assets like golf courses.But Mr. Osborne remains far behind his originally promised timetable for balancing the budget: When he and Mr. Cameron first took office in 2010, in a coalition government, he promised to get the country there by 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Macau Gambling Industry Faces Challenges on Multiple Fronts", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMACAU \u2014 Macau\u2019s newest gambling palace has plenty to beckon deep-pocketed Chinese visitors looking for a good time.The $3.2 billion hotel complex, Studio City, includes the usual collection of restaurants, bars and luxury watch and clothing shops. It offers family-friendly attractions like a Batman-themed flight simulator and a play area with rides based on Warner Bros. cartoon and comic book characters. It even features a Ferris wheel in the shape of a figure eight built into the Art Deco hotel facade \u2014 part of an overall effect the developer calls \u201cGotham City with asteroids shot through.\u201dThere is one attraction, though, it is short of: gambling tables.A few weeks before it opened in October, the local government announced that the casino would initially be permitted only 200 tables \u2014 half the number that Studio City\u2019s owners had planned. The decision undermined the developers\u2019 financial assumptions, forcing them to negotiate a waiver from their creditors on requirements for the casino\u2019s size.The local government started regulating the number of casino tables years ago to temper growth when the Macau market was booming. But the policy is now forcing a broad recalculation for casino operators, as this former Portuguese colony has been dealt a challenging hand.As gambling revenue has dropped over the last year, Macau\u2019s casino developers have been making a huge bet on mass-market tourism, with big investments in hotel rooms, retail space, shows and family-oriented attractions.These projects received financing and started construction a few years ago, when Macau was still growing fast. Including Studio City, developers are collectively spending about $20 billion on a wave of mammoth resorts scheduled to open in the next year or two on the Cotai Strip, a stretch of reclaimed land that has become the city\u2019s main casino district.The challenge is that the developers are counting on gambling revenue to initially offset those investments. And the number of tables is crucial in Macau. Casinos here rely on table games for 95 percent of their gambling revenue, compared with roughly 50 percent in Las Vegas, where slots play a big role.Studio City will not only be short of the tables it had planned, but it will also be the first casino in more than a decade without any private gambling rooms for high rollers \u2014 making the stakes even higher for that flight simulator and Ferris wheel to attract guests.\u201cStudio City is going to be the absolute litmus test for the mass market,\u201d said Ben Lee, the managing partner at IGamiX Management and Consulting, which focuses on the gambling industry.Macau, a special administrative region like Hong Kong, is the only place in China where casinos are legal, and the business has grown at an astounding pace since the government ended the four-decade gambling monopoly of the Hong Kong billionaire Stanley Ho in 2001.But after peaking early last year at almost $5 billion, monthly casino revenue has fallen by roughly half, to levels last seen five years ago. China\u2019s bruising crackdown on official corruption has scared away big gamblers of all stripes, but other factors, including the adverse effect of local government policy, have weighed on the bottom line, too.\u201cEven the Macau government thought for a while that the gaming industry is bulletproof, that you can take a machine gun or a bazooka and shoot it, and it\u2019s going to keep growing,\u201d said Lawrence Ho, the chief executive of Melco Crown Entertainment, Studio City\u2019s lead developer.Mr. Ho is one of 17 children (with four women) of Stanley Ho, now 94 and ailing. One of Stanley Ho\u2019s older children, Pansy, is the co-chairwoman of MGM China and owns 27 percent of the company, a joint venture controlled by the Las Vegas casino firm. But the siblings are confronted by different and perhaps more daunting challenges than their father faced.Gone are the days of the late 1990s, when triad gang members, engaged in turf wars, gunned down Portuguese officials and one another. Instead, the fiercest battles are being waged on the Cotai Strip, where the city\u2019s six casino operators \u2014 including local units of Las Vegas companies controlled by Sheldon Adelson and Stephen A. Wynn, as well as MGM \u2014 vie to complete the newest, biggest hotel even as the economy falters.One recent setback for these developers has been a brutal rout of the junket industry, the result of a corruption crackdown and slowing growth in China. Junket operators, both individuals and companies, are the middlemen who bring big gamblers from the mainland to Macau\u2019s casinos, extend them credit and collect debts.Unlike those in Las Vegas, casinos in Macau do not lend much to players from China because mainland courts don\u2019t recognize gambling debts. Instead they turn to the loosely regulated junket operators, who sometimes have murky backgrounds and unclear sources of funding.And the effects of the anticorruption drive have been compounded by the broader economic slowdown nationwide. From a peak of around $30 billion in gambling revenue in 2013, revenue from high rollers at Macau\u2019s casinos has fallen more than 50 percent.Players have been defaulting on loans from junkets or taking longer to repay. Fraud has also been an issue.In September, one large junket operator at the Wynn Macau casino, the Dore Group, announced that its financial manager had absconded with funds. The police have so far received 50 complaints from residents of Macau, the mainland and Hong Kong who claim to have lost a total of 530 million Macau patacas, or about $65 million, in the incident.\u201cThe adjustments taking place in China\u2019s economy are shedding light on business disputes and debt problems that built up within Macau\u2019s gaming industry,\u201d said Charlie Choi, a former investor in the junket sector, who is the president of the newly established Macau Gaming Information Association.\u201cOne of the main reasons for this is that the law is seriously lagging when it comes to the enforcement of gambling debt,\u201d he added, \u201cand a lot of people aren\u2019t repaying the money they owe.\u201dThe squeeze on their biggest customers has radically changed the environment for casino operators and made the local operating restrictions, including table limits, more keenly felt.Lawrence Ho said Studio City\u2019s decision to do away with private gambling rooms and their V.I.P. tables was, in part, forced by receiving permission to operate only 200 tables, with the ability to add 50 tables early next year.Mr. Wynn, the chairman of Wynn Resorts, has been outspoken in his criticism of the local government\u2019s table limits.The reason that the extraordinary nongambling attractions exist, he said in a conference call with investors last month, is that the casino \u201cis the cash register.\u201d\u201cHere in America, we would never have a Las Vegas of the diversity we\u2019ve had if the city had told us how many tables we could spread,\u201d Mr. Wynn added. \u201cThe table cap is the single most counterintuitive and irrational decision that was ever made.\u201dIn a statement last month, Lionel Leong, the Macau economy and finance secretary, replied that \u201ca moderate control of the pace of development for the gaming sector\u201d had \u201cthe consensual support of Macau society.\u201dThe array of challenges has forced operators to be resourceful in seeking to lower their operating costs.There is huge political opposition in Macau to layoffs of local residents, as casinos and hotels directly employ over 100,000 people, or a quarter of the work force. So gambling companies have been cutting migrant workers, while keeping thousands of local employees on their payrolls until they can be transferred to the new properties opening on the Cotai Strip.Another challenge has been a ban on smoking inside the casinos. Industry executives estimate that a majority of gambling patrons are smokers. The local government earlier this year proposed a full ban on smoking inside casinos, a move that has led to a falloff in gambling revenue in other jurisdictions. But the industry has pushed back, proposing instead to allow smoking only in designated rooms inside the casino floor. Talks with the government are continuing.With Macau\u2019s economy now in deep recession and the cash-rich government facing the rare prospect of budget cuts, Mr. Ho detects signs that local officials are likely to reconsider their hard line on the table limits and smoking. \u201cI think now they are realizing, \u2018Wait a minute, we need to support the industry as well,\u2019\u201d he said.What is clear is that Macau\u2019s once-seemingly inexorable rise, driven by big-spending mainland gamblers, commonly referred to as V.I.P.s, is over.\u201cIt\u2019s a paradigm shift,\u201d said Vitaly Umansky, a gambling analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. \u201cEveryone realizes that the V.I.P. business has gone through a structural decline, and it\u2019s not coming back, and it\u2019s definitely not coming back to the way it was before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today, not only are there no heads on London Bridge, but capital punishment has been abolished in Britain for half a century.\u2022 On Feb.\u202f14, 1876, Elisha Gray, a co-founder of the telegraph-equipment manufacturer Western Electric, filed with the United States Patent Office a memo describing \u201cInstruments for Transmitting and Receiving Vocal Sounds Telegraphically\u201d \u2014 the telephone. That same day, a lawyer representing a Boston University professor named Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent application for a device for \u201ctransmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\u201d \u2014 a telephone. The ensuing legal wrangle went on for years.\u2022 The 20th century was marred by horrors: the mass slaughter of World War I, the extermination camps of World War II, the tens of millions who died of starvation during China\u2019s Great Leap Forward. Yet in this period the lives of billions of people grew immeasurably richer, safer and more comfortable, thanks to widespread economic growth, major scientific and medical advances, dramatic improvements in transportation and communications and a gradual waning of racism and other biases.On the face of it, the disappearance of grisly totems of justice, the suspiciously coincidental patent filings and the inexorable rise in living standards in the face of organized disaster and depravity seem to have little to connect them. But Matt Ridley, the author of several well-regarded books on genetics and evolution, would argue that they are all of a piece \u2014 that each is the result of unplanned and undirected behavior unfolding over time. The word for this is \u201cemergent,\u201d and with \u201cThe Evolution of Everything\u201d Ridley has set out to construct a sort of grand unified theory of emergent behavior.The idea is simple, yet to many people disturbing: Society evolves, as does the world in general, largely in a way neither we nor whatever God we conjure up has any real control over. This isn\u2019t true of everything, but it\u2019s true of far more than we care to believe. Highways are designed; traffic happens. Buildings are constructed; cities happen. Battles are strategized, troops mobilized, weapons deployed, but defeat or victory happens. \u201cI want to . . . get you to see past the illusion of design,\u201d Ridley writes, \u201cto see the emergent, unplanned, inexorable and beautiful process of change that lies underneath.\u201dHe has set himself a tough task. As humans, we like to think we control events. We accept, at least in theory, that there is a degree of randomness in the world, but we still try to read some kind of portent into whatever happens. Any explanation is more comforting than the stark possibility that things occur without purpose. Even an inscrutable deity who deals out death and torment for reasons we can\u2019t fathom is preferable to the profound disorientation of chance. We want \u2014 need \u2014 to believe that someone or something is in charge.Darwin ran afoul of this mind-set with a series of far-reaching observations that are still bitterly and irrationally contested today. Ridley goes further. Citing the British innovation theorist Richard Webb, he calls Darwin\u2019s thesis the \u201cspecial theory of evolution,\u201d as opposed to a general theory that goes beyond biology \u201cto society, money, technology, language, law, culture, music, violence, history, education, politics, God, morality.\u201d In his previous book, \u201cThe Rational Optimist,\u201d Ridley took on doomsayers with the argument that things are getting better, thanks largely to market economies and other actions that take place without the benefit of central planning. Here he assails \u201ccreationism\u201d in all its forms. The result, while not entirely convincing, offers a highly intelligent and bracingly iconoclastic view of the world. It forces us to see life through new eyes.Ridley\u2019s muse is not Darwin but Lucretius, the Roman poet and philosopher whose opus, \u201cDe Rerum Natura\u201d (\u201cOn the Nature of Things\u201d), may have helped jump-start the Renaissance. Lucretius, unlike Aristotle, was not amenable to Christian dogma: He celebrated earthly pleasures, and he insisted that every phenomenon has a natural \u2014 as opposed to supernatural \u2014 explanation. The recovery of his long poem in 1417, on a dusty shelf in a German monastery by an out-of-work papal secretary, was the subject of Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s award-winning book \u201cThe Swerve.\u201d But whereas Greenblatt, following Lucretius, defined a \u201cswerve\u201d as a sudden deviation from the expected course of things \u2014 the unearthing of a forgotten manuscript, for example \u2014 Ridley gives it a very different meaning. To him, a swerve is what happens when someone devises a perfectly rational explanation only to succumb in the end to religious sleight-of-hand \u2014 as Newton did in insisting that his clockwork universe had to have been fashioned by \u201can intelligent and powerful being,\u201d even if it ticked along on its own.The world is full of such swerves, but try catching Ridley in one. You are more likely to find him holding fast to an idea even as it leads him toward the ditch. He is on solid ground in likening Adam Smith\u2019s explanation of markets to Darwin\u2019s account of evolution, and he makes a convincing case that language, marriage, monogamy, morality and even technology are also emergent phenomena, evolving without benefit of direction from above. This would explain, among many other things, the curious coincidence of the two telephones and the absence of heads on London Bridge: Ideas are in the air, and we prefer to get our gore at the movies now \u2014 but not because anyone decreed it. Ridley doesn\u2019t mention the failure of Esperanto or the emergence of English as a common tongue, maybe because these are so obvious. But he does go into fascinating detail on the spontaneous evolution of public morals \u2014 also laid out by Adam Smith, in his 1759 book \u201cThe Theory of Moral Sentiments.\u201dGovernment, religion, the Internet \u2014 all are spontaneous and evolutionary in Ridley\u2019s view, the laws of Moses notwithstanding. The trouble begins when he stops observing emergent phenomena and starts pumping for them as the ideal solution to any given problem. He makes a good case that education would be better off without bureaucrats. But elsewhere he overreaches. His insistence that climate- change arguments are overwrought is rather suspect, especially for someone with a working coal mine on his country estate. Elsewhere, discussing the shortcomings of foreign aid, he notes that while Ghana and South Korea had roughly the same per capita income in the 1950s, the one that has gotten far more aid in the years since is vastly poorer today. True enough \u2014 but it hardly follows that, as he concludes, \u201cthe story of economic development is a bottom-up story. The story of lack of development is a top-down story.\u201d In fact, South Korea\u2019s economy is both remarkably successful and heavily directed from above \u2014 unlike North Korea\u2019s, which is staggeringly unsuccessful and even more heavily directed from above.So the lesson is clear: Emergent solutions succeed, and planned solutions fail \u2014 except when they don\u2019t. It would be nice to learn what differentiates one situation from another. That Ridley hasn\u2019t explained it hardly invalidates his larger point, that emergence is far more prevalent and more powerful than we think. But here too a deeper question remains: Why are emergence and randomness so hard for people to accept? Could it be that the human brain is such a pattern-\u00adseeking organ that it can barely acknowledge unguided developments as an option? \u201cThe belief in the will and in the immortal soul themselves emerged as evolutionary consequences of how the brain changed,\u201d Ridley writes. It\u2019s a thought he might well have explored further.THE EVOLUTION OF EVERYTHINGHow New Ideas EmergeBy Matt Ridley360 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $28.99.Frank Rose is a senior fellow at Columbia University School of the Arts and the author of \u201cThe Art of Immersion: How the Digital Generation Is Remaking Hollywood, Madison Avenue and the Way We Tell Stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Is Split Over How to Prepare for Euro Crises to Come", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 During the height of the Greek crisis last summer, five men gathered in a war room at the Finance Ministry in Athens and began poring over the outlines of a surreptitious project. Greece was at a dangerous impasse with its creditors over a bailout, and the group needed to find a way to keep the country functioning if it were to be forced out of the euro.The group, led by Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister at the time, came up with what he later called a \u201cplan B\u201d for Greece. It called for the creation of a parallel banking system as well as the use of i.o.u.s or even a new drachma to replace the euro if Greece\u2019s creditors cut funding to banks.There was one catch: If Greece dropped out of the currency zone, the entire European project risked succumbing to new chaos.In the end, European leaders struck a deal to salvage Athens with a new 86 billion euro bailout, and the secret plan was not used. But the episode \u2014 a stark reminder of the weaknesses of the euro and the challenges of membership in the eurozone \u2014 has created a rift among policy makers about how to strengthen European unity to deal with future crises.\u201cIt\u2019s positive that the eurozone didn\u2019t break up,\u201d said Simon Tilford, a director at the Center for European Reform in London. \u201cBut there are still major fault lines that have not been fully addressed. Europe is by no means out of the woods.\u201dOne reason is that European leaders still have not repaired what many economists say is the euro\u2019s chief flaw: the absence of a central fiscal authority. The region lacks a single agency \u2014 something akin to the United States Treasury \u2014 that can help manage debt liabilities among countries and make it easier to transfer financial aid to those in periods of difficulty.Efforts to strengthen Europe\u2019s banking system by centralizing oversight are incomplete. Plans to allow money from one country to be used to rescue troubled banks in another are similarly in flux.The economic situation only adds to the uncertainty. After six years of back-to-back crises, the region\u2019s economic recovery continues to move at two speeds, with southern countries faring worse than countries in the north, like Germany. Meanwhile, a tide of migrants from Africa and the Middle East has presented new economic and political challenges for leaders.Europe is hardly falling apart. Although it angered many European politicians, the Greek showdown also crystallized their thinking about the euro as an irreversible, historic project anchoring the European Union. Since summer, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France have repeatedly insisted that the euro must not only remain together but expand through further integration.But the Greek debacle also showed that leaders were still grappling with the question of how far they were willing to go to keep the currency union together.After Greece clinched the deal in August with its European creditors for the new bailout, the economy ministers of Germany and France called for a radical shift in the way the single currency was run. They proposed a eurozone treasury, to be overseen by a eurozone finance chief. That official would have a single budget, the power to harmonize and raise taxes, as well as the ability to share liabilities between countries for public finances and debts.\u201cIt cannot be isolated from a broader rethinking of the E.U.,\u201d they wrote. \u201cA stronger eurozone should be the core of a deepened E.U.\u201dBut the proposal has divided political opinion in Germany, France and other countries for the same reason that no one wanted to carry it out before. Under its prescriptions, countries using the euro might have to give up some national sovereignty to make the eurozone work better.European Union leaders have postponed a discussion of the future of the eurozone until December because of conflicting views about how to go forward. Germany and France both want a stronger eurozone. But Germany favors better enforcement of existing rules governing fiscal responsibility among euro countries. France, on the other hand, is focused on whether there should be a common budget \u2014 using taxpayer money from member countries \u2014 for the entire euro bloc.Adding to the pressure, countries that were hardest hit during the euro crisis remain strained. While a slow turnaround is taking hold in Spain and Portugal, and the economy is improving with greater speed in Ireland, growth remains below precrisis levels. The fallout has damaged national balance sheets and fueled high unemployment among millions of citizens, especially young people.\u201cThere is a risk that the eurozone recovery could stall as the rate of growth in the global economy slows,\u201d Mr. Tilford said. \u201cIf that happens, nothing that has so far been agreed to in terms of governance reforms for the eurozone is going to help.\u201dSuch prospects have not helped burnish the appeal of the 19-member euro club for prospective joiners. Although most of the European Union\u2019s 28 member states are obliged to adopt the euro, no new countries are expected to sign on for several years, especially after the fresh chaos in Greece.Poland, whose relatively robust economy would provide a lift to the currency bloc, is disinclined to get on board anytime soon. Voter interest in adopting the euro has been tepid, and Polish leaders are in no hurry to sign up. For officials in the Czech Republic, the Greek drama reinforced concerns that the eurozone was not stable. In April, the finance minister, Andrej Babis, ruled out any plans for the country to adopt the euro before 2018, citing worries about what could happen \u201cif Greece collapses.\u201dBeyond the eurozone\u2019s borders, the crisis has cast uncertainty over the future of the European Union itself.In Britain, where the government has no intention of adopting the euro, Prime Minister David Cameron has repeatedly pointed to the euro crisis and the haphazard response of eurozone leaders as proof of a flawed project. Conservatives in his party argue that membership in the European Union is more trouble than it\u2019s worth. The surge of migrants has only reinforced such perceptions.After a majority conservative government was elected last summer, lawmakers quickly renewed the call for a referendum in 2017 or earlier on whether Britain should stay in the European Union, raising the specter of the departure of one of the bloc\u2019s biggest members.Faced with the chaos of a possible decision to withdraw, Mr. Cameron has responded with a campaign to create what he called \u201creal change in Europe.\u201d He recently visited with Ms. Merkel and toured European capitals to drum up support for streamlining European institutions and simplifying the tangle of rules, which critics say are too bureaucratic and often undemocratic.Similar concerns have also elevated right-wing parties in Europe that have rallied against further integration. In France especially, the far-right National Front party, led by Marine Le Pen, has gained ground heading into the 2017 elections partly by tapping discontent over France\u2019s sluggish performance within the euro as well as concerns that the region\u2019s open-door policy might lead to a bigger wave of migrants.\u201cIf Le Pen gets elected, we\u2019re going to have a very different discussion going on about Europe,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a political and economic policy think tank based in Brussels.Still, analysts say, the broader political will to strengthen the European Union as well as the currency bloc remains strong and is increasingly likely to prevail. The danger is that policy makers could drag their feet and fail to muster the support to fix problems quickly, before the next crisis.\u201cMy overall reading is still that the majority of people are thinking in terms of the continued, gradual integration of Europe,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cBut we can still have accidents.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reinventing the Brooklyn Navy Yard", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s literally like working in a federal prison,\u201d said Chris Terrell, a wine importer who stores his bottles at the yard and must venture past its security checkpoints.Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, the nonprofit entity that manages the city-owned facility, is removing some of the walls that have isolated the Navy Yard from the community, while adding a supermarket, a food hall and a park that the public can use.\u201cIt\u2019s to send a message that we\u2019re not turning our backs on the community,\u201d said David Ehrenberg, the development corporation\u2019s president and chief executive.From the 1940s until 1966, the Naval brig locked up unruly drunken sailors, according to historic accounts. And from 1984 to 1994, over the objections of neighbors, the site served as a 1,300-bed prison, before finally being razed in 2005.Construction on Navy Green started in 2010 and is scheduled to be completed next year. When finished, it will include four multifamily high-rises and 23 single-family townhouses across a nearly full-block site ringed by Vanderbilt, Flushing and Clermont Avenues.The townhouses, faced in brick, come with three or four bedrooms, along with two full and two half-baths. The townhouses have open layouts on their ground floors; kitchens with Caesarstone counters, Bertazzoni ranges and Bosch dishwashers; and laundry rooms with sinks and side-by-side washers and dryers.As of late October, six of the 10 houses put up for sale in June were in contract, a project spokeswoman said. A three-bedroom was listed last month at $1.995 million, or $689 a square foot.Most of the units at the 12-story, 99-unit condo tower, at 8 Vanderbilt, carry income restrictions: a maximum of $99,830 for a single buyer and $175,350 for a family of six, said Martin Dunn, Dunn Development\u2019s president. Prices for these apartments range from $230,000 to $440,000.The condo is also offering 24 market-rate units without income limitations, 14 of which have sold since September, including a one-bedroom to Mr. Terrell, the wine dealer. Prices for the market-rate condos start at $625,000 for one-bedrooms, or about $900 a square foot, according to Stephen G. Kliegerman, the president of Halstead Property Development Marketing, which is handling sales.In the third quarter, condos in an area that includes Wallabout and nearby Vinegar Hill, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, traded at an average of $1,088 a square foot, according to Halstead sales data.The three other towers, at Nos. 7 and 45 Clermont and 40 Vanderbilt, were built over the last five years and are made up of affordable rentals. All buildings surround a signature amenity: a long private lawn running down the center of the block framed by cherry, oak and other trees.Though the complex does not have a doorman, the bike room was made extra-large. Because the nearest subway stops, on the F and G lines, are long, bleak walks away, residents are expected to take advantage of Flushing Avenue\u2019s popular bike lane to ride to Manhattan. \u201cThere is always going to be somebody who\u2019s going to say it\u2019s too far from the train,\u201d Mr. Kliegerman said. \u201cBut I think this is part of the beauty of the area, that it\u2019s not so congested.\u201dAcross the way, the Navy Yard may seem a bit more crowded. The 300-acre facility, which wraps around Wallabout Bay, has 7,000 people employed in 330 companies, which are tucked into new and old structures amid rusting cranes, Belgian block lanes and cannons. This head count is a far cry from the 70,000 employed during World War II constructing ships like the U.S.S. Missouri, on whose deck Japanese officials would later surrender.When the base closed, in 1966, Brooklyn\u2019s economy quickly declined, historians say, despite efforts by the city to reinvigorate the yard. By the early 1980s, just 100 people worked there, said Mr. Ehrenberg, 39, who was raised in Brooklyn and remembers going to the yard to pick up a car that had been towed. A police tow pound is still there, off Navy Street; the yard also is home to a cement company and a dry dock, which was repairing Weddell Sea, a tugboat, on a recent afternoon.According to its stated mission, the yard tries to lease only to tenants that make things. Smaller, less-industrial occupants are welcome, like Kings County Distillery, which makes whiskey in a Romanesque former Paymaster\u2019s Building. On Saturdays, it offers tastings, which, in the spirit of the more welcoming yard, are open to the public, though visitors must show I.D. at a gate. Similarly, Building 92, which opened in 2011, offers an informative museum and organizes tours.Another piece of the yard, at Flushing Avenue and Navy Street, will be carved out for a 74,000-square-foot Wegmans supermarket, in an area known as Admiral\u2019s Row, which is lined with sagging 19th-century houses overgrown with vines. Most of the decrepit houses will be razed, despite efforts to preserve them, and in the process graffiti-marked walls barricading this corner will also come down.Nearby, on Williamsburg Street West, another piece of the yard will be liberated from its fences. The 1.7-acre Naval Cemetery Landscape, with wood walkways and wildflower meadows, is set to open next spring. There are other signs of change along Flushing Avenue. JJ\u2019s Navy Yard Cocktail Lounge, a longtime strip club at Washington Avenue that was shuttered in 2010, has been remade as an outpost of the Brooklyn Roasting Company, whose headquarters is inside the Navy Yard.Efforts at outreach are still appreciated, said Mary Andrews, president of the tenants association at Farragut Houses, one of three nearby public housing developments. In the last year, the Navy Yard has stepped up recruitment of local labor, said Ms. Andrews, who moved to the area in 1970. Once a month, yard officials come to Farragut with ads for jobs like lift operators and truck drivers. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have in the community,\u201d she said.An article last Sunday about developments in and around the Brooklyn Navy Yard misidentified one of the avenues bordering Navy Green, a housing complex under construction across from the yard. It is Clermont Avenue, not Clinton Avenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Gets Immigration Policy Right", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBut since the immigration reform bill was killed, in 2013, the party that killed it \u2014 the Republicans \u2014 has dragged the immigration debate to grotesque depths that go well beyond the usual nativist bigotry. Republican presidential candidates are arguing, in all seriousness, about sealing the border with fantastical 2,000-mile fences and weaponized drones; merging state, local and federal authorities and private prisons into one all-seeing immigration police state; forcibly registering American Muslims; mass-deporting 11 million Mexicans and others in a 21st century Trail of Tears; and turning away thousands of refugees fleeing war and terrorism in the Middle East.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, turns away from the insanity. His plan starts with the right premise: that immigrants should be welcomed and assimilated, not criminalized and exploited. His proposals seek to uphold American values, bolster the rule of law, bolster the economy and protect and honor families.Recognizing Congress\u2019s chronic inaction on immigration, Mr. Sanders promises to use executive authority well beyond what President Obama has done. He would protect young immigrants and their parents from deportation, and give \u201cbroad administrative relief\u201d to young immigrants, to the parents of citizens and legal permanent residents and to others who would have been allowed to stay under the 2013 Senate bill. This affirms the humane and sensible principle behind that legislation \u2014 that 11 million unauthorized immigrants should stay and contribute, not be isolated and expelled.The Sanders plan tackles an ugly truth \u2014 that racial profiling and the nation\u2019s vast deportation and detention machinery have made suspected criminals of millions of people who don\u2019t fit the definition. His promise to \u201cdecouple\u201d federal immigration enforcement from local policing would be a sharp break from dragnet policies that expanded under President Obama. Mr. Sanders rightly defends \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies that protect public safety by building trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.Mr. Sanders\u2019s promise to increase immigrants\u2019 access to the justice system, with more funding for courts and lawyers, stands in sharp contrast to the Republican view of unauthorized immigrants as a shadow society of criminals who haven\u2019t been deported yet. Mr. Sanders instead sees them as parents, breadwinners, taxpayers, bulwarks of the economy and of the communities they live in, aspiring Americans trapped by unjust laws and oppressive policing.Is that so radical? It may sound that way, in today\u2019s climate. But it is a vision that lawmakers of both parties once embraced without question. Ronald Reagan and both Presidents Bush spoke movingly of immigrants as assets to the country to be welcomed through assimilation and citizenship.In this bizarre campaign season, Republican candidates are playing reality-TV versions of themselves, filling the air with lies and irrational promises, while the Democrats \u2014 Mr. Sanders especially \u2014 are depicted by TV comics as cranks and loons. Mr. Sanders\u2019s immigration plan is a powerful counterpoint to that stereotype. It is reality-based, moderate, practical and hopeful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poll Finds Global Consensus on a Need to Tackle Climate Change", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe survey, which sampled people in 40 countries, found that in every nation surveyed, except Pakistan, a majority of respondents supported placing limits on the emissions of gases that are warming the planet. In the United States, 69 percent did; in China, 71 percent; in Nigeria, 77 percent; in Brazil, 88 percent.\u201cWhether it is the unprecedented drought in California, devastating floods and hurricanes, extraordinary wildfires, people are now seeing the impact of climate change with their own eyes \u2014 they are experiencing its negative consequences now, where they live,\u201d Dr. Mann said. \u201cIt is no longer a distant, far-off problem. It is very real, and as a result, a growing majority of the population is demanding action.\u201dBut the intensity of concern about rising temperatures varies significantly across the world, the poll found, hinting at some of the domestic constraints leaders could face in negotiating deals in Paris that may impose short-term costs on their economies. Respondents in the United States, Australia and Russia, among the top carbon polluters per capita, were substantially less alarmed about the problem than their counterparts in India, Kenya and Mexico, which have less industrialized economies.There were also striking differences in opinion trends. In the United States and France, the proportion of people who say global climate change is a \u201cvery serious problem\u201d increased over the past five years, according to the poll. In the United States, 45 percent said the problem was very serious, compared with 37 percent in 2010, while in France the proportion rose to 56 percent from 46 percent over the same period.By contrast, the proportion of respondents who see the problem as very serious declined over the past five years in China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, Turkey and Argentina, the survey found. In China, the proportion saying the problem was very serious fell to 18 percent from 41 percent. In Japan, it declined to 45 percent from 58 percent.Fears about climate change were strongest in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. In Australia, Britain, China, Germany, Israel and Poland, fewer than 20 percent of respondents said they were very concerned that climate change would personally harm them during their lifetimes; in Brazil, Burkina Faso, Ghana, the Philippines and Uganda, more than 70 percent did.Despite significant differences in views within and across countries, the poll also found broadly similar patterns. People around the world were far more likely to say that significant lifestyle changes will be necessary to mitigate the effects of climate change than to say that technology alone can solve the problem; even in the technology-oriented United States, the respective figures were 66 percent and 23 percent.The poll also found general agreement that rich countries should do more than poor countries to shoulder the burden of dealing with the problem, because the former have produced most of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions so far, even though the latter will produce more planet-warming emissions in the years to come.Drought was the most common concern cited by respondents when asked about the consequences of climate change, followed closely by severe weather. In the United States, anxiety about drought was most prevalent in the West and the Midwest, which have both experienced water shortages in recent years.The poll found stark partisan divisions in the United States: 68 percent of Democrats considered global climate change to be a very serious problem, compared with 20 percent of Republicans; 82 percent of Democrats support curbs on greenhouse gas emissions, compared with 50 percent of Republicans; 79 percent of Democrats saw a need for lifestyle changes, among Republicans, 55 percent. Substantial partisan divisions on the issue were also identified in Britain, Canada and Australia.American women (51 percent) were substantially more likely than American men (39 percent) to say that climate change is a very serious problem; that it will affect them personally (36 percent versus 23 percent) and that major lifestyle changes will be required (75 percent versus 57 percent).Similarly, Americans ages 18 to 29 were far more likely to view global warming as a serious problem \u2014 and to think that rich nations should do more to address it \u2014 than Americans 50 and older. Less affluent Americans were more worried about it than more prosperous ones. Half of American Catholics, but only one-third of American Protestants, said that climate change was a very serious problem.The poll asked citizens of five large developing countries whether their governments should develop alternative energy sources, like wind and solar power; expand exploration and production of oil, coal and natural gas; or build more nuclear power plants. Majorities in Brazil (73 percent) and China (51 percent) expressed support for alternative energy sources; in India, 44 percent did. People in Russia and South Africa were more likely to say that all three approaches should be given equal priority.Although fewer than one in five Chinese expressed serious concern about global warming, more than seven in 10 supported an international treaty to curtail emissions \u2014 a striking gap that may reflect both the prominence of recent official pronouncements about emissions controls, as well as the fact that other environmental concerns, like air pollution, tend to dominate public debate in China.The survey was conducted from March 25 to May 27 among 45,435 respondents in 40 countries. The survey included telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates International.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Forever Wars", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is war. Vladimir Putin will never tire of declaring it.Every autumn since 2004 Mr. Putin has gathered a large group of international political scientists and commentators for a couple of days of discussions. The gathering, called the Valdai Discussion Club, has shifted shapes over the years, changing locations, personalities and topics. It used to be held in Valdai, a national park about halfway between Moscow and St. Petersburg, but this year it was held in Sochi, where facilities left over from the Winter Olympics had fallen into disuse. It used to focus largely on Russian politics and the economy, but in the last few years has turned increasingly to Russia\u2019s role in the world. It used to draw virtually all the Western Russia specialists who could get an invitation, offering, as it does, an opportunity to interact with a president who is usually inaccessible.But in recent years a number of Western scholars have dropped out or been disinvited. Attendance peaked at over 200 in 2013, and dropped to roughly half that number the following year. Still, the basic nature of the event remains constant: It is a junket, an affair lavishly catered at the Kremlin\u2019s expense, at which Mr. Putin puts forward his vision of himself and his country.This year\u2019s gathering was titled \u201cSocieties Between War and Peace: Overcoming the Logic of Conflict in Tomorrow\u2019s World,\u201d but in his keynote address Mr. Putin dispensed with the \u201cbetween.\u201d The world is at war, he explained. And it is all the fault of the United States.Back in the 1970s the underground Soviet singer-songwriter Alexander Galich sang of his country, \u201cWe stand for peace and we are preparing for war.\u201d The Kremlin punished him for this and similar songs by kicking him out of the country, but this particular phrase was actually an accurate rendition of Soviet rhetoric. Much like the American gun lobby today, the Soviet rulers claimed that the only way to stay safe was to be armed to the teeth. Mr. Putin has now taken this logic a step further by claiming that the only way to maintain peace is to actually wage war.\u201cPeace, a life at peace, has always been and continues to be an ideal for humanity,\u201d said Mr. Putin. \u201cBut peace as a state of world politics has never been stable.\u201d In other words, peace is an anomaly, a fragile state of equilibrium that, Mr. Putin explained, is exceedingly difficult to sustain. The advent of nuclear arms helped, he said, by introducing the specter of mutually assured destruction, and for a while \u2014 from the 1950s through the 1980s \u2014 \u201cworld leaders acted responsibly, weighing all circumstances and possible consequences.\u201d He thus cast the Cold War as the golden era of world peace.Since the Cold War ended, the world has descended into disarray. \u201cIn the last quarter-century, the threshold for applying force has clearly been lowered,\u201d said Mr. Putin. \u201cImmunity against war, acquired as a result of two world wars literally on a psychological, subconscious level, has been weakened.\u201d The United States is the primary culprit because it has thrown the world out of equilibrium by asserting its dominance. Mr. Putin, who has cited different examples of this American behavior in the past, this time focused on the missile defense system and its recent tests in Europe.Mr. Putin\u2019s speech then took a short detour as he ranted about the United States not playing well with others, including France and Japan. Then he got on the topic of Syria. He repeated what he has said before: Russian military intervention there is legitimate because Russia is protecting Syria\u2019s sole legal government, that of Bashar al-Assad, and the United States can choose to accept this and negotiate with Russia, or find itself fighting a war against it.It is important to listen to what Mr. Putin is saying. His narrative of resisting U.S. world domination is familiar, but the key point he made at his meeting concerns his views on war \u2014 and peace. The strategic purpose of his wars is war itself. This is true in Ukraine, where territory was a mere pretext, and this is true of Syria, where protecting Mr. Assad and fighting ISIS are pretexts too. Both conflicts are wars with no end in sight because, in Mr. Putin\u2019s view, only at war can Russia feel at peace.A totalitarian society seeks to be mobilized, and in this sense Mr. Putin\u2019s statement is verifiably true: The more Russia reverts to its totalitarian habits, the more comfort it will derive from a constant state of war. It is useless, in the face of such single-minded determination, to caution against the return of the Cold War, as though Americans could stave it off simply by not wanting to be involved. The war is on, and Mr. Putin has been sparing no effort trying to get that message across.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Afghan Businessman Convicted in Kabul Bank Fraud Is Still Free to Make Money", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 In a big day for development here, a notable Afghan businessman stood with top government officials on Wednesday as he signed the contract for a new township: 8,800 homes across 33 acres of prime real estate in the heart of the capital, with an initial investment of at least $95 million.But Mr. Frozi, it seems, will be spending his days making money while he serves his sentence at night.Five years after the banking scandal, the apparent unwillingness of the Afghan authorities to deal firmly with the perpetrators is perhaps one of the most glaring examples of Western impotence in the fight to clean up a system that the United States, chiefly, built and paid for.At the very least, the lenient treatment is likely to be a new source of frustration for international donors and the International Monetary Fund, which had made the prosecution of Mr. Frozi and his partners a precondition for continued aid to a government that has shown halting progress in tackling corruption.\u201cClearly, this is very odd,\u201d said a senior Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had been surprised by the development and had yet to gather full details. \u201cThe message it sends is that if you have stolen enough money, you can get away with it.\u201dThe mixed message sent by Mr. Frozi\u2019s re-emergence is another sign of trouble for Mr. Ghani, who is caught in a risky quandary over corruption: He alienated many powerful Afghan figures with a series of reform dictates early in his term, but still faces criticism for not doing enough.Drago Kos, the chief international corruption watchdog in Afghanistan, resigned two weeks ago, saying he did not think the government was serious in its efforts.Anti-corruption campaigners said the Afghan government\u2019s partnership with Mr. Frozi on such a major project amounted to a public joke.\u201cIt sends a very negative political signal to the Afghan people and the world: that anyone can loot, but if they invest in Afghanistan, no one will question the legitimacy of the investment,\u201d said Yama Torabi, a member of the anticorruption committee. \u201cIt perpetuates the culture of impunity.\u201dAt the ceremony opening for Mr. Frozi\u2019s project, called Smart City, Mr. Ghani\u2019s legal adviser, Abdul Ali Mohammadi, thanked the businessman for his investment. He acknowledged that the presence of Mr. Frozi \u201chere and not in Pul-i-Charkhi prison\u201d had raised many questions.He added, \u201cAs long as these individuals remain imprisoned in jails, or on the run abroad, not only do they suffer but what they owe the people also remains.\u201dStill, efforts have lagged in reclaiming about $988 million in embezzled funds in the Kabul Bank fraud case, with less than half recovered as of August.In addition to his 15-year sentence, Mr. Frozi was ordered by the courts to pay back $137 million. In a telephone interview on Wednesday, he said that his new venture was part of an agreement he had reached with the government.Under the deal, he would serve his sentence at night, but would come to his office during the day to invest in projects that would eventually generate enough money to pay back what he owes.In addition, he said, he had paid back 17 percent of his debt upfront, with the rest to be paid in installments over seven years.His latest investment, he says, will allow him to pay his debts off much sooner, and make a large profit in the process.\u201cI will make $300 million in profits in this project,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will pay what I owe the government in 13 or 14 months, and the project will bring the government an additional $75 million in taxes.\u201dHe said that for more than a month now, \u201cI work in office until 4 p.m., then go to the National Directorate of Security to serve my sentence.\u201dIt quickly turned into a piggy bank of sorts for the country\u2019s elite, who borrowed freely from depositors\u2019 money to invest in their own projects without repaying their loans.One shareholder, a nephew of Mr. Fahim who had a 3 percent stake, was \u201cprobably 7 years old,\u201d according to the minutes of a government meeting held after the bank ran into trouble.But the shareholders were borrowers, too. Hundreds of millions of dollars in depositors\u2019 money was given to them and transferred to Dubai for investment in real estate.Customers\u2019 savings also went into purchasing an airline; the founding of a major liquid gas distribution company; the purchase of the country\u2019s oldest cement factory; the construction of a resplendent mall and residential complex in Kabul; and numerous other businesses.The bank\u2019s popularity grew largely because of the enticements it offered to struggling Afghans in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.Each month, the bank held a televised lottery in which customers with as little as $100 in their accounts were eligible to play. Apartments, cars, and large cash prizes were given away.But it was later revealed that the hundreds of apartments given away were properties sold to the bank by Mr. Frozi and Mr. Farnood at prices three to four times their actual value, earning them substantial profits.It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Farnood, who is also serving a 15-year sentence, had negotiated a similar deal with the government.But Mr. Frozi\u2019s latest tactic has raised a host of questions. Why, if he still has enough money to play with, has the government not been able to recover what he owes in full already? Why has it not seized the property he intends to build on, which he still owns? And why are the business partners in his new venture undeterred by his reputation?The answer, many analysts say, lies in the connections Mr. Frozi accumulated during his time in charge of Kabul Bank, when he doled out cash to an influential elite and political strongmen, who remain in his thrall.Mr. Ghani\u2019s coalition government depends on many of the same players, and could do little more now than to reach a compromise with Mr. Frozi, the analysts say.Mr. Frozi\u2019s enduring influence ensured him luxury even in jail, from where he was reportedly released regularly to watch his soccer team, Ferozi F.C.On a daily basis, Mr. Frozi posted photographs and poems on his Facebook page from his cell, which was specially furnished with cushions and maroon Persian rugs, its walls painted a pale yellow.Among the images is one of him with his children lounging on the cushions during family visit day. There is even a photograph of Mr. Frozi in the prison yard, hanging out with Taliban prisoners.\u201cIn Pul-i-Charkhi prison, with the political opponents of the National Unity Government,\u201d the caption reads, in reference to Mr. Ghani\u2019s coalition that he just signed a partnership with.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Labor Reform in Vietnam, Tied to Pacific Trade Deal, Depends on Hanoi\u2019s Follow-Up", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVietnam\u2019s Constitution enshrines the right of workers to strike and engage in organized protests, said Le Dang Doanh, a prominent economist and a former top official at a government research organization in Hanoi. But until now, Vietnam has adopted few laws to codify and protect those rights.Consequently, the labor accord \u201cis a very positive step for Vietnam,\u201d said Mr. Doanh, a longtime advocate of market changes who has advised his country\u2019s top leadership through its gradual relaxation of many government controls over the economy in the last quarter-century.Pham Chi Lan, the former secretary general of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a former senior adviser in the office of the prime minister, also portrayed the agreement as an important concession. \u201cThis is a big compromise, for Vietnam to agree to do this,\u201d she said.But Tony Foster, the managing partner of the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, a big global law firm, said that the labor provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership had been expected, and that it was unclear how much change they would bring to Vietnam.The central question, he said, will be the extent to which the trade agreement increases the influence and independence of labor unions.\u201cThe devil is really going to be in the details on a lot of this stuff \u2014 I\u2019m sure people are going to be parsing it very carefully to determine what will really be required,\u201d Mr. Foster said in a telephone interview from Hanoi. \u201cIt will be a balancing act for the government, and I\u2019m sure they will comply, more or less.\u201dMultinationals have shown much more interest this autumn in investing in Vietnam, and the anticipated labor provisions of the trade accord have caused little concern among companies, he added.For the last decade, factories in Vietnam have faced many wildcat strikes each spring, sometimes involving thousands of workers at a single location. The strikes tend to occur close to the Tet festival and are often the result of workers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the annual bonuses they receive then. Vietnam has administrative regulations for striking with government protection, but they are so bureaucratic that workers seldom follow them. The Vietnamese government has tolerated wildcat strikes to allow workers to let off steam and to demand raises, particularly during the period of high inflation in Vietnam that accompanied and followed the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Unlike some countries that have been under authoritarian rule, like Indonesia before the fall of President Suharto in 1998, Vietnam does not have a large underground labor movement that might quickly benefit from legalization. Vietnam\u2019s tolerance of wildcat strikes may have discouraged the formation of such a movement.Labor-affiliated institutes in Germany and Australia have had offices in Vietnam for many years to work with the government-affiliated union and encourage it to press harder on behalf of workers. American labor groups have been less active in Vietnam until now, partly because of the lingering history of the Vietnam War, which has made American involvement in Vietnamese domestic issues more delicate.Two Vietnamese government officials, reached in Hanoi after the text of the agreement was made public on Thursday, had no immediate comment. But Le Dinh Quang, the deputy head of the labor relationships department at the government-controlled Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, welcomed the accord.\u201cThat is a very big challenge for us, but due to national benefit, the integration with the world and also the rights and benefit of labor, we have to find solutions\u201d to apply the agreement, Mr. Quang said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe understand that this would be very good for workers in Vietnam.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "McDonald\u2019s C.E.O. on All Day Breakfast, Hourly Wages and Wall Street", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. and A. Q. What is the single most important thing you\u2019ve done since you became chief executive of McDonald\u2019s?Why do you think people were afraid to take risks?We\u2019ve been so successful for the best part of 60 years, so a lot of our people, their careers have developed through McDonald\u2019s, and they\u2019ve had that success working in a certain way. But my observation is that the pace of change outside McDonald\u2019s has been quicker than the pace of change within over the last few years, and consumers started to notice. What I\u2019ve tried to do is just add that sense of urgency. We have a huge amount of talent in the business, and we just encourage people to feel confident in their convictions and alter their decision-making \u2014 and let\u2019s get going!What what\u2019s been the biggest surprise or shock to you? What didn\u2019t you expect? I think what I found most rewarding \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a surprise \u2014 but what I\u2019ve found most rewarding is the speed with which the organization has embraced the challenge. We\u2019ve done certain things internally like restructuring our global business, which was a fundamental change in the way our operating business is structured. Which after 40 plus years of having the business structured in that way, the manner in which all of our people embraced the change, recognized the need and the benefit of it, has been really rewarding to me. It kind of encourages me to go harder and faster because I sense the organization, we are all rallying around each other and enthused by the sense of energy we\u2019re creating creating.The nature of competition has changed. It\u2019s no longer just the two who shall go unnamed, it\u2019s the better burger business, it\u2019s Panera, it\u2019s Chipotle, it\u2019s every new little restaurant that\u2019s popping up. What does McDonald\u2019s need to do to respond to that competition?There\u2019s absolutely no doubt consumers have more choice than ever, and the standards of all that provide food have improved over time. Our No. 1 priority is \u2014 and it\u2019s as simple as it sounds \u2014 is to run better restaurants and consistently.We\u2019re fortunate enough here in the U.S. to serve 27 million customers a day, around the world nearly 69 million customers a day, and we know that the biggest difference we can make to positively influence customer choice is deliver a higher standard, a more consistent standard, of day-to-day restaurant experience. And that\u2019s the fundamentals \u2014 we call it QS&C \u2014 fundamentals of hot, fresh, tasty food; fast, accurate and friendly service and in a clean and inviting environment, and we have focused very hard on just that concept of just running better restaurants on a day-to-day basis that\u2019s the way you can provide the most visible, immediate change to customers.I\u2019ve noticed myself, because I order things from restaurants all the time, I can honestly say the accuracy level at McDonald\u2019s has improved over the last three or four months.The U.S. team identified as its No. 1 priority in improving the service experience was to improve on accuracy. There are a number of things they\u2019ve done. We have simplified merchandise in the restaurants so there is a sharper focus to the menu we offer. We\u2019ve also reduced the range of the menu, and we\u2019ve eliminated some of the slower-moving items that customers clearly weren\u2019t appreciating as much. So that\u2019s enabled us to streamline the menu.The operations team is then working on the training programs, reiterating some of the operations procedures for the drive-through and the front counter about effective clarifying orders with customers when they place them, double-checking that when you assemble people\u2019s orders that we\u2019ve got it right. It\u2019s real nuts and bolts operational stuff.Your experience has actually been recognized in the mystery shopper feedback we get \u2014 we call it The Voice. We get feedback from tens and tens of thousands of customers every month, and customers are telling us we are delivering a more consistent and better experience than we were a year ago. Within that, accuracy is where the greatest improvement is.There\u2019s a lot of pressure on higher wages in the United States, both from people screaming and yelling for it and from the economy itself, with more people being employed. You all have taken steps to improve the pay of your employees in the stores you control, but what impact does this pressure have on your franchisees? Our franchisees are independent businessmen and businesswomen. They set their own pay scales, and over time, they\u2019ve been expert at that. They, just like the company, we recognize we\u2019re in the service business and therefore we want to hire and train and retain the best front-line staff we can, and pay is part of that package to attract the best and retain the best. But there\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s upward pressure on the operating business as a result. It\u2019s an above-inflation cost increase, and therefore in order to manage that, we then need to grow the topline of the business to help accommodate those costs.But also what we\u2019re working really hard on is to see it less as just a cost but more, if you like, as an investment. Because if we get a more high-trained, high-motivated staff in our restaurants, turnover comes down, our productivity improves and we deliver a better day-to-day customer experience. Ultimately, the customer benefits from the investment we\u2019re making. So does it generate P&L pressure? Absolutely, it\u2019s real cost.How have you been meeting with or addressing the franchisees, who\u2019ve been disgruntled for the last couple of years? They\u2019ve felt like corporate was out of touch with operations.Being relatively newer to the U.S. business, one of the priorities I\u2019ve made is to really work on being visible and approachable right across the U.S. I visit all of the highest-priority markets around the world, clearly, because that\u2019s fundamental to our turnaround, but nowhere more so than the U.S. I wanted to expose myself to them so I can learn and listen and understand the frustrations they have but also share my experience of having led turnarounds, albeit on a smaller level, around U.K. and Europe, and just see what I can do to help.We\u2019ve had such open conversation, such robust dialogue, and the alignment really is becoming strong. And, frankly, my role is to encourage the U.S. team to do that. It\u2019s the U.S. leadership team who have worked really well with the representative leadership owner-operators, and I have certainly lent my support and experience where required. The progress that has been made is, frankly, showing today in decisions being made today. As we look at something like the All Day Breakfast platform that we\u2019ve recently launched back in, well, a month ago, Oct. 6, when we develop initiatives of that scale, we actually take a vote from the operators to support it. We went to the field for a vote to support it, and we achieved a 98 percent approval from the field. I think that speaks volumes to the alignment and the unity that the owner-operators have among themselves and with management. When we have that strength of unity, our execution in the restaurants is noticeably better. I think they\u2019ve done a fantastic job of launching and delivering the initial phases of the All Day Breakfast plan.What is the biggest misunderstanding that the investment community has about what you\u2019re trying to do at McDonald\u2019s?It\u2019s interesting, because we\u2019re here in New York and had our investment meeting on Tuesday, which was a significant point in time for us to calibrate where we\u2019re taking the business decisions we\u2019re making. I\u2019ve been really pleased at the way across the last seven or eight months that I believe we\u2019ve delivered a really consistent message, an approach to how we\u2019re managing the business and the expectations we have and, frankly, where we\u2019ll create value and where we\u2019re going to grow.Through the quarterly earnings calls and through the investor day, I\u2019m sensing there\u2019s a deep understanding across the investment community, across Wall Street for where we\u2019re heading. I\u2019ve been unequivocal that this is an operating growth led turnaround, you know, grow the business, that\u2019s where the greatest value can be created, it\u2019s where the long-term interests of all of our stakeholders are and, at the same time, we have taken a challenging look at other aspects of our business that we think is good for the business, will support the turnaround but also reward shareholders-We\u2019ve taken some tough decisions on our cost base. We\u2019ve made assertive and proactive decisions on supporting a greater acceleration of franchising some of our company-owned restaurants. We\u2019ve taken a good look at the strength of the balance sheet and believe our capital structure can change in a way that actually helps take advantage of the markets at the moment, provides us strength and takes a little debt going forward. And we\u2019ve taken a look at our real estate and decided the best place for our real estate is within the business model as it stands. So we\u2019ve had a really rigorous look at our business, but the fundamental headline is this will be an operating growth-led turnaound, and I believe Wall Street has heard that and appreciates it.You\u2019ve said it\u2019s going to take time, you\u2019ve said that repeatedly and consistently. How much time should we give you?I think the greatest demand actually comes from within, not from outside. We are challenging ourselves to act earnestly and actually get some traction in the business. Part of the risk I want to avoid in the business is coming off the turnaround agenda sooner than is right. So we achieved growth in the third quarter, which was a little sooner and a little stronger than most people expected.But one quarter does not make a turnaround, so I\u2019m keeping a relentless focus within the organization and within my communication broadly that we are going to stick to the turnaround plan until it\u2019s truly embedded. At the same time, in parallel, we\u2019ve got a talented team working on what the future growth plan will look like. I was able to share on Tuesday that I expect to share that future growth plan in the second quarter of 2016, first of all internally and then we\u2019ll share it externally, but that will be subject to maintaining our momentum.I have had the confidence in our trailing momentum to indicate that I believe the fourth quarter will be a growth quarter, we\u2019re going to grow in all four segments of the business across the world. We\u2019re now five to six weeks into the quarter, and I reiterate my confidence that this will be a good solid quarter as well. That will be a second proof point. And then we want to head into 2016, maintain our momentum, and at the right time, we\u2019ll move from a turnaround plan to a longer-term strategic growth plan.Finally, what\u2019s your favorite item from McDonald\u2019s menu?A Quarter Pounder with cheese.An earlier version of this interview misquoted Mr. Easterbrook in one answer. He said that as a change agent he encouraged the company to \u201cembrace urgency,\u201d not \u201cembrace emergency.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charles M. Cawley, Credit Card Pioneer, Dies at 75", "Date": "2015-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles M. Cawley, who founded MBNA Corporation in a supermarket basement, transformed the company into the world\u2019s largest independent credit card issuer, and sold it two decades later to Bank of America for nearly $35 billion, died on Nov. 18 at his home in Camden, Me. He was 75.His death was confirmed by his family, who did not specify a cause.Mr. Cawley was running Maryland National Bank\u2019s credit card division in Baltimore in 1982 when, frustrated by the refusal of legislators there to lift a cap on interest rates (he called them \u201csome of the dumbest people I have ever known\u201d), he opened a subsidiary in a converted A&P store in Ogletown, Del., about four miles across the state line.The future of the subsidiary, called the Maryland Bank National Association, was so iffy that in its first year he signed a dozen 30-day leases for the space occupied by his 150 employees.But within five years, the company had 1,000 employees and $2 billion in loans, its phenomenal growth set off by its introduction of 24-hour customer service and, crucially, so-called affinity credit cards.The cards are tied to sports teams, universities, professional associations and other organizations and are aimed at consumers who are loyal to them and willing to retain the cards despite competition from rival issuers that offer lower fees and interest rates.Mr. Cawley theorized that consumers were more likely to apply for a card affiliated with their favorite team or school than an impersonal bank and less likely to default.MBNA became one of America\u2019s 50 most profitable companies, making $2.34 billion in 2003. That was also the third consecutive year that Mr. Cawley\u2019s total compensation, including cash, stock and options, was around $50 million. He retired late that year after the board refused his recommendations for bonuses and future compensation.Mr. Cawley spent profusely, building a 16-car garage to house his classic cars (beginning with a blue 1947 Cadillac convertible) and supporting cultural and educational institutions, including Georgetown University and the University of Delaware. He helped Maine\u2019s economy by employing thousands of its residents and supported its nonprofit institutions through his own philanthropy.He also cultivated political connections; in one instance he and MBNA donated $1 million to the foundation that built the elder George Bush\u2019s presidential library in Texas.Mr. Cawley was so intent on motivating his employees that he named the company\u2019s stock symbol KRB, after Kenneth R. Bowman, MBNA\u2019s first director of service quality.Charles Michael Cawley was born on Aug. 15, 1940, in Beverly, Mass., to Charles Sr. and the former Ruth Walsh. (The younger Mr. Cawley did not use the \u201cJr.\u201d with his name.) He was raised in New Jersey and spent summers in Maine, where his grandfather once ran a dress factory.After graduating from Georgetown in 1962, he married the former Julie Murphy.Mr. Cawley was hired by Maryland National Bank in 1972. After he opened the subsidiary in Delaware, he persuaded the alumni association of Georgetown, his alma mater, to sponsor a credit card for its members, and the concept of affinity cards was born.The National Education Association and the American Dental Association soon signed up, followed by 5,000 other groups.MBNA went public in 1991. When it was acquired by Bank of America in 2005, 50 million customers held MBNA credit cards.Mr. Cawley is survived by his wife along with their son, Dr. C. Michael Cawley III; their daughter, Maureen C. Rhodes; four grandchildren; and a sister, Constance Devanney.The couple lived in Vero Beach, Fla., Wilmington, Del., and Camden, Me.Mr. Cawley monitored MBNA\u2019s operations fastidiously. He once knelt in a company flower bed to cull a bloom that he deemed the wrong color. Perhaps not surprisingly, one of the company\u2019s yachts was named Impatience.Advertisement"}

But even party conservatives held a reservoir of affection for him, and since 2005 tributes, biographies and memoirs have multiplied, and his family supports a website in his memory.Although Mr. Xi has shown none of Mr. Hu\u2019s impatience with party orthodoxy, he had good reason to show affection for this widely admired leader. As head of the Communist Party\u2019s organization department from late 1977 and then party general secretary from 1980, Mr. Hu pushed to politically rehabilitate officials and intellectuals who had been purged under Mao.The elder Mr. Xi was a senior official ousted by Mao in 1962. He endured beatings and brutal interrogations during the Cultural Revolution, and after Mao died in 1976, he waited, like thousands of other purged officials, to be brought back from the political wilderness. Deng Xiaoping and other leaders helped those rehabilitations, but Mr. Hu was especially committed, according to historians.In December 1977, Xi Zhongxun\u2019s wife, Qi Xin, secured a meeting with Mr. Hu. His role as head of party organization affairs gave him a powerful role in political rehabilitations. Mr. Hu listened to her describe the elder Mr. Xi\u2019s sufferings, according to the official biography of Xi Zhongxun.Mr. Hu \u201cdeclared that all unjust and erroneous verdicts must be handled truthfully so that the verdicts are thoroughly reversed,\u201d the biography said. \u201cThe case of Comrade Xi Zhongxun, of course, is no exception,\u201d it quoted Mr. Hu as saying.Later, Xi Zhongxun, returned to senior office, repaid Mr. Hu\u2019s support. In late 1986, after Deng Xiaoping accused Mr. Hu of failing to act forcefully against ideological laxity and student protests, Mr. Hu came under bitter attack by Deng\u2019s loyalists and ideological conservatives. But the elder Mr. Xi stood by Mr. Hu at a meeting to criticize him.\u201cThis is abnormal,\u201d he said at that meeting, according to one account republished on the website dedicated to Mr. Hu. \u201cYou\u2019ve set in motion something that will only lay the seeds of disaster for the stability and unity of the party and the country.\u201dMr. Hu endured persecution and near-death experiences in his tortuous political career, which started as a teenage \u201clittle Red devil,\u201d joining the Communist revolutionary forces in the 1930s. He was almost executed as a suspected traitor in one of the purges that paralyzed the encircled Communist forces.After Mao\u2019s death in 1976 and a coup that swept aside radical supporters of the Cultural Revolution, Mr. Hu was among the cohort of party veterans who reclaimed power and began shedding the ideological and economic fetters in favor of economic and political liberalization.Mr. Hu\u2019s off-the-cuff pronouncements on policy exasperated even fellow reformers in the party elite. In 1984, Mr. Hu suggested that, for good hygiene, Chinese people should set aside chopsticks and shared dishes in favor of Western manners.\u201dWe should prepare more knives and forks, buy more plates and sit around the table to eat Chinese food in the Western style, that is, each from his own plate,\u201d he said. The idea never took off.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tulsi Gabbard, Rising Democratic Star From Hawaii, Makes Mark on Party by Defying It", "Date": "2015-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosWASHINGTON \u2014 Between the chilly temperatures and the pace of the push-ups, there was plenty to complain about after eight lawmakers straggled into the park behind the Longworth House Office Building for their regular 6:30 a.m. workout.While the others in the group griped and groaned on a recent Tuesday, Representative Tulsi Gabbard, 34, her Hindu prayer beads wrapped around a wrist for her daily yoga meditation, said little.\u201cI\u2019m feeling like whining,\u201d she replied between push-ups.\u201cMy responsibility is to the people of Hawaii and the American people to stand up and fight for what is right and what is in the best interest of our country,\u201d she said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThat has nothing to do with party politics.\u201dIt is not exactly what Democrats had envisioned when they tapped her for stardom.That unexpected burst came just weeks after she bucked the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, by calling for more presidential candidate debates.Those fights have left Ms. Gabbard straddling the line between being a next-generation leader for Democrats and a prominent critic of her party\u2019s leaders.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get a better role model,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel, who led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee when Ms. Gabbard was first elected in 2012. \u201cShe reflected the diversity of the caucus and at the same time had amazing credibility on the issue of national security.\u201dMs. Gabbard, who served two combat tours in the Middle East and holds the rank of major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has also called for the United States to suspend its visa waiver program with European countries until the intelligence community can catch up with the influx of Syrian refugees, an economically risky proposition.\u201cYou want to talk about the effect on the economy if these actions are not taken and an attack is allowed to occur here, even though we\u2019ve identified this vulnerability?\u201d she said on CNN this month.When she was sworn into office in 2013, she became not only the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to Congress, but also one of the first female combat veterans. So it is no surprise that leaders in both parties have kept an eye on Ms. Gabbard, a risk-taker who loves to surf and ordered her wedding dress five days before her ceremony in April.The home-schooled daughter of a state senator and a former member of the State Board of Education, Ms. Gabbard has credited her parents for her early interest in public service. She helped her father, Mike Gabbard, start a nonprofit devoted to environmental education when she was a teenager, an effort that prompted her to consider a path in politics.But glad-handing did not come naturally to Ms. Gabbard. \u201cI was probably not your prototype political candidate,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no background, no training, extremely shy, a total introvert, and really what I had was that motivation, that desire.\u201dShe developed a knack for it, eking out an upset victory 10 years later in a hard-fought congressional primary in her Democratic-leaning district. Ms. Gabbard entered the race as a Honolulu councilwoman with a fraction of the support of an established former mayor of Honolulu, Mufi Hannemann \u2014 and walked out with 55 percent of the vote to Mr. Hannemann\u2019s nearly 34 percent and, eventually, the seat.Party leaders rushed to put her to work mentoring candidates about campaign mechanics and defense issues.Shortly after she joined Congress, Patrick Gaspard, a former White House official who was then executive director of the Democratic National Committee, tapped Ms. Gabbard to become a vice chairwoman, she said, a post with fund-raising, campaigning and other party duties she had to have explained to her.\u201cComing to be a vice chair of the D.N.C. is not something I ever sought out. It\u2019s not something I knew a lot about,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018What exactly do you want me to do?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMs. Gabbard said in an interview that she had spoken out on principle. But to some, exposing internal disputes is a grave offense. Some Democrats privately questioned whether Ms. Gabbard, who takes pride in her independence, was well suited to the more partisan post, said one House Democrat, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were internal party matters.Though Ms. Gabbard has been unsparing in her criticism of some of Mr. Obama\u2019s national security decisions, some Democrats said that only made her voice more valuable.\u201cWe Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are not there to rubber-stamp administration policy,\u201d said Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019re there to say what we think is right, and Tulsi does that and does it very well.\u201dMs. Gabbard said, \u201cI\u2019d be dishonoring the memory of a lot of folks who I\u2019ve served with who didn\u2019t make it home if I didn\u2019t stand up for what I believe is right and stand up and speak the truth.\u201dIt is a quality that has earned her the respect of many Democrats and some Republicans. Thirteen lawmakers attended her wedding in Hawaii, including Mr. McCarthy and about a half-dozen other Republicans, said Representative Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat.Mr. Mullin, who was also on her guest list, said Ms. Gabbard \u201chas the ability to forge relationships on both sides.\u201d\u201cAnd she has a personality people just seem to want to work with,\u201d he said.Ms. Sinema, 39, said there was an emerging divide in Congress between younger members and older members. She said Ms. Gabbard exemplified a less partisan method of coalition-building that will ultimately prove more appealing to voters.\u201cShe\u2019s a solid Democrat,\u201d Ms. Sinema said. \u201cBut she\u2019s really practical in terms of how she approaches issues and gets things done.\u201dSgt. Ryan Soon, 31, who served under Ms. Gabbard in Kuwait on her second tour and has been a strong supporter of her political career, said she had earned the respect of her soldiers by exhibiting a reasoned practicality, recognizing her unit\u2019s strengths but also bolstering its weaknesses.And her presence at ad hoc barbecues supplemented with canned goods and meals ready to eat did not hurt, either, he said.\u201cShe was a leader that people followed not because they had to but because they wanted to,\u201d Sergeant Soon said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Henry S. Rowen, 90, RAND Chief Who Quit in Pentagon Papers Case, Dies", "Date": "2015-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis son Chris confirmed the death.The Defense Department, the Air Force and NASA accounted for more than 90 percent of its contracts when Mr. Rowen took over, but under his leadership, RAND analysts began looking at social welfare issues as well.In 1967, Robert S. McNamara, then the secretary of defense, created a task force to write a comprehensive history of America\u2019s political and military involvement in Vietnam, recruiting several RAND analysts, including Mr. Ellsberg, to work on the project. Drawing on a wealth of classified material, the completed study ran to 7,000 pages and 47 volumes. Two copies were given to RAND.Mr. Rowen had been a close friend of and mentor to Mr. Ellsberg, from their time at RAND in the late 1950s. He had steered contracting work to Mr. Ellsberg at the Defense Department, brought him back to RAND as a strategic analyst soon after becoming its president and authorized him to work on the Pentagon study.Increasingly disillusioned with America\u2019s role in Vietnam, Mr. Ellsberg photocopied the study in late 1969 and, after resigning from RAND in 1970, turned it over to The New York Times, which began publishing excerpts in June 1971.Some of RAND\u2019s military clients and board members were already unhappy with Mr. Rowen\u2019s focus on social policy. The leaking of the Pentagon Papers was the final straw. In November 1971, Mr. Rowen announced his resignation. In a terse statement, he said, \u201cMaintaining vitality in institutions and in people is brought about by change \u2014 RAND and I are no exception.\u201dHe went on to become a leading policy intellectual at Stanford University and the Hoover Institution, and served in a variety of government posts. As assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs under Dick Cheney in the administration of the first President George Bush, Mr. Rowen was deeply involved in military planning for the Persian Gulf war. His study of a 1941 British operation to put down an Iraqi revolt led him to propose an end run around Iraqi forces rather than a frontal attack, an idea that, with modifications, found its way into the successful \u201cleft hook\u201d strategy employed by American forces.Henry Stanislaus Rowen, known as Harry, was born on Oct. 11, 1925, in Boston. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business and engineering administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1949, then served a management internship at the Barnsdall Oil Company before joining RAND as an economist.One of the most important studies he worked on, \u201cSelection and Use of Strategic Air Bases,\u201d showed that Soviet short-range missiles could eliminate the forward European bases operated by the Strategic Air Command, a finding that led the Air Force to close all of them.Mr. Rowen left RAND to study economics at Oxford but returned after earning a master\u2019s degree in 1955 and continued writing on issues including nuclear strategy, international security and the emerging economies of Asia. He helped develop RAND\u2019s Planning-Programming-Budgeting System, which sought to improve decision making by combining systems analysis with budgeting abilities. It grew out of a RAND analysis of the relative costs and benefits of the B-52 and B-70 bombers.He joined President John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration in 1961 as deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. Working under the Cold War strategist Paul Nitze, Mr. Rowen helped develop the policy known as \u201cflexible response,\u201d an alternative to the Eisenhower-era policy of massive nuclear retaliation to defend NATO allies. In 1965, he was named assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget, where he promoted the RAND planning and budget system. President Lyndon B. Johnson went on to order all federal agencies to use it.In pursuing his social agenda at RAND, Mr. Rowen signed a contract with New York City to analyze police, fire, housing and welfare services and how to improve them. And in 1970, he established a graduate school for the study of public policy at RAND headquarters in Santa Monica. \u201cThere are a lot of problems around, and a shortage of people who are good at defining and analyzing them and suggesting how they can be solved,\u201d he told The Times.Now known as the Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School (named after a former RAND researcher and philanthropist), it is the largest program in the United States offering doctorates in the field, and the only one based at an independent policy research institution.After leaving RAND, Mr. Rowen became a professor of public policy and management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He taught there off and on until his retirement in 1995.The government in Washington frequently recruited him as an adviser. In the early 1980s, he was the chairman of the National Intelligence Council at the Central Intelligence Agency, a group created by William J. Casey, the agency\u2019s director, to supply better intelligence estimates.He later served on the Presidential Commission on the Intelligence of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, a panel formed to investigate the quality of American intelligence leading to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and on the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, outside experts who help the Pentagon formulate policy.In addition to his son Chris, Mr. Rowen, who lived in Palo Alto, Calif., is survived by his wife, the former Beverly Griffiths; his daughters, Hilary, Sheila and Diana Rowen; two other sons, Michael and Nicholas; and nine grandchildren.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it feels like nothing is working in Thailand anymore.\u201dThailand was once the torchbearer of freedom and prosperity in Southeast Asia \u2014 a center of commerce for Indochina, a bastion of free expression and a home for refugees from neighboring countries, which for years Thais saw as war-ravaged basket cases.But these days when Thais look to their neighbors, they feel envy, not pity.To the west, there are signs of a blossoming democracy in Myanmar after the victory of the Nobel Peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi over the military establishment that oppressed her for years. To the east the economies of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam are showing signs of vigor and luring foreign investors away from Thailand.\u201cWe are moving backward, and they are running ahead of us,\u201d said Samorn Thurapan, a 51-year-old noodle seller who roams the streets of Bangkok on a motor scooter attached to a food cart.A popular Thai radio host recently told his listeners that the only way to feel better about the country was to leave it. Take a vacation abroad, said Vera Theerapat, the host.Mr. Vera said he sought \u201csage advice\u201d about the country\u2019s straits from the smartest people he knew. \u201cThey all shake their heads,\u201d he said.\u201cI am not sure if I can take it any more,\u201d he said on his program, adding that he was considering emigrating.The deputy prime minister, a marketing specialist appointed by the junta in August as part of an effort to revive the economy, acknowledges the country\u2019s sour mood.\u201cPeople feel dismal,\u201d the minister, Somkid Jatusripitak, said at a conference this month. He compared the country to \u201ca sick person standing in a cold wind.\u201dThailand\u2019s malaise set in after nearly a decade of political turmoil. In late 2013, a protest movement led by the country\u2019s elites took to the streets to demand the suspension of electoral democracy. The military obliged, taking power from an elected government in May 2014.Immediately after the coup, Thais of various political persuasions said they felt a sense of relief that months of protests and street violence were over.But military rule now seems indefinite and the army seems mostly preoccupied by its critics, detaining professors, politicians, journalists and students and subjecting them to what the junta calls \u201cattitude adjustment,\u201d which often entails signing an agreement that allows the military to seize assets if the detainee criticizes the junta.The leader of the junta, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, stunned many Thais when he said in a nationally televised address in October that he might be forced to \u201cclose the country.\u201d He retracted the comment after an outcry by Thais and puzzlement by foreign businesses.Around the same time, the Thai news media reported that the government had approved plans to route all Internet traffic in and out of the country through a \u201csingle gateway,\u201d effectively giving the military government control over the flow. After another outcry, the junta played down the plan, but it has not rescinded it.On social media, Thais lament that the country feels directionless. But privately they also report being fearful. At least three people arrested on the criminal charge of insulting the monarchy have died in custody since the junta came to power. The government has given only oblique accounts of these deaths, saying the men died from suicide or illness. In each case, the body was cremated before an inquest could take place.Thais are also increasingly fearful of crime. Military rule has somewhat paradoxically coincided with a surge in thefts, burglaries and robberies. The national police recorded more than 75,557 thefts and other property crimes in the fiscal year that ended in September, 10.5 percent higher than the previous fiscal year.Violent crime was up 8.6 percent during the same period.Samorn Thurapan, the noodle seller, says the bad economy has made people more hot-tempered. \u201cPeople are quick to start fights,\u201d he said. \u201cBuddhist teachings are not restraining them anymore. The bad economy has turned everything upside down.\u201dThe economy more than perhaps anything else is a daily preoccupation, especially among the traders and unregistered workers, a group that economists call the \u201cinformal\u201d sector and that makes up two-thirds of the work force. At the fruit and vegetable market, vendors say their customers are not in the mood to spend anymore.\u201cThis is the topic we discuss every morning \u2014 how things are so bad,\u201d said Rasami Sidamat, 49, who sells green papaya salad and grilled chicken. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, terrible, terrible.\u201dLoan sharks charging interest rates of 20 percent a month walk through the market each morning to collect debts.Yet even the loan sharks are complaining. One, who gave his name as K. Singh, said the poor economy meant people borrow and cannot pay back.\u201cThey close their shops and say bye-bye,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are never able to find them.\u201dIn a wholesale clothing district of Bangkok, many shops are for sale or going out of business, says Thongyoy Phaesuwan, 29, the owner of a clothing business. Her buyers have become cautious and frugal.\u201cIt\u2019s as if people are swarming to eat the tiny bits of meat left on a fish bone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt used to be a big fish, but today there are only scraps left.\u201dThe military has been focused on bringing order to a famously disordered society. But Ms. Thongyoy faults the junta for its management of the economy.\u201cI am not dreaming about an ideal government,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to survive.\u201dThe Memo From Thailand article on Nov. 30, about a widespread feeling of malaise in the country, using information from the Thai national police department, misstated the percentage increase in crime in Thailand during the fiscal year that ended in September. The increase in property crime from the previous fiscal year was 10.5 percent, not 63 percent, and the increase in violent crime was 8.6 percent, not 17 percent. (The police say they changed their methodology for reporting such crimes between 2014 and 2015; the new figures take account of that change.)Advertisement"}

Ms. Villalpando said Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters had intimidated voters, and she cited their actions as among the main reasons she planned to vote for Mr. Macri.Mr. Macri, 56, has vowed to roll back such policies, pointing to galloping inflation and intensifying political divisiveness, while running a largely nonconfrontational campaign seeking to soften his patrician image as the scion of a wealthy Argentine family.His opponent, Mr. Scioli, 58, a former speedboat racer and the departing governor of Buenos Aires Province, has increasingly gone on the offensive, calling Mr. Macri \u201ca snob from Barrio Parque,\u201d one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Buenos Aires.Stunning a political establishment that had grown accustomed in recent years to blistering attacks on critics by Mrs. Kirchner and her supporters, Mr. Macri has largely avoided such tactics during his campaign. In an interview with journalists here in Jujuy Province on Thursday, he spoke in a low monotone.Dressed in a blue shirt without a tie, Mr. Macri greeted other questions with the barest of smiles while sitting in a hotel lobby. At the end of a long campaign, he seemed neither exhausted nor dazed, resembling instead someone who might have emerged from a session of meditation.Hewing to his plan to restore investor confidence in the economy, Mr. Macri calmly criticized what he views as the unreliability of official statistics in Argentina. He avoided mentioning Mrs. Kirchner or Mr. Scioli by name. Touching for a moment on a politically delicate subject, he said he planned to review a deal with China to build a nuclear reactor in Argentina.\u201cThe geography of Argentine politics has changed,\u201d said Julio Burdman, an Argentine politics professor.Still, others questioned the reliability of the polls when so many failed to predict Mr. Macri\u2019s strong showing in the first round. The race remained volatile even after the candidates formally wrapped up their campaigning on Thursday, with Mr. Scioli contending that he had the support of Pope Francis, who is from Argentina and ranks among the country\u2019s most popular figures. Francis has urged his countrymen \u201cto vote according to their conscience.\u201dJaime Dur\u00e1n Barba, an Ecuadorean campaign strategist for Mr. Macri, disputed Francis\u2019 importance, speaking in favor of decriminalizing abortion and telling reporters on the sidelines of Mr. Macri\u2019s coca-chewing ritual that \u201ca pope doesn\u2019t influence more than 10 votes in a country.\u201dSimon Romero reported from Humahuaca, and Jonathan Gilbert from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Economy Feels the Sting of China\u2019s Slowdown", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 In its small way, Tsutomu Nyuwa\u2019s metalworking shop in Yasugi, Japan, has been feeding the economic boom 700 miles away in China.Many of the precisely machine-tooled gears, bearings and other components turned out by Mr. Nyuwa and his 14 employees end up on Chinese work sites, in the engines of the giant earthmovers that have powered China\u2019s breakneck pace of construction.But with Chinese growth now slowing, Mr. Nyuwa\u2019s business is slumping \u2014 along with the rest of the Japanese economy, which data released on Monday showed is in recession again.Japanese equipment makers like Komatsu, Kubota and Hitachi Construction Machinery are selling fewer excavators and bulldozers in China and, in turn, are buying fewer parts from manufacturers like Mr. Nyuwa. Orders from the construction sector are off 40 percent this year, he estimates.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely come back down to earth, and we feel it,\u201d Mr. Nyuwa said of the Chinese market.With the economy on the edge, even small setbacks can have major repercussions. In the latest quarter, companies wary about the outlook cut back on their investments in factories and equipment, tipping the economy into its fifth recession in seven years. Exports to China dropped sharply, worsening the falloff in activity and contributing to the general unease.China\u2019s slowdown has reverberated around the world.Demand has declined for oil, iron ore and other products from commodity-exporting countries like Australia, Brazil and Ecuador. Developing economies that have grown dependent on Chinese investment in resource projects have been left vulnerable.Others, like Japan and Germany, have provided many of the machines used to build China\u2019s skyscrapers and equip its thousands of factories. For them, it is manufacturing industries that stand to lose.Japan supplies \u201call the things used in China\u2019s infrastructure expansion,\u201d said Paul Sheard, the chief global economist at Standard & Poor\u2019s, the credit ratings agency. Because of that, Japan now risks being hurt as that expansion slows.China\u2019s economy is hardly in ruins. It grew at an annualized rate of 6.9 percent in the third quarter, according to the official government estimate. While that was enviable by the standards of more advanced countries, it was the lowest rate since 2009, in the depths of the global financial crisis. And sectors that have been especially eager buyers of Japanese capital goods, like manufacturing, construction and mining, are in worse shape than the economy as a whole.China overtook the United States as Japan\u2019s top trading partner a decade ago. Roaring exports of things like mining trucks, textile looms and semiconductor fabricators have been a bright spot for Japanese industry, which has lost ground in more visible areas like consumer electronics. Diplomatic disputes that have divided Tokyo and Beijing have failed to halt a deepening interdependence in commerce.China\u2019s commercial relationship with Japan has been shifting, however. Rising labor costs in China have prompted many Japanese companies with factories there to spread their bets, turning to countries in Southeast Asia like Thailand and Indonesia.In their place, Japanese retailers have poured into China to target newly wealthy consumers there. Convenience stores and clothing chains like Uniqlo have been expanding rapidly.Tomokatsu Shiina, an architectural designer in Tokyo who regularly works in China, recently returned from Shanghai, where he was overseeing design for a Japanese discount shoe retailer\u2019s first store in the city. \u201cThese are budget consumer items,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the activity is now.\u201dIt is also in Japanese shopping districts like Ginza in Tokyo, where a standard amenity on package tours from China is an extra, empty suitcase, for filling with brand-name clothing, handbags and electronics. A tourism explosion brought 3.8 million mainland Chinese to Japan in the first nine months of this year, more than twice as many as visited in the same period last year. Their shopping habits have inspired a new Japanese word, \u201cbakugai,\u201d or \u201cexplosive buying.\u201dDong Changyuan is one of several new Chinese employees hired by Laox, an electronics chain, at its Ginza store in September. Laox has 20 to 30 Chinese clerks helping visitors find the right air purifier, heated toilet seat or high-end rice cooker. \u201cThere are people who buy four at a time\u201d for friends and relatives back home, Mr. Dong said. The weak yen was still a draw, he added, regardless of lower growth in China.At a small shoe store in the same neighborhood, about 15 Chinese shoppers were examining the offerings on a recent afternoon. Kazuhiro Kawashima, the manager, said the number of Chinese customers was holding up, but they were buying less than they did a few months ago. \u201cThey used to buy everything and anything, completely bakugai, but now they\u2019re more selective,\u201d he said. Average spending per customer was down about 5,000 yen, or $40, he estimated.Retailing and tourism are not yet big enough to fill the hole left by heavy industry. Overall Japanese exports to China fell 3.5 percent in September, according to Japanese government trade figures, the second straight month of decline. Some sectors, like steel, car parts and industrial machinery, are falling more steeply. Several major Japanese companies, including Canon, the camera and office equipment maker, cited the slowdown as they issued profit warnings over the last few weeks. Steel makers like Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal and JFE Holdings, as well as suppliers of semiconductor-making machinery, also cut their forecasts in response to falling Chinese demand.\u201cRecovery is going to take time,\u201d Canon\u2019s chief financial officer, Toshizo Tanaka, told reporters. His counterpart at Komatsu, Mikio Fujitsuka, said the company had \u201cno sense yet of hitting bottom\u201d in China.The headwinds from China are making it harder for the Japanese government to create forward momentum in the economy.Mr. Abe\u2019s three-year-old program, known as Abenomics and centered on aggressive stimulus by the central bank, has curbed persistent consumer price declines and benefited exporters by weakening the yen. Unemployment is just 3.4 percent, the lowest it has been in two decades. Yet the project remains \u201chalf-finished,\u201d said Mr. Sheard of S.&P., with deflation not yet safely beaten and many households and businesses still fearful about the future.To give the economy another push, Mr. Abe\u2019s government is putting together a stimulus package worth \u00a53.5 trillion, or roughly $29 billion, according to Japanese media reports. But sustained stimulus is politically tricky. Mr. Abe says he is committed to increasing the national sales tax in April 2017, after delaying a planned 2 percent increase by 18 months to take pressure off growth. The finance ministry wants more tax revenue to offset Japan\u2019s national debt, the largest in the world relative to the size of the economy.At his metalworking shop, Mr. Nyuwa said he did not believe government policy would do much to change the direction of the economy. Abenomics, he said, may have helped big companies at the top of the food chain, and the investors that own their shares, but it has not done much to benefit small businesses like his.\u201cIt\u2019s never really connected,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s just that time in the cycle where you have to dig in and bear it.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting from Yasugi, Japan, and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ArcelorMittal Loses $700 Million in 3rd Quarter", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steel maker, on Friday reported a $700 million loss for the third quarter, blaming falling prices and competition from Chinese exports.Lakshmi N. Mittal, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview on Friday that steel demand in the company\u2019s main markets, Europe and North America, was healthy, but that low-cost Chinese steel was depressing prices.\u201cThe Chinese are dumping in our core markets,\u201d Mr. Mittal said. \u201cThe question is how long the Chinese will continue to export below their cost.\u201dThe company\u2019s loss for the period compared with a $22 million profit for last year\u2019s third quarter.ArcelorMittal, which is based in Luxembourg, also sharply cut its projection for 2015 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 the main measure of a steel company\u2019s finances. The new estimate is $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, down from the previous projection of $6 billion to $7 billion.On a call with reporters, Aditya Mittal, Mr. Mittal\u2019s son and the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said that a flood of low-price Chinese exports was the biggest challenge for ArcelorMittal in the European and North American markets.The company estimates that Chinese steel exports this year will reach 110 million metric tons, compared with 94 million tons last year and 63 million tons in 2013. ArcelorMittal produced 93 million metric tons of steel in 2014.ArcelorMittal is one of several companies operating in the United States that have brought complaints against the dumping of Chinese steel. On Tuesday, the United States Commerce Department issued a preliminary ruling in those companies\u2019 favor in one product category, saying it would impose tariffs of up to 236 percent on imports of corrosion-resistant steel from some Chinese companies, on the grounds that their products are subsidized by the government.\u201cThat clearly shows there is substance in the trade cases,\u201d Lakshmi Mittal said.The slowing Chinese economy and resulting drop in demand has caused prices of almost all commodities to fall. Steel is no exception. ArcelorMittal said its average selling prices were down nearly 20 percent in North America and Europe in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, and were continuing to fall.The price decline was a major reason the company\u2019s sales in the quarter fell to $15.6 billion, compared with $20.1 billion in the period last year.ArcelorMittal has invested heavily in mining in recent years, as a hedge against its weakening steel business. But falling prices for iron ore and coal have undermined that strategy. The company said it had recorded a $2 million operating loss in mining in the quarter.To conserve cash, the company said it would not pay a dividend for 2015. It paid 20 cents a share last year. The stock was up more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in Europe on Friday.Advertisement"}

On Friday, the stock was at $34.09. On Monday the company released its third-quarter results, showing that commissions from Sotheby\u2019s auction sales during the period were $56 million, a decrease of 12 percent from the same period in 2014, according to documents used by the auction house.At the close of trading on Wednesday the stock stood at $28.71, having lost almost 16 percent of its value since Friday.The auction house\u2019s struggles seem attributable to several factors, including Christie\u2019s continuing domination at the top end of the art market. Last year, the company posted about $7.7 billion of sales, $1 billion more than Sotheby\u2019s. Recently, concerns have been raised that the $515 million that Sotheby\u2019s guaranteed to the family of A. Alfred Taubman, its former chairman, to secure his collection might have been excessive.\u201cSotheby\u2019s stock price reflects the general slowdown in the global economy,\u201d said Steve Blitz, the director and chief economist at ITG Investment Research Inc. \u201cThe stock has been hurt by their earnings from their main auction business, which are weak.\u201dMr. Blitz and other analysts are also concerned about the rapid expansion of Sotheby\u2019s art finance business, which provides loans to clients secured by the value of their art collections.Several financial analysts pointed out that Christie\u2019s, a privately held company owned by the French luxury goods magnate Francois Pinault, has the freedom to pursue market share without being accountable to shareholders.Tuesday night, for example, at Christie\u2019s $331.8 million comparable auction of contemporary material, sellers of 10 of the 53 lots were guaranteed minimum prices, with financing from the auction house itself.Art auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.Shareholder-owned Sotheby\u2019s has been more cautious.Just five out of Wednesday night\u2019s 54 lots were guaranteed, with the risk shared by third parties, including the \u201cMao\u201d owned by the billionaire hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen. He had acquired the painting in 2007 from Mr. Pinault in a private transaction, for $17 million, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.One night earlier at Christie\u2019s, Mr. Cohen made a profit of about $12 million on his $29.2 million sale of a Lucio Fontana painting. His guarantee on the \u201cMao\u201d was about $45 million, including fees; it sold for $47.5 million. Mr. Cohen therefore made about $41 million from the sale of these two lots \u2014 which helps explain why so many hedge-fund managers have become art collectors.The evening\u2019s other highlights included a Cy Twombly \u201cblackboard\u201d painting from 1968, a gray abstract with white chalky loops, which sold Wednesday for $70.5 million \u2014 a new high for the artist at auction \u2014 against an estimate of over $60 million.And Jackson Pollock\u2019s drawing \u201cNumber 17, 1949,\u201d which sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 2003 to a telephone bidder for $5.3 million, went for $22.9 million with fees, over its low estimate of $20 million.But some said the repetition of artists in this week\u2019s sales was dispiriting. \u201cIt\u2019s the same stuff \u2014 Bourgeois, Warhol,\u201d Thierry Geoffroy, the founder of the Copenhagen Biennale, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more expensive than posters in a pizza bar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Look For in Republican Debate", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are some things to watch for in the debate, which begins at 9 p.m.:It will be the fourth Republican debate, but the first with fewer than 10 candidates onstage. By relegating Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, to the so-called undercard, held at 7 p.m., Fox Business may have imposed at least an incremental measure of order. The first three debates could be chaotic and drew cries of anger from candidates who felt they received too little speaking time. But eight is still more than enough to constitute a crowd.A similar issue confronts Senator Marco Rubio, who has been facing renewed scrutiny over his use of a Florida Republican Party credit card during his time as a state lawmaker. Mr. Rubio sought over the weekend to settle those questions by releasing a series of previously undisclosed credit card records. But Mr. Trump, again, could bring up the subject even if the Fox Business moderators do not deem Mr. Rubio\u2019s personal finances relevant to a debate about economics. Mr. Rubio has yet to be aggressively confronted in the debates, aside from Jeb Bush\u2019s lackluster attempt to do so on Oct. 28. Mr. Rubio\u2019s reaction to any attacks on Tuesday could be revealing about how he would hold up if he survives deeper into the primary contest, when the field narrows, the debate stage gets lonelier, and scrutiny from the news media and rival campaigns becomes more exacting.A pattern has emerged in the debates so far: When the discussion turns to the intricacies of policy matters, Mr. Trump ceases to be much of a presence. Given his real estate career, he could speak broadly about economic issues. But if Tuesday\u2019s debate takes a turn toward details, will Mr. Trump fade into the background again? And how will the crowd respond if he attacks Mr. Carson or Mr. Rubio? Mr. Trump could find it hard to follow through if his criticisms are met with boos.Given how poorly he fared at the CNBC debate, Mr. Bush knows he needs to step up in Milwaukee and stop a cascading, self-reinforcing negative story line about his candidacy. He will try a new approach: \u201cIt\u2019s not a debate. It\u2019s a chance to be able to say what you think. I\u2019ll take advantage of that,\u201d he said last week in New Hampshire. But it is not clear that disregarding questions and offering talking points instead of direct answers will be enough to lift his prospects. Mr. Bush may need to show a measure of authority and forcefulness that has often been lacking in his campaign \u2014 not only in showing that he would be a better choice than his Republican rivals but also in delivering the kind of blistering indictment of the Democrats that could at last give primary voters a reason to give him a new look.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas does not like attacking Republicans who are held in high esteem by grass-roots conservatives. He prefers safer targets, like the news media and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. But with the Iowa caucuses in less than three months, he may not be able to avoid jabbing at candidates like Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump. Those two political outsiders are besting him in Iowa at the moment, and Mr. Cruz would like to cut into Mr. Carson\u2019s support among evangelical Christians and Mr. Trump\u2019s among blue-collar Tea Party conservatives. How Mr. Cruz contends with those two rivals may signal whether he remains convinced that they will self-destruct or is coming to the conclusion that he must be a party to their collapse.Advertisement"}

Written by John McNamara and directed by Jay Roach, it opens in 1947 in Los Angeles, where, in between shouts of \u201cAction!\u201d and \u201cCut!\u201d and the usual wheeling and dealing, Hollywood is coming under siege. That was the year that the House Un-American Activities Committee held hearings in both Los Angeles and Washington to look into Communist doings.

Oddly, the eldest, Niki (Madison Wolfe plays her until Elle Fanning steps in), ends up having more narrative and emotional weight than Cleo. Niki\u2019s prominence smacks of a screenwriting contrivance, mostly as a way to paint Trumbo as someone who remained a loving family man despite his ordeals, but too often when he explains stuff to his daughter (Dad, are you a Communist?) the filmmakers are obviously explaining stuff to the audience.\u201cTrumbo\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual references.

{"Headline": "Predatory Islamic State Wrings Money From Those It Rules", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fighters who man the border post treat the payment as an import duty, not a bribe. They even provide a stamped receipt, with the logo and seal of the Islamic State, that Mr. Kirayfawai, 38, needs for passing through other checkpoints on his delivery route.Refuse to pay and the facade of normality quickly falls away. \u201cIf I do not,\u201d Mr. Kirayfawai explained, \u201cthey either arrest me or burn my truck.\u201dThe ease of creating roads through the desert could limit the effectiveness of the offensive to cut off a key ISIS supply route.The earnings from these practices that mimic a traditional state total tens of millions of dollars a month, approaching $1 billion a year, according to some estimates by American and European officials. And that is a revenue stream that has so far proved largely impervious to sanctions and air raids.\u201cThey fight in the morning and they tax in the afternoon,\u201d said Louise Shelley, the director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University.Ultimately, though, many officials and experts said the Islamic State would probably be able to cover its costs even without oil revenue, and that so long as it controls large stretches of Iraq and Syria, including major cities, bankrupting the group would take a lot more than blowing up oil tankers.\u201cThese are all going to be little pinpricks into Islamic State financing unless you can take their revenue bases away from them, and that means the territory they control,\u201d said Seth Jones, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation.Inside that territory, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has taken over the legitimate revenue collection operations of the governments it has usurped. And it has used the ever-present threat of violence to extract as much as it can from the people, businesses and property it now controls.In the Bab al-Tob neighborhood of Mosul, Iraq, for instance, the militants turned a police station that dated to the 19th-century Ottoman era into a market, with 60 shops selling fruits and vegetables. The annual rent for a market stall is 2.8 million Iraqi dinars, or roughly $2,500.In Raqqa, the Syrian city that is now the de facto capital of the Islamic State, a department called Diwan al-Khadamat, or the Office of Services, sends officials through the city markets to collect a cleaning tax \u2014 2,500 to 5,000 Syrian pounds, or about $7 to $14, per month depending on the size of the shop. Residents go to collection points to pay their monthly electricity and water bills, 800 Syrian pounds, or roughly $2.50 for electricity and 400 pounds, about $1.20, for water.Another Islamic State department, the Diwan al-Rikaz, or the Office of Resources, oversees oil production and smuggling, the looting of antiquities and a long list of other businesses now controlled by the militants. It operates water-bottling and soft-drink plants, textile and furniture workshops, and mobile phone companies, as well as tile, cement and chemical factories, skimming revenues from all of them.Officials of the so-called caliphate dislike the term \u201ctax,\u201d preferring the Islamic term \u201czakat,\u201d which refers to the alms Muslims are required to pay. Although the norm would be 2.5 percent of a person\u2019s wealth under typical interpretations of Islamic law, the militants are taking 10 percent, justifying the high rate by saying they are a \u201cnation in a time of war,\u201d according to a citizen journalist in Raqqa who asked for his safety to be identified only as Abu Mouaz.The Islamic State emerged from a group of militants in Iraq to take over large portions of Iraq and Syria, and now threatens other countries in Europe and elsewhere.The group has taken over the collection of car-registration fees, and made students pay for textbooks. It has even fined people for driving with broken taillights, a practice that is nearly unheard-of on the unruly roads of the Middle East.Fines are also included in the punishments meted out for breaking the strict living rules imposed by the Islamic State. Smoking is strictly forbidden, for example, and Mohammad Hamid, 29, said that when he was caught smoking a cigar in his shop in Mosul in late August, \u201cISIS not only whipped me 15 times in public but forced me to pay a fine of 50,000 dinar,\u201d or about $40 at the time. He soon after fled to a Kurdish area of Iraq.In all, some officials estimate that the Islamic State is extracting as much as $800 or $900 million, possibly more, from residents or businessmen inside the territory it controls.That is on top of revenues from oil smuggling, which are estimated to bring an additional $500 million. The group also earns tens of millions of dollars more from other revenue sources, such as kidnapping. And it looted roughly $1 billion from banks in the towns and cities it took over \u2014 including $675 million in Mosul alone \u2014 though that was a one-time source of revenue.\u201cThere is nothing that would let me suspect that we have a complete sense of the central bookkeeping operations,\u201d said a European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence.A bustling city has been transformed under the group\u2019s brutal rule.After oil and taxes, \u201ceverything else is a rounding error,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, who was the top counterterrorism official at the State Department and is now a scholar at Dartmouth College.Mr. Benjamin said that given the group\u2019s scope and ambition it could not be \u201cjudged by the standards of other terrorist groups.\u201d Only the \u201cpseudo-state\u201d of Colombia\u2019s FARC, which once controlled territory the size of Switzerland, came close. But he said the Islamic State\u2019s economic model would be hard to maintain in the long run.In the short term, American and European officials are struggling to cut the group\u2019s revenues. But the old strategy for stopping the flow of money to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, which was largely based on cutting them off from donors in the Persian Gulf upon which they depend, does not apply to the Islamic State.\u201cThey derive so much of their resources internally, that more traditional counterterror finance tools we would apply, say in the case of Al Qaeda, to cut off a terror organization from its income sources are not applicable in this case,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, the assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. \u201cThey don\u2019t rely on donors.\u201dInstead, the United States and its allies have concentrated their efforts on trying \u201cto stop them from getting access to the financial system,\u201d he said.More than a dozen countries have had attacks since the Islamic State, or ISIS, began to pursue a global strategy in the summer of 2014.The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on nearly three dozen people linked to the Islamic State\u2019s finances, and last week expanded those to include a Syrian construction executive who it charged is helping Mr. Assad buy oil from the Islamic State, and Kirsan N. Ilyumzhinov, the Russian businessman who heads the World Chess Federation and was accused of \u201cmaterially assisting\u201d top Syrian officials and bankers.Officials assume that the Islamic State must be circulating the money it collects back out into the regional and global financial system since there have not been signs of the kind of rampant inflation that could result from a large influx of currency into a relatively small economy closed off from the surrounding markets.Money-changing and transfer businesses in southern Turkey are another particular concern because they are believed to be helping the militants launder money, the European official said.In a reflection of the growing frustration with Turkey, the State Department pointedly mentioned the use of the city of Gaziantep as a transit point for fighters heading to the Islamic State when it recently announced a $5 million reward for a senior militant figure.The militant, Tirad al-Jarba, better known by his nom de guerre Abu-Muhammad al-Shimali, is the Islamic State\u2019s border chief, and runs one of the group\u2019s logistics committees that coordinates \u201csmuggling activities, financial transfers, and the movement of supplies into Syria and Iraq,\u201d according to the State Department.But in the long run, according to American officials, the surest way to significantly restrict the group\u2019s finances will be to retake territory it controls, something that has been painstakingly slow so far, despite thousands of airstrikes.\u201cThe only one sure way to take away their wealth, their revenue base,\u201d one senior administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, \u201cis going to be through military force.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg and Steven Lee Myers reported from Washington, and Nicholas Kulish from New York. Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon, Falih Hassan and Omar al-Jawoshy from Baghdad, employees of The New York Times from Erbil and Anbar Provinces, Iraq, Mohammad Ghannam and Nabih Bulos from Paris, and Tim Arango from Essex Junction, Vt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Struggles to Maintain Momentum in Upstate Employment", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut even as Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has trumpeted new job opportunities and new jobs secured, several major employers have recently announced plans to lay off hundreds of workers, causing state officials to scramble to retain those jobs and maintain the governor\u2019s economic momentum.An even more devastating blow was narrowly averted on Wednesday, when Mr. Cuomo and Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, announced a deal with Kraft Heinz, committing up to $25 million in state funds for upgrading several of the company\u2019s upstate plants, which make products such as mozzarella and Cool Whip, in exchange for the company\u2019s maintaining nearly 1,000 jobs for five years.Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Schumer were working to try to avert the Entergy shutdown; on Friday, similar efforts were being made by both men to convince Alcoa to stay in Massena.\u201cIn upstate New York, the story is kind of one step forward, one step back,\u201d said Don Dutkowsky, an economics professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.Economists also point to successes in certain regions \u2014 Buffalo, for example, and the capital region around Albany \u2014 where jobs are growing at a healthy pace.\u201cYou can see a kind of split going on, some places that are doing quite poorly and some doing quite well,\u201d said Richard Dietz, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Buffalo, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two cities.\u201dOr in some cases, many more than that. Part of the problem in declaring victory in upstate New York is that its very definition is misleading.\u201cThe Southern Tier is struggling,\u201d he said last week, after a jobs announcement outside Syracuse. \u201cWe have to create more jobs in the Southern Tier.\u201dMr. Dietz, from the Federal Reserve, said individual factory closings were not necessarily a sign of larger economic problems in the state, characterizing them as part of a painful, long-term reconstruction of the upstate economy amid the loss of once-dependable manufacturing jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that this is still happening,\u201d he said.He added that some upstate cities had successfully mitigated the damage from decades of economic malaise, as well as from the Great Recession, by turning to educational and medical facilities, which \u201ctended to grow during both ups and downs, and be less dependent on cyclical things.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s strategy has centered on pouring ample state and political capital into growing high-tech sectors more commonly associated with places like Silicon Valley in California. But technology has ups and downs, too: At the end of October, GlobalFoundaries, a semiconductor company based in California, announced layoffs at a multibillion-dollar plant in Malta, north of Albany, and in East Fishkill, near Poughkeepsie.Mr. McMahon, a frequent critic of Mr. Cuomo, said that such use of public money was part of a \u201cbig-push strategy\u201d around tech projects, whereby \u201cyou take a boatload of government money and you pour it into a favored industry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a tinder under a fire,\u201d he added. \u201cExcept in this case, it\u2019s a can of gasoline.\u201dBut Mr. McMahon also questioned such a plan when many upstate cities are begging for more spending on infrastructure. \u201cYou have cities where the water mains are literally rusting cast iron,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s funding tech plants.\u201dThe governor says that putting public money toward private technology companies is building a critical mass and creating a cluster economy.\u201cIf you are in this nano-high-tech cluster, this clean energy cluster,\u201d he said in his remarks last week, \u201cyou want to be in upstate New York.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Cash Floods U.S. Real Estate Market", "Date": "2015-11-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe China Factor | Part 3Canyon Lake Ranch was once a playground for Christian day campers, and then was a corporate retreat with water-skiing, barbecues and cowboy shoot-\u2019em-up shows. Hawks now circle above 108 sunbaked acres occupied by copperhead snakes, a few coyotes and the occasional construction truck.Soon this ranch will be a gated subdivision of 99 mini-mansions designed for buyers from mainland China. The developer, Zhang Long, a Beijing businessman, is keeping three plots to build his own estate along the site of an old rodeo arena.This luxury development 35 miles northwest of Dallas is the latest frontier in a global buying phenomenon as Chinese money becomes a major force in real estate around the world. The flood of money is likely to persist despite the current tumult in China. While a currency devaluation and stock market crash have crimped the country\u2019s buying power overseas, the resulting uncertainty is making many Chinese individuals and companies eager to invest anywhere except their home country.In London, Chinese investors are purchasing high-end apartments in wealthy neighborhoods and big skyscrapers in the financial district. In Canada, they are paying $1 million for modest Vancouver bungalows. In Australia, a Chinese sovereign wealth fund bought nine office towers, one of the biggest real estate transactions in that nation\u2019s history.In the United States, the home-buying spree began on the coasts, where Chinese buyers snapped up luxury condos in Manhattan and McMansions in Silicon Valley, pushing up home values in big cities. It is now spreading to the middle of the country, where prices are more modest and have room to run.The homes here in Corinth will feature two master suites, one for the buyers, the other for aging parents. A concierge service will help new arrivals from overseas order Internet service and pay electric bills. Chauffeurs will ferry homeowners until they learn to navigate the loops and spurs of Texas freeways.\u201cWhen Chairman Zhang saw the strength of the Texan economy, he decided it was time that the Asian community should be presented an opportunity to invest in the American Dream,\u201d marketing materials for the development read.The great property rush is part of the tidal wave of Chinese money that is pouring into the global economy and reshaping financial markets. In residential and commercial real estate, the new flow of cash is upending the traditional dynamics of buying and selling.This year, Chinese families represented for the first time the largest group of overseas home buyers in the United States. Big spenders on new homes are helping prop up local economies in the Midwest. But in dense areas like San Francisco and Manhattan, they are also affecting the affordability and availability of housing, as demand outpaces supply and bidding wars ensue.While Chinese purchases make up a small sliver of overall sales in the United States, they have had a disproportionate impact on the market for more expensive properties, buying one in 14 homes sold for more than $1 million. On average, buyers from China, including the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, pay $831,800 for a home, more than three times as much as Americans spend, according to a National Association of Realtors survey.Chinese money is reshaping real estate markets, as companies and individuals snap up commercial and residential properties.Some Chinese are buying homes purely as investments, capitalizing on surging rents in many parts of the United States. Others are trying to move their money beyond the reach of the Chinese government.Many buyers have their children\u2019s education in mind, picking up homes in good school districts or close to universities. At the upper echelon, the wealthy are hoping for green cards, joining with developers to take advantage of a federal program that fast-tracks them for residency.Eric Du, a management and investment consultant from Beijing, was motivated by the potential for his family and his fortune. Over the last two years, he bought a townhouse \u2014 sight unseen \u2014 and two single-family homes in Northbrook, Ill., north of Chicago. He paid cash for all of them.He plans to live in one, to give his children a chance to breathe cleaner air and learn at a better school than he could find in his hometown. He will rent out the other two.\u201cThe price of property in Beijing is very high, the stock market is crashing, and the real economy is not stable,\u201d Mr. Du said of the environment in China. \u201cThe people here have some money, but they don\u2019t have enough good ways to invest their money.\u201dIn Shanghai, not far from the banks of the Huangpu River, the offices of Windham Realty are tucked inside a glassy tower where the walls feature a poster of a development in Michigan: the Stonewater community on 366 acres in Northville, a suburb of Detroit.\u201cThe most magnificent waterfront community and the most grand eco-redevelopment project in the U.S.,\u201d the poster reads, highlighting six artificial lakes and 424 luxury villas.Other posters of properties line the office space. Chic townhouses in San Diego. A golf course community in Fort Myers, Fla. Spacious homes in a Los Angeles development.\u201cThe market is definitely larger and broader than when we started,\u201d said Steven M. Lawson, the chief executive of Windham China. \u201cThey\u2019re very different than the people we were working with in 2007. If we want to cut right to it, they\u2019re less wealthy, a lot younger and a lot better educated from an international point of view.\u201dThe company is among many hoping to capture the wealth pouring out of China.Chinese buyers spent $28.6 billion on American homes in the year ended in March, more than double their purchases two years before, according to the Realtors association. Chinese purchases in overseas commercial real estate jumped 49 percent last year, Jones Lang LaSalle, a big real estate brokerage firm, has estimated.The real estate deals follow a broader exodus of money from China to countries and companies around the world. An estimated $590 billion moved out of China in the 12 months through June, according to Fitch Ratings. And the amount of outflows most likely set a record in the third quarter, although detailed data will not be available until next month. In the past, they tended to stay under $200 billion a year.The swell of funds from China represents the confluence of several big trends.Over the last six years, the Chinese government has kept the country awash with cash to stimulate the economy, which means a lot of extra money available to slosh abroad. The Chinese government has also made it easier for individuals to move large sums out of the country, as part of a broader liberalization of the nation\u2019s heavily regulated financial system.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.The government is loosening the rules for corporations, too. Beijing now allows insurance companies to invest as much as 15 percent of their assets overseas, helping drive a surge in commercial purchases.But the highflying deals may have only just begun. By the end of last year, Chinese insurers had only 1.44 percent of their money overseas.\u201cThe Chinese are deliberate; there will clearly be large capital flows coming to the West,\u201d said Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, the largest private landlord in the United States. \u201cThat will increase in frequency until the Chinese government decides it shouldn\u2019t happen anymore \u2014 they\u2019ve opened the spigot.\u201dCompanies are racing to develop services for Chinese customers. This year Zillow, the real estate search website, began publishing its database of American homes on a Chinese real estate site, Leju.com. American real estate agents are advertising in local Chinese newspapers.On the front lines are brokers in the Dallas suburbs like Roddy de la Garza, who arrives at homes with a video camera and a compass. The camera is for sharing video of house tours with his clients who live in China; the compass is to make sure the homes have a north-south alignment, to ensure proper energy flow in accordance with Chinese principles of feng shui.\u201cI\u2019ve learned these things,\u201d said Mr. de la Garza, who works for the realty firm Redfin, \u201cso they trust me.\u201dLast summer, Scott Hogg, a Dallas real estate agent, helped a client bid on a home near the Plano-Frisco line for about $220,000.The bid from his client, who needed a mortgage, was rejected. The home went to a Chinese buyer who paid cash.\u201cWe lost out,\u201d Mr. Hogg said. \u201cIt\u2019s just this market. It\u2019s insane.\u201dFor typical American home buyers who require mortgages, the influx of Chinese money makes it even more challenging in markets facing low inventory and rising prices. A majority of home purchases by Chinese buyers \u2014 69 percent \u2014 are entirely cash, according to the Realtors association.Such bids often rise to the top for sellers who can then close on a deal in little more than a weekend. Even in Silicon Valley, a market awash in millionaires, Chinese buyers \u2014 if they pay cash \u2014 can edge out tech entrepreneurs whose wealth is tied up in stock options.\u201cThere are even bidding wars between cash buyers now,\u201d said Sam Van Horebeek, a director at East-West Property Advisors, a China-based firm that connects Chinese buyers with American real estate agents.Outside the United States, the Chinese demand has been so great that some places are trying to temper it.Hong Kong and Singapore have each imposed 15 percent taxes on nonresident buyers of residential real estate. In Australia, the state government of Victoria, which includes Melbourne, introduced a 3 percent tax on overseas buyers.Still, some places are welcoming the economic activity. City coffers benefit from stronger property tax revenue. Many overseas arrivals are relatively wealthy, spending on new cars and furniture as well as everyday shopping and dining.The interest from Chinese buyers is reshaping demographics in Texas. As the volume of Asian purchases grow, the number of Mexican buyers, historically the largest category from abroad, is leveling off.In fast-growing Plano, a northern suburb, the number of people born in mainland China swelled to nearly 6,000 in 2010, from 3,600 in 2000 \u2014 and the group has since expanded. The area is such a popular destination that this spring American Airlines began operating a direct flight to Beijing, the airline\u2019s second nonstop from Dallas to a mainland Chinese city, after Shanghai.In Corinth, a town of just 20,000, the development on the old ranch site is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in property taxes and fees. The average price of the new homes is $2 million.The City Council unanimously approved the development in Corinth, where a Chicken Express and an AutoZone abut a highway along the south side of town. Mr. Zhang\u2019s company is planning a strip of luxury stores, including high-end restaurants, a spa and a wine shop that will sell bottles from a vineyard that the developer started just across the Oklahoma border.\u201cThis will be a positive cash flow,\u201d said Rick Chaffin, Corinth\u2019s city manager. \u201cI\u2019d say it would be significant.\u201dIn the Dallas area, the current Chinese boom traces its roots to Taiwanese immigration in the 1980s.Back then, Texas Instruments was starting to make headway in the semiconductor business. The company had a strong presence first in Taiwan and later in mainland China, recruiting there for its operations.As Texas Instruments grew and the technology boom in America took off, students from China began arriving to study engineering in hopes of getting a job at the home office. The company hosted English classes for its new employees and cultural events to help them feel at home.Soon a small strip of Chinese restaurants and an Asian market sprouted in Richardson, along with a community center offering a library of Chinese books, tai chi classes and country line dancing. In 2001, Huawei, a major Chinese telecom company, opened its American headquarters in Plano.With their own economy growing quickly, the Chinese arrivals were armed with more money and wanted newer, more expensive homes than Richardson\u2019s usual stock of ranch-style homes built in the 1950s. They found them nearby in towns including Plano and Frisco, part of the supercharged suburban sprawl. Chinese families have clustered in the miles upon miles of new brick houses in subdivisions fortified by brick walls, with names like Whiffletree, Spring Ridge and Hunters Glen North.\u201cChinese people like newer areas,\u201d said Charlie Yue, who moved from Beijing to the Dallas area in the late 1990s as a student. He bought a new house in Frisco five years ago and now runs a real estate investment firm, snapping up homes that linger on the market.\u201cI\u2019ve traveled to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and I feel like I\u2019ve gone back to China. Texas is wide open, with so much space, which I really love,\u201d said Mr. Yue, who is also vice president of the Association of Chinese Professionals in Richardson. \u201cIf you consider how expensive housing is in Beijing or Shanghai, this is a bargain.\u201dSteve Robinette, an administrator at Missouri State University, often plays tour guide to newly arriving Chinese students. The university, which operates a campus in China, has about 900 Chinese students at its main campus in Springfield.Not long ago, one student\u2019s mother came to him seeking help with a major purchase. He assumed she wanted a recommendation for a car dealer, but she was looking for a real estate agent.\u201cWhen I take them around to the better areas of Springfield, if there\u2019s a For Sale sign they\u2019ll jump out and grab a flier,\u201d said Mr. Robinette, the university\u2019s associate vice president for international programs.Education plays an outsize role in Chinese families\u2019 decisions to buy American real estate.While college enrollment in China is soaring, top schools have limited space. Almost all of the expansion is taking place at poorly regarded universities and polytechnics. Students unable to win admission to prestigious universities frequently apply to American schools if their families can afford it.At the university level, the Chinese now make up 31 percent of all international students in the United States, according to the Institute of International Education. While New York, Los Angeles and Boston are popular destinations for Chinese students, more are attending universities in the Midwest, with its giant institutions like Ohio State and Michigan State.Their parents often buy homes in college towns. St. Louis real estate listings \u2014 homes that average nearly $800,000 \u2014 are attracting mainland buyers on the Chinese real estate website Juwai.com. The influx of Chinese students is most likely the reason, said Simon Henry, the company\u2019s co-chief executive.\u201cIf you look at the student populations of any major or nonmajor university,\u201d Mr. Henry said, \u201cyou\u2019ll get a really good indication of what property prices are going to do.\u201dThe push starts young. About 23,500 Chinese citizens were enrolled in American high schools in 2013, the most recent year for which figures were available.Echo Zha, from Beijing, is renting an apartment in Naperville, Ill., so her 12-year-old daughter can attend school there. She also spent about $200,000 on a small, one-bedroom apartment in Chicago, where she hopes to collect enough rental income to also buy a home in Naperville.\u201cIn the schools in Beijing, students with high-powered parents or rich parents are given special treatment by the teachers,\u201d Ms. Zha said. \u201cI want my daughter to be in a more fair environment and to grow up with more character and values.\u201dAnn Irvine, the principal of Harrington Elementary in Plano, said several Chinese families whose children attended her school had bought two homes simultaneously.One, she explained, was for attending Harrington, which has a bilingual Mandarin-English preschool, and the other to ensure spots later for their children at a high school in a different area.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking mansions,\u201d Ms. Irvine said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking nice homes with research done thoroughly and the best price point attained.\u201dFor Mr. Zhang, the old ranch in Corinth was somewhat of an impulse buy.A lawyer by training, Mr. Zhang, 42, first came to know Texas during airport layovers while traveling between the coasts for his work, which spans technology, mining, wealth management and other industries. A Chinese friend in Dallas started talking about a patch of undeveloped land in Corinth.Two years ago, Mr. Zhang paid $6.8 million in cash for Canyon Lake Ranch, his first foray into American real estate. He renamed the lake after himself; it\u2019s now officially Long Lake.\u201cI chose Dallas because the unique culture of the city was evident on my first visit and has since impressed me with every return visit,\u201d Mr. Zhang said in a statement. \u201cCompared to other U.S. metropolitan areas, Dallas presents numerous prospects for all walks of life, drawing people from across the country and globally.\u201dVivian Tsou, chief operating officer and president of Lelege USA, Mr. Zhang\u2019s development company, put it bluntly: \u201cThe bang for your buck is higher here.\u201dOverseas real estate speculation by Chinese investors started to rise after the recession in America began to recede in 2009. The two markets have been out of sync, creating opportunities. American home prices have been in a recovery phase, while the Chinese boom has been fading.Millions of Chinese are looking to park their money in countries where there is less risk of arbitrary confiscation and more political stability. Some want to obscure the true extent of their wealth, while others are trying to diversify their assets.China\u2019s history of corruption has also left people vulnerable.A recent Goldman Sachs analysis found that some types of capital outflows closely follow Chinese anti-corruption campaigns. As crackdowns intensify in China, outflows tend to increase.Investments in the United States provide another advantage: a pathway to a green card.Chinese investors have been particularly aggressive at using a federal visa program called EB-5 that allows overseas citizens to put $500,000 to $1 million into a project that will create at least 10 jobs. Investors can get a green card in about two years. So far this year, 86 percent of the EB-5 visas issued worldwide have gone to Chinese.While the homes in the development at Long Lake are also being marketed locally, mainland buyers are eligible for this program. \u201cThese high-caliber homes will bring high-caliber residents,\u201d said Ms. Tsou of Lelege.Ida Hung, a real estate agent and feng shui specialist in the Dallas office of the Virginia Cook agency, which now has the exclusive listing for the Long Lake development, peddles the homes to contacts in the area\u2019s Chinese community and beyond. On a recent afternoon, she stopped at Tam\u2019s, a Chinese buffet in Richardson.In the last decade or so, the restaurant\u2019s owner, Wing Tam, has bought seven condos and houses that ranged in price from $20,000 to $500,000 \u2014 one for his sister, one for an employee in his kitchen, one for his wife, one because it was a good price, one for investment purposes and so on. He paid cash for them all, except for his own Dallas home, which he bought in 2008 with a mortgage he has since paid off.During a busy lunch hour, he pored over the materials for the Corinth development but decided the location was a bit too remote. He offered to put Ms. Hung in touch with Chinese friends who live in Arkansas.\u201cThey are very rich. They don\u2019t know how to spend their money,\u201d said Mr. Tam, tucking one of the brochures under his arm. \u201cThey need to invest.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the history of a Chinese community center in Richardson, Tex. It was built in the 1980s; it did not pop up recently in response to a growing Chinese population.Dionne Searcey reported from Corinth, Tex., and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "A Car Dealers Won\u2019t Sell: It\u2019s Electric", "Date": "2015-11-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo why are only about 330,000 electric vehicles on the road? One answer lies in an unexpected and powerful camp of skeptics: car dealers. They are showing little enthusiasm for putting consumers into electric cars.Some buyers even tell stories of dealers talking them into gas cars and of ill-informed salespeople uncertain how far the cars can go on a charge or pushing oil changes that the cars do not need. And industry officials themselves acknowledge a hesitancy to sell cars that may not suit drivers\u2019 needs.\u201cThat was a nice way of saying 86 percent of them didn\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.California has 150,000 electric cars, but that figure needs to grow tenfold in the next decade, she said, or the state will not be able to meet its environmental goals. Without the cars, \u201csimply put, we can\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.Industry insiders and those who follow the business closely say that dealers may also be worrying about their bottom lines. They assert that electric vehicles do not offer dealers the profits that gas-powered cars do. They take more time to sell because of the explaining required, which hurts overall sales and commissions. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, undermining the biggest source of dealer profits: their service departments.The vehicles are not for everyone. They typically go only 80 miles or so before they need to be recharged. While many people charge them at home, public charging stations remain limited, particularly outside California. Air conditioning and heat drain the battery quickly, so weather can affect performance.But the cars have big selling points. Owners can ignore fluctuating gas prices. Government subsidies can lead to price breaks of $10,000 or more. The cars accelerate quickly, too.The dealers play an obviously crucial role in the popularity of electric vehicles. Almost all new cars are sold through dealerships. To a large extent, dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a big effect on how someone feels about a prospective purchase.Some electric car buyers have said they felt as if they were the ones doing the selling. For example, Chelsea Dell was in the market for an electric car in Salt Lake City last year, and discovered online that a local Chevrolet dealer had a used Volt.She made an appointment to test-drive the car. But when she arrived, she said, a salesman told her that the car had not been washed, and that he had instead readied a less expensive, gas-powered car.\u201cI was ready to pull the trigger, and they were trying to muscle me into a Chevy Sonic,\u201d said Ms. Dell, an account administrator for U.P.S. \u201cThe thing I was baffled at was that the Volt was a lot more expensive.\u201dShe asked to see the manager, prevailed, and paid the higher price for the car she wanted. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d she added.Charge Across Town, a California-funded nonprofit that advocates electric vehicles, organizes events to introduce consumers to dealers, but has had to work hard at times just to get dealers to show up. In August in San Diego, at the first such event, a few dealers showed up, but to the astonishment of the organizers would not let anyone test-drive or even sit in the cars, said Maureen Blanc, who heads Charge Across Town.The group saw better dealer turnout at a recent event in San Rafael, with representatives from BMW, Mitsubishi, Mercedes, Ford, Honda and Tesla there. (Tesla stands apart in the conversation about dealers because it does not use them, selling directly to consumers.)At the event, Kyle Gray, a BMW salesman, said he was personally enthusiastic about the technology, but listed several reasons that dealers may not do more to push the cars: Salespeople who have spent years understanding combustion cars don\u2019t have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of overall sales, and the sales process takes more time because the technology is new, cutting into commissions.Mr. Gray told the story of a couple who came into the dealership to try an electric BMW and, during a test drive, discovered that the braking system felt so different that \u201cthe wife was in the front getting sick.\u201dIn the end, though, he said the couple got used to the car and loved it. That\u2019s why, he said, the dealership where he works allows three-day test drives, so potential customers can become used to the different driving experience.BMW and Nissan are among the companies whose dealers tend to be more enthusiastic and informed, said Dr. Cahill, the scholar. He estimated that, over all, 10 percent of dealers are \u201creally sharp\u201d on the technology.Marc Deutsch, Nissan\u2019s business development manager for electric vehicles, said some salespeople just could not rationalize the time it takes to sell the cars. A salesperson \u201ccan sell two gas burners in less than it takes to sell a Leaf,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work for a little pay.\u201dJared Allen, a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said there was not sufficient data to prove that electric cars would require less maintenance. But he acknowledged that service was crucial to dealer profits.According to the organization, dealers on average make three times as much profit from service as they do from new car sales. A 2013 J.D. Power survey of car buyers found that about 48 percent of electric car buyers planned to take their car back to the dealer for service, compared with 57 percent for traditional cars, noted Dr. Cahill, from U.C. Davis.Maybe that helps explains the experience of Robert Kast, who last year leased a Volkswagen e-Golf from a local dealer.

{"Headline": "House Passes $300 Billion Bill to Improve Roads and Bridges", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bill, however, still fails to address a chronic shortfall in financing for the Federal Highway Trust Fund, which pays for such projects, and has been the subject of a fierce long-running disagreement over federal tax policy.The House measure must now be reconciled with a Senate version adopted earlier this year. Like the House bill, the Senate measure included six years of policy prescriptions but only provided about three years\u2019 worth of financing.The vote in the House was 363 to 64. Most of the \u201cno\u201d votes came from hard-line conservative Republicans who were angered that the bill was not fully paid for and that it included a provision to reopen the federal Export-Import Bank.Some transportation experts also criticized the measure, which they said was too small to address the nation\u2019s widespread, and worsening, infrastructure problems. President Obama, in his budget, had called for a larger, $478 billion program.Still, authors of the House bill said that it would improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure as well as transportation safety. House Republicans also said that the two and a half days of freewheeling floor debate, and consideration of more than 100 amendments, demonstrated Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s commitment to running a more inclusive legislative process.Mr. Ryan, at a news conference in the Capitol, hailed the passage of the bill.\u201cWe just completed the work on a bipartisan highway bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cuts waste. It prioritizes good infrastructure. It will help create good-paying jobs. And it is the result of a more open process.\u201cOver these last four days, the House has debated more amendments than in the last four months combined,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, adding, \u201cThis is a good start. It\u2019s a glimpse of how we should be doing the people\u2019s business.\u201dStill, critics said the insufficient financing in the bill represented a longstanding failure by Congress and recent administrations to maintain the nation\u2019s transportation systems, and to invest in much-needed enhancements.The shortage of financing reflects a continuing disagreement in Washington over how to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded largely by a federal gas tax. The tax was last increased in 1993 and is not indexed to inflation.That, together with greater fuel efficiency of modern cars, has led to shortfalls of more than $70 billion since 2008, which Congress has covered with general funds.And while the House did engage in far more open debate than it has been in recent years, Republican leaders blocked amendments that would have increased the gas tax \u2014 a move they oppose but many business groups support.The debate on the floor was managed by Representative Bill Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, following the footsteps of his father, former Representative Bud Shuster, who was chairman of the same committee from 1995 to 2001.In a statement, the younger Mr. Shuster praised the House for approving his bill. \u201cToday the House voted to give our infrastructure and our economy a much-needed shot in the arm,\u201d he said.Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the committee, also praised the outcome but expressed concern about the insufficient financing.\u201cI am very pleased, that after 10 years of short-term Band-Aids and extensions, the House finally passed a bipartisan, six-year transportation bill,\u201d Mr. DeFazio said in a statement. \u201cThis legislation isn\u2019t perfect. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t provide the level of investment needed to repair or rebuild our aging 1950s-era system of roads, bridges and public transit systems.\u201dStill, Mr. DeFazio said the bill provides a framework that would make good use of additional money if Congress and the president provide it.Others saw deeper shortcomings. \u201cI see it as a huge missed opportunity,\u201d said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy group in Washington.He said the bill failed to provide money for passenger rail capital projects and also fell short by not encouraging a more modern, efficient freight policy.Hard-line conservative Republicans were infuriated by the provision to restart the Export-Import Bank, but their opposition seemed futile given that a huge bipartisan majority in the House had voted to approve a separate measure that would also reopen the bank. Still, the conservatives pushed a number of amendments aimed at weakening the bank should it reopen. Those amendments were rejected.Separately on Thursday, the House voted again to approve the annual military policy bill, which President Obama vetoed last month in a fight with congressional Republicans over spending.The spending fight was ultimately resolved in a budget agreement that Mr. Obama signed on Monday. But there are still points of disagreement in the military bill, particularly a Republican provision that keeps in place a ban on bringing prisoners from the detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, into the United States, even for prosecution or continued detention in another prison. It also would tighten restrictions on transferring detainees to other countries.Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to close the prison, an unfulfilled promise of his presidency, calls for transferring 53 of the remaining detainees and bringing the other 61 to a prison on domestic soil.The White House on Wednesday declined to say whether Mr. Obama would veto a second version of the military policy bill over Guant\u00e1namo, which he has objected to in past years but ultimately signed into law.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the provisions were \u201ca really bad idea,\u201d but added: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take a look at exactly what passes Congress before making a determination about what the president will sign.\u201dThe Senate is also expected to readopt the military measure, though a vote is not yet scheduled.Also on Thursday, Senate Democrats blocked Republicans from taking up the annual military appropriations bill. Some Democrats fear that despite the recent budget agreement, Republicans would gladly approve increased military spending but then refuse to carry out other aspects of the budget accord.Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Portugal\u2019s Government Ousted in Challenge to Austerity", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn alliance of left-wing Portuguese lawmakers on Tuesday brought down the government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, turning the country\u2019s politics on its head just weeks after inconclusive elections and offering up a strong new challenge to the austerity policies that have divided Europe.Mr. Passos Coelho, a center-right leader, was ousted after lawmakers voted to reject his new government\u2019s program, 123 to 107.The prime minister had been held up as a model proponent of the belt-tightening prescriptions pushed by European Union officials in Brussels, international creditors and countries like Germany.Ahead of the vote, the country\u2019s finance minister had warned members of Parliament that a turnaround in economic policy could have dire consequences at a time when Portugal\u2019s debt continues to be rated as junk by three of the major credit rating agencies.\u201cIf investor confidence is shattered, the threat of bankruptcy is real,\u201d the finance minister, Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque, told lawmakers.The warning went unheeded.Portugal\u2019s conservative president, An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, now faces the difficult choice of either asking Mr. Passos Coelho to stay at the helm of a caretaker minority government until new elections can be held next year, or \u2014 more likely \u2014 allowing Ant\u00f3nio Costa, the leader of the Socialist party, to form an alternative government.The Socialists and their allies have promised to unwind parts of the austerity program Mr. Passos Coelho had introduced during his first term.In either case, analysts expect Portugal to remain in a fragile political condition and to struggle to meet the deficit and debt targets set by Brussels after a 78 billion euro bailout program Portugal received in 2011. The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body, recently warned Portugal for delaying its 2016 budget plan.Elected in 2011, Mr. Passos Coelho was the first prime minister to lead a coalition through a full term in office since Portugal\u2019s 1974 revolution and return to democracy. His second term will now be one of the shortest on record.He and his center-right coalition won national elections on Oct. 4, with just 39 percent of the vote, after putting in place an austerity program credited with arresting the country\u2019s economic slide; restoring some growth and access to financial markets; and bringing down unemployment, which remains about 12 percent.But the majority of votes were spread among parties on Portugal\u2019s long-fractured left who tapped into the deep resentment of Brussels that the austerity policies have engendered.A majority of Portuguese, judging by the elections returns, did not experience the benefits of austerity, and they continue to struggle with low wages and widening income disparities. Tax breaks for foreign investors under Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s government have revitalized pockets of the economy, while other parts have been left behind.After the election, the Socialist leader, Mr. Costa, managed to broker a rare alliance of left-wing parties who have now united around their opposition to the austerity program.The deal may allow his Socialist party to lead a new government with support from the Left Bloc, the party that made the biggest gains in the election, and the country\u2019s Communist Party, bringing it in from decades on the sidelines of Portuguese politics.Mr. Costa\u2019s administration would be the first Socialist government supported by radical left parties since Portugal\u2019s return to democracy four decades ago, said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence, in a research note issued Monday.\u201cThe probable consequences of this experiment are far from clear-cut, but they are likely to be mostly market-negative,\u201d Mr. Barroso said.While the two smaller left-wing parties have dropped most of their most radical pre-election demands, including a restructuring of Portugal\u2019s debt with international creditors, a new Socialist-led government is still expected to challenge the austerity orthodoxy.The left-wing parties have pledged to cut some taxes and reverse public-sector wage cuts that Mr. Passos Coelho had introduced. They also plan to suspend Portugal\u2019s privatization program, which could create particular tensions over what to do with Novo Banco, the bank that was salvaged from the fraud-tainted collapse of the Esp\u00edrito Santo business empire last year.But a left-wing alliance may itself face its own challenges, and its own longevity and stability is by no means assured.Pedro Magalh\u00e3es, a researcher at the Institute of Social Sciences in Lisbon, suggested before Tuesday\u2019s vote that a left-wing administration could struggle to last a full mandate given the longstanding divergences and different incentives of the three parties.In particular, the Left Bloc is a less centralized party, \u201cwith a volatile electorate and aspirations of growth within the left,\u201d he said. \u201cI think their role in government survival introduces particular uncertainty.\u201dThe political turmoil in Portugal is being closely watched elsewhere in Europe as a bellwether of political trends and an indicator of whether even countries that had been models of austerity prescriptions are now experiencing fatigue with the belt-tightening nearly seven years after the onset of Europe\u2019s debt and euro crisis.Particularly wary is the conservative government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in neighboring Spain, which has also been a strong proponent of austerity but has faced similar complaints about its spending cuts from Socialist opponents and others.Mr. Rajoy faces elections on Dec. 20, when polls so far indicate that his conservative Popular Party may lose what has been an ironclad majority in Parliament, with the potential to leave the Spanish in a similar position to the Portuguese.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Post in Strong Stock Market Debut in Tokyo", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 For decades, whenever Japan\u2019s leaders had an important project to pay for, they turned to the post office.Whether it was a new bullet train line, aid for struggling small businesses or money to finance the national debt, politicians could call on Japan Post to assign a portion of Japanese citizens\u2019 nest eggs to the task, through the nationwide network of savings banks it operates through its more than 20,000 post office branches.On Wednesday, Japan Post was enlisted in a new national project: turning conservative Japanese savers into risk-taking investors by offering them the chance to buy shares in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.Japan\u2019s leaders should be happy with the early results.A glut of buy orders for shares of Japan Post Holdings meant the stock went untraded for more than half an hour on its first day on the market. It ultimately made its debut at 1,631 yen \u2014 or $13.49 \u2014 per share, 16.5 percent higher than its I.P.O. price. Two subsidiaries that operate banking and insurance businesses, which were listed separately, also faced a surplus of buy orders. Japan Post Bank finally opened at \u00a51,680, up 16 percent from its I.P.O. price, and Japan Post Insurance opened 33 percent higher.Japan Post Holdings finished 25.7 percent above its I.P.O. price at \u00a51,760. Japan Post Bank ended 15.2 percent higher at \u00a51,671, and Japan Post Insurance closed up 55.9 percent at \u00a53,430. The Nikkei 225-stock average closed 1.3 percent higher.With the economy sluggish, the Japanese government wants to persuade smaller investors to squirrel away their savings in stocks, rather than in bank accounts. Such a shift, it hopes, will spur a wealth-generating rise in asset prices. To help accomplish the move, the leadership has looked to the privatization of Japan Post, the 144-year-old national postal service that is also the country\u2019s biggest bank and life insurer.\u201cA quarter of Japanese savings are sitting in the postal bank, and for the sake of the economy we need this to become risk-taking money,\u201d said Heizo Takenaka, a professor at Keio University who promoted privatization as economics minister a decade ago. \u201cAs a private company, Japan Post will be able to lend and invest freely, which will revitalize asset markets.\u201dThe I.P.O. was aimed squarely at small investors, people who might otherwise have added to Japan Post savings accounts. About three-quarters of the stock was allocated to individual buyers in Japan. Japan Post advertised the I.P.O. on television, an unusual move to drum up interest in a stock listing, and brokerage firms reported a surge in new accounts from first-time customers looking to buy in.Demand was strong, with the I.P.O. oversubscribed. The company priced at the top of its range, raising \u00a51.4 trillion, or $11.6 billion, in the I.P.O.Japan Post, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, was the largest offering since the $25 billion debut last year of Alibaba, the Chinese Internet giant. It is also the biggest privatization in Japan since 1987, when the government began selling off the state-owned telephone monopoly.Japan joins Germany, Britain and other countries that have privatized their postal systems. Those efforts, though, have often been accompanied by heated political battles.Plans for the privatization of Japan Post began a decade ago, but it was delayed by a fierce tug of war.Some politicians wanted to maintain state ownership and the control of the vast pool of postal savings. Others said the system was obsolete and wasteful. The final impetus for privatization was provided by Japan\u2019s earthquake and tsunami in 2011, when huge sums of money were needed for rebuilding. The government says it will allocate money raised by the I.P.O. to that effort.The I.P.O. frees Japan Post to take more risks with the huge pool of funds it controls. Japan Post\u2019s savings bank holds the equivalent of more than $1.4 trillion of deposits, making it one of the world\u2019s biggest financial institutions. The insurance arm oversees tens of billions of dollars in policies. Much of the money has been invested in relatively safe but low-yielding government bonds.\u201cI hope it will further accelerate the shift from savings to investment and help to create a virtuous cycle in the economy,\u201d Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the primary spokesman for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said when the offer price of Japan Post\u2019s shares was completed late last month.Other government-controlled financial firms have been enlisted in the campaign.The Government Pension Investment Fund, the world\u2019s biggest public pension fund with more than \u00a5120 trillion of assets, said last year that it would double the portion of its portfolio dedicated to stocks, to a target of 50 percent.Many analysts said the shift was long overdue, and would align the fund\u2019s investment strategy more closely with other big global pension funds. But some critics have accused Mr. Abe of engaging in a politically motivated effort to inflate stock prices.Postal savings have long been used to pay for government initiatives, supplementing the regular government budget.\u201cIt allowed the government to raise funds without having to levy taxes,\u201d said Gene Park, a professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, who has written a book on the history of postal savings in Japan.That function helped the government by giving it money to spend while keeping taxes lower than they otherwise would have been. But it also fostered a culture of unaccountable and sometimes wasteful spending, Mr. Park said. Favored industries could be propped up in bad times, for instance using subsidized loans backed by postal savings, with little public disclosure or input.\u201cThe beauty of it from politicians perspective was that it was invisible,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cIt allowed problems to be kicked down the road.\u201dJapan Post no longer directly finances the so-called \u201csecond budget,\u201d formally known as the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, and the program itself is smaller and less important than it once was. But Japan Post remains a buyer of bonds issued by program-related agencies.Advertisement"}

Bratton, as he announced an indictment against gun traffickers last week.The economics are straightforward: A low-quality handgun that sells for $100 in an Atlanta store might sell for $500 or $600 in New York City, researchers say \u2014 and it can be transported cheaply. By contrast, the majority of guns used in crimes in Texas, Georgia and other states with more lenient gun laws are purchased in-state.The New York Times examined gun trafficking by analyzing nine years of data compiled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as an index of state gun laws developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University.Law enforcement officials express frequent frustration that they are not able to track every gun that crosses state lines, which means the estimates here are conservative. When the police do recover a gun tied to criminal activity, typically after an arrest, they can trace the gun to where it was last sold through a federally licensed dealer.Chicago offers perhaps the starkest example of trafficking. There are no retail gun dealers within city limits, because Chicago has some of the tightest municipal gun regulations. Yet bringing a gun into Chicago can be as simple as driving less than an hour to a gun show in Indiana, where private sales are not recorded and do not require a background check.The Route Into ChicagoWisconsinMost guns used in crimes in Illinois were recovered in the Chicago area.MichiganIowaCHICAGO1,041 gunsIllinoisGun shows in Indiana are a frequent source for guns used in crimes in Illinois.IndianaMissouriMany people in Illinois have family ties to Mississippi, the second most common source for crime guns.The Route Into ChicagoMost guns used in crimes in Illinois were recovered in the Chicago area.WisconsinIowaCHICAGO1,041gunsIllinoisIndianaGun shows in Indiana are a frequent source for guns used in crimes in Illinois.Many people in Illinois have family ties to Mississippi, the second most common source for crime guns.MissouriMany guns follow a complex path from the original sale to the underground market. Most guns are originally bought from retail stores, but people who can\u2019t pass a background check typically obtain guns from friends, family or illegal dealers.One inmate said, \u201cSome people get on a train and bring them back, can be up to five or six guns, depending on how much risk they want to take.\u201dSome larger traffickers use more elaborate techniques. Buying a gun in Puerto Rico requires an expensive permit and a lengthy application process, but Florida has no such restrictions. Traffickers in Orlando tied to organized gangs in Puerto Rico send guns in the mail, through FedEx, or even encased in cars that travel by ship to the island.\u201cThey\u2019ll buy a $500 car and stuff it with as many guns as possible,\u201d said Carlos Gonzalez, an agent with the Miami division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.Guns by MailOrlando, which has a large Puerto Rican population, is the source for many guns trafficked to Puerto Rico.ORLANDOFloridaMIAMI349 gunsIn 2014, more guns used in crimes in Puerto Rico were traced to purchases in Florida than on the island itself.CubaPuertoRicoHaitiDom.Rep.Guns by MailOrlando, which has a large Puerto Rican population, is the source for many guns trafficked to Puerto Rico.ORLANDOFloridaMIAMI349 gunsCubaHaitiDom.Rep.In 2014, more guns used in crimes in Puerto Rico were traced to purchases in Florida than on the island itself.PuertoRicoFederal agents and postal inspectors have caught some traffickers, leading to modified techniques, such as shipping guns in newer, more expensive cars or mailing guns from Jacksonville, Fla., instead of Orlando. Stopping such smuggling is logistically hard. \u201cIf the U.S. Postal Service were to screen every single package that entered into Puerto Rico, it would bring the economy to a halt,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said.Most gun trafficking patterns have remained remarkably constant over time. But some researchers point to a significant shift in Missouri as evidence that changes to one state\u2019s laws can have broad implications.But when Missouri relaxed its gun control laws in 2007, the flow started to change. The number of guns traced to other states decreased, while the number of guns from within Missouri increased to nearly three-quarters.Source of guns used in crimes in Missouri80 percentGuns from Missouri74%60More criminals used guns from Missouri after guns became easier to purchase.40Missouri repealed strict gun control lawsin August 2007.26%20Guns imported from other states2014\u201912\u201910\u201908\u201906\u2019042002Source of guns used in crimes in Missouri80 percentGuns from Missouri74%60More criminals used guns from Missouri after guns became easier to purchase.40Missouri repealed strict gun control laws in August 2007.26%Guns imported from other states202014\u201912\u201910\u201908\u201906\u201904\u201902Note: State gun strictness shown in maps is based on work by researchers at Johns Hopkins University that examined whether states require licenses to purchase handguns, regulate private handgun sales, require gun owners to report theft or loss, strongly regulate gun dealers and ban junk guns that do not meet certain design and safety standards.

{"Headline": "Entergy to Close Nuclear Plant on Lake Ontario, Angering Cuomo", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe company said it was losing too much money operating the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in Oswego County and had failed to persuade state officials to provide adequate help. Bill Mohl, president of Entergy Wholesale Commodities, declined to discuss details of the negotiations the company had held with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s staff over the past several weeks.\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t reach a mutual agreement on the situation,\u201d Mr. Mohl said in a phone interview. He said the plant suffered from being in a region of the state with abundant energy production but relatively little demand.But Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement that the state would \u201cpursue every legal and regulatory avenue in an attempt to stop Entergy\u2019s actions and its callous disregard for their skilled and loyal work force.\u201d The company notified employees at the plant and state regulators about its plan on Monday morning. The regulators must now decide whether the plant, which can produce about 2 percent of the power generated in the state, is too important a source to allow to close, but Mr. Mohl said he did not foresee such a determination.He said the company had opted not to order any more fuel for the reactor, which would mean that it would cease operating late next year or in early 2017. At that point, he said, about half of the employees \u2014 300 or so \u2014 would lose their jobs.After that, employment at the plant would gradually decline through a decommissioning process that would last five years or more, Mr. Mohl said. He said it would take that long for the spent fuel to cool enough to be moved from a pool into dry cask storage on the site.The plant also is one of the few sources of high-paying jobs in the region, said Mr. Doyle, who commutes to his job in plant security from his home 20 miles away in Pulaski.\u201cEverybody that works here is making a good salary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no other jobs here. These are the best jobs.\u201dMr. Mohl said the company understood the role it played in the community, but added that Entergy had a fiduciary duty to its shareholders. The company recently reduced the value of the FitzPatrick plant on its books by $965 million.Asked if the decision to close was final, he said: \u201cYou never say never. But we believe a reversal is very unlikely.\u201dMr. Cuomo, in his statement, took a swipe at the company\u2019s rationale. \u201cGood corporate citizenship must appreciate that there are many factors that count as the \u2018bottom line,\u2019\u201d the governor said.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat who had met with Entergy officials to try to persuade them not to close the plant, was angered at the announcement. A spokesman for the senator, Angelo Roefaro, said the company\u2019s plan to close FitzPatrick \u201cwould be awful for the local economy and to hundreds of loyal and effective workers, but it will also negatively impact power reliability in central New York.\u201dThe shutdown would leave Entergy with just one source of nuclear power in New York \u2014 the two reactors at Indian Point, on the east side of the Hudson River in Buchanan. The company is seeking a renewal of its federal licenses to operate those reactors, but Mr. Cuomo has opposed those applications.Mr. Mohl said Indian Point was more cost-effective than FitzPatrick because it had two reactors and benefited from being located in the New York City metropolitan area, one of the most expensive markets for electricity in the country.Advertisement"}

On Dec. 7, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a case regarding alleged sexual assaults by a Dollar General manager against a tribal minor, a 13-year-old who apprenticed in a store on Choctaw tribal lands in Mississippi. While working in partnership with non-Indians remains an important part of what tribal governments do, ensuring the welfare of tribal members is an essential function of their power. This case has the potential to undermine the authority of tribes to do both.In keeping with the fraught legal and political relationship between Indians and the federal government, this case, Dollar General v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, is deeply rooted in our shared history. And as its focus has expanded, it is no longer exclusively about the child who was originally at its center.Since its inception, the United States government has recognized that tribal governments have authority over their lands, their members and, in certain situations, those who enter their territories. This recognition is rooted in the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause, in nearly two centuries of Supreme Court rulings and, crucially, in generations of customary practices between tribes and their neighbors. By asserting that tribes, despite generations of these partnerships with non-Indians, lack jurisdiction over businesses in Indian country, Dollar General is challenging this historic principle of American law.This is not the first time tribes have fought to preserve their authority over non-Indians. For example, in 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe that only the federal government could punish non-Indians for crimes committed on tribal lands.But decades later, it was Native American survivors of domestic violence who led efforts to have Congress reauthorize previously lost forms of tribal authority over domestic violence. This victory came not only after growing concerns over lawlessness in Indian country but also after the harrowing testimony of survivors during the run-up to the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.Given this history, it is chilling that the Supreme Court has now agreed to hear Dollar General\u2019s challenge to the sovereignty of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Initially, the minor and his parents \u2014 barred from bringing criminal charges through tribal court \u2014 secured the molestation suspect\u2019s expulsion from the reservation. No criminal charges were ever filed by the United States attorney\u2019s office. The family then sought compensatory, civil damages within the tribe\u2019s court system. Tribal and lower federal courts all agree that the tribe has the jurisdiction to hear the case. Dollar General, however, does not.The arguments made by Dollar General\u2019s lawyers are radical. They conflict with decades of settled precedent that recognize the ability of tribes to protect their citizens from noncriminal harms within their territories. Specifically, the corporation now argues that no tribe can protect its citizens in such civil cases, unless it is expressly authorized to do so by Congress.A federal court agreed that Dollar General\u2019s arguments were incorrect, but in appealing to the Supreme Court, Dollar General has created the potential of another Oliphant-style ruling that restricts tribal authority even further.Dollar General, which has a market value of approximately $20 billion, once believed in tribal jurisdiction. In 2000, it received a business license from the Choctaw to open a store, executed binding leases recognizing tribal law, and maintained a commercial enterprise for years thereafter. Only when the tribe\u2019s court system might hurt its bottom line, it seems, did the corporation turn to extreme and costly measures to ward off any form of restitution.Dollar General is now asking the court to reverse essential tenets of federal Indian law. The ability of tribal governments to protect their citizens on reservation lands remains a long-recognized attribute of Indian sovereignty. As the Supreme Court held in 1981 in Montana v. United States, the doctrine of retained tribal sovereignty includes the power to exercise \u201csome forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians on their reservations.\u201dDollar General stands poised to become one of the century\u2019s fiercest challengers to tribal communities. This case has the potential to jeopardize tribal governments\u2019 ability to develop their economies, to make binding contracts, even to protect their citizens.In pursuing profit above all else, Dollar General has darkened this holiday season. The Supreme Court should affirm the lower court rulings and preserve tribal authority in tribal lands. Otherwise, this Thanksgiving may be the last one during which we can give thanks for this long-recognized principle of American law.Advertisement"}

This year, a former deputy chief of the Shanghai free-trade zone, Dai Haibo, was also placed under investigation on suspicion of corruption.In Beijing, Ms. Lu\u2019s colleagues were quick to distance themselves from her case, which was announced Wednesday. Guo Jinlong, the secretary of the Communist Party in Beijing, said at a meeting that party members should learn from the case.

{"Headline": "In Obama Era, G.O.P. Bolsters Grip in the States", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 Young, telegenic and news media savvy, State Auditor Adam Edelen looked like a shoo-in for re-election when Democrats gathered in a horse barn here for a buffet dinner late last month. Most figured he would go on to challenge Senator Rand Paul, whose Republican presidential bid is faltering even as he seeks re-election.\u201cIn terms of governors, legislators and constitutional officers, the bench has been eviscerated during his tenure,\u201d said Mr. Edelen, 40, who says it would be \u201ctoo difficult\u201d for him to beat Mr. Paul and plans to go back to the private sector. He called the loss of Democratic talent across the country \u201cregrettable\u201d and said, \u201cIt will have very long-term consequences.\u201dWhile Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 election helped usher in a political resurgence for Democrats, the president today presides over a shrinking party whose control of elected offices at the state and local levels has declined precipitously. In January, Republicans will occupy 32 of the nation\u2019s governorships, 10 more than they did in 2009. Democratic losses in state legislatures under Mr. Obama rank among the worst in the last 115 years, with 816 Democratic lawmakers losing their jobs and Republican control of legislatures doubling since the president took office \u2014 more seats lost than under any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.\u201cRepublicans have more chambers today than they have ever had in the history of the party,\u201d said Tim Storey, an analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. \u201cSo they are in a dominant and historic position of strength in the states.\u201dThe absence of up-and-coming Democrats is evident in Washington, where the party leadership in Congress consists largely of aging veterans. The average age of the three top Democratic leaders in the House is 75, while the three most senior Republican leaders \u2014 with the new speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan \u2014 average 48 years old.There are a handful of young, ambitious members of the Democratic caucus, especially in the House, but it may be years before they are ready to play a bigger role on the national stage.In the Democratic presidential race, Hillary Rodham Clinton is 68; Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, is 74; and the biggest intrigue had been whether Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who turns 73 next week, would join them. (Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, is the party\u2019s youngest candidate at 52, though he is a major long shot.)Linking Democratic candidates to Mr. Obama in general, and his health care plan in particular, have long proved winning Republican campaign tactics in many states, but he is hardly the first president to become an election-year burden for some members of his own party. Republicans experienced big losses in 2006 and 2008, many of them attributed to the sagging popularity of President George W. Bush, the economic meltdown and deep concerns about Mr. Bush\u2019s conduct of the war in Iraq. By some measures, Republican losses in Congress under Mr. Bush were larger than Democratic congressional losses under Mr. Obama. And Democrats say Mr. Obama has been successful in building a new Democratic coalition in presidential politics and in mobilizing minority voters.But even some supporters say that Democrats face a major challenge in cultivating a new generation of politicians able to reach beyond the Democratic base and speak to white voters, especially white men, in states around the country. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011, said he was very worried by the absence of successful Democratic candidates positioned to move up, especially in the South, as well as in swing states like Ohio.\u201cWe are losing the white male vote in droves, and we\u2019ve got to appeal to the white male with stronger economic themes, inequality themes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to find a way to do that, but what is key is recruiting more white male, and women, candidates. We can\u2019t just become the minority advocate party.\u201dAt a $33,400-a-plate fund-raiser last week, Mr. Obama described a Democratic vision that he said had succeeded in overhauling health care, reviving a moribund economy and making progress on climate change. But he acknowledged the difficulty that Democrats sometimes had in winning over voters.\u201cAll they know is, nothing works up there, a plague on both their houses,\u201d Mr. Obama told more than 300 donors at a home in suburban Maryland. \u201cAnd so then they stop voting. And they give up on the system. And when we don\u2019t vote, oftentimes we lose.\u201dOther Democrats have different explanations. State Representative D. Stephen Holland, a Mississippi Democrat, said Republicans had exploited Mr. Obama\u2019s race to make gains in the South.Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, a Republican, acknowledged that Mr. Obama had been crucial to Republican successes throughout his presidency. But he disputed the contention that racism was in play.\u201cOn the racial issue, it\u2019s the Democrats that are bringing those issues up, or attempting to, to divide our people,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue that 90 percent of people are talking about. People are wanting to talk about, how do I get a job and a career?\u201d\u201cWe had a difficult time with the top of the ticket, and that dragged down all the others statewide and the locals,\u201d said Joe Schiavoni, the minority leader of the Ohio Senate.State Representative Andy Jorgensen, a member of the Democratic leadership in the Wisconsin House, noted that even the best Democratic candidates will have trouble running in Republican-dominated districts.\u201cThe gerrymandered state we\u2019re in is also a challenge,\u201d Mr. Jorgensen said.Democrats have one last chance at a breakthrough this year, in the Nov. 21 governor\u2019s runoff in heavily Republican and often volatile Louisiana. Polls show State Representative John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, running ahead of Senator David Vitter, a Republican who had been a heavy favorite but has been dogged by the resurgence of a prostitution scandal from his past.In states where Democratic despair is deepest, recruiting and even retaining candidates can be a challenge. Jody Steverson, a state representative from Mississippi, announced that he was switching parties two days after he was re-elected on the Democratic ticket last week. \u201cYou just can\u2019t be a conservative and a Democrat in Mississippi anymore,\u201d he said.Here in Kentucky, Mr. Edelen called the debate over Mr. Obama \u201cyesterday\u2019s conversation.\u201d The problem for Democrats in Middle America, he said, is that the party is \u201cperceived to be elite\u201d \u2014 a perception he said the president had helped foster \u2014 and is \u201cnot speaking to blue-collar, middle-class aspirations.\u201dHe said: \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge for the Democratic Party going forward \u2014 how do we re-engage the guy who works in the factory or the woman who\u2019s trying to raise kids on a waitress\u2019s salary?\u201dStill, he lamented a loss of talent, friends and peers like Jason Carter, who lost the governor\u2019s race in Georgia last year, or Vincent A. Sheheen, who lost a bid to become governor of South Carolina.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us are dead,\u201d Mr. Edelen said, \u201cbut we are resting and waiting for clearer skies.\u201dSheryl Gay Stolberg reported from Lexington, Michael D.

(The script was produced as a 1980 television movie starring Vanessa Redgrave.) Against a somber purple background, white pages of a score spill from a skinny music stand. It takes a second to notice the swastika at the base.With just a few elements, it\u2019s one of the most eye-catching images to be released in this centennial year of Miller\u2019s birth \u2014 a creative visual solution that speaks with the same economy that Miller did in his dramas about crippled dreams and punishing life choices. Like Miller\u2019s characters, it\u2019s unadorned and unfussy, but also considered, and heavy with emotion.Jim Tierney, who created the artwork for this and other Miller titles in the Penguin Plays series, said the playwright\u2019s works \u201chave such very clear and specific symbolism that you really only need to communicate one object that\u2019s loaded with meaning.\u201dBelow is a look at how designers are capturing the modest but powerful spirit of Miller\u2019s plays with simplicity and brawn.The cover of this hefty new collection was selected from some 30 Miller portraits painted by Riccardo Vecchio. It\u2019s a drawing that bled as Mr. Vecchio applied his brush to wet sections of the paper. Mr. Vecchio said the portrait reflected a \u201cdissonance\u201d found in Miller\u2019s work, between the \u201cclarity and the transparentness of the message\u201d and an \u201cambiguity and grayness about the present.\u201d It\u2019s there in the dramatic brushstrokes of the hair, the sour green of the shirt and in the severe and curious gaze of the eyes.Mr. Tierney said he set out to \u201creduce, reduce, reduce\u201d the imagery for Penguin Plays\u2019 new releases of some of Miller\u2019s more obscure works. Set in an unnamed Eastern European city, this play is about writers in an ornate room that the government may have bugged. Mr. Tierney said he made the Rococo ceiling \u201cmetaphorically sinister\u201d by adding a watchful eye. A star gives it dimension and a sense of place. \u201cYou have the idea of looming surveillance, secret police and Communism,\u201d he said. The gray background gives the image a bleak, utilitarian feel. The italic titles are Didot, a typeface that \u201cevokes a gravitas\u201d that is \u201cserious but expressive,\u201d Mr. Tierney said.Rapture Theater (closed)New Yiddish Rep (New York)Through Nov. 22The Yiddish translation of the play\u2019s title (\u201cToyt fun a Salesman\u201d) intersects this poster designed by Kenny Funk.

Mr. Funk, who has been a designer for 25 years, said he felt an affinity for the play\u2019s protagonist. \u201cHe\u2019s a salesman, and he\u2019s always looking for that customer who\u2019s going to give him this fabulous job that he\u2019s been looking for,\u201d said Mr. Funk, the owner of Coffee Cup Design Studio in New York. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m just getting by in this graphic design world, just like Willy Loman.\u201d Cleveland Play House (closed)\u201cWe wanted to make \u2018The Crucible\u2019 more exciting than the play I read in eighth grade,\u201d said Michelle Berki, a graphic designer for the theater.

Accusatory arms and pointed fingers cast blame all around. \u201cWe stuck with red because there\u2019s a lot of bloodshed in the play,\u201d Ms. Berki said. \u201cThe vision was to bring out lust and desire, and red needed to be the color.\u201dModern Theater (Spokane, Wash. and Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho)Jan. 22-Feb. 7, 2016David Clemons\u2019s original artwork for this production, which is being presented at the theater\u2019s venue in Coeur d\u2019Alene, was done with airbrush illustration, a style of art that was popular in the World War II era in which the play is set. The colorful silhouette is of the family patriarch in a Superman-like pose. \u201cYet there\u2019s a heaviness on him, a shame that\u2019s going to come out,\u201d said Mr. Clemons, a freelance illustrator. A uniform row of small headstones, like those in a military cemetery, undergird his heft. Blueprints of airplanes in the background are angled, as if the aircraft are diving.Grand Canyon University (Phoenix)Feb. 12-21, 2016Social responsibility fueled Jessica Foncannon\u2019s design for this production of Miller\u2019s drama. \u201cIt\u2019s about right versus wrong,\u201d she said. That black-or-white approach comes through in high-contrast design that features a composite image of a B-17 bomber appearing to disintegrate.

The stencil-like font, with slightly unaligned tops and bottoms, adds to the military feel. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chaos and dissent\u201d in the image, said Ms. Foncannon. \u201cThere are shows on Valentine\u2019s Day weekend, so we wanted to let people know what they are in for.\u201dArtsWest (Seattle)April 28-May 29, 2016An article on Wednesday about how designers are representing Arthur Miller\u2019s works on the centennial of his birth, using information from a designer, misidentified the plane shown on promotional artwork for the Grand Canyon University production of \u201cAll My Sons.\u201d It is a B-17 bomber \u2014 not a P-38, which was primarily a fighter plane.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Reveals Emissions Fix for Diesel Cars in Europe", "Date": "2015-11-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe technical patch that Volkswagen presented at company headquarters here is valid only for Europe, where it will be installed beginning next year.Modifying Volkswagen diesel cars sold in the United States will be more complicated because of stricter rules on emissions of nitrogen oxides, pollutants harmful to the environment and human health.Volkswagen will go a long way toward overcoming the crisis it faces if it can fix the cars in Europe.Of the 11 million vehicles that the company has admitted programming to cheat on emissions tests, most are in Europe, and about 8.5 million of those require repairs. About 500,000 of the cars are in the United States.The company said it hoped the changes to European cars would not affect performance or fuel economy, but could not yet guarantee that.Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen, estimated the cost of the recalls in Europe at 500 million euros, or $532 million, a fraction of the \u20ac6.7 billion that the company has set aside to cover the cost of the scandal.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The automaker also said on Wednesday that eight employees \u2014 fewer than some news outlets had reported \u2014 had been suspended in connection with an internal investigation to determine who decided to install illegal software in the vehicles.Hans-Gerd Bode, a Volkswagen spokesman, declined to identify the employees who were suspended but confirmed that they included three top managers with responsibility for engine development.Software in the cars ensured that they were on their best behavior when being tested, but allowed the vehicles to exceed emissions limits at other times.The three managers have been previously identified as Wolfgang Hatz, who was in charge of research and development at Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche division as well as head of engine and transmission development for the Volkswagen Group; Ulrich Hackenberg, head of development for all Volkswagen Group brands; and Heinz-Jakob Neusser, head of development for the Volkswagen brand.The technical fixes proposed by Volkswagen appeared to be surprisingly simple, deepening the mystery over why the decision had been made to evade pollution testing with illicit software. Volkswagen said German regulators had approved the changes.Cars with 2-liter diesel motors can be repaired by simply updating the engine-control software, the company said.Cars with 1.6-liter motors will require installation of a so-called flow straightener tube, which has mesh inside designed to stabilize air flowing into the motor. It allows the fuel-injection system to function more precisely and to reduce emissions.Volkswagen is still working on a repair for 1.2-liter motors, but said it would probably consist of a software update.The company said it would begin making the repairs in January and complete the recall by the end of 2016.The measures required in the United States are not likely to be so simple. The United States places stricter limits on nitrogen oxides, which are linked to lung ailments. In addition, most of the diesel vehicles sold in the United States \u2014 320,000 out of a total of 480,000 \u2014 are equipped with older emissions technology that could be harder to make compliant.Beginning with the 2013 model year, cars like the Passat were equipped with a system that uses the chemical urea to neutralize nitrogen oxide emissions and is considered effective when properly configured. Those vehicles may be easier to repair.Volkswagen did not sell any engines smaller than 2 liters in the United States, though a small number of cars with 1.6-liter motors may have been imported from Mexico or other countries.Representatives of Volkswagen and its Audi division have been in talks with the Environmental Protection Agency about how to make cars in the United States compliant.This month, the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency discovered during on-road testing of Volkswagen vehicles that larger models were also equipped with defeat devices. While the carmakers dispute that the software is actually used to cheat on emissions testing, they admitted to regulators that all 2009 to 2016 models equipped with a 3-liter engine were fitted with the software.A further problem in the United States is that there are only about 1,000 Volkswagen and Audi dealers that could carry out the repairs. Volkswagen\u2019s dealer network is much denser in Europe, where it is the largest carmaker by far.\u201cThe risks continue to be in the U.S.A.,\u201d Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo to Raise Minimum Wage to\u00a0$15 for All New York State Employees", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe increase will place the pay of New York\u2019s state employees far ahead of the current minimum wage in other states, and positions Mr. Cuomo at the vanguard of a national movement to address stagnant pay for millions of American workers.Using executive authority, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, would gradually increase the hourly rate: State workers in New York City would earn $15 an hour by the end of 2018; state workers outside of the city would also see wages rise, though more slowly, with rates climbing to $15 by the end of 2021. All told, some 10,000 workers \u2014 about 6.5 percent of the state\u2019s permanent and seasonal work force \u2014 would see an increase in pay, according to the governor\u2019s office, with the vast majority of those living upstate or outside the city.Two states, Massachusetts and Oregon, have recently agreed to raise minimum wages to $15 for home care workers, who are private employees but often receive public funds. But Mr. Cuomo\u2019s action is the first time a governor has increased mandatory hourly pay to at least $15 for employees of a state itself.At a raucous rally in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo framed his decision as part of a larger fight against poverty and economic inequality, criticizing fast-food companies like McDonald\u2019s for being culpable in \u201ca scam on the taxpayers of this country.\u201d He also summoned the legacy of another New York governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and argued that \u201cif you work full time, you should have a decent lifestyle for you and your family.\u201dThe state\u2019s current minimum wage of $8.75 was failing that promise, Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cYou can\u2019t pay for housing and food and clothing on $18,000 a year, period,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what today is all about.\u201dBut in recent months, Mr. Cuomo, a pragmatic centrist in many realms, has come to embrace raising the minimum wage. In July, he won an increase in the minimum wage for fast-food workers in New York through a state wage board.And although Mr. Cuomo in September did discount the option of raising wages only for state workers \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not an optimum situation\u201d \u2014 he did so because he said he wanted it to apply to all workers.The job categories affected by the plan include lifeguards, office assistants and custodial staff, some of which are seasonal. Wages in New York City would be raised first, administration officials said, because of its higher cost of living.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s announcement was met with an enthusiastic response from labor leaders like George Gresham, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U., the nation\u2019s largest health care workers union, who applauded the governor\u2019s action. Mr. Gresham said it could potentially set a $15-an-hour standard of pay for tens of thousands of the union\u2019s home-care workers, \u201cwho do this important work, but who are not necessarily state employees.\u201d The announcement prompted the city\u2019s public advocate, Letitia A. James, to call for a $15 minimum wage for city employees. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat and frequent sparring partner of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s, noted that the city had already promised its lowest paid workers more than $12 an hour in 2016, while the governor\u2019s plan would accelerate past that level only at the end of 2017.\u201cOf course, the mayor will continue to fight to ensure all workers, across every industry, make a wage on which their families can live,\u201d the spokeswoman, Amy Spitalnick, said.On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo, long rumored to have national political ambitions, seemed to sense the broader appeal and impact of the issue.\u201cThe nation is going to watch us and we\u2019re going to raise up this state and we\u2019re going to raise up this nation to a higher level than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he said, to a cheering crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are going to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Saturday\u2019s ceremony was broadcast on radio and television stations across the country and included an emotional story from an Ebola response worker who survived being infected with the virus.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a mixed emotion,\u201d said Tunis Yahya, director of communications for the country\u2019s National Ebola Response Center, speaking by phone from the official ceremony, attended by President Ernest Bai Koroma. \u201cPeople are happy, but also many are depressed because they lost their families.\u201dThe swirl of emotions was evident on the streets of Freetown, where people started gathering at midnight in anticipation of the announcement, dancing in celebration. But there was also quiet reflection. Names of the dead were read aloud, and people gathered under a giant cotton tree for a vigil for health workers who died.In Sierra Leone, the hardest hit of any nation during the Ebola outbreak, nearly 4,000 people died from the disease; altogether 14,000 were infected. The outbreak has so far killed more than 11,300 people across the world.Sierra Leone will now begin a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance that will run until Feb. 5, with the aim of quickly detecting any new possible cases. But for Sierra Leone, Saturday was a time to relish the chance to get back to normal.Celebrations were planned across the nation, with speeches from political and religious figures, singing, dancing, an ambulance exposition from the Red Cross and balloon releases.The consequences of the outbreak in Sierra Leone, which began in May 2014, have been far-reaching. As was the case in Liberia and Guinea, the nation\u2019s economy has been knocked off kilter after companies pulled out and tourism and commerce ground to a halt when the virus started spreading.The Times produced more than 400 articles, including about 50 front-page stories from inside the Ebola-afflicted countries themselves. Here is a sample of work.\u201cSierra Leone can now focus on rebuilding its economy and harnessing our community spirit and national ambition to bring back foreign investors, strengthen the private sector, diversify its economic activity and bring growth and prosperity to the people of this country,\u201d said John Sisay, chief executive of the mining company Sierra Rutile, the largest in the country, in a statement.The celebratory mood on Saturday was a far cry from the situation here almost exactly a year ago, when the number of cases in Sierra Leone was at its highest level.The disease hopscotched across the country, with health workers scrambling to react. More than six months after the epidemic was identified, patients in one district, Kono, died in an overrun holding center strewn with contaminated waste. Many of those exposed to Ebola were not tracked.\u201cIt was a different world,\u201d said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which sent 986 workers to Sierra Leone, more than were sent to Guinea or Liberia. Those workers ran a testing laboratory, supported an Ebola vaccine trial and helped build an emergency operations center.They also offered advice, including opposing Sierra Leone\u2019s policy of quarantining people who had come into contact with Ebola patients, often without support for those people\u2019s basic needs in the beginning. The quarantines increased mistrust and may have extended the outbreak, Dr. Frieden said. He said the priority now was to help strengthen health care and disease surveillance.Dionne Searcey reported from Dakar, and Sheri Fink from Ennis, Ireland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Money Makers,\u2019 by Eric Rauchway", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 2008, the international economy came within weeks of catastrophic collapse. Concerted action by the world\u2019s monetary authorities staved off disaster. Although stagnation continues to plague much of the globe, especially Europe, a major depression was avoided.The world was not so lucky in 1929. In \u201cThe Money Makers,\u201d the historian Eric Rauchway argues that the cause of the Great Depression was a failure of monetary imagination, and that only when Franklin Roosevelt overcame this failure did recovery begin. And, as his subtitle makes clear, Rauchway ties Roosevelt\u2019s Depression-era monetary policies to initiatives taken during and after World War II, which created the basis for the next 30 years of international economic growth.The policies of the world\u2019s major governments helped turn the recession that began in 1929 into a full-fledged depression. International economic leaders largely followed the dictates of the gold standard, which called for deflation and austerity. The results were disastrous, as prices and wages plummeted, dragging heavily indebted economies down with them.Of course, this evokes a parallel to Europe\u2019s current failure to revive its moribund economy, by continuing to adhere to the politics of austerity. The sooner countries left the gold standard in the 1930s, the more quickly their economies rebounded. Britain went off gold in September 1931, followed by most of the rest of the world. America\u2019s path out of the Depression was slowed by the Hoover administration\u2019s gold-standard orthodoxy. When Roosevelt took office in 1933, he almost immediately took the United States off gold and devalued the dollar. The result, as Rauchway shows, was a robust recovery.By 1936, the world had left gold behind. For the next 10 years, even as war clouds gathered and then as war raged, American and British policy makers, led by John Maynard Keynes and the United States Treasury official Harry Dexter White, planned a new international monetary order based on the principles of managed currencies that had evolved in the 1930s. This system, codified at Bretton Woods in 1944, presided over decades of rapid economic growth after World War II.Rauchway tells this important story with passion, intelligence and style. He is a true believer in managed currency as an alternative to gold-standard orthodoxy, and most modern macroeconomists would agree with him. But Rauchway\u2019s treatment goes well beyond purely macro\u00adeconomic considerations.The gold standard may seem a dry economic issue, but Rauchway casts the debate over it as an epic struggle with grave social and political consequences. The supporters of gold were big-\u00adbusiness plutocrats; the proponents of a new monetary model were political progressives sensitive to the needs of farmers and workers. Moreover, as the economic turmoil of the period fed into the rise of right-wing ideologies, Rauchway sees the American, British and French monetary initiatives of the 1930s as part of the gathering struggle against fascism. The Bretton Woods conference was an attempt to inoculate the postwar world against the sort of economic calamity that had given rise to Hitler.The major players come alive in \u201cThe Money Makers.\u201d Rauchway\u2019s archival research gives depth to Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., showing that both men understood the economic and political implications of their monetary policies, even if they were uninterested in the theoretical foundations for them that Keynes and others were building. The book also gives great detail about the practical involvement of the two principal economists involved, Keynes and White. Rauchway places the political context front and center, especially in addressing the issue of White\u2019s contacts with Soviet agents.\u201cThe Money Makers\u201d is economic and diplomatic history of the first order. It tells a crucially important story about a central development in the world economy, the emergence of the modern monetary system. And it tells this story with sensitivity to the economic, diplomatic and political environment. Anyone with even a passing interest in international economic affairs will benefit from reading this intelligent, timely and thoroughly accessible book. And perhaps today\u2019s policy makers \u2014 especially contemporary advocates of orthodox austerity sitting in Berlin \u2014 can learn something from the story Eric Rauchway tells so well.

{"Headline": "Paris Attacks Complicate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Alignment With Obama", "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut she did, indirectly and deftly, contradict Mr. Obama\u2019s comments, made in a television interview recorded a day before the attacks, that the Islamic State had been \u201ccontained\u201d in Iraq and Syria.\u201cWe have to look at ISIS as the leading threat of an international terror network,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt cannot be contained; it must be defeated.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has said for months that it sees no reason to break with Mr. Obama. Mrs. Clinton has instead positioned her agenda around plans to \u201cbuild on the progress\u201d of the Obama administration. In places like South Carolina where African-American voters, in particular, overwhelmingly support the president, Mrs. Clinton devotes much of her stump speech to effusively praising Mr. Obama\u2019s success in reviving the economy after the 2008 financial crisis.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.For four years as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton played a prominent role in nearly every foreign policy issue of Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, often pushing the White House to embrace a more aggressive approach. She urged the administration to join a NATO-led coalition to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, proposed that more forces be left in Iraq and pushed to funnel arms to moderate Syrian rebels.\u201cI assume she and her advisers are trying to calibrate Obama\u2019s approval rating right now,\u201d said Paul R. Pillar, a former C.I.A. analyst who teaches at Georgetown University. But he added, \u201cI think the conventional wisdom, that Hillary Clinton is a more hawkish person and would be a more hawkish president, with everything that adjective implies, is correct.\u201d\u201cI did, early on, say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early on,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said Saturday. \u201cBecause I thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum.\u201dThe images from France have not prompted Mr. Obama to abandon his deep reluctance to send additional American troops to Iraq and Syria.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe U.S. troops are the answer to the problem,\u201d Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said Sunday. \u201cThe further introduction of U.S. troops to fully re-engage in ground combat in the Middle East is not the way to deal with this challenge.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s reaction to the attacks in France reminded foreign policy experts of the gulf between the president and Mrs. Clinton, which first emerged in their 2008 primary contest as Mr. Obama contrasted his antiwar message with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq.\u201cBoth when she was secretary of state and since, she has had a sense of focusing not just on the cost of action, but the cost of inaction,\u201d said Dennis B. Ross, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama who is now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPresident Obama has been much more inclined to the cost of action versus the cost of inaction.\u201dBut for Mrs. Clinton, embracing an inclination toward intervention is potentially an even more precarious proposition in a Democratic primary than breaking with Mr. Obama.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Iraq war vote, which she has repeatedly said was a mistake, was a major factor in her defeat in the 2008 primary, and it remains a vulnerability.On Saturday, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic rival, assailed her for supporting the war. \u201cI don\u2019t think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now,\u201d he said.Appearing acutely aware of how liberal primary voters, particularly in Iowa, view her hawkish reputation, Mrs. Clinton said on Saturday that \u201cthis cannot be an American fight\u201d and that the United States should not bear \u201cthe bulk of the responsibility.\u201dThose remarks allowed Republicans to tie Mrs. Clinton to an administration that they widely view as ineffective in combating the Islamic State. \u201cThe president has admitted he does not have a strategy as it relates to ISIS,\u201d Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and a Republican presidential candidate, told CNN. \u201cHillary Clinton last night said that it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not our fight.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt is our fight, and without our leadership in building a coalition to destroy ISIS, it won\u2019t happen.\u201dAt a campaign event in Ames, Iowa, on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton tried to expand on her earlier statement, saying that the United States should play a leadership role and \u201cbe rallying our partners and allies, pulling countries off the sidelines.\u201dHer seemingly incongruous comments on the issue speak to the reality that there may be no real political upside for Mrs. Clinton in coming out early with a detailed plan for Syria, said Michael O\u2019Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\u201cEven if she could convince people she\u2019s right today, by a year from now, on Election Day, the situation will have morphed,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cAnd in the meantime, she would have scared a lot of people with a little too much of what the Democratic base doesn\u2019t want to hear right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Economy Contracts 0.8%, Returning to Recession", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The Japanese economy deteriorated more severely than expected in the third quarter, government data released on Monday showed, extending a downturn into a second consecutive three-month period and putting the country in technical recession.Worsening business confidence appeared to be behind the decline. Companies reduced investment in the quarter and drew down on their inventories rather than increase production, a sign that they may be bracing for tougher times ahead.In a preliminary estimate, the Cabinet Office said gross domestic product shrank at an annualized rate of 0.8 percent. Economists surveyed by news agencies had expected a contraction of between 0.2 and 0.3 percent, on average.A darkening outlook for global growth has put Japanese businesses on the defensive. One concern is China, where growth in Asia\u2019s largest economy is slowing, in some sectors markedly, meaning there is less demand for industrial equipment, construction machinery and other capital goods, much of which has been supplied by producers in Japan.The Japanese stock market opened lower after the economic report. In late-morning trading, the Nikkei 225 average was down about 1 percent.Japan grows more slowly than other countries at the best of times, largely because its work force is shrinking, so even small setbacks can easily send it into reverse. The latest recession was its fifth since the global financial crisis of 2008, though by some measures, including unemployment, the picture looks less dire.The recession could embolden critics of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic policies, however. Mr. Abe gained office three years ago on a pledge to put Japan on a new and more robust growth path. So far, his \u201cAbenomics\u201d program, centered on aggressive stimulus by the central bank, has lifted the stock market, lowered the yen\u2019s exchange rate \u2014 a boon for multinational companies like Toyota that earn a lot of revenue outside Japan \u2014 and helped curb persistent consumer-price deflation. But it has struggled to approach its ambitious goals for lifting incomes, spending and investment.Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, or Keidanren, the country\u2019s most influential corporate lobby group, called for further official measures to support the economy. Mr. Abe\u2019s government is working on a possible new spending package, according to Japanese media reports, which is expected to be worth about 3.5 trillion yen, or $29 billion.\u201cTwo straight quarters of decline needs to be taken seriously,\u201d Mr. Sakakibara told reporters. \u201cThe biggest issue is policies to lift growth. We need some kind of stimulus measures.\u201d The economics minister, Akira Amari, described the latest downturn as a temporary dip that belied broadly improving fundamentals. \u201cWeakness is apparent in some areas, but corporate profits are at record highs and the employment and wage environment is improving,\u201d he said in a statement after the economic report\u2019s release. \u201cThe gentle recovery in the economy is continuing.\u201dThe fall in output in the third quarter followed a similar decline in the second, which the government now estimates at 0.7 percent. Since Mr. Abe took office at the end of 2012, the economy has experienced six quarters of growth and five quarters of decline.The latest bout of weakness could add to pressure on the central bank to expand its stimulus efforts, which involve injecting trillions of yen into financial markets each month by buying up government debt. The idea is to keep borrowing costs low and encourage households and businesses to spend.The bank chose to keep its monetary policy unchanged at its last meeting on Oct. 30, defying the predictions of some private-sector economists who had been expecting new measures, such as an increase in the pace of its bond buying.

{"Headline": "In Presidential Campaign, It\u2019s Now Terrorism, Not Taxes", "Date": "2015-11-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Bernie Sanders dispensed with the threat from the Islamic State in two sentences at the start of the Democratic debate before abruptly pivoting to the dangers of a \u201crigged economy.\u201d Ben Carson struggled to answer a simple question on Sunday about how he would form a coalition to fight the militant group. And Marco Rubio, after pushing out a new video about the \u201cclash of civilizations,\u201d revamped his plans for an important Monday appearance before a group of executives on the assumption that terrorism, not tax rates, would be their most pressing concern.Until now, the campaign, when it did not descend into insult comedy on Twitter or become mired in biographical disputes, was focused on a subtler sort of threat to the country\u2019s way of life: economic and racial inequality, for Democrats, and a less-defined fury about a loss of America\u2019s identity, for Republicans. But the bloodshed in the heart of Paris posed concrete questions about how the contenders would respond to an urgent and seemingly metastasizing threat.\u201cI think this incident in Paris will break down some of the false sense of separation from the experience the rest of the world is having with terrorism,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. He predicted that the campaign would \u201cbegin to focus as much on national security and foreign affairs as domestic matters and economic security.\u201dOr, as Tom Ridge, a former secretary of Homeland Security, put it: \u201cThe barbarians are no longer at the gate. They\u2019re inside.\u201dLess than three months before the Iowa caucuses, the attack may prompt some Democrats who have had misgivings about Hillary Rodham Clinton to come to terms with her given the potential for a general election overshadowed by terrorism. Republicans, whose primary is far more volatile, may now ask whether candidates like Mr. Carson, who claimed at one point that China was becoming involved in Syria, and Donald J. Trump, who suggested the battle against the Islamic State could be left to Russia, are wise choices in a world where Western capitals can be made into killing fields.\u201cVoters are very dubious about our ability to remake the world, but they\u2019re very serious about us defending ourselves,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. \u201cThey have a very low tolerance for being frightened.\u201dMuch is not known about the attack\u2019s impact on the race, given short attention spans in politics and the news media and the fact that it did not occur on American soil \u2014 though it could affect the discussion of issues like the balance between intelligence-gathering and civil liberties or the closing of the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.What is almost certain is that the demands on the candidates will grow more exacting. As previous presidential campaigns jarred by outside events have demonstrated, how a candidate responds can be as important to a campaign as the event itself.There have already been telling responses that could resound as the threat of terrorism becomes more central to the campaign. Mr. Sanders\u2019s cursory treatment of the attack and the larger challenge of terrorism at the start of the debate on Saturday seemed to fall short, particularly after Mrs. Clinton followed him by speaking at length about the assault and confronting the threat of terror.And while Mr. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, has struggled with policy before, his inability to answer a straightforward question three times on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d about whom he would first call to put together a military alliance to confront the Islamic State appeared more consequential than it might have before Paris.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Mrs. Clinton was already tightening her grip on the Democratic race before the attacks. But for Republicans, the bloodshed seemed more likely to shift the direction of the campaign. What is unclear is in which direction.As the shock of the Friday attacks wore off, many of the hard-liners in the Republican field were moving to focus on blocking Syrian refugees from coming to America. \u201cTo bring them here under these circumstances is a suspension of intellect,\u201d Mr. Carson declared Sunday.The day before, at a rally in Beaumont, Tex., Mr. Trump was just as blunt, claiming without any evidence that President Obama wanted to take in 250,000 Syrian refugees. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be insane,\u201d he said. And Mike Huckabee called for denying entry to travelers from countries with a \u201cstrong presence\u201d of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda.Other Republicans expressed cautious optimism over the weekend that the Paris attack would snap voters out of a dalliance with contenders who display little familiarity with the military or the intelligence community, let alone with the intricacies of the geopolitical landscape on which the Islamic State is being pursued.\u201cI think that when you look at the dimensions of this tragedy, most Republican voters will not be satisfied with \u2018We\u2019ll bomb the S out of them,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Senator John McCain of Arizona, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s more pungent vow last week.Mr. Ridge said: \u201cBombast doesn\u2019t cut it. Inexperience doesn\u2019t cut it. Those who have a record of governance and demonstrated leadership capabilities \u2014 their stock is going to rise.\u201dCandidates who fit that profile have wasted little time since the attacks articulating their vision for confronting terrorism and jockeying to see who can demonstrate the most resolve.Mr. Rubio, the Florida senator, anticipated that a question-and-answer session with business leaders in Washington on Monday would focus on how to eradicate terrorism. Jeb Bush was recasting an address about rebuilding the military, to be delivered Wednesday at the Citadel in South Carolina, to expand on his argument for America leading the campaign against the Islamic State. And aides to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former federal prosecutor, and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who had a long career in Congress, said their stump speeches, already replete with references to their national security experience, would focus even more heavily on the subject. \u201cIt does give an advantage to serious candidates,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cBecause this is an opportunity for them to emphasize their experience and give the kinds of speeches and explanations of this threat that will prompt people to say, \u2018Hey, they know what they\u2019re talking about.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThere are risks, though. After the capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Howard Dean, then the Democratic front-runner, sought to portray himself as a more serious candidate by delivering an expansive foreign policy speech. But he inserted a line claiming that Hussein\u2019s capture had \u201cnot made America safer,\u201d which only reinforced doubts about Mr. Dean.Yet the question looming over the Republican race is whether such traditional rules of politics still apply. Further, the scale of the assault, its direct link to the Islamic State and the fact that one of the attackers appeared to have been a Syrian refugee who came to Europe through Greece is also pushing the Republican candidates to speak more loudly about keeping Middle Eastern migrants out of the United States. Should the reaction to Paris become conflated with matters of migration, it could empower those candidates willing to raise the rhetorical stakes and appeal to voters who are as concerned about immigration as they are terrorism.\u201cIf in fact it becomes more clear that a critical aspect was a refugee problem, and the issue blends, that could play into somebody like Trump\u2019s hands,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a Democratic pollster. \u201cBecause then it gets to a larger narrative that the West has to shut down its borders \u2014 and then you\u2019re playing with fire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pakistan Nuclear Nightmare", "Date": "2015-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWith as many as 120 warheads, Pakistan could in a decade become the world\u2019s third-ranked nuclear power, behind the United States and Russia, but ahead of China, France and Britain. Its arsenal is growing faster than any other country\u2019s, and it has become even more lethal in recent years with the addition of small tactical nuclear weapons that can hit India and longer-range nuclear missiles that can reach farther.What\u2019s new about the administration\u2019s approach is that instead of treating the situation as essentially hopeless, it is now casting about for the elements of a possible deal in which each side would get something it wants. For the West, that means restraint by Pakistan and greater compliance with international rules for halting the spread of nuclear technology. For Pakistan, that means some acceptance in the family of nuclear powers and access to technology.American officials say they are not offering Pakistan an India-like deal, which would face stiff opposition in Congress, but are discussing what Pakistan needs to do to justify American support for its membership in the 48-nation Nuclear Supplier Group, which governs trade in nuclear fuel and technology.As a first step, one American official said, Pakistan would have to stop pursuing tactical nuclear weapons, which are more likely to be used in a conflict with India and could more easily fall into the hands of terrorists, and halt development of long-range missiles. Pakistan should also sign the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Myanmar Generals Set the Stage for Their Own Exit", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews Analysis\u201cI\u2019ve worked for the government for 25 years, and nothing has changed,\u201d said Daw Myint Myint Than, a civil servant in the Ministry of Labor. \u201cI would have regretted it for the rest of my life if I didn\u2019t vote for Daw Suu.\u201dHer party\u2019s sweep was so thorough that one candidate who died before the vote still defeated his ruling-party rival.The official results are still being tabulated, but all signs so far point to that rarest of things: an authoritarian government peacefully giving up power after what outside election monitors have deemed a credible vote.Analysts and Myanmar\u2019s citizens are still coming to grips with the results. But the outcome appears to stem from the simple fact that veneration for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi was underestimated and the ruling party\u2019s strength overestimated.In the days before the elections, the ruling party organized large convoys of tractors to ride through the countryside. Thousands of farmers, wearing T-shirts given out by the party, chanted slogans and waved party flags. Wedding bands performed patriotic songs.But that show of support was misleading. Many of the farmers said they had taken part in the rallies because they were paid, but when it came time to stamp their ballots, they voted for the National League for Democracy.\u201cIt was easy money,\u201d said U Win Naing, 43, a farmer who was paid the equivalent of $12 to join the ruling party\u2019s campaign convoy. He never had any doubt whom he would vote for. \u201cI wanted freedom from the dictatorship,\u201d he said.The campaign rallies by the National League for Democracy, by contrast, were more organic. Shopkeepers donated food. Supporters drew up their own banners. Vast convoys paraded chaotically through towns in the countryside.The party\u2019s strategy was to contest nearly every constituency in the country, including in ethnic minority areas where it risked splitting the vote with smaller ethnic parties and allowing the ruling party a victory.But the plan appears to have paid off. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party far exceeded expectations in the upland minority areas and even defeated some ethnic parties.Across the nation, the party focused on the micro level, officials said. \u201cOur main instruction was to go door to door,\u201d said U Win Htein, a senior member of the National League for Democracy.The party reminded voters of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s lineage by holding celebrations in July for the 100th birth anniversary of her father, U Aung San.\u201cA big factor was the freedoms that have existed since 2011 \u2014 in terms of the press, the Internet, the relaxing of censorship, the ability to hold demonstrations,\u201d said David Steinberg, an expert on Myanmar at Georgetown University. The government \u201callowed campaigning to have a lot more freedom than in the past,\u201d he said.Mr. Thein Sein was not unpopular. Seventy-two percent of people surveyed in October by the Merdeka Center, a polling agency based in Malaysia, said they approved of the way he was administering the country.\u201cThe majority of Myanmar citizens appreciate Thein Sein for the reforms he tried to bring, and opening up the country,\u201d said Tan Seng Keat, the research manager at Merdeka. \u201cBut this alone cannot address their fervent desire to have a government chosen by the people and to put an end to an indirect rule by the military.\u201dVoters blamed the ruling party for 50 years of military control and for a poor economy.\u201cThey seemed to have the sentiment that the current leaders have been governing for 50 years,\u201d said U Khin Maung Htoo, a candidate for the ruling party in Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city.The government has courted foreign investment, but the countryside, to a large extent, remains just as impoverished as it was when the current government came to power five years ago. Many farmers in Myanmar still use oxen to plow their fields.The combination of freedom of expression and poverty proved toxic for the government.\u201cMost of the poorer people, their lives have not improved over the past five years,\u201d said U Yan Myo Thein, a political commentator. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t want the same government, and they need immediate change. That\u2019s the big message of the vote.\u201dSome analysts pointed out that not only had the military allowed the vote, but the generals had been the ones to set it in motion.\u201cThey knew they needed to change the political system,\u201d said Priscilla A. Clapp, former chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Myanmar. \u201cThis transition has been carefully managed.\u201dThe military leaders saw the country falling behind its neighbors economically and set out a political road map to democracy, and they appeared to have stuck to it, she said. Observers from Europe, Japan and the United States said they were satisfied with the handling of the elections.\u201cYou have to give these guys some credit for what\u2019s happened,\u201d Ms. Clapp said of the military leaders. \u201cThey put it in place.\u201dThe biggest factor in the landslide, analysts and voters agreed, was the star power of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has an emotional, almost religious, connection with voters.But when voters are pressed on why they love her, especially in the countryside, they often have blank stares. The National League for Democracy issued a platform, but very few voters seemed aware of it.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about her,\u201d said U Saw Yan Naing, 28, a farmer who lives outside Naypyidaw. \u201cI voted for her because she is the daughter of Aung San.\u201dHistory moves slowly here, and official results from the vote continue to dribble out. As of Thursday evening, the opposition had won 327 seats of the 491 contested in the elections. The ruling party had won 40.That could still happen, of course, but so far, the military has said the right things.On Wednesday, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of the armed forces, congratulated the opposition for \u201cgetting a majority of seats\u201d in Parliament.

{"Headline": "Jon Meacham\u2019s \u2018Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.George H. W. Bush is unusual among modern American presidents in that after he left the White House in 1993 he never produced his own full-scale autobiography. True, he co-wrote a book about his administration\u2019s foreign policy with Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, and then allowed a collection of his letters and diary excerpts to be published. But he showed no interest in writing the kind of doorstopper others have given us, nothing on the order of \u201cRN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon,\u201d \u201cRonald Reagan: An American Life\u201d or Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cMy Life.\u201d Even Hillary Clinton, who may yet be president and thus get her own chance to add to the genre, has already written two thick memoirs, either of which, if you accidentally dropped it on your foot, might leave you limping.It is a measure of Bush\u2019s shrewdness that he cooperated so extensively with Jon Meacham on \u201cDestiny and Power,\u201d allowing his biographer not just access to his diaries and family members but sitting for a series of interviews from 2006 to 2015. Meacham \u2014 an executive editor at Random House, a former editor of Newsweek and the author of \u201cAmerican Lion,\u201d a well-told account of Andrew Jackson\u2019s presidency that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2009 \u2014 amply rewards his subject\u2019s trust by producing a deeply empathetic, often moving book about the former president and what Bush calls the L-word, his legacy.How does the reader fare in this affectionate transaction between president and biographer? Surprisingly well, since Meacham\u2019s access and lack of ideological fervor allow him to paint Bush the man in unusually subtle colors. Bush, called \u201c41\u201d by friends to distinguish him from his son, the 43rd president, emerges from this book as more ambitious, more anxious and far more emotional than commonly perceived. He could easily give former House Speaker John Boehner a run for his money in the Kleenex sweepstakes.Bush, who is now 91, also comes across as an acute and often witty observer of other people\u2019s quirks; his anecdotes of touring Asia with Bill Clinton may be the most hilarious description of 42\u2019s charm and egotism (\u201cHe talks all the time,\u2019\u2019 Bush 41 notes. \u201cHe\u2019s just shameless\u201d) I have ever read. And thanks to Meacham\u2019s adroit questioning, Bush drops his customary refusal to second-guess his son\u2019s administration and offers a devastating critique of Vice President Dick Cheney, an analysis that carries special weight since Bush himself served in that office during the Reagan years.Raised in privilege, Bush is known to be allergic to introspection, and try as he might, Meacham unearths no \u201cRosebud\u201d moment that illuminates what propelled Bush throughout his career. Perhaps it really is as simple as what Bush, in his telegraphic style, tells Meacham: \u201cMy motivation\u2019s always been goal .\u2008.\u2008. you know, to be captain.\u201d Pressed further, Bush is not exactly expansive: \u201cWhatever you\u2019re in. Be No. 1.\u201d Bush\u2019s father, Prescott, served as United States senator from Connecticut, but Bush did not inherit the political bug so much as the itch, as Meacham puts it, \u201cto serve, to make his mark, to be in the game.\u201d Despite his self-effacing style, Bush never doubted he was the best man for a job, whether it was as president of a Texas oil company, a twice-elected congressman (and failed Senate candidate) or in r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building positions under Nixon and Gerald Ford: United States ambassador to the United Nations, America\u2019s envoy to China and head of the Central Intelligence Agency.Meacham\u2019s admiration leads him to glide quickly over some of Bush\u2019s more controversial decisions, like his nomination of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. Meacham is toughest on Bush for insisting in 1987 that he had been \u201cnot in the loop\u201d on the Reagan administration\u2019s arms-for-hostages deal, a lie that clearly appalls the author. But even then Meacham writes more in sorrow than anger, describing the incident as \u201cunworthy of his essential character.\u201dThis sympathetic approach allows Meacham to draw out Bush on the most emotional moments of his life and tell them with dramatic verve. In 1944, when he was 20, during one of the dozens of bombing missions Bush flew as a naval aviator, his plane was hit and Bush ordered his two fellow crewmen to \u201chit the silk!\u201d After hours of bobbing about on a life raft in the Pacific, Bush was rescued by a submarine, but the other crewmen were never found. Decades later Bush teared up as he told Meacham, \u201cI wondered \u2014 wonder still \u2014 whether I did all I could.\u201dThe worst tragedy of Bush\u2019s life was the death from leukemia at age 3 of his daughter, Robin, his second child. Neither George nor his wife, Barbara, had even heard of leukemia when their doctor in Midland, Tex., gave them the news, and what followed was months of painful treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York. George W. was 6 and Jeb less than 1, and they stayed at home in Texas with their father while Barbara remained in New York. Bush sobbed as he discussed Robin with Meacham, and admitted that the grief remained so deep that \u201cnormally I push it away, push it back.\u201dBush has never been accused of eloquence, and on two occasions when he did utter memorable phrases, they backfired. The colorful description of Reagan\u2019s tax proposals as \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d during the 1980 Republican primary campaign nearly wrecked his chances of becoming Reagan\u2019s running mate that year. His pledge at the 1988 Republican convention, \u201cRead my lips: No new \u00adtaxes,\u201d may have helped him into the White House, but when the threat of a government shutdown two years later forced him to backtrack, the reversal cost him dearly.Yet one time his choice of words set the course for the singular achievement of his presidency, and it was unscripted. After Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait in August 1990, the administration and its allies were at a loss on how to react. Options were still being bandied about when Bush, arriving from Camp David on a Sunday afternoon and frustrated by the diplomatic shilly-shallying, announced to reporters: \u201cThis will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.\u201d Such an adamant statement shocked even his closest advisers. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that \u2018This will not stand\u2019?\u201d Scowcroft asked. \u201cThat\u2019s mine,\u201d Bush replied. \u201cThat\u2019s what I feel.\u201dThis was Bush at his best: decisive, in charge, imbued with a mission. Can you be a born leader but not an effective president? That is the central question of the one-term Bush presidency, and Meacham tiptoes around a definitive answer. The flagging economy did not interest Bush as much as foreign policy did, and his hatred for campaigning to win a second term culminated in a disastrous \u00adpresidential-debate performance against Clinton and Ross Perot, in which he stumbled over answers and looked at his watch. Meacham makes a persuasive case that Bush\u2019s persistent health problems (his thyroid medication for Graves\u2019 disease needed constant adjustment, and he had bouts of atrial fibrillation) contributed to his defeat, sapping his energy on the trail and making him snappish and cranky.Bush took the loss hard, awash with those lifelong fears of letting down people who depended on him and of leaving a mission unaccomplished. \u201cGod, it was ghastly,\u201d he told Meacham. \u201cYour whole life is based on trying to accomplish stuff, and losing hurts.\u201d But what also stung was who he lost to: a man he considered a \u201cdraft dodger\u201d for avoiding service during the Vietnam War, an observation Meacham is too polite to say would dog Bush\u2019s own son. So much for \u201cduty, honor, country,\u201d Bush wrote in his diary.History has a way of making what happens look predictable in hindsight, but given Bush\u2019s decisive drubbing by Clinton in 1992, it remains remarkable that eight years later George H. W. Bush would become, as Meacham puts it, \u201cthe only president since John Adams to see his son also win the ultimate prize in American politics.\u201d Nearly all of Bush the elder\u2019s friends thought the more studious Jeb had a better shot at the Oval Office than George W.; even James A. Baker, the secretary of state, had once jokingly described the older son as a \u201cjuvenile delinquent, damn near.\u201dMeacham interviewed both father and sons about the perception, and George W. is the most forthright, acknowledging he was a \u201ccutup\u201d and \u201cirreverent,\u201d uninterested in putting down roots. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different from Jeb, who falls in love early and gets married in college and has babies early. He\u2019s just a different kind of person.\u201d His father is more succinct, using a barnyard epithet to dismiss \u201cthe whole idea that Jeb was the favorite one because he was more knowledgeable. .\u2008.\u2008. I thought Jeb had a better chance to win than George.\u201d The 1994 gubernatorial elections in Texas and Florida settled the question, at least around the Bush dining room table: George W. won, surprisingly, and Jeb, just as surprisingly, lost. (Jeb would prevail in 1998 and serve eight years. Stay tuned to see if George H. W. Bush outdoes Adams on the offspring-in-the-Oval-Office front.)Bush 43\u2019s two-term presidency is the subject for a different book, but Meacham deftly sketches what the son learned from his father\u2019s tenure, which included maintaining his conservative and religious base and above all projecting a vision. Meacham explores in depth how some of these lessons shaped Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, including how much he consulted his dad (more than he admitted, Meacham implies) and that contrary to some reports there was no daylight between the two men on the decision to oust Saddam Hussein militarily.Where Meacham breaks new and startling ground is reporting how needlessly harsh Bush 41 thought the rhetoric was, including Bush 43\u2019s characterization in 2002 of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an \u201caxis of evil.\u201d And for that tone Bush 41 largely blames Dick Cheney, defense secretary during his own administration and a man Bush 41 believed had grown more hawkish over time, perhaps because of the influence of his wife, Lynne, who, Bush 41 speculates, is \u201ca lot of the \u00e9minence grise here \u2014 iron-ass, tough as nails, driving.\u201dCheney \u201chad his own empire there and marched to his own drummer,\u201d Bush says. \u201cThe big mistake that was made was letting Cheney bring in kind of his own state department. I think they overdid that. But it\u2019s not Cheney\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the president\u2019s fault.\u201dMeacham shows a transcript of these remarks first to Cheney and then to Bush 43. \u201cA small smile\u201d crossed Cheney\u2019s face as he read them. \u201cFascinating,\u201d he said. He acknowledged that he did become more hard-line after 9/11, and insisted that the way he structured the office of the vice presidency, so unlike the way Bush did under Reagan, was because Bush 43 wanted it like that. \u201cW. is the one who made the decisions. To the extent I was a consequential vice president is because that\u2019s what he wanted.\u201dBush 43 seems more taken aback by the comments than Cheney, insisting that his father \u201cwould never say to me, \u2018Hey, you need to rein in Cheney. He\u2019s ruining your administration.\u2019 It would be out of character for him to do that.\u201d It is hard to tell how stung Bush 43 is by these remarks, since he quickly adds that \u201cin any event, I disagree with his characterization.\u201d Yet Meacham wisely points out that by the second term Bush had clipped Cheney\u2019s wings and become less bellicose. \u201cThough they never spoke of it, then, Bush 41 and Bush 43 may have been more in sync all along than even they knew.\u201d\u201cDestiny and Power\u201d reflects the qualities of both subject and biographer: judicious, balanced, deliberative, with a deep appreciation of history and the personalities who shape it. If Meacham is sometimes polite to a fault, \u201cDestiny and Power\u201d does not suffer for it. His kinder, gentler approach succeeds in making George H. W. Bush a more sympathetic \u2014 and more complex \u2014 figure than if the former president had written his own doorstopper after all.DESTINY AND POWER: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker BushBy Jon MeachamIllustrated. 836 pp. Random House. $35.A review last Sunday about \u201cDestiny and Power,\u201d Jon Meacham\u2019s biography of George H.

Seven \u201cbarons\u201d control the country, employing warriors called \u201cclippers\u201d to protect them from the other barons and from marauding bands of \u201cnomads.\u201d The show\u2019s hero, Sunny (Daniel Wu), is a clipper for a baron named Quinn (Marton Csokas) but is disillusioned after years of service and more than 400 kills. He dreams of escaping to a mythical city outside the Badlands, and an encounter in the pilot with a supernaturally gifted boy may open the door.What becomes lost in that conversation is that Mr. Carradine was a charismatic actor, whether or not his ethnicity lined up with his character. Mr. Wu, an American actor who has worked mostly in Hong Kong, is likable and projects a wry, self-effacing intelligence, especially in the infrequent moments when the script inches toward humor. He\u2019s not very expressive, though \u2014 he moves between troubled and puzzled, without many stops in between. (He\u2019s fine in the elaborate and brutal fight scenes, which are the high points of the show, though the camerawork and editing leave it a little too clear when a double is subbing for him in the more taxing sequences.)It\u2019s a common problem of post-apocalyptic, scorched-earth series that no one seems quite as fierce or deadly as you would expect them to be. One exception in \u201cInto the Badlands\u201d is the teenage Tilda (Ally Ioannides), a baron\u2019s daughter with a talent for climbing on top of men and snapping their necks.

Women drawn to the thrilling collision of cultural, intellectual and literary mondes here may aspire to dress like Jackie O. in her editor incarnation, striding down Fifth Avenue in a black turtleneck and a heavy wool YSL coat \u2014 even if they wound up working in marketing.The woolen mittens memorialized by Oscar Hammerstein may be languishing on store shelves, but \u201cwe sold over 80 units of Dior sunglasses alone in October,\u201d said Elizabeth von der Goltz, a senior vice president and general merchandise manager at Bergdorf Goodman. She herself bought a heavy Burberry cape and hasn\u2019t had call to bust it out since Paris Fashion Week in September.Although Ms. von der Goltz still sees those traditional \u201cupper tier\u201d department store customers who buy their full fall wardrobes in May, and the second tier of wealthy but busy professionals who do a one-stop for their full fall in September, she said there had been a major shift to \u201ca buy now, wear now\u201d model with \u201cspecial\u201d replacing \u201cseasonal.\u201dWhile business for big coats \u201cor any other heavy fabrics in your basic ready-to-wear kicks in later now,\u201d Ms. von der Goltz said, \u201cif it\u2019s something special that people think maybe isn\u2019t going to be there later in the season, we do sell those well early.\u201d This year, an Acne shearling jacket, which shipped in June, and a Yves Salomon army coat with fur inside it, both qualified.Beth Buccini, an owner of the 16-year-old SoHo boutique Kirna Zab\u00eate, preordered a different version of the hot (as in temperature) hot (as in trendy) fur-lined parka, by Mr. and Mrs. Italy, back in May. \u201cI\u2019m like a psycho next-level planner because I see everything first and I know what I like,\u201d she said. But has she gotten to wear it yet?\u201cNot one chance,\u201d Ms. Buccini said. \u201cNot one!\u201dInstead, her YSL moto jacket, which she thought wouldn\u2019t get her past Paris Fashion Week, has been trotted out for going on two months.\u201cI laughed because when I came to work this morning, out of five of us who were standing there, four of us were wearing leather moto jackets,\u201d Ms. Buccini said, \u201cand it seemed preposterous that in the middle of November we\u2019re still able to get away with wearing just a little leather jacket, but in this time of global warming, it seems that\u2019s that the new reality.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny, but resort is actually a huge sweater time because it\u2019s freezing when that ships,\u201d Ms. von der Goltz said, referring to one of the industry\u2019s confusing sales periods. \u201cKnitwear and coats are really important in the resort delivery as well, and then, you know, prefall you want to have lighter weight, because that\u2019s in in spring and high summer.\u201dBuyers say that these \u201cprecollections\u201d \u2014 formerly done by only a few labels and now widely embraced \u2014 have become synonymous with \u201cseasonless,\u201d relied upon more and more to keep revenues up as weather-driven shopping becomes increasingly unpredictable and customers, encouraged by the 24/7 Internet, seek more instant-gratification purchases.With some items, retailers are attempting a mental shift from fall to \u201cfall.\u201d\u201cCustomers want to know they\u2019re getting something new and it\u2019s the new season and it has maybe the feel of fall, but it has to be a weight that they can wear right away,\u201d Ms. von der Goltz said. Sleeveless vests, for instance, \u201clook like fall but aren\u2019t really going to keep you warm.\u201dWe can ascribe the faddishness of one \u201cfall\u201d favorite, the toeless boot, to the Givenchy designer, Riccardo Tisci, and his muse and Instagramanuensis, Kim Kardashian \u2014 but we must give reluctant credit to global warming for making this functionally oxymoronic invention look positively pragmatic.Gucci\u2019s kangaroo-fur-lined mule loafer, both air-conditioned and evocative of the hearthside at once, may be the ultimate symbol of the new \u201cfall.\u201d It will be in stores again in March, which may or may not be spring. (Last year, it took even longer to come than fall has this year.)Meanwhile, Chlo\u00e9\u2019s coveted lace-up Harper boot ($1,525 at Mona Moore in the Venice section of Los Angeles for the knee-high version) is roughly one-third ribbon. These corsetlike calf encasers allow the wearer to effect the look of buttoned up Edwardian \u201cfallishness\u201d while holes between the grosgrain keep feet cool. If the temperature drops, just add socks.But when? \u201cThe first \u2018tights day\u2019 used to be the first day of fall,\u201d Ms. Kriseman said wistfully, \u201cbut there\u2019ve been almost none this fall.\u201dOn a recent eerily warm evening at the new Dos Toros outpost in Downtown Brooklyn, many of the female patrons had slipped their bare feet into scalloped flats (a style also popularized by Chlo\u00e9) or low-top sneakers that left ankles exposed. Top halves and bottom halves were fighting a pushmi-pullyu war, with activewear fleeces juxtaposed awkwardly with dress shoes, and summery cheeseclothlike cotton scarves challenging the highly promoted Stuart Weitzman wintry thigh-high suede boots.Eventually, a woman in a seasonally familiar khaki parka and midcalf, sturdy fashion/hiking boot hybrids came in, but when she took off her coat, her sheer white summer T-shirt was almost translucent.Dos Toros is modeled after Gordo Taqueria in the Bay Area, and though the burritos can\u2019t compare, the clientele, unnervingly, suddenly can.\u201cI just think that everyone\u2019s become an expert in how to dress in layers,\u201d Ms. Buccini said.But layering successfully is a challenging art that requires much more thought and sartorial sophistication to get right, whereas a camel coat with complementary gloves, hat and scarf offers relatively straightforward \u00e9lan. Good fences make good neighbors, and distinct seasons make good dressers.Residents of the Bay Area and Pacific Northwest, those leaders of the new economy, could be forgiven for never quite nailing it in the style department precisely because of their tricky layering challenges. In those places, the weather is unchanging over days, but each particular day can swing between sun-baked and bone-chilling. People dress less to achieve an overall look and more to have a ready arsenal of temperature regulators.Alice Roi, an independent designer in New York who took some time off from the frenzied fashion cycle, acknowledged the Californification of local climes \u2014 \u201cI was just on the phone to my husband in L.A., and he was basically wearing the same thing I was,\u201d she said \u2014 while still seeing exciting styling possibilities in what she calls \u201cuniversal\u201d weather.\u201cI think there\u2019s a New England feeling that\u2019s probably lost, and that is sad,\u201d Ms. Roi said. \u201cI remember getting the L. L. Bean catalog and being, like, which sweater should I get? Which flannel shirt? And that mood is definitely lost, or you could say it\u2019s morphed.\u201dMs. Roi has adjusted to the new market demands by selling T-shirts and seasonless staples with a twist.\u201cYou can still wear a fisherman sweater, but you\u2019re probably going to wear it with shorts and no jacket,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a new world out there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Creditors Withhold 2 Billion Euro Bailout Payment From Greece", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greece\u2019s international bailout program has hit snags, delaying release of the next payout of rescue money.Despite a weekend of negotiations by telephone, Greek officials and the country\u2019s foreign creditors remained at odds. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, eurozone finance ministers debated whether Athens had met the first set of conditions to unlock the next installment of the bailout of 86 billion euros (about $92 billion).The ministers decided to delay the release of the payout, a sum of \u20ac2 billion, but indicated it might be dispensed soon.Greece is not as desperate for money as it was last summer when the bailout package was negotiated and it received an initial allotment of \u20ac13 billion. But the country is eager to secure the new tranche so that it can start addressing domestic problems and ensure that state coffers do not start running low again.More crucial is that each delay could have a cascading effect, throwing off the schedule for future steps \u2014 including talks on giving Greece some relief from its debt burden, which is expected to exceed 180 percent of gross domestic product this year. Also hanging in the balance is the release of \u20ac10 billion in bailout money that has been set aside to replenish Greece\u2019s cash-starved banks.\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic, we\u2019ve come closer on several issues, but we\u2019re still committed to protecting primary residences,\u201d one official said, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.The Greek economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, who participated in the marathon of negotiations over the weekend, told Greek radio on Monday that Athens was seeking a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to ensure that thousands of Greeks did not lose their homes.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Greek homeowners who are having trouble making loan payments are among the problems plaguing the country\u2019s banks. But Mr. Tsipras argued that protecting Greek families from losing their homes was necessary to ensuring social cohesion in his country, according to a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office.The French finance minister, Michel Sapin, said on Monday that Greece should be given some room to maneuver on the foreclosure issue. \u201cGreece is making considerable efforts,\u201d Mr. Sapin said before the meeting.Resistance to continued austerity in Greece is growing. Farmers, seamen and pharmacists are among those who have staged protests in recent weeks. On Thursday, thousands of Greeks are expected to walk off the job, disrupting public services and transportation, in a general strike.The 24-hour walkout would be the first general strike under the government of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza party, which came to power in January on a promise to fight austerity and was re-elected in September on a pledge to enforce the country\u2019s third international bailout while trying to soften its harsher aspects.Mr. Tsipras and the other European leaders on Sunday also discussed the region\u2019s refugee crisis, which Greece is struggling to contain because of its position at the front line of the influx. Greek officials have suggested in recent weeks that creditors should ease austerity demands as the government grapples with the refugee problem.An earlier version of this article erroneously attributed a distinction to the \u20ac2 billion payout that Greece is seeking from its new bailout program. The disbursement would be the first to be used exclusively to address domestic problems, not the first disbursement from the program.

{"Headline": "In Rebuke to Kirchner, Argentines Elect Opposition Leader Mauricio Macri as President", "Date": "2015-11-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentine voters handed a victory to Mauricio Macri in the country\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, delivering a mandate to an opposition political figure seeking to roll back some of the protectionist economic measures of the departing president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.With votes from 99 percent of polling places counted, Mr. Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires and a former president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina\u2019s most popular soccer teams, was leading with 51.4 percent of the vote, according to election officials, against 48.5 percent for Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer and vice president under former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who died in 2010. Mr. Scioli conceded defeat on national television on Sunday night. Running a largely nonconfrontational campaign in a society that has grown increasingly polarized under Mrs. Kirchner, who succeeded her husband in 2007, Mr. Macri, 56, stunned the political establishment in October by forcing the race into a runoff and maintaining his surge in recent weeks. He ran to the right of his rivals, blending plans to overhaul the economy and promote the tolerance of various points of view on social issues.Mr. Macri\u2019s relatively narrow victory revealed deep fissures in Argentina after 12 years of governance by Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, with many voters expressing concern over the direction of the economy and frustration with Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s blistering attacks on critics in the news media, business establishments and rival political parties.\u201cCristina divided the country and destroyed it morally,\u201d said Dimitri Javakhishvili, 67, an immigrant from Georgia who works as a doorman at a building here in the neighborhood of Recoleta. Mr. Javakhishvili acknowledged that Mr. Macri could face challenges in trying to govern when Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political movement moves into the opposition.Still, Mr. Javakhishvili said, \u201cAt least he\u2019s something new; he\u2019s something fresh.\u201dNot everyone here shares such views. Graffiti and posters have appeared across Buenos Aires demonizing Mr. Macri, outnumbering on many streets the campaign posters expressing support for Mr. Scioli, who balanced lukewarm support from Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s loyal followers with claims that social spending could be sustained despite galloping inflation and declining private investment.One example of anti-Macri sentiment, alluding to fears that he will govern for a privileged few, simply says \u201cMacrisis.\u201dIn addition to grappling with inflation and currency controls aimed at curbing capital flight, Mr. Macri will now face the challenge of governing with much of his opposition under the sway of Peronism, the ideologically diverse political grouping that has dominated Argentine politics for decades.Yet while Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s leftist faction has emerged as a dominant group within Peronism, with the president herself signaling that she planned to remain politically active after stepping down in December, Mr. Macri\u2019s margin of victory will help him in the months ahead, analysts said.\u201cHe will be able to start to work with authority,\u201d said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm. But he added that Mr. Scioli\u2019s performance still demonstrated the underlying strength of the Peronist political movement. \u201cIt\u2019s not a devastating margin of difference,\u201d Mr. D\u00edaz said. \u201cWith a fatigued government and an erratic campaign, it\u2019s a good performance. They are far from dead.\u201dMany political analysts in Argentina doubted that Mr. Macri would make it this far, with skepticism abounding when he began assembling his movement to the right of many rivals more than a decade ago.He ventured into a part of Argentina\u2019s political spectrum that had previously been associated with conservative Peronists or disgraced figures in the military establishment.But over time, he honed his negotiating skills as the mayor of Buenos Aires, while insisting during this year\u2019s campaign that he did not plan to roll back popular social programs introduced during the Kirchners\u2019 presidencies, like cash subsidies for poor families and \u201cSoccer for Everybody,\u201d a government initiative that covers soccer broadcasting fees so people can watch matches free.Mr. Macri seemed to gain the upper hand after mounting a door-to-door campaign that helped his supporters win important provincial and local races in October, including the prized post of the governor of Buenos Aires Province, now held by Mr. Scioli but won by Mar\u00eda Eugenia Vidal, a top adviser to Mr. Macri and deputy mayor who focused largely on antipoverty programs in the municipal government.Many voters have also expressed fatigue with Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s governing style and reports of corruption among her prominent supporters.Signaling that she may not plan to remain subdued after leaving office, Mrs. Kirchner issued a torrent of messages on Twitter on Sunday celebrating her foreign and domestic policies. One message even seemed like a warning to Mr. Macri, who has vowed to improve Argentina\u2019s strained ties with the United States and review a contentious deal with China to build a nuclear reactor.\u201cThe person with the responsibility of leading the homeland should know the right place of the Argentine republic in a multipolar world,\u201d Mrs. Kirchner wrote.Some voters, however, said that their fears over the threats to the government\u2019s antipoverty programs outweighed criticism of the Kirchners or concerns that Mr. Scioli, viewed as friendlier to the business establishment, was not as radical as they had hoped.\u201cI\u2019m voting for the lesser of two evils,\u201d said Teo Lev\u00edn, 25, a medical student who explained that he was voting for Mr. Scioli with gritted teeth. \u201cI understand that Scioli will adopt come conservative economic policies, but he won\u2019t destroy the political model. Macri will. He\u2019s the worst thing in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Talk of Taxes Leaves Much Unsaid", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican presidential candidates talked a lot about their tax plans at last week\u2019s debate, but most of the conversation was not very illuminating. Here are some details you may have missed about the candidates who did mention plans.The biggest tax in his plan is a 16 percent value added tax. Mr. Cruz describes this tax as a \u201cbusiness flat tax,\u201d but it\u2019s not a tax on business profits. Businesses would pay the tax on their total sales, minus the cost of the things they bought to produce the thing they sold. They would not be able to deduct wages, meaning they would pay the 16 percent tax on an amount far greater than their profits. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates this tax would generate $25 trillion in revenue over a decade, making it about six times bigger than the existing corporate income tax, which Mr. Cruz would repeal, and more than twice as big as his proposed personal income tax.Added up across the whole economy, Mr. Cruz\u2019s VAT would be equivalent to a very broadly based sales tax, applying even to services like health care that are ordinarily exempt from sales taxes. Like a sales tax, this tax would be built into prices and paid by consumers \u2014 and for many lower-income households, it would be a far greater burden than the income tax.Basically, the Cruz plan is a large VAT with a small income tax on top. His plan is very similar to Rand Paul\u2019s tax plan. Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Paul have chosen to identify their VATs as \u201cbusiness\u201d taxes, obscuring the fact that consumers would ultimately pay it. The main difference is that Mr. Paul leans a little more on income tax and Mr. Cruz leans a little more on the VAT.You might notice Mr. Rubio\u2019s comment was not directly responsive to Mr. Harwood\u2019s question: He asked about the difference between middle and high earners, not between low and high earners.The truth is that the Rubio plan offers the largest percentage increases in after-tax income to low earners, then the highest earners, with the smallest improvements for moderate earners \u2014 that is, both Mr. Rubio\u2019s answer and Mr. Harwood\u2019s question were correct.And this actually reflects a distinct feature of Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax plan: While all the Republican tax plans, including his, are generous to the highest earners, his plan is more focused on raising incomes for the poor and less on cutting taxes for the middle class.According to an analysis from the Tax Foundation (as developed with Senator Mike Lee and released in March),Mr. Rubio\u2019s plan would raise after-tax incomes for the bottom 10 percent of earners by a whopping 44.2 percent, mostly by expanding tax credits so their tax bills would be negative. (Remember, these people have low incomes, so the absolute amounts being discussed here are often small.)It would raise after-tax incomes for the highest 10 percent of earners by 5.5 percent, and the top 1 percent of earners by 11.2 percent. Families earning from 40 to 90 percent of the average would get smaller tax cuts, increasing their incomes by 1 to 3 percent.There is one caveat to all that generosity for low-income filers, though: Senator Rubio and Senator Lee have not yet hammered out precisely which low-income filers would qualify for their new, generous tax credits.\u201cOur offices would negotiate rules and requirements for eligibility of the refundable credit,\u201d said Brooke Sammon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign. \u201cRules would be tailored to ensure that our reforms would not create payments for new, nonworking filers.\u201dMr. Rubio\u2019s plan would greatly increase the budget deficit, unless offset by sharp federal government spending cuts that would have their own impacts on families\u2019 well-being. You\u2019d have to weigh those against the benefits of tax cuts.If these tax cuts were simply financed with government borrowing like the last round of Republican tax cuts, economists would generally expect that borrowing to slow economic growth, offsetting positive growth effects from the tax cuts themselves.Mr. Carson disclaimed that idea. \u201cWell, first of all, I didn\u2019t say that the rate would be 10 percent,\u201d he told Ms. Quick.Well, actually, he did. At the first Republican debate, he described the plan as follows: \u201cYou make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one.\u201d But anyway, Mr. Carson now doesn\u2019t think a 10 percent rate is workable, and said the rate would have to be closer to 15 percent.He argued: \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about an $18 trillion economy, you\u2019re talking about a 15 percent tax on your gross domestic product. You\u2019re talking about $2.7 trillion. We have a budget closer to $3.5 trillion. But if you also apply that same 15 percent to several other things, including corporate taxes, and including the capital gains taxes, you make that amount up pretty quickly.\u201dEssentially, he\u2019s saying, if the base is broad enough, a 15 percent tax will suffice. The main problem is his assumption that you can have a tax with a base equal to 100 percent of the economy.Some things are always tax-exempt, for a mixture of good reasons and bad. We don\u2019t tax investment income earned by nonprofits like churches and universities, nor do we tax investment returns to pension funds and 401(k) retirement accounts. We don\u2019t tax income that people give away to charity. We don\u2019t tax employee health benefits. Most tax plans decline to tax at least some income for low earners; Mr. Cruz said his flat tax wouldn\u2019t apply to the first $36,000 of income for a family of four.It would be possible to have a tax base that is broader than today\u2019s, but it\u2019s unlikely that Mr. Carson would succeed in getting it to 100 percent.Despite high projected budget deficits, Mr. Kasich says he can cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent from 39.6 percent, the top capital gains tax rate to 15 percent from 23.8 percent, and the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent \u2014 and still balance the budget in eight years.He\u2019s betting on a healthy economic expansion, too, but he didn\u2019t disclose his exact assumptions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Saudis Miss When They Focus on Iran", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 It doesn\u2019t take long in Saudi Arabia to see evidence of an obsession with Iran, the Shiite foil to this Sunni country. In recent conversations, government officials, analysts and members of the royal family were quick to describe how incensed they were that President Obama hadn\u2019t found a way to remove Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president and Iran\u2019s close ally, from power.That \u201cwas a moral and strategic failure by Obama,\u201d Asaad al-Shaman, of the Saudi Institute of Diplomatic Studies, told me in October.Iran, with tentacles in many regional conflicts, is a big challenge for Saudi Arabia. But Riyadh\u2019s single-minded focus is diverting attention from other pressing issues, some of which are much closer to home. The Sunni terrorists of the Islamic State pose the most direct threat. In the past year, the group\u2019s affiliates have claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in the country\u2019s Eastern Province, where a lot of the country\u2019s minority Shiites live. Many of the victims have been Shiites, fueling sectarian tensions.The government has done little to ease tensions. Reacting to the attacks, Shiites requested a law against what they described as racism. The Shura Council, an advisory body appointed by the king, refused to even allow it to be discussed.When it comes to fighting terrorism, Washington gives Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the country\u2019s second in command, high marks. But many Saudis have been unfairly swept up and cruelly punished. Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, for example, is facing execution for joining an anti-government protest in 2012 when he was 17.In another sign of domestic political discontent, there is unofficial talk in some circles of moving to a constitutional monarchy, and at least one proposal for a new political charter has been written. Unless citizens are given a role in governance, there is no way to properly address anybody\u2019s rights, one activist told me, stressing that the goal is \u201cnot revolution but evolution.\u201dSome young Saudis also speak of the need to reform Wahhabi Islam, which imposes suffocating rules, especially on women. But King Salman, 79, who succeeded King Abdullah last January, has put the brakes on political reforms.The royal family has not been able to stifle talk about its internal machinations, especially signs of a power struggle between Crown Prince Mohammed, 56, and his deputy, Mohammed bin Salman, the king\u2019s 30-year-old son. One unidentified prince roiled the waters with two memos, first reported in The Guardian, calling for removal of the king, who has health issues, and of the crown princes.This palace intrigue has added to the unease as the country grapples with social issues, plunging oil prices, the Islamic State, Yemen and, of course, its rival Iran. Yet members of the royal family and those close to it seem confident the leaders will weather the storm. \u201cI don\u2019t see any sign of impending collapse,\u201d said Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah al-Saud, a junior member of the family and head of an investment company. \u201cThe royal family rules by consensus, and if the royal family does poorly, the people will reject it \u2026 so the government will always manage to work through any problems.\u201dAn earlier version of this Editorial Observer misspelled the name of a city in Saudi Arabia. It is Saihat, not Shaihat. It also referred incorrectly on second reference to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as Prince Nayef, instead of Prince Mohammed, and to Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as Prince Salman, instead of Prince Mohammed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Singles Day in China Draws New Suitors: Foreign Sellers", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Over the last year, A2, an Australian milk company, made an unexpected discovery: A sharp increase in domestic sales came from Chinese bulk buyers, not local mothers.The commercially driven event began as a celebration of single people, held on a date that said it all, 11/11. But it has long since moved beyond the province of lonely shoppers and Chinese vendors. This year, a long list of foreign companies waited for the clock to hit midnight.At stake were potentially billions of dollars in sales and access to the wallets of a growing Chinese middle class. This year, Alibaba sold $14.3 billion worth of products, surpassing last year\u2019s total of $9.3 billion. JD.com and other Chinese e-commerce companies also got into the Singles Day action with their own deals.\u201cDouble 11 is a really big part of my calendar,\u201d said Scott Wotherspoon, the chief executive for A2 in Britain and China. Online outlets \u201chave allowed us to get into China in a much more direct way.\u201dCompanies like A2 are being welcomed into China as Beijing tries to stimulate growth by increasing consumption. The boom in online commerce is a major part of that plan \u2014 so much so that the office of Premier Li Keqiang offered encouragement to Alibaba, a private company.Although online purchases account for only about 10 percent of China\u2019s overall retail sales, government officials \u201care pretty optimistic, because they see this part of the economy growing very fast,\u201d said Xiaoping Ma, an HSBC economist. \u201cThat will have significant future implications.\u201d Days before Singles Day, Cheng Xin, the mother of a 22-month-old boy, had already filled her shopping cart at Alibaba\u2019s Taobao with 73 items, like Uniqlo baby underwear and Mellin baby food from Italy, worth about 30,000 renminbi, or about $4,700.Her husband was leery of the price. But she hoped that with the help of the delete button and deeper discounts on Singles Day, she would be able to get her cart down to about 10,000 renminbi.\u201cFor my baby, I feel more confident with foreign brands, especially food,\u201d Ms. Cheng said. \u201cAnd with clothes, I also feel the design of the foreign brands are better. I think domestic brands have made progress, but still they are not that cool.\u201dSince its inception in 2009, Singles Day has become a whirlwind of discounting, as bargains abound on overseas products. Alibaba said that it offered 5,000 overseas brands from 25 countries.Alibaba\u2019s Tmall site for Procter & Gamble sold out of Always sanitary napkins, which were being sold at 69 renminbi, or about $11, for two packs, down from 170. It was also offering one Aussie shampoo and conditioner for 99 renminbi with free shipping, rather than the usual 236. A box of Pampers diapers was cut to 199 renminbi, from 478.Nike was offering shoes at almost half price, while prices for pillowcases from Macy\u2019s were down to 399 yuan from 699 yuan. There were nuts from Costco and Craisins from Ocean Spray. Consumers could get loyalty points for buying an iPhone 6s.In addition to established brands, newer players, like A2, are looking for a foothold in China.\u201cThe way I see this, we\u2019ve only got our business going since we went online,\u201d Mr. Wotherspoon said, referring to sales in China. Although there is huge demand for milk formula in China, he added, having an online presence helped the company reach consumers more easily.The company offered deep discounts and deals that encouraged multiple purchases. And there were opportunities to preorder, reassuring parents that they could get a constant and reliable supply in the future.\u201cThe rise of e-commerce has been a staggering door-opener for companies with relatively small resources to talk to consumers,\u201d Mr. Wotherspoon added.JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s smaller competitor, has taken advantage of the interest in foreign goods by opening storefronts showcasing products from specific countries, like Germany, Japan and the United States.The company hopes Singles Day customers hungering for Mexican avocados and American apples will become repeat visitors, said Josh Gartner, senior director of international communications at JD.com.\u201cSingles Day is partly about the volume of sales, but it\u2019s about bringing new users to our platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to introduce new users, we\u2019re able to convert them into longtime customers.\u201dAlibaba made globalization the theme of its four-hour gala before Singles Day kicked off, and it has been promoting itself to foreign retailers as a point of access into China.In a news release, the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, promoted the opportunities that this access gave. \u201cThere are currently 300 million middle class in China, and that number will rise to 500 million in 10 to 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be an opportunity for every nation. China\u2019s consumption power will rise quickly, and that will not only drive China\u2019s economy, but also the world\u2019s economy.\u201dAlibaba even had a promotional video featuring a very American figure \u2014 Kevin Spacey, playing President Frank J. Underwood in the TV show \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u2014 suggesting that shoppers could perhaps buy a signet ring, or even a desk like his, on Singles Day.\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at data on Chinese spending habits, demand, international categories that would resonate \u2014 everything from maternity, to apparel, to domestics to home appliances, fresh foods,\u201d said Jennifer Kuperman, Alibaba\u2019s vice president of strategy and planning. \u201cThese categories, we believe, and have proven, to sell well in China.\u201dThey are all trying to stand out in an increasingly crowded field.Vipshop, a site for fashion and beauty products, is betting that offering lesser-known overseas brands not yet available in China will attract customers looking for items they saw while traveling, like health care items from the Australian brands Blackmores and Swisse.\u201cIn the past, they have to travel or ask friends to buy for them,\u201d said Tony Feng, the company\u2019s vice president for Chinese shoppers.This was welcome news to Jeakey Chen, who had her eyes on a pair of boots from the British brand Clarks, to which she took a liking when she was a student in Sheffield, England. Apart from a washing machine for her parents, she did not plan to buy anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of stressful to search and compare prices,\u201d she said.Amie Tsang reported from Hong Kong and Cao Li from Beijing.

{"Headline": "A Conversation With Martin Cohen", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 30-Minute InterviewI\u2019m thoroughly engaged in all the strategic initiatives that the company engages in. I\u2019m an active member of the executive committee, and all the major decisions of the firm I\u2019m involved in. We were doing extremely well up until earlier in the year. We were up around 30 percent last year, and more than 5 percent at the end of the first quarter this year in our real estate funds. And then there was some turbulence based on uncertainty \u2014 Fed policy, the course of the economy, etc. \u2014 and REITs had about a 15 percent decline. We had a great recovery in September and October. I think we\u2019re up about 2 percent for the year now. So the diversification benefits of owning real estate companies are taking place with the low-interest-rate environment, which seems to be destined to persist. Plus, one thing that is missing from many strategists\u2019 thinking is that REITs are not bonds. So yields might be 3 or 4 percent, but dividends grow every year. And this year we\u2019ve had close to double-digit growth in dividends. We expect the same thing next year. We still like the regional mall sector. The economy has yet to really accelerate, but at some point, as employment grows and consumer wealth grows, then that certainly helps retail. A lot of retailers are having issues, but the mall owners are not. We also like urban markets, because that\u2019s where my children\u2019s generation wants to live, and it\u2019s also where jobs are \u2014 services, technology. And we like the office market as a result. We have to recognize that there\u2019s a lot of new building taking place in New York City, and that gives us a little bit of pause, because when you see a bulge in supply, that could cause rents to level off. That could happen over the next year or two. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Tax Code Can Be Simpler. But Not Three Pages.", "Date": "2015-11-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAll the Republican presidential candidates say they want to make the tax code simpler. But no candidate has been more aggressive about simplicity than Carly Fiorina, who says \u201cour tax code needs to go from 73,000 pages down to about three pages.\u201d\u201cReporters said it wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d wrote Sarah Isgur Flores, Mrs. Fiorina\u2019s deputy campaign manager, on Twitter. \u201cOnce again, media was wrong.\u201dThat would still leave Subtitles B through K, a further 1,445 pages describing taxes other than the income tax, and setting out important administrative matters like what happens if you don\u2019t pay your taxes. Those pages would need to be retained or replaced with new law, unless Mrs. Fiorina wants the Internal Revenue Service to make up its own rules.Even replacing just Subtitle A with the three-page Hall-Rabushka version could cause significant problems.\u201dThe minute it\u2019s passed, I\u2019m going to call my dean and tell her to pay me only in goods,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a tax professor at Columbia Law School. \u201cBuy me a house, buy me some groceries every week, buy me meals.\u201d That\u2019s because the three-page plan avoids complex rules about fringe benefits by saying noncash compensation is tax-free.That said, while the tax code can\u2019t be reduced to three pages, it could be significantly simpler than it is today, and Mrs. Fiorina and most of her opponents have identified a source of both length and complexity: so-called tax preferences.When a provision of the tax code says one thing will be taxed and another thing will not, taxpayers are encouraged to contort their lives to do more of the untaxed thing and less of the taxed thing, paying lawyers and accountants to keep the records along the way.\u201cIn my case, I have lawyers all over the place, I have accounting firms all over the place,\u201d Donald Trump said in August. Like all of his opponents, Mr. Trump says he would simplify the tax code by lowering tax rates and cutting the number of deductions and preferences offered. Unlike his opponents, he says his simplification would be so effective as to \u201cput H&R Block out of business, knock \u2019em out, put \u2019em out of business.\u201dBut the candidates have missed the mark in a few ways. One is by conflating tax simplicity with the number of tax rates imposed by the I.R.S.The candidates\u2019 plans would simplify the taxable income calculation, but they have been hesitant to make this calculation too simple for a reason: That would require taking away tax deductions, and people tend to like the deductions they take.Most Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump, have said their plans to attack tax preferences would not touch two of the biggest and most popular ones: deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable giving.So far, the candidate most committed to tax simplification may be Ben Carson, who advocated abolishing the deduction for charitable giving at Tuesday\u2019s debate. Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have also proposed simple tax plans that would not only shrink the personal income tax and repeal most deductions but also abolish payroll taxes and the corporate income tax, replacing them with a value-added tax, which is kind of like a national sales tax.Other candidates\u2019 plans are not so simple. Senator Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump would both introduce a significant new source of complexity by taxing small-business profits at a lower rate than wage income; currently, they are taxed at the same rate.This change would encourage taxpayers to find ways to recharacterize their income as profits instead of wages, perhaps by becoming independent contractors. It would also require the I.R.S. to issue new rules about what is a wage and what is a profit, complicating life for people who have bona fide business income.There is also one approach to simplification that hasn\u2019t been proposed by any of the Republican candidates: having the I.R.S. complete most people\u2019s tax returns for them, requiring changes only if there is an error. This is already done in countries like Denmark and Spain. Tax complexity isn\u2019t about just how many rules there are, but also about how many of those rules taxpayers actually have to confront. Auto-completion of tax forms would reduce complexity (and time and cost) as experienced by real people.One challenge with such a system is that tax returns depend not just on information known to the I.R.S. \u2014 such as the wages your employer reports on form W-2 \u2014 but on information it may not know, like your charitable giving. But if the tax code were simpler, with fewer deductions, it would be possible for the government to prepare an accurate, completed return for a greater share of tax filers.A change like that, along with simpler tax rules, might really put H&R Block out of business.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

Like the picture, with its shiny surface molting and its edges rubbed indistinct, the revolution and its heroes are fading.Time is Mr. Olmo\u2019s enemy, now that he is 79. He lives a quiet, modest life in an apartment complex on the edge of Santiago de Cuba, the island\u2019s second-largest city. Few of his comrades remain \u2014 five perhaps, or six. They disagree on a count when you ask them. The men meet once every three months, Mr. Olmo says, and between sessions it is not uncommon for one of them to have passed away.The revolution is still respected, but to many Cubans it is no longer reason enough to abide shortages of food and supplies, low monthly incomes, infrastructure in disrepair.\u201cThere are people who are die-hard and want to maintain the faith, but I don\u2019t see another generation accepting the sacrifice for the project as a basis for continuing austerity,\u201d said Lisandro P\u00e9rez, a professor of Latin American studies at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.But change is in the air now, and the old revolutionaries recognize it. What they do not know is whether it will preserve the ideals they fought for or scatter them to the winds.For sure, the revolution did not make Cuba, or many of them, wealthy.

The evidence is clear on the streets of Santiago, where young people take their fashion cues, their backward hats and baggy clothes, from the country that was long portrayed as Cuba\u2019s nemesis, the United States.\u201cWhat can I say, I don\u2019t really believe in politics, and the revolution is purely political,\u201d Rub\u00e9n Suarez Romero, 24, said. \u201cMy main concern is my family, not party politics.\u201dMany Cubans his age have little patience for revolutionary rhetoric, and they are frustrated by the dearth of economic opportunity in the country, despite the diplomatic thaw with Washington. They want to see change in their lives, and revolutionary talk sounds to many like a distraction from their struggles.\u201cThe youth want everything now,\u201d Mr. Mato said with a sigh, running his hands along the legs of his pants. \u201cThey think that everything will fall from the sky.\u201dThen, with a smile, he added: \u201cListen, I\u2019m an old fart, and I\u2019ll die pretty soon. The youth are the ones who will need to carry things forward.\u201dContradiction is more than just a sign of a changing Cuba \u2014 it is a fundamental characteristic of it.Revolutionaries like Mr. Olmo do what they can to pass the torch. He tells his grandchildren about his actions in the 1950s and why it was so important to overthrow the Batista regime.\u201cThe revolution, for me, opened up my future,\u201d Mr. Olmo said as he sat in a rocking chair in the home he shares with a daughter, her husband and their children. \u201cIdealistically, the revolution committed errors, but in its essence it was something very pure.\u201dHe spoke of his children, all of them educated, some now living abroad. The revolution gave them opportunities that did not exist in the old Cuba, he said. He acknowledged that \u201cnow changes are necessary, our economy needs to open up.\u201d But he also insisted, \u201cThe central idea of politics, it should stay the same.\u201dHope for preserving the old socialist ideals grows fainter by the day, even on Mr. Olmo\u2019s doorstep. The sun pierced the foliage of a large acacia tree in the courtyard beneath his apartment, where a dozen children played soccer barefoot, their voices and scrapes and bangs filtering up through the open windows.During a break in the game, the children sat on the concrete lip of the courtyard and teased one another. When a visitor asked them about the war hero living just above, they looked puzzled; one suggested that the man was a friend\u2019s grandfather, then shrugged.Another question, about what the revolution meant to them, was met with a mix of adolescent shyness and aloofness. Finally one young boy stepped forward and answered.\u201cThe revolution has given me everything,\u201d he said, squinting slightly into the sun. Pressed further, the boy could not say what \u201ceverything\u201d was, or what the slogan meant. He retreated to the concrete lip with his friends and looked away.\u201cWhen we talk about the revolution,\u201d he said, \u201cit confuses me sometimes.\u201dHannah Berkeley Cohen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Death Among Middle-Aged Whites", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDeath rates have continued to decline in every other age group and racial or ethnic group in the United States, and this particular group had shown no unusual problems in the preceding years. (Middle-aged blacks still have a higher mortality rate than middle-aged whites but the gap is closing. Middle-aged Hispanics have a far lower mortality rate than whites.)When the economists sliced and diced the data, they found that the mortality rate for all white Americans from 45 to 54 years, which fell by 2 percent a year between 1978 and 1998, began rising at an annual rate of 0.5 percent beginning in 1999. The toll was especially high for the less educated. Death rates rose by 22 percent for people with a high school education or less, while they continued to decline for those with a college education or better.The Princeton economists attributed the increase in death rates to suicides and drug and alcohol poisonings, problems that may have been exacerbated by the economic downturn. After the 2008 recession and slow recovery, the inflation-adjusted income for households headed by a person with only a high school degree fell by 19 percent, according to experts at Dartmouth who were asked to comment on the paper.Other rich nations suffered similar or even worse economic slowdowns without a change in mortality rates, and blacks and Hispanics in the United States were harmed more than whites by the recession but did not experience an increase in mortality rates. Even so, the economic effects were potent.The Princeton economists detected signs of growing distress among middle-aged whites, who express pessimism about their futures and report declines in their physical and mental health and ability to function. They also report increases in chronic pain, which many alleviate with prescription opioids and heroin.If sickness and death rates continue to rise in this age group, an influx of chronically ill people will strain Medicare, Medicaid and the Social Security disability insurance program. There is no single remedy. A real plan for action is not easy to achieve. Economic growth that creates more high-paying jobs would solve some of the problem. Policies to promote affordable college educations and universal access to mental health clinics and addiction treatment centers could help.If nothing is done, those now in midlife can expect trouble, and the next generation to hit that age could suffer a similar fate. We must not let that happen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "School vs. Society in America\u2019s Failing Students", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneHere\u2019s the good news: American schools may not be as bad as we have been led to believe.Ah, but here\u2019s the bad news: The rest of American society is failing its disadvantaged citizens even more than we realize. The question is, Should educators be responsible for fixing this?The perennial debate about the state of public education starts with a single, seemingly unassailable fact. American students sorely lag their peers in other rich nations and even measure up poorly compared with students in some less advanced countries.The lackluster performance has reinforced a belief that American public education \u2014 the principals and teachers, the methods and procedures \u2014 is just not up to scratch. There must be something wrong when the system in the United States falls short where many others succeed.But is the criticism fair? Are American schools failing because they are not good at their job? Perhaps their job is simply tougher.\u201cOnce we adjust for social status, we are doing much better than we think,\u201d Professor Carnoy told me. \u201cWe underrate our progress.\u201dThe researchers started by comparing test scores in the United States with those in France, Germany, Britain, Canada, Finland, South Korea, Poland and Ireland. On average, students in all those countries do better than American children.Then the researchers divided students into groups depending on the number of books in their homes, a measure of the academic resources at families\u2019 disposal. This adjustment significantly reduced the American deficit, especially among students on the bottom rungs of the resource ladder.American students from families with the least educational resources, as it turned out, scored better on the PISA math test than similar children in France and about the same as Britons, Germans and Irish.Encouragingly, disadvantaged American students have made more progress over recent years than those in even some of the highest-ranked countries. And some American states perform as well as the international darlings. Adjusting for families\u2019 academic resources, 15-year-olds in Massachusetts scored roughly as high in the PISA math test as students in Canada, Finland and Poland.Mr. Carnoy and his colleagues estimated that the score gap between American students and those in the highest-ranked countries \u2014 Finland, Canada and South Korea \u2014 shrinks by 25 percent in math and 40 percent in reading once proper adjustments for gender, age, mother\u2019s education and books in the home are taken into account.Awareness that America\u2019s educational deficits are driven to a large degree by socioeconomic disadvantage might move the policy debate, today so firmly anchored in a \u201cschools fail\u201d mode. It offers up a new question: Is it reasonable to ask public schools to fix societal problems that start holding disadvantaged children back before they are conceived?And it is becoming even harder for the American schools most children attend to overcome these differences. \u201cThe public school population is getting poorer,\u201d Mr. Carnoy noted.This line of thought may let American schools off the hook too easily. Equalizing opportunity is, in fact, one of the core purposes of education. And schools in countries poorer than the United States seem to do a better job.\u201cThere is no way you can blame socioeconomic status for the performance of the United States,\u201d said Andreas Schleicher, the O.E.C.D.\u2019s top educational expert, who runs the organization\u2019s PISA tests. \u201cWhen you look at all dimensions of social background, the United States does not suffer a particular disadvantage.\u201dMr. Schleicher criticized the analysis of the PISA data by Professor Carnoy and his colleagues for using a single indicator: books at home. And he pointed me to a statistic that underscores how the role of socioeconomic status can be overplayed.As part of the PISA exercise, the O.E.C.D. collects information about parental education and occupation, household wealth, educational resources at home and other measures of social and economic status \u2014 and combines them into one index.By that standard, fewer than 15 percent of American students come from the bottom rung of society. And yet, Mr. Schleicher found, 65 percent of principals in American schools say at least 30 percent of their students come from disadvantaged families, the most among nations participating in the PISA tests.\u201cI found this contrast between actual and perceived disadvantage so interesting that I intend to publish it shortly,\u201d he told me.Whatever the failings of the rest of society, it still seems clear American schools can do better.While poor students start at a disadvantage, Professor Waldfogel and her colleagues found that the gap between the educational performance of rich and poor children widens further as they progress through the public school system.Mr. Carnoy and Mr. Schleicher agree that parents should expect more.Mr. Carnoy, however, argues that policy makers could learn more from successful American states, like Massachusetts, than from vastly different countries like Finland or South Korea.Mr. Schleicher doesn\u2019t quite agree. Comparing the United States with other countries, he notes, allows researchers to identify particularly egregious deficits of American education.There\u2019s the wide disparity in resources devoted to education, which flows naturally from a system of school finance based on local property taxes. There\u2019s the informal tracking that happens when smart children are grouped separately in gifted and talented classes while the less able are held back a year.Teachers are paid poorly, compared to those working in other occupations. And the best of them are not deployed to the most challenging schools.In a country like the United States, with its lopsided distribution of opportunity and reward, social disadvantage will always pose a challenge. What\u2019s frustrating, Mr. Schleicher said, is \u201cthe inability of the school system to moderate the disadvantage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Chill Grips a Michigan Haven for Syrian Families", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. \u2014 In late 2011, as killings, kidnappings and sectarian strife crept across the battle-scarred city of Homs, Syria, the family of four made a sorrowful decision: to flee.Radwan Mughrbel; his wife, Sanaa Hammadeh; and their two young sons packed their bags with only a single change of clothes per person. They took a bus to Damascus and hired a taxi to spirit them across the border into Jordan. For years, they patched together a meager life, barely making enough money to eat and desperately seeking refugee status.When the United Nations refugee agency asked where they wanted to go, the answer was obvious.\u201cAmerica,\u201d said Mr. Mughrbel, a short, wiry Muslim man of 52, his face lighting up in a smile as he sat in his bare-walled living room in this Detroit suburb last week. \u201cThey brought us here, and I feel safe, like nothing bad can happen to us. Now we have a beautiful life.\u201dGov. Rick Snyder, who in September publicly rhapsodized about the boon that refugees were to Michigan\u2019s economy, was among the first of more than two dozen Republican governors to vow last week that they would try to keep displaced Syrians out of their states to preserve the safety of Americans from would-be terrorists.Presidential candidates and elected officials around the country have suggested closing mosques, collecting Syrian refugees already in the country or creating a registry for Muslims.Sentiments like those are especially jarring in Michigan, which has one of the largest and most vibrant Arab-American populations in the country and a vocal group of advocates for bringing more Syrian refugees to the United States. In the Detroit suburbs, refugees have traded a harrowing war in the Middle East for cold winters, strip malls and subdivisions with houses as uniform as Monopoly pieces.In explaining Mr. Snyder\u2019s opposition to Syrians coming to Michigan, his spokesman, David Murray, said the state remained \u201cunwavering\u201d in its commitment to helping refugees.\u201cBut our first priority is to keep Michiganders safe,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cAfter tragedies such as we\u2019ve seen in France, Lebanon and in the skies above Egypt in recent weeks, it\u2019s proper to pause and review background and safety procedures with our partners in the federal government.\u201dRegardless, advocates for refugees say they have no intention to stop helping them settle here. Many more Syrian families who have waited for refugee status for years are destined for Michigan in the coming months.Syrians must pass through many steps of security clearances before being admitted to the United States.Mr. Mughrbel, who arrived with his family in July, bristled at the suggestion that refugees like him could be a threat.\u201cWe didn\u2019t cross illegally,\u201d he said. He threw his hands in the air. \u201cWe went through hell to get here.\u201dEscape From WarThat hell started in Homs more than four years ago.The government, under President Bashar al-Assad, had cracked down on the rebellious city, religious sects were at war with one another, and the deadly mix of bombings, snipers and random violence forced many residents indoors. Ms. Hammadeh was afraid to leave their home to shop for fresh food. On some days, the family resorted to eating moldy bread.The couple\u2019s sons, Soubei and Ahmad, now 19 and 18, were then in their early teens, and their parents began to fear they would be kidnapped.\u201cWe got scared,\u201d Ms. Hammadeh said. \u201cThe government would see kids on the street and take them, beat them. We didn\u2019t want them to kidnap our children.\u201dIn November 2011, they resolved to leave.Everything had to be left behind: furniture, photos, nearly all of their clothes. The only exception was Ms. Hammadeh\u2019s gold wedding band and two bracelets that she slipped onto her wrist. Once the family arrived in Jordan, she sold them all for about $230.Life in their temporary country was expensive and difficult. Mr. Mughrbel\u2019s brother, who had also fled to Jordan, died of a heart attack. Mr. Mughrbel blamed stress.After months of grueling trips to the United Nations refugee agency in Amman for repeated hourslong interviews as part of the refugee process, they found out they would be going to the United States.\u201cOur life was about to change,\u201d Mr. Mughrbel said in Arabic through a translator. \u201cWe were going to have a safe future for our kids, live a happy life, be in a better environment, be treated like a real person.\u201dBefore departing for the United States, he and his family attended four days of orientation, where they were instructed in the ways of American life. How to drive a car. How to throw banana peels and other trash in a garbage can, not on the ground.They were also schooled in what they should focus on when they arrived. Learn English, they were told. Find a job, because America is all about work. The United States is a wonderful place, they were told. People will respect you.On their first morning in their new Michigan apartment, they marveled at the lawns and trees. \u201cWe didn\u2019t walk around because we were afraid we would get lost,\u201d Mr. Mughrbel said. \u201cSo we just looked out the window.\u201d\u201cWhen I saw all the grass,\u201d said Ms. Hammadeh, 43, her large eyes widening, \u201cI felt that I was reborn.\u201dShe sheepishly recounted trivial missteps. A used minivan, bought for $2,500, was accidentally filled with premium gas. An unfamiliar shampoo seemed to make her hair go temporarily thin.But after four months, the family says it is financially independent, living on the earnings of the two sons, who work in a factory. Mr. Mughrbel, a cook and butcher in his native Syria, has found occasional work in a restaurant and, once his English is better, would like to open one of his own. Sometimes the family piles into the van after dinner at home and visits other Syrian families for coffee and gossip.At home last week, family members bustled around as a soccer game played on the television, their preferred alternative to CNN and all its bleak bulletins. The smell of eggplant and spices wafted from the galley kitchen. A glance through the sliding patio doors revealed other modest but well-kept brick apartment buildings nearby.A growing number of governors said they oppose the entry of Syrian refugees into their states.They have kept their lives small, mostly going to work and back, and occasionally to the mosque. Mr. Mughrbel condemned the attacks in Paris. \u201cThese are criminals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are against this kind of stuff. You can\u2019t just walk and kill somebody in the street. God won\u2019t forgive you.\u201dFamiliar SupportThe task of keeping an eye on the new refugees has fallen to many of the 3,000 Syrian-Americans who have settled near Detroit for generations, a group known for its prosperity and devotion to higher education.\u201cThere\u2019s a significant number of Syrians here, so if the refugees don\u2019t have relatives, they\u2019ll at least have a lot of cultural connections,\u201d said Dawud Walid, the executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cOur community in general has been very welcoming to refugees, irrespective to their national origin.\u201dMany established Syrians have formed volunteer organizations to assist in the resettlement process; supplied the refugees with furniture, clothing and food; and procured apartments, often at a discounted rent.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to help them find their way once they are here,\u201d said Mahmoud Altattan, 65, the owner of Altas Greenfield Market, an emporium of produce, jarred olives, nuts and pita breads in Southfield, a Detroit suburb. \u201cThey have some difficulty adjusting at first. We try to put them on the right path.\u201dNew refugees have come to his store in search of familiar comforts: pumpkin seeds, sweets and coffees from their native country. Mr. Altattan, who arrived in the United States from Syria 27 years ago and speaks softly accented English, said he advised the refugees that their most important task was to learn the language.\u201cMost of the Syrian community is educated people, doctors, lawyers,\u201d said Mr. Altattan, who proudly noted that he counts a doctor and lawyer among his four grown children. \u201cThe new Syrians who are coming now are not so educated.\u201dRefugee resettlement officials say many of the new refugees have worked in blue-collar jobs in Syria, as carpenters, cooks, tailors and drivers. Many were poor and vulnerable when they fled.Case managers for the agencies that assist with resettlement spend the first few months of refugees\u2019 time in the United States in a sort of hand-holding: making nearly daily visits to their homes, helping them book doctor\u2019s appointments and register their children for school, and driving them to the grocery store.\u201cWhen refugees arrive to the country, they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Jewan Poulis, a program coordinator with Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, an agency that has received about one or two Syrian families each week since June. \u201cThey have no clue what\u2019s going on.\u201dAmer Sharaf, a 36-year-old Syrian refugee who arrived in Michigan in August, said he and his family had been warmly embraced by the older Syrians, who helped them by donating furniture and translating bills. A house painter when he lived in Syria, he found a job here in an automotive factory, making $9 an hour and working 50 hours a week.But in his family\u2019s apartment last week, as he and his wife, Marvat Mando, sipped Turkish coffee and watched their children read e-books on iPads provided by their public school, he turned to a new and troubling subject: the terrorist attacks in Paris and the governor\u2019s subsequent criticism of Syrian refugees.\u201cIt\u2019s wrong,\u201d Mr. Sharaf said. \u201cWhy is what happened everybody\u2019s fault?\u201dAnother ArrivalLast Tuesday afternoon, refugee specialists were gathered in a conference room at the suburban Detroit offices of Lutheran Social Services, discussing their final preparations for the arrival of a family of Syrian refugees on Wednesday evening.Hani Aziz, a refugee specialist who is an Iraqi refugee himself, was assigned to pick up the family of three at 8 p.m., at the end of a long journey flying from Jordan to Frankfurt to Chicago and, finally, to Detroit.Two days earlier, Mr. Snyder had proclaimed his opposition to new Syrian refugees entering the state. The specialists mentioned his name defiantly.\u201cIf Snyder\u2019s at the airport tomorrow, pushing them back onto the plane, then we know he\u2019s for real,\u201d Sean de Four, the vice president of children and family services at the agency, said wryly.But when Wednesday evening came, the family\u2019s flight was delayed for almost four hours. Standing in the arrivals terminal beneath an enormous Christmas wreath, Mr. Aziz scanned the crowds nervously, not knowing anything about the family except for names.Finally, just after midnight, the family emerged, looking remarkably unrumpled: Nayef Buteh, 45; his wife, Feryal Jabur, 41; and their 8-year-old son, Arab.Ms. Jabur was poised and elegant but sank onto a bench near the baggage claim.\u201cIt was very tiring,\u201d she said through a translator, looking glassy-eyed and exhausted. The couple\u2019s son, wearing a black bomber jacket and jeans, slumped wordlessly next to her and lowered his dark eyelashes.Mr. Buteh was polite but agitated, his eyes darting toward the exit. It had been 10 hours since his last cigarette. He stepped out into the mild November air and lit up.\u201cThank God,\u201d he said in Arabic, taking a deep drag.Worn down by the grinding war in Syria, the family fled in March 2013 on the bed of a pickup, destined for a refugee camp in Jordan. But water was scarce there, and medical care was poor. Arab kept getting sick. The three sneaked out illegally, heading to a larger city and finding an apartment with relatives.\u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019ll send you to Michigan,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Buteh said as the minivan driven by Mr. Aziz hurtled down the nearly empty highway. \u201cThey told us it\u2019s very beautiful, with a large Middle Eastern community and jobs in car factories.\u201dAbout 2 a.m., the van delivered the family to its small motel, where a spread of tea, chicken, rice, apples and pickles awaited on a night stand.Mr. Buteh stepped out into the deserted parking lot and rapidly smoked another cigarette. He patted the beige, puffy coat he was wearing and glanced upward.\u201cI was not expecting it to be warm,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here expecting snow.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The pope said he wanted to spread a message of peace and reconciliation.He arrived in Kenya at a time when public confidence in the government is plummeting, the economy is ailing, ethnic tensions are rising and corruption has spiraled out of control. Many Kenyans are hoping that Francis can lift their spirits.\u201cWhat\u2019s the mood?\u201d said Bishop Anthony Muheria. \u201cIt\u2019s electric.\u201dThe 78-year-old pontiff is going to have a busy five days in Africa. His schedule is packed with meetings, red-carpet receptions, arrival ceremonies, farewell ceremonies and a Mass on Thursday for as many as one million people.Kenyans are fed up with the excesses of their political class \u2014 five government ministers were fired this week in connection with allegations of graft \u2014 and many said they hoped the pope would talk about it.Francis did not address the subject directly in his short, upbeat speech Wednesday night at State House, Kenya\u2019s equivalent of the White House. But he did say, to a burst of applause: \u201cThe Gospel tells us that from those to whom much has been given, much will be demanded. In that spirit, I encourage you to work with integrity and transparency for the common good.\u201dMore than other recent popes, Francis has cast himself as a champion of the poor. As a cardinal in Buenos Aires, he rode a public bus to work and often walked in the city\u2019s slums.Africa is by far the world\u2019s poorest continent, and many Kenyans are touched that Francis plans to spend Friday morning in the Kangemi slum, a huge informal settlement of flimsy metal shacks, broken dreams and open sewage trickling across the ground.\u201cThe people here never expected this,\u201d said the Rev. Paschal Mwijage, who leads a church in Kangemi. \u201cEven now,\u201d he said on Wednesday afternoon, \u201cthey still don\u2019t believe the pope\u2019s coming.\u201d One child from the slum said she was too excited to sleep.Nairobi has put aside day-to-day life in expectation of the papal visit. Schools, major roads and most businesses will be closed on Thursday, an impromptu national holiday and a day of \u201cprayer and reflection.\u201d Hundreds of thousands of Catholics are streaming into the city from all corners of Kenya by bus, taxi, motorbike, even bicycle. Major hotels are fully booked, though many worshipers have chosen a cheaper option: sleeping on school floors.The only event here that has come close to generating this level of excitement was President Obama\u2019s visit in July, and hopes this time are even higher.\u201cOur politicians,\u201d the paper concluded, \u201ccould learn a thing or two from him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Two months later, relations deteriorated further after news reports that Australia\u2019s embassy in Jakarta was part of an international spying effort, including against Indonesia, led by the United States.The countries lie only about 125 miles apart at their closest point, but the differences are stark: Australia is a wealthy, progressive Christian country, while Indonesia, which has the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, is a developing nation with small but vocal radical Islamic groups promoting jihad against the West.Analysts, however, say that the countries share too many interests to let relations remain sour. The countries are major trading partners, and Australia is one of the largest bilateral donors to Indonesia.Mr. Joko expressed hope that Australia would invest in Indonesia\u2019s digital economy, which he said one report estimated would grow to $130 billion in 2020, from around $13 billion this year.Advertisement"}
