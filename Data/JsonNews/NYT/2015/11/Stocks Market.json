{"Headline": "For Investors, \u2018Portfolio Insurance\u2019 Against Market Declines", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth Special SectionWhenever the stock market shows a bad hand, as it did in the third quarter, nearly all stock investors hope they have something akin to an ace in the hole.Investing professionals call this favored-card strategy \u201cportfolio insurance,\u201d a way of hedging against the brutal loss of a broad-based market decline. In recent years, more specialized investments to stem market downturns have become available to individual investors.Although portfolio-protection strategies are complicated and none work perfectly, they can be widely employed to protect wealth over time. But shielding against future loss in retirement income and addressing short-term volatility are often two different missions that have varying costs and results.What most unnerves many investors is volatility, the day-to-day sell-offs that can shave up to 3 percent off stock prices; this happened more than once in August. To safeguard against those Tilt-A-Whirl rides, people can turn to investments that actually reward them in the most skittish periods. That approach would have paid off in August, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost 6 percent, and in September, when it lost nearly 3 percent.Nine exchange-traded funds, known as E.T.F.s, are linked to indexes that track stock volatility. The idea behind these funds is that when short-term fears derail stock returns, investors can make still money. The funds follow a \u201cfear\u201d index listed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange that gains when stocks head south.The largest fear E.T.F. by assets is the VIX Short-Term Futures E.T.F. (VIXY). The fund was up 27 percent for the third quarter, a handsome return considering the S.&P. 500 was down 6 percent during that period.As investors have become more skittish during market dips, trading in the volatility products has soared. In August, the C.B.O.E. reported that trading in such funds was the \u201csecond-busiest of all time,\u201d eclipsed only by the 2008 collapse.But when the market flattens out or posts gains, the returns on fear-index funds are abysmal. The ProShares fund is down 49 percent over the last three years as of Oct. 19. As with all short-term trading funds, investors have to be fairly precise about when they enter and exit this E.T.F., which is not something most individuals can do with consistent success.Another strategy that has grown in popularity among individual investors in recent years is the low-volatility or smart beta stock approach. These funds select stocks that don\u2019t have as much downside movement as the rest of the market, may offer growth and are often less prone to huge declines because they pay consistent dividends.\u201cI love the idea of stock growth and lower portfolio risk,\u201d said Howard Erman, a certified financial planner in Seal Beach, Calif. \u201cThe idea is to manage volatility and not avoid it. That means investing in stocks and having confidence in the growth of the global economy. Every bear market ends. When it does, you need to be invested in stocks.\u201dWhile low-volatility funds can and do lose money in a downturn, their losses are not as great as that of the S.&P. 500. Steve Stanganelli, a certified financial planner with Clear View Wealth Advisors in Amesbury, Mass., recommended the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility E.T.F. (USMV), which owns durable dividend payers such as AT&T Inc. (T) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The fund was down slightly more than 1 percent in the third quarter, compared with more than 6 percent for the S.&P. 500.A more active approach to portfolio protection can be found through hedgelike or alternative mutual funds, which can skew a portfolio toward making money on the downside if market conditions warrant. You can also invest in commodity and real estate funds that tend not to move in lockstep with stocks of American companies most of the time (except for 2008).The managers in these funds are free to home in on securities that could do well during a downturn, or to \u201cshort\u201d companies \u2014 that is, to make money when the companies decline in value.Returns for the more than 100 long-short funds on the market, however, vary widely and are expensive to own. The Turner Medical Sciences Long/Short Fund (TMSFX), for example, is up 20 percent for this year, through Oct. 19. It holds mostly small health care growth stocks.Be careful with any active strategy, because managers can still guess poorly or whole industries can fall out of favor. Then you will pay dearly for their mistakes and will not have the downside protection you seek.For even more sophisticated investors, options \u2014 bets that a security or index will rise or fall over a given period \u2014 can provide some downside protection.You can, for example, buy \u201cput\u201d options on a single stock or an entire index, which pay off if a security declines over a specific time. For this strategy to make sense, you need to have some understanding of how options work; commissions and taxes are involved. It may be helpful to work with an adviser who specializes in options.For most investors, though, a comprehensive portfolio review that involves a combination of strategies can smooth out some of the bumps. Most, if not all, certified financial planners, chartered financial analysts and registered investment advisers can model the portfolio that will allow you to sleep at night.You can, of course, set up your own portfolios or go online to create one through a robo-adviser such as Betterment, Wealthfront or Personal Capital. But if you have some specific needs such as saving for college, a late retirement or tax reduction, a personal adviser can do some hand-holding and perhaps better tailor an investment plan to your risk and return goals.Mr. Stanganelli, for example, uses a broad array of low-volatility, option-based and dividend-focused funds in his client portfolios, which are customized according to goals and risk tolerance.\u201cThe market\u2019s going to be volatile and things change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as you have a plan, there\u2019s no need to panic as long as you\u2019re meeting your goals.\u201dIf you choose to work with an adviser, ask that any suggested portfolios be \u201cstress tested\u201d so you can see how much money you would lose under a 10 percent, 20 percent or 2008-scale sell-off. Then you can determine which hedging strategy feels right to you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strong Growth in Jobs May Encourage Fed to Raise Rates", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 271,000 jump in payrolls reported by the Labor Department on Friday was much more robust than expected and suggested that economic growth had enough momentum to allow the central bank to begin its move away from the ultralow, crisis-level interest-rate policy it has been following for seven years.\u201cIt was pretty much everything you could ask for in a jobs report,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cNot only was the headline number strong, but there were upward revisions for prior months, the unemployment rate fell and wage growth accelerated.\u201dA healthy, improving economy tends to favor the incumbent party in the White House, and it could blunt Republican attacks on President Obama\u2019s economic record, a mainstay of the Republican candidates\u2019 message.After the release of the employment data, economists lined up to predict that a rate increase is now nearly a lock at the Fed\u2019s mid-December meeting.\u201cThe report was so strong and broad-based that it will be difficult to deter them from raising rates,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. Until Friday, Barclays had been predicting the Fed would wait until March 2016 to act, but moved that up to next month after Friday\u2019s announcement. \u201cI think the odds are about 80 to 85 percent that they will move,\u201d Mr. Gapen said.The unemployment rate dipped to 5 percent, from 5.1 percent in September. Average hourly earnings also bounced back, rising 0.4 percent in October after showing no increase in September. That lifted the gain to 2.5 percent over the last 12 months, the healthiest pace since 2009.Still, most workers will need bigger raises for some time to come to make up for ground lost after a long period of wage stagnation. What\u2019s more, many Americans remain on the sidelines of the job market, discouraged by years of lackluster hiring after the Great Recession.The proportion of Americans who are in the labor force, which fell to a 38-year low of 62.4 percent in September, was unchanged last month.Still, at 5 percent, the official unemployment rate is very close to the threshold that the Fed and many private economists consider consistent with stable prices over the long term. The slack that built up in the labor market after the recession, however, has changed traditional calculations of how far unemployment can fall before the job market tightens and the risk of inflation rises.An additional jobs report for November will be in hand by the time the Open Market Committee gathers for its last meeting of the year, on Dec. 15 and 16.Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, had long advocated waiting until 2016, but he said on Friday that he expected internal debate to start shifting toward the timing of subsequent rate increases.\u201cI think what we\u2019re likely to get into discussing before too long is what\u2019s the path of the rate increases,\u201d Mr. Evans said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to dictate how accommodative or restrictive our policy is. And so I think we need to have communications which indicate that the path is going to be gradual.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.But some analysts said the Fed would be forced to move faster than it currently plans.\u201cRegardless of the exact timing of the first rate hike, we still believe that the big story next year will be an unexpectedly strong pickup in wage growth and price inflation,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. This trend, he predicted, \u201cwill force the Fed into a much more aggressive policy-tightening cycle than the Fed\u2019s projections currently suggest.\u201dMr. Evans is among Fed officials who do not want the central bank to move too quickly, before there is clear evidence of inflationary pressure. Prices have increased slowly in recent years, rising just 0.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, well below the 2 percent pace that the Fed regards as optimal.At the same time, many workers are still working fewer hours than they would like, or taking jobs that pay much less than they would like.The Labor Department\u2019s broadest measure of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time jobs because full-time work is unavailable, fell to 9.8 percent in October from 10 percent in September. A year ago, it was over 11.1 percent.The picture of labor market strength evident in the data sent bond yields surging as traders rapidly adjusted for the likelihood of a December move. Stocks were mixed in trading Friday, as investors weighed the risks that higher rates pose to earnings and company valuations.In a separate report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said consumer borrowing surged by $28.9 billion in September, the biggest monthly jump since the start of data collection in 1941. Student debt and car loans posted big increases.As has been the case for several months, there was a feast-or-famine quality to the job report. Sectors tied to commodities and exports treaded water while domestically focused areas of the economy performed well.The pattern persisted in October: Factory jobs were unchanged, while mining and logging lost 4,000 positions. Professional and business services recorded a huge 78,000 increase in jobs. Health care hiring was also robust, with a 56,700 increase.White-collar employers like Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting giant, have been on something of a hiring binge. Over the course of the company\u2019s 2016 fiscal year, which began in July, Ernst & Young plans to hire just over 17,000 new employees in the United States, roughly 10,000 joining straight out of college.In July, August and September, the firm added 2,500 more experienced accountants and consultants, said Dan Black, director of recruiting for the Americas. \u201cWhether it\u2019s dealing with taxes, regulations or technology, our clients want help,\u201d Mr. Black said.Nearly all the positions, whether entry-level or for more experienced workers, require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, underscoring how crucial credentials and specialized skills have become in today\u2019s job market.\u201cFor experienced talent, it\u2019s a dogfight,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cIn 2008 and 2009, as companies cut back, we had our pick of the litter. Now it\u2019s much more competitive.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the response of bond trading to the jobs report. Bond yields went up after the release of the report; they did not go down.Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Status of Museums Questioned by Senators", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Senate Finance Committee is scrutinizing nearly a dozen private museums opened by individual collectors, questioning whether the tax-exempt status they enjoy provides sufficient public benefit to justify what amounts to a government subsidy.Republican committee staff members said the inquiry was part of a broader effort by Mr. Hatch to re-examine bedrock institutions, including museums and private universities, that have long enjoyed preferential tax treatment.\u201cTax-exempt museums should focus on providing a public good and not the art of skirting around the tax code,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in an email statement. \u201cWhile more information is needed to ensure compliance with the tax code, one thing is clear: Under the law, these organizations have a duty to promote the public interest, not those of well-off benefactors, plain and simple.\u201dA broad debate about the personal and corporate tax system has emerged yet again as an important element in the presidential campaign. But little attention has been paid to the longstanding charitable deductions for museums, nonprofit theaters and other institutions \u2014 an exemption that is zealously defended by both donors and recipients.The Hatch letter noted that \u201ccharitable organizations have an important role in promoting good in our society,\u201d but questioned whether \u201csome private foundations are operating museums that offer minimal benefit to the public while enabling donors to reap substantial tax advantages.\u201d\u201cSuch an arrangement would be inconsistent with the letter and intent\u201d of the law, it added.As investors have poured money into the skyrocketing art market, financial consultants and tax experts have said that many wealthy individuals are looking to convert their personal collections into private foundations or museums as a way of reducing their tax bills.Founders can deduct not only the full market value of the art they buy, but also the value of cash and stocks they donate. The cost of insuring, conserving, warehousing and other expenses associated with a masterwork\u2019s upkeep are also tax-free.Internal Revenue Service guidelines are vague when it comes to establishing the degree of public benefit that justifies an art institution\u2019s tax-exempt status. But public access and adequate signage are both considered prerequisites, according to previous agency rulings. There are also strict restrictions on displaying the art in a donor\u2019s own home.Aaron W. Fobes, the spokesman for the finance committee, said the panel\u2019s \u201cconcerns are confined to a small number of private foundations and are not something that is symptomatic of a larger problem in exempt organizations.\u201dSome tax experts have questioned whether some of the small, out-of-the-way museums that are on or close to a donor\u2019s property \u2014 like the Brant study center (founded by the newsprint magnate Peter Brant) or Glenstone (created by Mitchell Rales) \u2014 meet I.R.S. guidelines.Philippa Polskin, a spokeswoman for Glenstone, said in an email that the museum was \u201cgathering information in response to the questions sent by Senator Hatch and looks forward to sharing information with the committee about their efforts to build Glenstone into a world-class museum.\u201dSince the end of September, she said, \u201cwith future reservations already received, Glenstone is tracking toward a 12-month attendance of around 25,000 visitors.\u201d She added that the number of visitors is expected to increase four- or fivefold when a planned expansion is completed.The Brant Foundation did not respond to requests for comment, but it had previously defended the art center\u2019s charitable work and public service.The Rubells\u2019 45,000-square-foot contemporary art center, located in a former Drug Enforcement Administration warehouse in Miami, helped revitalize the surrounding Wynwood neighborhood when the family opened it in 1993. The center reports that tens of thousands of people visit the center every year.Several well-established art institutions, like the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, the Frick Collection in New York, the Phillips Collection in Washington and the Barnes Collection in Philadelphia, grew out of a wealthy art collector\u2019s private purchases.Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Huge Valeant Stake Exposes Rift at Sequoia Fund ", "Date": "2015-11-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor more than four decades, the Sequoia Fund has been the envy of Wall Street, one of the rare funds to consistently beat the market. Known for its close ties to Warren E. Buffett, the fund at its peak managed more than $9 billion. It was in such demand that it closed to new investors in 2013, a move that enhanced its mystique.At its peak this summer, Valeant represented 32 percent of the fund\u2019s portfolio, according to Sequoia, a hugely concentrated bet even for a fund like Sequoia, which invests in a smaller number of stocks than most funds.David Poppe, president of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, the New York investment firm that manages the Sequoia Fund, confirmed that the two directors had resigned over the Valeant position.\u201cThere was an ongoing debate over a considerable period of time, and they pushed us pretty hard on the level of concentration and why we were comfortable with that,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cAnd I think recent events frustrated them,\u201d he said, referring to Valeant\u2019s stock plunge. Still, the resignations came as a surprise. \u201cThey resigned within five minutes of each other on a Sunday,\u201d he said.From its inception in 1970 through the end of last year, Sequoia has been a top-performing fund, generating an annualized return of 14.5 percent a year, compared with 11 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Then came Sequoia\u2019s infatuation with Valeant. The fund began buying the pharmaceutical company\u2019s shares in 2010 and watched its share price rise inexorably as it bought existing drugs and raised their prices significantly, rather than trying to develop new drugs.But this summer, Valeant came under siege for its aggressive drug-pricing policies, its voracious appetite for acquisitions, its high debt level and its ties to a dubious pharmacy partner. Valeant\u2019s shares have plunged to about $75 this week from over $260 in August.Valeant, in turn, has dragged down Sequoia. Over the last three months, shares of Sequoia, which trade publicly as an open-end mutual fund, have dropped 22 percent, while the S.&P. 500 has been flat. During October, investors withdrew nearly $100 million from the fund.The Sequoia directors\u2019 resignations also revealed a growing estrangement between Sequoia and Mr. Buffett, who over the years has often praised the fund\u2019s management, performance and adherence to his value-oriented investment approach.After Mr. Buffett closed his investment partnership in 1969, Sequoia, founded by his close friend William J. Ruane, was the one fund he recommended to his clients. (Mr. Ruane died in 2005.) Mr. Buffett\u2019s company, Berkshire Hathaway, has been a core position for Sequoia: During the late 1990s, it reached 35 percent of the fund\u2019s assets, the only stock that has exceeded the size of its current position in Valeant. Berkshire is now its second-largest holding after Valeant, with the company\u2019s two classes of shares representing nearly 13 percent of the portfolio.When Sequoia was seeking new independent directors 12 years ago, Mr. Buffett recommended Ms. Osberg. In a 2006 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, she described Mr. Buffett as her best friend, and she has often spent Thanksgiving with him in Omaha. A former Wells Fargo executive, Ms. Osberg is perhaps best known as a world-class bridge player. She has won two world championships, and she and Mr. Buffett play bridge electronically four times a week.Ms. Osberg had been expressing her worries about Valeant at board meetings for over a year, and she grew so concerned that she insisted the discussions be reflected in the minutes. In recent weeks, Mr. Buffett advised Ms. Osberg on her predicament and agreed with her decision to resign after concluding she had done all she could as a board member. Ms. Osberg sold her stake in Sequoia shortly after resigning.Mr. Ahooja, a former Goldman Sachs partner, is also a friend and supporter of Ms. Osberg (though not a bridge partner) and she persuaded him to rejoin the board last year after he had resigned because of health issues.Many of Ms. Osberg\u2019s problems with Valeant echoed those expressed by executives at Berkshire Hathaway. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s vice chairman and a close business partner of Mr. Buffett, has been one of the most vocal critics of Valeant, whose aggressive pricing tactics he observed firsthand as chairman of Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. He has publicly called the company\u2019s practices \u201cdeeply immoral\u201d and its business strategy unsustainable. If anything, Mr. Buffett takes an even dimmer view of Valeant, though he has not been as outspoken.In the recent Sequoia directors\u2019 meeting, conducted by telephone, Mr. Poppe and Ruane Cunniff\u2019s chairman, Bob Goldfarb, defended the fund\u2019s large position in Valeant by comparing it with the fund\u2019s longtime investment in Berkshire Hathaway. Some independent directors were especially taken aback when Mr. Goldfarb defended the recent additional purchase of Valeant shares by repeating one of Mr. Buffett\u2019s favorite sayings: \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful.\u201dIn his conversation with me, Mr. Poppe also used Berkshire to defend his Valeant investment. He said that during the late 1990s, Berkshire Hathaway was 35 percent of the fund and had a period when it lost half its value, but it recovered and became one of the fund\u2019s best investments.But the comparison between Mr. Buffett, who has often said that he won\u2019t tolerate practices that are borderline unethical, and Valeant\u2019s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, was the last straw for Ms. Osberg. She and other people \u201csaid Buffett is nothing like Pearson,\u201d Mr. Poppe acknowledged. He agreed that \u201cBuffett is a different kind of investor and manager than Pearson, but there were still risks when we had such a big stake in Berkshire Hathaway. We had a third of our portfolio invested with a 69- or 70-year-old chief executive.\u201d (Mr. Buffett is now 85 and still chief executive at Berkshire Hathaway.)Mr. Poppe stressed that it\u2019s not up to fund directors like Ms. Osberg to make investment decisions. \u201cWe believed Valeant was one of our very best ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cBob and I make those decisions. It\u2019s not a team or management by committee. We listened to their input, but we felt strongly that we need to manage the fund as we see fit.\u201dAlan Palmiter, a law professor at Wake Forest University and an expert in mutual fund governance, said the board revolt at Sequoia was highly unusual. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of mutual fund directors ever quitting in protest of fund management. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s happened, but the world of mutual fund directors is one of \u2018go along to get along.\u2019\u201dMr. Poppe said shareholders understood that the fund\u2019s policy was to take concentrated positions in stocks the managers believed in, and then hold them long-term. Still, the fund has typically pruned positions as their valuations soared, and the concentration in Valeant seems an anomaly. The next biggest position after Berkshire Hathaway is just 5 percent of the portfolio, and most are less than 2 percent.Larry E. Swedroe, director of research at Buckingham Family of Financial Services and the author of several finance books, including one on Mr. Buffett, praised Sequoia\u2019s track record but said its outsize Valeant position was an accident waiting to happen.\u201cThere\u2019s no way Valeant could be considered a value stock,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at 100 times forward earnings. If they were a systematic value manager that followed certain statistical criteria, they would never have owned Valeant at that multiple, let alone let it get to nearly one-third of the portfolio.\u201d He added that successful investors often start to think they are smarter than everyone else. \u201cThen they start ignoring their own discipline,\u201d he said. \u201cHubris may have gotten to them.\u201dMr. Poppe conceded that he and his colleagues had not realized the level of risk that was in the stock at $260. \u201cWe\u2019re still surprised that the accusations, which certainly don\u2019t warrant the death of the company, would have led to a loss of two-thirds of its market value,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stock is trading on panic, not fundamentals. Hindsight will tell if we were smart or not so smart.\u201dHindsight, of course, already suggests that Sequoia\u2019s managers should have heeded Ms. Osberg\u2019s and other directors\u2019 warnings and sold or at least pruned the Valeant position in late summer, when the stock was over $200 and Sequoia was sitting on a huge gain. (Sequoia said it still has a net gain on its Valeant position because its early purchases were at such low prices.)At the insistence of the remaining three independent directors, Sequoia\u2019s managers have agreed not to buy any more Valeant shares, even at current depressed levels. On Tuesday, its shares traded as low as $73.70, nearing its intraday low of $73.32 reached last week, the stock\u2019s lowest price in more than two years.The last month has been \u201cpainful,\u201d Mr. Poppe said, but has also taught him a valuable lesson about owning companies with questionable business practices, even though those practices may be within the boundaries of the law. As he wrote in the fund\u2019s recent letter to shareholders, \u201cOne lesson of recent events is that sometimes doing everything legally permissible to maximize earnings does not create shareholder value.\u201dAn earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to Sequoia\u2019s status on the market. It is an open-end mutual fund, not a closed-end one.Advertisement"}

Buffett in 1964, in a letter to Howard L. Clark, chief executive of American Express.William A. Ackman is hoping for similar magic from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. At the end of his three-and-a-half-hour conference call last Friday defending his decision to pile 20 percent of his fund into Valeant stock, Mr. Ackman invoked the salad oil swindle.

Michael Pearson, to invest a substantial amount of money into the company, but promised rich equity-based compensation should the stock price appreciate. In other words, like any good hedge fund manager, Mr. Pearson put his own wealth at risk while getting exposure to tremendous upside should he create value for his investors.Since Mr. Pearson took the helm, Valeant has focused more on allocating its capital than researching and developing new drugs. It acquired dozens of companies, slashed overhead and research and development and raised prices to maximize profits. At the same time, Valeant borrowed heavily, and actively repurchased its own shares. This strategy ruffled a lot of feathers in the pharmaceutical industry, but Valeant shareholders rejoiced. According to FactSet, the stock was the second only to Apple among widely held hedge fund investments at the end of June.Valeant stock has since tumbled. The hedge fund darling has become the target of several prominent short-sellers, one of whom called Valeant the next Enron. At the center of the claims is a specialty pharmacy called Philidor Rx Services, which reportedly used improper sales tactics \u2014 including changing doctors\u2019 prescription orders \u2014 to secure payment for Valeant products from health insurers. Although Valeant employees are said to have worked at Philidor\u2019s offices since the company\u2019s early years, and even though Valeant paid $100 million for an option to purchase Philidor for $0, the company insists it does not control the pharmacy and is not liable for its misdeeds. Last Friday, after a week of scrutiny from regulators, journalists and short-sellers, Valeant announced it would sever ties with Philidor, forcing the pharmacy to cease operations.When Philidor is banished to the ranks of extinct businesses, it will join a company called the American Express Field Warehousing Corporation. The warehousing subsidiary of American Express collapsed after it unwittingly guaranteed the soybean oil inventory of Anthony De Angelis, whose background was so shady that his business could not even open a regular bank account. The scandal blew up in spectacular fashion in 1963, when Mr. De Angelis used warehouse receipts stamped with the American Express guarantee to open margin-trading accounts in a reckless attempt to corner the market in soybean oil. When Mr. DeAngelis\u2019s trade turned against him, it sank a brokerage firm with 20,000 customers holding half a billion dollars of stocks, and shut down the Produce Exchange for an entire day.American Express was far from blameless in the scandal. An anonymous tipster explained Mr. De Angelis\u2019s swindle to the company in 1960, including his method for filling tanks with seawater except for a narrow chamber of oil positioned under the measuring hatch. The accusations were largely ignored, and the fraud grew tenfold over the following three years, until American Express had guaranteed more soybean oil than actually existed in the entire country.After Mr. De Angelis\u2019s empire collapsed, American Express was left with scores of angry creditors demanding payment. Because the field warehousing business was housed in a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, Mr. Clark, the American Express chief executive, could have let the unit fail and ignore the liabilities. In a decision that activist shareholders would later sue the company over, Mr. Clark announced that American Express felt morally bound to honor the liabilities. The company settled with soybean oil claimants, the stock recovered and resumed its upward climb, and Mr. Clark credited the scandal with injecting new life into his employees.The difference between American Express after the salad oil swindle and Valeant Pharmaceuticals is bigger than Mr. Pearson\u2019s refusal to assume financial responsibility for Philidor\u2019s actions. Whereas American Express\u2019s field warehousing business had nothing to do with the company\u2019s rapidly growing credit card and its dominant traveler\u2019s checks franchise, Philidor and other specialty pharmacy partners play an important role in protecting profit margins on Valeant products.American Express proved to be a bonanza for its shareholders because its valuable brand survived a crisis at an obscure subsidiary operating in a different line of business. Valeant\u2019s Philidor scandal, by contrast, raises real questions about the company\u2019s growth prospects and the long-term viability of its aggressive business model. For Valeant investors, this is an altogether different proposition, and one with a vastly different risk profile, than the one Mr. Buffett faced with American Express.It can be dangerous to compare current investment opportunities to home runs from the annals of business history. A possible warning sign may be seen in a quiet insurrection at the Sequoia Fund, a Valeant shareholder that is one of the country\u2019s most respected mutual funds.When Mr. Buffett shut down his investment partnership in 1969, he recommended that his partners invest with his longtime friend William J. Ruane, who co-founded Sequoia the following year. The fund has since compiled a long history of market-beating returns. A big part of Sequoia\u2019s success was a huge position in Mr. Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which accounted for 35 percent of the portfolio by the end of 2004, shortly before Mr. Ruane\u2019s death.His successors drastically reduced the fund\u2019s dependence on Berkshire Hathaway. Sequoia used the proceeds to buy stock in Valeant, which many shareholders, including Mr. Ackman, have compared to a young Berkshire Hathaway. At the end of June, Sequoia held a stunning 29 percent of its portfolio in Valeant stock.Since then, two directors have left the Sequoia Fund board, reportedly because of concerns over the size of the Valeant position. It is exceedingly rare for directors to quit a mutual fund board because of disagreements over portfolio management.Valeant Pharmaceuticals may prove to be another in a line of gut-wrenching winners for Mr. Ackman. But when investors look at Valeant and see American Express in 1964 or Berkshire Hathaway in 1970, rather than an envelope-pushing pharmaceuticals vehicle run by a former McKinsey consultant wielding low-cost leverage and a scalpel, there\u2019s more than just fear in the air. There\u2019s clearly some greed as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market Changes May Prompt New Definition of Insider Trading", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe law of insider trading has not changed much since important Supreme Court rulings in the 1980s established a high bar for convictions.It was not enough that someone used confidential information for personal gain, the court said then; prosecutors had to prove that the person had committed a breach of duty \u2014 in other words, had violated a legal responsibility \u2014 in benefiting from that information.And in September \u2014 in one of the largest insider cases so far \u2014 the court held fast to that requirement by refusing to hear an appeal of a lower-court ruling that overturned the conviction of two prominent hedge fund portfolio managers in New York. They were charged with trading stocks based on nonpublic information that reaped profits of more than $72 million for their firms.But the court\u2019s recent decision did more than that. It also led to speculation in the legal world that the case would become its own kind of \u201ctipping point\u201d \u2014 a critical moment that would inspire the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek legislative action to toughen and expand the laws on insider trading. The speculation is fueled by the belief that the problem could get worse in the years ahead as information exchange becomes increasingly rapid, complex and exclusive to a technologically savvy few.Any attempt to change the ground rules for insider trading prosecutions will inevitably raise complex questions about what types of information and trading practices should be targeted.Traditional insider trading cases revolve around corporate developments, from an impending merger to more mundane information about quarterly earnings. Most charges involve relatively small amounts of money, ranging from a few thousand to perhaps a million dollars, although there are occasional situations like the prosecution of Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors, that involved more than $250 million.There is no question that these types of cases will remain illegal, even without any change in the law. Mr. Bharara conceded that the Newman decision would not affect 90 percent of the insider trading convictions his office obtained in the last few years.So if the definition of insider trading should be expanded, it is worth taking into account how the markets have changed since the Supreme Court established the contours of the prohibition to figure out what might come within a new law.Two developments are worthy of consideration: the rise of exchange-traded index funds and the growth of high-frequency trading algorithms, which execute transactions in the blink of an eye and account for an increasing share of the market.The value of E.T.F.s and their various offshoots has grown exponentially in the last decade, to more than $2 trillion today from about $250 billion. And they are becoming more exotic by the day, with funds based on physical commodities, triple-leveraged offerings that multiply investor gains and losses, and even funds that track the volatility of different markets rather than any particular securities.These funds are not immune to trading on confidential information, and indeed they may be even more vulnerable to manipulative conduct when they reflect just a sliver of the market. The temptation to tinker with an index is quite powerful, especially given the constant pressure on Wall Street to produce profits.We have seen global banks plead guilty and pay billions of dollars in penalties the last few years when traders have misreported interest rates to affect the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. As more specialized E.T.F.s proliferate, there may be efforts to put out information and adopt trading strategies designed to change the valuation of securities and investments underpinning an index, creating an opening to profit.Could information that affects a market index represent a new vehicle for insider trading? If so, then limiting insider trading to those who breach a fiduciary duty, as the law currently requires, may not be broad enough to counter misconduct in E.T.F. transactions.But corporate fundamentals are almost pass\u00e9 as more of the market is driven by high-frequency trading firms looking for a sliver of profits from a heavy volume of transactions, rarely holding a position for more than a day or two. These firms engage in different forms of what is known as \u201carbitrage,\u201d which is buying and selling securities and other assets across different markets to take advantage of small price differences that crop up.Insider trading is all about getting a leg up on the market by cashing in on information before other investors learn about it. The S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the first line of defense for investors, need to determine how new sources of information will shape the markets, and their potential for abuse by traders seeking unfair advantages. The challenge is to determine the extent to which informational advantages gained by high-frequency traders should be tolerated.Questions have been raised about whether these firms gain an unfair advantage from having access to information about the flow of orders and potential price changes just a few seconds before others do. Indeed, some exchanges sell an early peek at their trading data before it is available to the general public, which is quite unlike the information used in a typical insider trading case.The type of information that can move markets is changing because of sophisticated trading algorithms that can execute trades in milliseconds. The number of orders, the prices being offered or sought, and the type of order entered on an exchange can give important clues about the direction of prices \u2014 along with the temptation to create false impressions by submitting bids and quickly canceling them. That practice known as \u201cspoofing,\u201d which can fool algorithms by enticing them to trade in order to drive prices up or down, was outlawed by the Dodd-Frank Act.Yet, orders are canceled all the time, often for legitimate reasons. If an algorithm causes a high volume of cancellations, then proof of a violation without more evidence would depend on somehow divining the computer programmer\u2019s intent, which seems problematic if not utterly futile.Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys\u201d claimed that high-frequency trading based on small informational advantages has \u201crigged\u201d the stock market. Yet, the S.E.C. relies on some of that very rigging to help ensure that the markets operate properly.So while the law prohibits trading on confidential information obtained improperly, it says little about the types of information used by high-frequency traders to engage in arbitrage, such as whether installing their computers closer to an exchange or paying for access to information about the flow of orders might be improper. There is nothing inevitably nefarious about trading on this type of information; but it does mean that the investors may pay a bit more to buy or receive a lower price when selling, effectively taxing them in the name of greater market liquidity.Any change to insider trading law should confront the question of whether a line can be drawn around the types of information that these traders can use properly, and what practices cause too much harm to the markets and investors. Simply taking a hands-off approach to high-frequency trading fuels the perception that the markets are the rigged game that Mr. Lewis portrayed, producing profits from trading on information unavailable to ordinary investors \u2014 the very rationale for outlawing insider trading.A simplistic approach would be to limit or even eliminate many high-frequency trading practices, but that could involve substantial consequences as the market depends more and more on the liquidity these traders provide. Moreover, imposing restrictions on how high-frequency trading firms operate, or taxing them to reduce their volume, may not be any more realistic than mandating the use of rotary phones and handwritten orders, the way the market operated in the 1960s. Turning back the clock is not a viable strategy, and could affect the long-term health of the financial markets by curbing innovation that helps drive the financial sector.Informational advantages that help generate profits can be the reward for hard work and creative thinking. The challenge is figuring out when it is no longer effort but fraud that is generating the gains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks of Shopworn Watches Skyrocket", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven in a down market, somebody always benefits.Dealers who handle what are called shopworn watches \u2014 timepieces that just haven\u2019t found buyers \u2014 say that offers of such unsold stock have been skyrocketing. Retailers in Europe and the United States are trying to turn extra display pieces into revenue or to get rid of oversupply, the result of the general decline in high-end watch sales, particularly in China. And at the end of the shopworn sale chain, many of those watches are ending up on American wrists. \u201cPre-owned watches are truly a U.S. thing,\u201d said Maurice Goldberger, founder and chief executive of Chiron Inc., a Montreal-based buyer of shopworn watches. \u201cWe have seen growing interest in pre-owned in the Asian market over the last few years but still the majority of the Asian market prefers new.\u201dIt\u2019s a cultural difference that Mr. Goldberger believes is related to the American attitude toward retail. \u201cIn the U.S., if someone else takes the depreciation, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in Europe or Asia, if you don\u2019t buy new, it means you can\u2019t afford it and you lose face. It\u2019s cultural, simple as that.\u201dMr. Goldberger said his company is among those seeing a lot of growth recently. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a big business buying from retailers and reselling them as secondhand or shopworn or reused,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really taken off in the last year.\u201dSo far, he added, the company has bought between $35 million and $40 million worth of shopworn stock this year and passed it on to businesses that sell to the public \u2014 a sharp increase in the $5 million to $6 million worth of timepieces it handled in 2014.\u201cNext year, we\u2019ll be disappointed if it\u2019s less than $65 million to $70 million,\u201d Mr. Goldberger added. Mike Manjos of the jewelry chain Betteridge, based in Greenwich, Conn., said many retailers in the United States have \u201cseen a drop in demand from tourists, especially from Asia, as the dollar to Swiss franc has changed,\u201d the result of the Swiss central bank\u2019s decision in January to stop pegging the franc\u2019s value to the euro. But, he added, \u201cWe never had a large tourist business, so we have probably seen less of a demand drop than some others.\u201dSome European retailers also have been affected. Richard Birnbaum has been in the secondhand watch business with his brother for 16 years in New Jersey. He said they are now obtaining much of their stock from the Mediterranean region, including Italy, Greece, Malta, Spain and Portugal.\u201cAuthorized retailers in these countries for at least the last 10 years have counted on much of their business coming from Russian tourists,\u201d Mr. Birnbaum said. \u201cThose Russian tourists aren\u2019t coming anymore, and if they are coming, with the exchange rate of the ruble, they\u2019re not spending what they used to spend.\u201d\u201cThese authorized retailers traditionally might have had an 80 or 85 percent sell-through on the goods they bought from the top brands,\u201d Mr. Birnbaum said. \u201cToday they might be looking at only a 50 or 60 percent sell-through. That gives us a great opportunity to buy goods attractively.\u201dMr. Birnbaum said most of the watches they sell are really new \u2014 their only wear has come on the shop floor. \u201cIn many cases the watch has never even been on a human wrist,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut every night, being taken out of its case and put in the vault, and then every morning being taken out of the vault and put back in the showcase, that certainly puts wear on the watch \u2014 just handling it with your fingers twice a day.\u201dThe Betteridge chain takes a different approach. \u201cWe actually take our watches that are aged two-plus years and eliminate the warranty\u201d and sell them as pre-owned in the company\u2019s stores, Mr. Manjos said. Mr. Birnbaum said shopworn watches allow collectors to enjoy pieces that otherwise might be out of their price range.\u201cThe most sophisticated customer, who is a collector, realizes that if he makes a great deal on a shopworn piece, he can wear it for a couple of years and then go trade it in for not much less than he paid for it,\u201d he said.As for the next 12 months, Mr. Goldberger said he expected retailers to be more cautious about orders, but he added that anything was possible.\u201cWe can\u2019t predict further than a month or two,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, retailers, brands, distributors need to play much closer to the month, rather than the year. These are interesting times.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Companies Trying to Mimic Private Firms", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking the Long ViewIt was one of the biggest rebukes of the public markets in recent memory \u2014 and it may not be the last.In October, just two years after Dell\u2019s management took the company off the stock market to make it a private company, Dell announced one of the biggest technology acquisitions ever.Investors are also throwing money at companies that have never been on the public markets. Uber, the young ride-sharing company, has managed to raise $8 billion without showing its books to the world, for instance.In fact, there is evidence that companies are avoiding going public \u2014 or like Dell, withdrawing from the public markets \u2014 even though the stock market is supposed to provide the lowest-cost, most responsive place to raise money. Currently, 5,303 companies are listed on United States stock exchanges, down 35 percent from 8,160 companies some 20 years ago, according to data from Weild & Company.Economists and stock market experts often place much of the blame for the decline on new regulations that have been introduced over the last 20 years. These, they say, increase the costs and burdens of being public for many companies.But three academics, puzzled by the drop in stock market listings, recently carried out research that suggested another cause: Companies may be avoiding the stock market so they can be free of the short-term pressures that can undermine corporate performance over time.The paper\u2019s authors are John Asker, a professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles; Joan Farre-Mensa, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School; and Alexander Ljungqvist, a professor of finance at the New York University Stern School of Business. Their standout finding is that \u201cprivate firms invest substantially more than public ones on average, holding firm size, industry and investment opportunities constant.\u201dThe inference is clear. Freed from the obligations of being public \u2014 disclosing quarterly results, making earnings projections and dealing with investors\u2019 reactions to disappointments \u2014 corporate executives may feel they can take the risk of investing more. Ambitious investment projects can bring unexpected hits to earnings and periods of greater uncertainty, the sorts of things that can cause public shareholders to sell now and think later. But a private company can plow ahead, more or less regardless.The researchers found that private companies not only invest more than public ones, but also that they are more responsive to changes in investment opportunities. Other researchers had reached somewhat similar conclusions. But Mr. Asker, Mr. Farre-Mensa and Mr. Ljungqvist said they were able to go further because they had access to \u201ca rich new database\u201d of private company financial information assembled by the firm Sageworks, which gave them a comprehensive look at how such companies behave.Still, public companies may not want to talk to their bankers about going private just yet.Also, shielded from the limelight, owners of private companies may treat their firms as personal fiefs. And away from the scrutiny that comes with the public markets, young technology firms may be able to play down or cover up flaws in their businesses.Perhaps more important, there is a third way. A public company can simply behave as if it were private.Some of the most beloved companies on the stock market try to mimic private firms. Often, this approach requires a chief executive who has a strong long-term bent and could not care less about the ups and downs of public markets. Such executives might of course include well-known figures like Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon. But analysts say plenty of other executives, often in the less glamorous reaches of corporate America, aim for the long term.Take Charles Fabrikant, chief executive of Seacor Holdings. Seacor focuses on providing equipment to the offshore oil and gas industries. As the company has navigated many vicious energy cycles since it went public in 1992, its stock has risen more than 800 percent, compared with nearly 400 percent for the wider market. It does not give out earnings guidance or hold quarterly conference calls.\u201cYou need to think like a private owner,\u201d Mr. Fabrikant said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t make an investment with the expectation that it will produce the returns that you hope for in quarters, or semesters, or sometimes years.\u201dAnother company off the beaten track is Middleby, based in Elgin, Ill., whose core business is making ovens for restaurant chains. Its stock is up over 800 percent in the last 10 years, more than 10 times as much as the market over the same period. \u201cThese guys are the antithesis of \u2018We\u2019ve got to hit the number this quarter,\u2019\u201d said C. Schon Williams, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. \u201cThey don\u2019t give guidance. It goes back to this being a long-term game.\u201dBut do public companies that aim for the long term actually outperform other public companies?Amazon has sat at the center of this debate for years.The company has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. It has invested heavily over that period, often sacrificing profits in the process. Investors who are bullish on Amazon\u2019s stock assert that the investments will one day produce industry-beating returns, while critics argue that such returns should have materialized by now, given that the company is not exactly young anymore. Amazon is still reporting a relatively meager amount of net income.Still, the bulls seem to be gaining the edge. Analysts have a yardstick that they say does more than others to determine the fundamental performance of a company over time. It is free cash flow, or the actual cash generated by the company\u2019s operations after subtracting what it spends on investing in its own business.From Wall Street to Washington and in the towers of academia, people are buzzing about what some say is the pernicious focus in corporate America on short-term profits.For the 12 months through the end of September, Amazon\u2019s free cash flow totaled $5.4 billion, a 400 percent increase from the $1.07 billion in free cash flow that the company recorded for the 12 months through the end of September 2014. Amazon\u2019s free cash flows look weaker if the money spent on lease payments is included. But even with this adjustment, Amazon\u2019s cash flows are surging. At the very least, Amazon does not appear to be as profligate as the skeptics say.Berkshire Hathaway is a big test case for the notion that the long-term approach produces better results.Mr. Buffett is famous for buying companies outright and allowing their existing managers to chart a course for themselves. \u201cMost of our managers are independently wealthy, and it\u2019s therefore up to us to create a climate that encourages them to choose working with Berkshire over golfing or fishing,\u201d he wrote in Berkshire\u2019s latest annual report.Within the walls of Berkshire, they are theoretically insulated from short-term pressures.Many companies in the Berkshire stable compete with stand-alone public companies, making some comparisons possible. In 2010, for instance, Berkshire acquired the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe. From 2010 to the end of 2014, its operating income grew by 11 percent, exactly the same as the average rate for five of its United States and Canadian peers, according to an analysis by The New York Times.Burlington Northern\u2019s average revenue growth over the same period has been slightly higher than that of the peer group (8 percent vs. 7 percent), but its operating profit as a percentage of revenue, or its operating margin, was slightly lower. The margin for the company was 29 percent, compared with 31 percent for its peers. Still, Burlington Northern may have the edge, at least for now. Recent railroad traffic figures suggest that it is pulling away from the others this year.Berkshire\u2019s enormous insurance businesses lend themselves to a similar exercise. Geico, the auto insurer, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire in 1996. But being part of Berkshire may not have made Geico significantly more profitable than some of its closest rivals.Analysts measure an insurer\u2019s profitability with something called the combined ratio, which measures a company\u2019s insurance payouts and its expenses as a percentage of the premiums paid by its customers. The further the ratio is below 100 percent, the better. Geico\u2019s 10-year average combined ratio is 92.9 percent, according to an analysis by A.M. Best. That\u2019s a very strong result, but the average ratio of Progressive, a rival of Geico, is marginally better at 92.6 percent, according to A.M. Best.Still, as a Berkshire company, Geico has grown faster than many of its rivals to become the second-largest provider of private passenger insurance. And part of Geico\u2019s growth is a result of its willingness to spend huge sums on marketing. Its annual advertising bill is well over $1 billion.Long-term-focused managers at public companies often have a belief system that helps keeps their goals clear and tunes out unhelpful noise. At Berkshire, that comes in the form of \u201cintrinsic value,\u201d which Mr. Buffett describes as \u201can all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses.\u201dMr. Fabrikant of Seacor has to try to invest wisely in assets whose values can swing wildly through the booms and busts of the energy sector. \u201cIt requires patience and understanding potential changes in the market and in technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it requires understanding the current cost of capital and the future cost of capital, and a deep understanding of what it would cost to replace that asset.\u201dEven so, Mr. Fabrikant would rather not have had to deal with the demands of being public. \u201cIf I could do it over, yes, I would be private,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Success Metrics Questioned in School Program Funded by Goldman", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was, in the vernacular of corporate America, a win-win: a bond that paid for preschool for underprivileged children in Utah while also making money for investors.Goldman Sachs announced last month that its investment in a Utah preschool program had helped 109 \u201cat-risk\u201d kindergartners avoid special education. The investment also resulted in a $260,000 payout for the Wall Street firm, the first of many payments that is expected from the investment.Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah hailed the program as a model for a new way of financing public projects. Such so-called social impact bonds are a new kind of public-private partnership, promising financing from Wall Street and imposing a goal on local governments.Yet since the Utah results were disclosed, questions have emerged about whether the program achieved the success that was claimed. Nine early-education experts who reviewed the program for The New York Times quickly identified a number of irregularities in how the program\u2019s success was measured, which seem to have led Goldman and the state to significantly overstate the effect that the investment had achieved in helping young children avoid special education.Goldman said its investment had helped almost 99 percent of the Utah children it was tracking avoid special education in kindergarten. The bank received a payment for each of those children. The big problem, researchers say, is that even well-funded preschool programs \u2014 and the Utah program was not well funded \u2014 have been found to reduce the number of students needing special education by, at most, 50 percent. Most programs yield a reduction of closer to 10 or 20 percent.The program\u2019s unusual success \u2014 and the payments to Goldman that were in direct proportion to that success \u2014 were based on what researchers say was a faulty assumption that many of the children in the program would have needed special education without the preschool, despite there being little evidence or previous research to indicate that this was the case.\u201cWe\u2019re all happy if Goldman Sachs makes money as long as they are making it with smart investments that make a real difference,\u201d said Clive Belfield, an economics professor at Queens College in New York, who studies early childhood education. \u201cHere they seem to have either performed a miracle, or these kids weren\u2019t in line for special education in the first place.\u201dThe concerns about the program are a reminder of how hard it is to properly structure public-private partnerships like social impact bonds, which depend on easily verifiable and commonly agreed-upon methods of measuring success for goals that can be hard to define, such as student success.Finding such measurements is increasingly important as government programs face cutbacks, and public officials look to find private investors willing to address the funding gap. Social impact bonds have been described as one of the most promising ways to harness this money. Indeed, these bonds will be the focus of a conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Wednesday, when the mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter, and a representative from the White House will speak, along with the Goldman executive who oversaw the Utah program.But the criticism of the Utah program points to issues that could hinder the wider adoption of the concept of social impact bonds. Kenneth A. Dodge, a professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke, who has been an advocate for the pay-for-success model, said that if the model was to succeed it would have to be done differently than it was in Utah.\u201cIt is a step in the right direction, but this is not the criteria I hope we hold ourselves to ultimately,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for Goldman, Leslie Shribman, deferred questions about the methods used to determine the payments it had received to Utah officials, who she said had developed the methodology.\u201cWe were approached by community leaders in Utah to help address an important local priority,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSocial impact bonds allow the government to avoid paying for programs that don\u2019t work. In this case, targets were set publicly, impact was measured transparently, and the government paid for success based on those targets.\u201dBrenda Van Gorder, director of preschool services at the local school district, said she was happy with the program because it had induced Goldman to pay for a program that the state would not have otherwise supported.But she and the researcher who tested the local children, Mark Innocenti, acknowledged that they lacked certain basic data on what would have been expected to have happened to the students without the Goldman-funded preschool, and the difference in the performance of the students in the program versus other similar students who did not attend preschool.\u201cIf we had the data \u2014 if we could follow kids without intervention \u2014 we would be able to come up with a clearer idea of what is happening,\u201d said Mr. Innocenti, a researcher at Utah State University. \u201cTime for another study, I guess.\u201dEarly-childhood education experts said that the results from Utah should have been viewed skeptically from the start, just based on the amount of money being spent on the program.Ms. Van Gorder said the preschool that the bank had paid for cost $1,700 a year for every student, or barely enough to cover the cost of part-time day care. Some of the children Goldman paid for were sent not to preschool but to a local day care center or Y.M.C.A., according to Ms. Van Gorder.The preschools that have been found, in previous research, to reduce the future need for special education usually cost four or five times what Goldman spent in Utah.\u201cThere are hundreds of studies of programs like this, and none of them find a large positive impact,\u201d said W. Steven Barnett, the director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. \u201cYou have to spend real money to get results.\u201dThe rate of success being reported by Goldman \u2014 and the success of the whole program \u2014 is a product of the program\u2019s method of identifying a population of low-income 3- and 4-year-olds who were likely to need special education without preschool.The school district tested each incoming preschool student using a picture and vocabulary test known as the P.P.V.T. Any child who, before entering preschool, received a score below 70, a very low score, was labeled likely to later need special education.For Goldman, the children identified in this way were crucial to its investment, because the bank was paid for each at-risk child who ended up not needing special education after leaving the preschool program.But early childhood experts said it made little sense to base Goldman\u2019s payouts on the assumption that all of the children who scored low on the P.P.V.T. test would end up in special education without the preschool.At the most basic level, the P.P.V.T. is not usually a test used to screen for special education, particularly on its own, education experts said. What is more, non-English-speaking students have been shown to score very poorly on the test when it is administered in English, which is not a sign of any learning disability, but of a need for English instruction.\u201cTo just assume that all these children would have gone to special education is kind of ridiculous,\u201d said Ellen S. Peisner-Feinberg, a senior scientist at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute.Mr. Innocenti, who administered the tests in Utah, said that from 30 to 50 percent of the children in the preschool program come from homes where English is not the only language. He said the school decided to test the children in English, despite the many non-English-speaking children, because the preschool program is conducted in English.Before Goldman executives made the investment, they could see that the Utah school district\u2019s methodology was leading large numbers of children to be identified as at-risk, thus elevating the number of children whom the school district could later say were avoiding special education. From 2006 to 2009, 30 to 40 percent of the children in the preschool program scored below 70 on the P.P.V.T., even though typically just 3 percent of 4-year-olds score this low. Almost none of the children ended up needing special education.When Goldman negotiated its investment, it adopted the school district\u2019s methodology as the basis for its payments. It also gave itself a generous leeway to be paid pack. As long as 50 percent of the children in the program avoid special education, Goldman will earn back its money and 5 percent interest \u2014 more than Utah would have paid if it had borrowed the money through the bond market. If the current rate of success continues, it will easily make more than that.Ms. Peisner-Feinberg said that before these sorts of investment are considered again, investors and schools needed better ways to measure them.\u201cYou have to be sure you have very rigorous ways of measuring the impact to make sure that it\u2019s legitimate in terms of the outcome you get,\u201d she said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It comes at a time when so-called interdealer brokers have been hurt by lower trading volumes as they face uncertainty in the global markets and higher regulatory costs.The deal would include ICAP\u2019s global brokering business; associated technology and brokerage platforms, including its electronic interest-rate swap platform iSwap; ICAP\u2019s associated information services revenue; and some of ICAP\u2019s joint ventures.Under the agreement, Tullett Prebon would issue about 309.9 million new shares in the combined company to ICAP and its shareholders. Once the deal is complete, ICAP and its shareholders would own about 56 percent of Tullett Prebon, with the remainder held by Tullett Prebon\u2019s existing investors.As part of the deal, Tullett Prebon would take on about 330 million pounds, or about $500 million, in gross debt.The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to be completed next year.Tullett Prebon said it expected to achieve cost savings of at least \u00a360 million from the deal, primarily by eliminating duplicated management and support costs. The combined business would employ about 5,500 people.ICAP\u2019s global brokering business acts as an intermediary for businesses and individuals looking to trade a variety of asset classes, including bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates and stocks.The global brokering business focuses on so-called voice brokering, in which orders are negotiated on the phone, rather than through electronic orders, as well as a hybrid of voice brokering and electronic trading. It had 1,458 voice brokers as of the end of March.The business operates in 35 locations in 22 countries, including one in Jersey City.It is by far ICAP\u2019s largest revenue generator, but it has experienced declining revenue in recent years and has been less profitable than the company\u2019s remaining businesses, which include electronic trading and post-trade services.Michael Spencer, the ICAP chief executive, called the transaction a \u201chistoric moment for both companies.\u201dAfter the deal\u2019s completion, Ken Pigaga, ICAP\u2019s chief operating officer, would leave ICAP to join Tullett Prebon\u2019s board and become its chief operating officer.Mr. Spencer would hold the honorary title of president of Tullett Prebon and would be available to advise its board, but would not become a director.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s website offered no information about Mr. Xu.The Chinese leader presided over a meeting on Monday of the Communist Party\u2019s leading group on financial issues. State news media said that he had been joined by three of the six other members of the standing committee of the Politburo, the most powerful body in China\u2019s system.Summarizing Mr. Xi\u2019s speech, the state news media said that the president had called for stock markets to be better regulated so that investors are treated fairly. China\u2019s stock markets have long had a reputation for chronic insider trading and other abuses.\u201cWe must prevent and ease financial risks,\u201d the official news agency Xinhua cited Mr. Xi as saying. \u201cAccelerate the formation of stock markets that have full financing functions, robust institutions, effective market supervision, and full protection of investors\u2019 rights and interests.\u201dThe concern over the stability of financial markets coincides with new indications of China\u2019s economic doldrums. Consumer price data released on Tuesday was weaker than expected, and trade figures on Sunday showed persistent weakness in demand. Economic growth has slipped below 7 percent.Allowing married couples to have two children will most likely increase the number of entrants into the labor market and reduce the proportion of older people dependent on others for care, Wang Pei\u2019an, a vice minister of the National Health and Planning Commission, told a news conference in Beijing. The net long-term effect could lift economic growth rate by about 0.5 of a percentage point, Mr. Wang said.Until now, most urban couples have been allowed only one child, although it has been common for rural couples to have two or more children. Mr. Wang said that the relaxation of rules governing family size would bring more than 30 million new entrants into the labor force by 2050, and that the proportion of older people in China\u2019s total population would be reduced by about 2 percentage points. In China, the term elderly typically refers to those who are 65 or older.Experts agree that the new policy will bring an additional 17 million births by about 2020, said Yang Wenzhuang, another health and family planning official at the news conference.\u201cIn the near term, it has a direct boost,\u201d Mr. Yang said, noting that the changed policy would help companies that sell products for infants and mothers. \u201cIn the longer term, research from the Academy of Social Sciences has shown the impact on the potential growth rate will be about 0.5 percent.

{"Headline": "HEB Grocery Chain to Give Stock to 55,000 Employees", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the plight of low-wage retail workers has gained national attention, HEB, a regional grocery chain and one of Texas\u2019 largest private employers, is giving 55,000 employees an equity stake in the company.The Butt family, which founded the San Antonio-based grocer 110 years ago, is handing an estimated 15 percent of the company\u2019s shares to employees over 21 years old who have worked at least a year at the retailer and clocked at least 1,000 hours in a calendar year.Managers at the retailer, which runs 370 stores in Texas and Mexico and had $23 billion in net sales this year, started informing employees who qualify on Monday, according to the company.The plan is intended to recognize workers\u2019 contributions and foster loyalty to the company, and enhance their long-term financial stability, said Craig Boyan, HEB\u2019s president and chief operating officer. Under the plan, workers are able to cash out when they leave or retire from the company, and will also receive dividends based on the retailer\u2019s earnings.\u201cSo many in retail are competing in the race to the bottom, and people are the largest cost. So it seems logical to cut people, and lots of folks are doing it,\u201d Mr. Boyan said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a trap. We believe the race for the bottom cheapens the American experience. It\u2019s bad for the country and bad for companies.\u201dMr. Boyan continued: \u201cWe think there is great benefit in a more empowered, inspired, proud, trained work force.\u201dHEB, started by Florence Butt as a tiny grocery store in Kerrville, Tex., would not be the first supermarket to experiment with employee ownership. Publix Super Markets, based in Lakeland, Fla., and WinCo Foods, based in Boise, Idaho, both attracted attention for their majority employee-owned status, as well as their rapid growth, which have earned them the moniker \u201cWalmart slayers.\u201dBut HEB\u2019s outright gifting of shares to a wide swath of employees is unusual. Starting in January, eligible workers \u2014 the retailer calls its workers \u201cpartners\u201d \u2014 are set to receive a grant of nonvoting shares valued at 3 percent of their salary, as well as $100 in stock for each year of continuous service.\u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s free money, pretty much,\u201d said Veronica Solis, 39, who joined HEB in high school, bagging groceries, and now handles payroll at a San Antonio store. \u201cI\u2019m going to retire from here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dThe retailer said it would continue to make yearly contributions to the stock plan, based on company performance. About 55,000 of the chain\u2019s 86,000 full- and part-time employees are expected to receive shares. Employees in Mexico are not eligible, for now, because federal laws that set standards for pension and health plans do not apply there.HEB is now run by Charles Butt, grandson of Ms. Butt, and he and his family are ranked as the 44th-richest in the United States, worth an estimated $10.7 billion.HEB says the minimum starting pay for its cashiers is already $10.25, and that wage level is set to rise again next year to account for inflation. The retailer also offers health care coverage to employees who work more than 28 hours a week, as well as a company-matched 401(k) plan, which will be unaffected by the new stock ownership plan.Mr. Butt, HEB\u2019s chairman and chief executive, declined to comment on the push for a $15 hourly wage. Still, he said by email, technological advances in sourcing and distribution should allow retailers to pay their workers more.\u201cPay and the price of food in our stores are of course inextricably linked. It\u2019s a trade-off with which I have struggled all my business life,\u201d Mr. Butt said. \u201cNothing is more price-sensitive than food. Nevertheless, we don\u2019t see the conflict as immutable.\u201d An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a worker at HEB. She is Veronica Solis, not Belise. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plan for New Stock Exchange Stirs Furious Debate ", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA proposal to create the first new American stock exchange in five years has set off a fierce debate over how to solve problems created by increasingly complex and high-speed stock markets.Simply put, the application submitted by IEX to regulators in September explains that as an exchange it intends to use a 350-microsecond \u201cspeed bump\u201d to stand in the way of traders that place and cancel orders more frequently than that.The speed bump concept, which has already been tested on IEX\u2019s private trading venue, has won the company support from many large investors who have filed letters in support of the IEX application.But the proposal has also drawn criticism from the other large stock exchange companies, a coalition of high-speed-trading firms and, perhaps most troublesome for IEX, one of the largest companies handling retail stock trades from ordinary investors, Citadel, the huge Chicago-based investment firm founded by Kenneth C. Griffin. Those companies have all said that IEX will introduce one more complex wrinkle that will end up benefiting one set of market participants over another, rather than leveling the playing field.IEX responded in a letter on Monday that its methods were the best way to protect investors who do not depend on placing and canceling orders quickly.The debate raises larger questions about the best way to improve a stock market that has grown remarkably fragmented and complicated over the last decade.There are already 11 officially sanctioned public stock exchanges in the United States and dozens more dark pools, or private forums, where traders can interact without posting their prices publicly. This complexity has been blamed for some of the technical errors that have brought down trading for hours at a time at several points in recent years.The fragmentation has also allowed high-speed traders to dart back and forth between exchanges and take advantage of investors on exchanges where prices are not updated as quickly.IEX and its outspoken chief executive, Brad Katsuyama, have said that the answer to any problems should come from market participants, not from regulators.In a letter to the S.E.C., Capital Group, a large mutual fund manager and an investor in IEX, wrote that the automation of the financial markets in recent years had largely worked to the advantage of investors of all stripes. But Capital Group\u2019s chairman, Timothy D. Armour, said that the current markets allowed for some new problems such as \u201cpredatory high-frequency trading\u201d that IEX could help deter.Investors like the Capital Group have blamed several practices at existing stock exchanges for opening the door to predatory trading strategies.Most exchanges currently offer so-called rebates to certain traders, which can encourage high-speed firms to rapidly flip shares to collect the rebates. IEX is doing away with rebates. IEX is also doing away with the lengthy list of order types that most other exchanges use and that play to the advantage of investors who understand the details of each order type.But the biggest change introduced by IEX is its 350-microsecond speed bump \u2014 the length of time it takes data to travel 38 miles of fiber optic cable.IEX\u2019s proposal notes that other exchanges already introduce similar delays for their investors \u2014 some because of their location, in Chicago, say, rather than in New York, and some because they offer shorter delays for high-speed-trading firms that pay to have computers located directly in an exchange\u2019s data center. IEX aims to eliminate these differences by imposing the same delay on every user.That proposal faced strong criticism from the other exchanges and from Citadel, which handles a significant volume of stock trades from retail brokerages like TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab.In its letter on Monday, IEX contested Citadel\u2019s suggestion that the 350-microsecond delay would prove a disadvantage to any group in particular, other than those traders that rely primarily on speed.An article on Tuesday about the Investors Exchange and its application to create a stock exchange misstated the length of the \u201cspeed bump\u201d that it would use to slow down high-speed trading. It is 350 microseconds, not 350 milliseconds.Advertisement"}

And that man, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, thinks there isn\u2019t nearly enough thinking about it.To Mr. Fink, there isn\u2019t enough preparation for retirement. There isn\u2019t enough thinking about what prolonged stock buybacks mean. There isn\u2019t enough work being done to shore up the country\u2019s infrastructure.Mr. Fink noted that companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 100-stock index are paying out 108 percent of their earnings to shareholders.\u201cThat can\u2019t last,\u201d he said.As one of the world\u2019s biggest overseers of exchange-traded funds, baskets of stocks that function much the same as mutual funds, BlackRock has been working to address issues that arose with E.T.F.s this summer, he said. But the market has been saturated with what he believes is too much extreme alarm over those troubles.When asked about various governmental issues, Mr. Fink offered a mixed report card. He raised a familiar complaint about the lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the nation\u2019s infrastructure, but he said that financial regulators have thought long and hard about whether to deem investment managers like BlackRock as systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to stricter oversight.\u201cToday, they\u2019re looking at activities of all asset managers,\u201d he said, adding that he believes the day is approaching when regulators will test mutual funds for financial stress.

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Attracts Investors in Midst of ESPN Woes", "Date": "2015-11-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLOS ANGELES \u2014 FOR roughly a decade, ever since the DVD market started to implode, movie studios have been investor afterthoughts. Hits? Misses? Ho-hum, and back to the cable networks. With its steadily climbing subscriber fees, the Wall Street theory has held, cable would always save the day for the media conglomerates.The question is whether that is sustainable. Analysts say the takeaway is clear: Investors care about subscriber attrition at ESPN, part of a cable unit that provided about 45 percent of Disney\u2019s operating income in fiscal 2015. But they care more, for now, about Walt Disney Studios, which will restart the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie series on Dec. 18 after a decade of theatrical dormancy. Disney plans a \u201cStar Wars\u201d-related film once a year through 2020, roughly when \u201cStar Wars\u201d theme park attractions are expected to open in Florida and California.Wall Street expects \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d to take in at least $1.5 billion worldwide. Some analysts predict $2 billion or more. Tim Nollen of Macquarie Securities has estimated that mountains of related merchandise could generate an additional $5 billion in revenue over the next year.The exuberant expectations have, in effect, shifted the conversation about Disney in an unusual way, analysts say, toward a movie\u2019s potential to deliver otherworldly riches and away from the challenges buffeting the broader cable and broadcast television businesses, including the cracks in ESPN\u2019s once-impregnable armor. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how Disney (or market psychology) has been able to divert the focus\u201d away from a decelerating ESPN, Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note on Nov. 18. \u201cNow the single most frequent question we get regarding Disney is, \u2018What\u2019s in your model for \u201cStar Wars\u201d?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Juenger added, \u201cWe do have concern, however, that once \u2018Star Wars\u2019 is digested, the focus will return to affiliate fees.\u201dFor the last six months of its fiscal year, which ended on Oct. 3, Walt Disney Studios had operating income of $1 billion, a 51 percent increase from the same period a year earlier.

{"Headline": "Shire Turns Focus to an Easier Deal for Dyax", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe Dyax Corporation has proved easier prey for Shire than Baxalta, but it\u2019s far from cheap.Midway through its proposed deal for Baxalta, Shire, an Irish pharmaceutical company, is offering $6 billion for Dyax, a developer of a treatment against a rare swelling disorder. The deal relies on bold assumptions and could take years to pay off.Buying Dyax, based in Massachusetts, is probably at most a distraction. Shire is struggling to persuade the management of Baxalta to accept an all-share deal. Given the falling share prices of drug companies in recent months, Shire may be willing to take a breather anyway.Shire is offering $5.9 billion up front and $646 million if Dyax\u2019s main pipeline drug is approved by United States regulators. That\u2019s $2.2 billion more than its undisturbed market capitalization. Shire expects to cut costs by only $50 million in 2017 and $100 million by 2019. Taxed at say 18 percent, and capitalized at 10 times, those might be worth $820 million, well below the premium on offer.Although Dyax is not presently making a profit, tax cuts could also help because of Shire\u2019s Irish domicile. The median forecast of analysts is for the firm to generate pretax profit of $317 million in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon. Assuming Shire can bring Dyax\u2019s rate down to 18 percent, that would create some $53 million of additional earnings. Capitalized at Shire\u2019s historical multiple of 18 times, those would be worth nearly $1 billion.Yet the deal is about more than ripping out costs. Shire thinks it can bolster Dyax\u2019s main product, a drug for treating a potentially fatal swelling disorder called hereditary angioedema, or HAE, to up to $2 billion of annual sales. That\u2019s bullish: Cowen, a broker, was estimating just over $1 billion by 2025.Shire also needs to protect its own HAE business, which is threatened by Dyax\u2019s as-yet-unapproved drug, DX-2930. By bringing the different treatments together, Shire thinks it can create a global leader and reap benefits from a strong market position and common infrastructure. It believes that roughly 60 percent of HAE patients are not yet diagnosed.Even if the deal works, Shire does not expect to cover its cost of capital until 2019. That may be why markets are struggling to see the value of the deal: Shire\u2019s share price fell, even as pharmaceutical stocks rose.Shire\u2019s track record in deal-making is solid, but a lukewarm reaction shows that market support cannot be assumed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elliott Management Appoints Jonathan Pollock as Co-Chief Executive", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor most of its 38 years, Elliott Management has been a lucrative hedge fund run solely by its founder, the billionaire Paul E. Singer, a man known for his hard-nosed trades and outsize influence in politics.Now for the first time, Mr. Singer will run the $27 billion investment firm with a partner who first joined 26 years ago by answering an employment ad in The Wall Street Journal.Elliott told its staff of more than 350 employees on Monday that it had appointed as co-chief executive Jonathan Pollock, who will help to steer the hedge fund as it continues to grow.Though Mr. Pollock and Mr. Singer insisted that the promotion was in some ways a formality \u2014 Mr. Pollock, 52, had already performed most of the responsibilities of the job in recent years as co-chief investment officer \u2014 it was a nod to the fact that at some point Elliott\u2019s 71-year-old founder will step down.That day, however, is not coming anytime soon, Mr. Singer said in an interview last week in the firm\u2019s Midtown Manhattan offices, a few blocks from Central Park. But it is a recognition that the hedge fund, known for publicly shaking up companies and, most recently, for waging a protracted court battle with Argentina over its defaulted debt, has grown far bigger than one man.\u201cThe impulse that creates hedge funds is independence and creativity,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cThe challenge is building a team,\u201d he added, touching on the biggest test for hedge funds today.One of the biggest trials for firms, almost always started by one or two individuals, has been to turn them into institutions that last beyond their founders.Many of the industry\u2019s founding hedge fund titans have retired in recent years, choosing to close up shop. Some, like Julian Robertson, the well-known founder of Tiger Management, and Stanley F. Druckenmiller, the founder of Duquesne Capital, returned money to investors and now focus on managing only their own money.Whether a hedge fund founder has a clear succession plan or not is a question frequently asked by investors, many of them pension funds and institutional investors who will keep their money with one manager for the long term, sometimes for decades.The industry has also battled through several difficult months. Market gyrations have left many managers and their investors nursing large losses as once-profitable bets have turned sour, creating an environment where managers have been quick to liquidate their funds.The hedge fund also has filled in other senior roles during that time, hiring a onetime Citigroup executive as chief operating officer and a deputy United States attorney as its first general counsel ever.(The hedge fund also promoted Richard Ritholz, its head of commodities trading, to its fifth equity partner.)The newly minted senior executives will free Mr. Singer and Mr. Pollock to focus on overseeing Elliott\u2019s huge book of investments, which runs from the United States to Africa to South Korea, and includes stocks, bonds and more esoteric financial instruments.As a distressed debt investor, one of its specialties, Elliott buys bonds owned by companies on the brink of bankruptcy, a situation in which it can have a say in how things play out after bankruptcy. It has established itself as a holdout investor in defaulted government debt in countries like Peru, Congo-Brazzaville and Argentina.On Monday, the firm disclosed another big activist position, having acquired a 6.4 percent stake in the metals giant Alcoa.It is not just the firm and its financial dealings that have been in the public eye. Mr. Singer has become a fixture in the political world as one of the wealthiest and most powerful political donors in the country \u2014 last year he gave more money to Republican candidates and causes than any other donor, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. When he publicly threw his support behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida last month, pundits predicted the move would shift the political race among the Republican candidates.Even as a staunch Republican with passionate views on fiscal conservatism, Mr. Singer has also been a strong supporter of same-sex marriage, donating millions of dollars to the cause. He has talked publicly about how his gay son, Andrew, helped to change his views.Becoming co-chief executive seemed like a distant possibility when Mr. Pollock first saw Elliott\u2019s ad \u2014 which told interested applicants to contact \u201cR. Plant,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek reference to Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, a favorite musician of Mr. Singer\u2019s \u2014 26 years ago.Upon joining the firm, Mr. Pollock said, his responsibilities began not with running complex trades but with taking lunch orders. (His biggest innovation was faxing the lunch requests so he had proof that he placed the order correctly, a mistake that cost one of his predecessors dearly.)What did Mr. Singer recall of the junior analyst during that time? \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he said. \u201cI am told I was tough on him.\u201dMr. Pollock rose through the ranks of the hedge fund, beginning as a junior analyst after a stint at E. F. Hutton. He later opened Elliott\u2019s offices in London, Hong Kong and Tokyo, while eventually overseeing part of the firm\u2019s investment. In 2011, he became co-chief investment officer.Since then, he has assumed more responsibilities, including weighing in on the firm\u2019s big trades and deliberating on overall strategy. Eventually, Mr. Singer decided that it was time to give him a title that matched his workload and skills.Both men insisted that Mr. Singer remained \u201cfully engaged\u201d in the hedge fund\u2019s main business.\u201cPaul and I share the senior risk management role,\u201d Mr. Pollock said. \u201cWe view every position as our own position.\u201dMr. Singer and Mr. Pollock have asserted that they are willing to negotiate. But under the presidency of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, relations became increasingly tense. The two sides have not sat down to negotiate, they added.\u201cBy being a country that scoffs at the rule of law, they sacrifice so much,\u201d Mr. Singer said, adding, \u201cIt makes so much sense for Argentina to sit down with us.\u201dWith the change in government that resulted from Argentina\u2019s election on Sunday, many hope that the holdouts and Mr. Macri will be able to find a solution.The executives insist that Elliott\u2019s reputation as unfairly litigating against poor countries over their debts they cannot pay \u2014 or as Ms. Kirchner memorably put it \u201ca vulture fund\u201d \u2014 is unfounded. So-called sovereign debt investments account for less than 2 percent of the hedge fund\u2019s overall capital, they said.\u201cOver the 14-year period I don\u2019t think the Argentina situation defines us within the investing community,\u201d Mr. Pollock said. The firm will continue to focus on what Mr. Singer called \u201cElliott-type trades.\u201d He defined them as trades that are not necessarily low risk, but that are likely to reap substantial rewards.The goal is the same as it has been for decades.\u201cWe try to make money, as close as is possible, all the time,\u201d Mr. Singer said.Advertisement"}

The hedge fund \u2014 which as recently as two years ago had $4.6 billion in assets under management \u2014 is now almost completely cashed out, that person said.BlackRock is the latest firm to wind down in a string of hedge fund closures, many of them focused on global macro strategies. Macro hedge fund managers have struggled to stem losses that have come from tumultuous and unexpected moves in markets around the world this year.At the start of the year a group of managers were stuck with large losses from making wrong-footed currency bets after the Swiss National Bank decided to lift a cap on the Swiss franc against the euro. Later in the year, the Chinese central bank suddenly devalued its currency, the renminbi, a move that reverberated across Asia over the summer. Plunging oil prices and a rout in the commodity markets also caused a headache for many managers.The third quarter has been the worst the industry has seen since the financial crisis of 2008. Over a period of weeks, many managers saw their gains for the year wiped out. William A. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management has lost 21 percent this year, suddenly reversing earlier gains in August. Other hedge funds run by stars like David Einhorn and Daniel S. Loeb also suffered losses in August. .BlackRock is better known for its mutual funds and exchange traded funds but it runs $51 billion in hedge funds, including $20 billion in funds of hedge funds. The Global Ascent fund was its only dedicated global macro fund.\u201cWe believe that redeeming the Global Ascent Fund was the right thing to do for our clients, given the headwinds that macro funds have faced,\u201d said Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for BlackRock. The firm continues to invest in other managers who use macro strategies, he said. In recent years, BlackRock has closed on average 200 funds a year, Mr. Sweeney added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senators Revive Financing Tactic From \u201970s for Carbon Emissions", "Date": "2015-11-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, power companies, manufacturers and entrepreneurs have tried to make capturing and storing carbon emissions from industrial operations like burning coal into a business, to little avail.Despite decades of promising research, demonstration projects and government investment, large-scale developments have often proved too difficult and costly to get off the ground.But now two senators think they have hit on a way to move the industry forward. Under a bill set to be introduced on Thursday, carbon capture projects \u2014 considered important tools for fossil fuel power plants and industrial facilities to meet anticipated greenhouse gas restrictions \u2014 would qualify for tax-exempt private activity bonds, which helped clean up air pollution in the 1970s and 1980s.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who is a co-sponsor of the bill, said that power plants \u201cused some of these private-activity-type bonds\u201d to install equipment like \u201cscrubbers and so on back in the day.\u201dHis co-sponsor, Senator Michael F. Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, said, \u201cThis is the very same idea.\u201dThat allowance no longer exists, although there are exceptions that have let businesses use the tax exempt bonds for projects that include carbon capture and storage. The proposed change is aimed at bringing the tax code in line with policy and technology developments, proponents say.The project is moving ahead, said Jason Crew, Summit\u2019s chief executive, but much more slowly than anticipated. \u201cIf we had access to a greater suite of financing tools, we certainly would be done by now.\u201dSome experts question the use of tax-exempt bonds for private development in general. Others caution that state limits on bond issues each year could keep some projects from going forward.But supporters argue that in many states the cap on bond issues has gone unmet, and that the carbon projects\u2019 financing would not add that much anyway. Congressional officials estimate that expanding the qualification to include carbon capture and storage would cost taxpayers $29 million over five years and $128 million over 10.\u201cThis is a way, in a relatively inexpensive way, to solve a problem that needs to be solved,\u201d Mr. Portman said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kenneth Griffin Looks Back on Citadel\u2019s 25 Years", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-five years ago, Kenneth C. Griffin got a break when, as a newly minted Harvard graduate, he drew backers to start a small investment firm in Chicago.In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by DealBook, the hedge fund manager ascribed the firm\u2019s rise to both technical prowess and its team of now 650 investment professionals.\u201cIn our first decade, I interviewed about five thousand people in pursuit of the talent that would create our future,\u201d Mr. Griffin wrote in the letter. \u201cAs our success grew, we became known across the four corners of finance not just for our outstanding returns, but also for our outstanding people.\u201dThe beginnings of Citadel are Wall Street lore: As a sophomore at Harvard, Mr. Griffin had a satellite dish installed on the roof of his dorm room to trade the relatively arcane area of convertible bonds.\u201cWe were 19 or 20 at the time,\u201d said Alex Slusky, the founder of the investment firm Vector Capital and a classmate of Mr. Griffin\u2019s. \u201cThat was not something most of us knew anything about.\u201dBy the time Mr. Griffin graduated, he had turned down a lucrative offer from an investment bank \u2014 one that Mr. Slusky said was roughly twice as rich as offers their other finance-minded classmates had received \u2014 to move to Chicago with the support of several backers.Among those initial investors was Frank Meyer, a co-founder of Glenwood Partners. According to Mr. Griffin, it was Mr. Meyer who encouraged the rookie investor to dream big about what the newly minted firm could do.\u201cFrank always encouraged me to think of the business as a platform,\u201d Mr. Griffin said in a telephone interview from Seoul. \u201cHaving your first investor embrace you as someone they think can make that happen is really inspirational.\u201dCitadel quickly became known as a hypercompetitive hedge fund not shy to throw elbows, capitalizing on the stumbles at Long-Term Capital Management and Enron to build its team and make money. (When asked about the reputation of his firm as having a challenging environment, Mr. Griffin said that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a tough place to go to college as well, but is stocked with people eager for a challenge.)To Mr. Griffin, the growth of the market-making division is both an example of the diversity of operations that Mr. Meyer encouraged and a sign of how others at Citadel have helped build its empire.\u201cIt came down to a colleague who had the vision and me knowing he had the talent to make that happen,\u201d Mr. Griffin said. \u201cWhat\u2019s lost in the Citadel story is how good my partners are.\u201dBelow is a copy of Mr. Griffin\u2019s letter to investors:Dear Investor,As we mark our 25th anniversary, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for your trust and support over the years.I\u2019ve often thought of successful entrepreneurs as individuals who have just the right expertise \u2014 at just the right moment \u2014 to solve the emerging problems of their time. When I started Citadel 25 years ago, my expertise in software engineering and mathematics created significant competitive advantages in a world where the power of computational finance was appreciated by few.But the opportunity that was born of that fortunate positioning would never have grown into the success of today without crucial early support. Frank Meyer, co-founder of Glenwood Partners, empowered the formation of Citadel with his willingness to take a chance on an unproven twenty-year-old portfolio manager. With the tailwind of strong early returns, and the enthusiastic support of our investors, Citadel took off.In our firm\u2019s earliest days, our understanding of the power of great software engineering and quantitative analytics helped Citadel stand out. But history is littered with companies started by entrepreneurs who failed to sustain such early bursts of success. In fact, the average lifespan for a hedge fund is just a few years. What, then, has driven our longevity and our success? The answer is simple: Our sustainable competitive advantage doesn\u2019t just come from our technical prowess; it comes from assembling teams of extraordinary individuals who have the creativity, resourcefulness, ambition and tenacity to take on the world.The early days of Citadel had a constant rhythm: research, problem-solve, program, trade, interview. Repeat. In our first decade, I interviewed about five thousand people in pursuit of the talent that would create our future. As our success grew, we became known across the four corners of finance not just for our outstanding returns, but also for our outstanding people.Today, I\u2019m proud that Citadel is seen as a beacon for the best and brightest. It is incredible to come to work every day surrounded by individuals whose insights and efforts place us at the forefront of finance. As I reflect upon the exceptional team that is Citadel today, I believe our greatest moments lie not in our past, but in our future.Over the past twenty-five years, I have enjoyed a remarkably challenging and rewarding career \u2014 a career defined by the extraordinary people for whom and with whom I have worked. Thank you for your continued support and for your trust in my team and in me.With all my best,KenAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intel Lawsuit Questions Place of Hedge Funds in Retirement Plans", "Date": "2015-11-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair Game\u201cWe push the boundaries.\u201dWhile each lawsuit against a 401(k) plan sponsor varies, most involve high and often hidden fees levied on participants.The case against Intel has a different twist. At its heart is this question: Should hedge funds, private equity portfolios and commodities be anywhere near a 401(k) plan?For the professionals who run public pensions, these kinds of investments are ubiquitous. They are far less common in 401(k) plans, which are aimed at individual employees and typically limit investment choices to mutual funds that hold publicly traded stocks and bonds.An Intel spokesman declined to comment on the litigation. But the company\u2019s approach to its retirement plan as laid out in the suit certainly was atypical.For example, rather than hiring an outside firm to create a plan consisting of low-cost mutual funds, the nine portfolios in the Intel plan were devised by the company\u2019s investment committee. This committee, which included an Intel director and the company\u2019s treasurer, chose the specific vehicles, which included mutual funds, hedge funds and limited partnerships, that would be used to achieve plan participants\u2019 goals and determined asset allocations.Earlier this year, Intel changed it operations, handing over the retirement plan oversight to AllianceBernstein. The heavy reliance on alternative investments appears to have continued.The company has two main defined contribution retirement vehicles, the Intel Retirement Contribution Plan and the Intel 401(k) Savings plan.The lawsuit contends that two groups of Intel employees paid higher costs and lost hundreds of millions in income they would otherwise have received investing in plain vanilla funds.One group invested in certain Intel target-date funds. The other concentrated on Intel\u2019s Global Diversified fund, the asset allocation model that directed money to various vehicles and included an unusual cluster of hedge funds and other alternatives. Intel made inadequate disclosures about these instruments, the lawsuit contends, leaving participants unable to make an informed decision about \u201cwhether investing in these particular hedge funds and private equity funds was prudent.\u201dUnlike many 401(k) plans that allow employees to choose their investments, the Intel plan often made those decisions for them. For example, until 2015, the lawsuit said, Intel employees in the Retirement Plan who were under 50 years old were automatically placed in the Global Diversified fund.As a result, that fund was the sole investment available to \u201cthe overwhelming majority of participants\u201d in Intel\u2019s retirement plan, the lawsuit said. By 2013, almost 37 percent of the Global Diversified fund\u2019s allocation was in hedge funds, private equity and commodities.In addition, participants in the 401(k) savings plan who failed to make a selection were automatically enrolled in a target-date fund that corresponded with their ages, the lawsuit said. Many of these funds were also heavily invested in alternatives.Back in 2005, Intel employees were in a plain vanilla plan, investing primarily in large-capitalization stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. Then the company began diversifying into small-capitalization stocks, emerging-markets securities, fixed-income and alternative investments like commodities futures, hedge funds and private equity.Recently, the investments in hedge funds and private equity have grown significantly.Intel declined to discuss its approach to 401(k) oversight or to make available directors who monitored the investments.But a March 2014 internal Morningstar report on the Global Diversified Fund said Intel\u2019s investment committee expected adding alternative investments would reduce volatility in the portfolio and generate higher performance.The fund fell short of those goals, the report said. Its one-year return as of March 31, 2014, for example, was a full percentage point below its benchmark, according to the report.Last year, in an email to Andy D. Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, Mr. Parish expressed his concerns about those investments in the retirement plan. Mr. Bryant responded by saying he would forward the criticism to the appropriate Intel officials, according to the email.\u201cMy perspective, regardless of whether it is prudent diversification, is it doesn\u2019t make investment sense,\u201d Mr. Parish said. \u201cIt would be better for Intel to eliminate hedge funds altogether because they don\u2019t meet the standard with respect to financial disclosure. They\u2019re too opaque.\u201dIndeed, fund filings with the Labor Department indicate that Intel designated as difficult to value fully $1 billion of the $12 billion in fair value of overall retirement account assets at the end of last year. They are known in accounting parlance as Level 3 assets, and the stated value of these investments is based on significant \u201cunobservable inputs,\u201d Intel said. In other words, the values are estimates.Some are in vehicles that cannot be sold anytime soon. Around $830 million in plan assets consist of \u201cnonmarketable limited partnerships\u201d in real estate, energy and venture capital, fund filings show.\u201cThese are closed-end funds, which are not eligible for redemption until a date in the future that currently cannot be determined,\u201d Intel\u2019s filings state. \u201cThe liquidation of these investments is likely to occur at different times over the next 10 years.\u201dGregory Y. Porter at Bailey & Glasser in Washington is one of the lawyers representing Mr. Sulyma, who remains an Intel plan participant. Mr. Porter said he believes the case is significant not only for Intel employees, but also as a warning for retirement account holders elsewhere who may be receiving calls from their brokers to invest in risky strategies involving hedge funds or private equity.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a heavy marketing push over the past couple of years into what the industry calls \u2018liquid alternatives,\u2019 a mutual fund wrapped around a hedge fund or other illiquid investment,\u201d Mr. Porter said in an interview. \u201cThis might give people pause about investing in these products.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Risks and Rewards of Short-Termism", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe debate has been raging in various forms for the last 30 years \u2014 whether corporate short-termism is a problem and, if it is, is it hurting American businesses and the economy? Short-termism is exactly what it sounds like: companies managed for the short term, with decisions driven by the need to meet shareholder expectations about quarterly earnings and stock prices.This year it has spilled into the presidential campaign, with Hillary Rodham Clinton recently decrying \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d and proposing some changes in the tax code to encourage more long-term investments by companies and individuals. She and others have criticized practices that put a priority on share buybacks and dividend payments over sources of long-term growth like wage increases, investment in research and employee development.This strategy, Mr. Sonnenfeld added, destroys brand value and causes companies to sell valuable assets \u201cat fire sale prices during cyclical economic downturns.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld and other academics, as well as legal and financial experts, have repeatedly warned of the perils of short-term management. So why does it persist?Kevin Laverty, a retired associate professor of business strategy at University of Washington in Bothell, wrote one of the first academic research papers to use the phrase \u201cshort-termism\u201d and examine the phenomenon. The paper was published in 1996, but Mr. Laverty began researching it in 1991. \u201cWall Street was asking the same questions back then,\u201d he said.In the 1980s, many companies expressed concern that stock market pressure for short-term profits and the threat of hostile takeovers were forcing them to abandon long-term projects. Many observers at the time blamed what they called management \u201cmyopia\u201d\u2014 decisions that enable companies to pursue short\u2010term gains at the expense of long-term strategies \u2014 for managerial incentives based on quarterly profits and stock prices. Mr. Laverty said the debate continued because there had not been any agreement on whether short-termism was a problem. \u201cI think it goes back to human nature,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do people seek immediate gratification rather than looking to the long term?\u201dWhat do we do about short-termism then, if it is a problem?Mr. Pozen of M.I.T. said the corporate world needs to rethink how it compensates executives, specifically the period of time against which performance bonuses are given. \u201cIf you look at most companies, it\u2019s one year,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you pay people based on one year\u2019s compensation, they will manage for a one-year horizon.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld of Yale said what was needed were \u201cboards with stronger backbones\u201d against activist hedge funds. He again pointed to DuPont. \u201cEven though they had just won a proxy battle the board panicked, all because of a highly vocal activist investor,\u201d he said.Mr. Pozen recalled many institutional investors complaining at an investment conference in March about being long-term investors in a world of short-term returns. \u201cThese people own 60 to 70 percent of the stock in most public companies. They ought to be able to get those companies to be long-term oriented,\u201d he said. Activist investors, Mr. Pozen pointed out, cannot win proxy fights without the support of institutional investors. Institutional investors talk the talk, he said, \u201cbut they need to walk the walk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Mr. Gorman said the company\u2019s traditional strength in equities, debt capital markets and merger advice were still a strong focus.The bank\u2019s top management spends a lot of time figuring out who in the organization will be the next generation of leaders, with attention to those who have the skills to lead through the next financial crisis, he said. The plan is to seed the management team with \u201ccollaborators and stirrers,\u201d he said.Morgan Stanley reported a worse-than-expected 55 percent decline in third-quarter profit last month after difficulty in its fixed-income trading operations and declines in private equity investments. Mr. Gorman said Tuesday that two-thirds of the company\u2019s problems in the quarter were related to a one-time regulatory settlement over financial-crisis-era issues he inherited and a decline in the private equity investments in China, which could reverse themselves.Although Morgan Stanley didn\u2019t do well in fixed income, Mr. Gorman noted, neither did other banks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stormy Markets Today May Offer Steady Growth Tomorrow", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth Special SectionThere are times when a cautious investor can take risks that a rough-and-ready speculator cannot.When the price of an asset has plunged so far, so fast that it seems to get cheaper by the day, it can be imprudent for a short-term trader to bet that the trend will change. An investor planning for the long haul can be confident, however, that what seems like a bargain will pay off eventually.Certain depressed assets \u2014 notably stocks in emerging markets or those related to energy and other commodities, or the commodities themselves \u2014 fit the bill, investment advisers say. They could offer excellent returns in coming years, even if they are risky propositions in coming weeks.Among the beaten-down groups of investments, Mr. Koesterich prefers emerging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a universally hated asset class\u201d that \u201chas underperformed for years,\u201d he said.He cautioned that while emerging markets in general are cheap, there is great variation in prospects among individual countries. The best long-term bets, in his view, include India and Mexico.The discrepancies have led him to calculate that emerging markets will return 7.9 percent a year for the next decade, net of inflation, compared with 1.1 percent for their American counterparts. He makes no claim about any shorter horizon.\u201cSpeculators in equities ask how I can be sure that equity prices in emerging markets will rise more than equity prices in the United States over the coming year,\u201d Mr. Brightman wrote. \u201cI respond that I have no clue about the prospects for short-term price changes. I am not speculating on price changes, I explain. I am investing to build long-term wealth.\u201dOn Wall Street, by contrast, analysts and money managers are judged on how well they do in a given year or even quarter. That can cause people to overemphasize the importance of recent performance when judging prospective investments. As strategists at HSBC note, recent history in developing markets is unpleasant.The developing world \u201cappears to have inherited a bad legacy from the developed world, namely low growth and high debt,\u201d they said in a report last month. They go on to say that the \u201cbleak fundamental outlook makes us remain cautious\u201d and that \u201ccurrent valuations offer only limited opportunities on a very selective basis.\u201dHSBC recommends owning stocks in China, India, Mexico and Taiwan and avoiding Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand.The HSBC strategists are not alone in their disdain. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers found them to be shunning emerging markets more than any other asset class, relative to their average allocation.Energy ranks a close second. Oil is trading at roughly half its price in the summer of 2014. Natural gas and other energy commodities have been pounded too, as have the stocks of companies that produce them.\u201cI think leadership is going to change,\u201d he predicted. There has been \u201ca massive tax cut in the form of a halving of commodity prices. Long term, that is hugely stimulative because 95 percent of the world is commodity consumers, not producers.\u201dAnticipating a recovery in commodities, he encouraged investors essentially to focus on the other 5 percent by buying stocks in economies where commodity production plays a big role, such as Canada and Australia. Foreign markets are generally cheap and so are commodities, so investments that can benefit from recoveries in both could be particularly rewarding, he said.Mr. Koesterich agreed that energy and mining stocks were cheap and \u201crepresent long-term value,\u201d but he was less certain how much value was available in commodities themselves, the main driver of producers\u2019 stocks.

{"Headline": "Dizzying Ride May Be Ending for Tech Start-Ups", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The worth of hot technology start-ups seemed for years to go in only one direction: straight up.Now there are signs of growing unease over the dizzying valuations of some of the most richly priced private companies.Another start-up, Dropbox, the widely used file storage service, was devalued by the giant asset manager BlackRock this year.The funds\u2019 markdowns may tap the brakes on a fast-growing market. Investors, in the hopes of getting a piece of the next Facebook or Google, have been pouring billions of dollars into young private companies.Yet the public stock market has cooled for new technology companies: witness the current effort by Square, a mobile payments company, to go public at a valuation lower than what its last private investment gave it.The moves by Fidelity and BlackRock reflect how mutual funds can create challenges for technology\u2019s favored start-ups, just as they helped inflate valuations in the first place.Over the last few years, mutual funds fought to buy pieces of appealing venture-backed companies like Snapchat and Dropbox. The idea was that public investors wanted to own these start-ups because their value was growing faster than that of many publicly traded companies. By owning the private shares, the large mutual funds would also get to know the start-ups and be well positioned to buy their shares when they went public.Snapchat, for example, is valued at more than $16 billion and Dropbox at around $10 billion. The biggest prize of them all, Uber, is now seeking a round of investment that would value the company at $60 billion to $70 billion. Uber\u2019s success with that round would be a further test of investors\u2019 appetite.The competition among investors also helped create a herd of dozens of \u201cunicorns,\u201d a term for private companies valued above $1 billion, coined when such a phenomenon was still considered rare.Yet unlike venture capital firms, mutual funds are legally obligated to value each of their portfolio holdings every day, including hard-to-value assets like shares in private companies, and they must report these values quarterly.A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, one of the largest mutual fund associations, said that the process was a \u201cgood faith determination\u201d of what an owner could get in a sale of the asset.\u201cThis assessment has been widely recognized to be more art than science,\u201d said Mike McNamee, a spokesman for the institute.Indeed, there are often discrepancies between mutual funds that own pieces of the same private companies, often because they can each negotiate for special treatment that other investors may not get.\u201cThere is also room for different funds to make different judgments about how much they could get in a sale,\u201d said David L. Larsen, a managing director at Duff & Phelps, a firm that helps mutual funds value their private company shares.Most of the largest mutual fund companies, including BlackRock and T. Rowe Price, have pricing committees that work independently from the portfolio managers who bought the shares. This is done, Mr. Larsen said, to prevent money managers who might have a stake in keeping a valuation high from influencing the valuation.In the case of Fidelity, it valued its stake in Snapchat at $22.91 a share as of Sept. 30, down from $30.72 in the previous quarter, according to data compiled by the research service Morningstar.Dropbox, by comparison, was valued in its last fund-raising at around $10 billion. The large discrepancy between Box\u2019s market capitalization and Dropbox\u2019s private valuation has become a factor as mutual funds worked to create an accurate estimate of how much their Dropbox shares were worth.It is unclear why Fidelity marked down its investment, and whether the move was because of faltering performance in Snapchat or because of rough comparisons to publicly traded social media companies. Twitter, for example, suffered a nearly 26 percent drop during the third quarter, though Facebook rose almost 5 percent during that same time.But those companies are very different from Snapchat, making comparisons difficult if not impossible. The service is a combination of photo and video messages \u2014 including the famous disappearing photos that first made its name \u2014 and a publisher of mobile content from companies like Vice and CNN through its Discover section.Without a fair publicly traded comparison, mutual funds may compare the revenue and user projections that private companies made when they last raised money to their current performance, Mr. Larsen of Duff & Phelps said.\u201cThe mutual funds look at whether the company is hitting the targets it created,\u201d he said, declining to comment specifically on Snapchat.Snapchat\u2019s popularity with younger users has earned it the admiration of financial firms from Wall Street to Silicon Valley and beyond, with the Alibaba Group of China among its investors.Snapchat has been focused on generating revenue through advertising in Discover, the news platform that it introduced in January.Yet the company has suffered from turmoil of late, including the departure of several high-level executives over the last year or so. Among them: its previous head of communications, a chief operating officer and a top engineer. And investors and analysts have questioned whether Discover could live up to Snapchat\u2019s promises.Representatives for both Fidelity and BlackRock declined to comment. Dropbox also declined to comment.A spokesman for Snapchat declined to comment.An earlier version of a capsule summary with this article erroneously attributed a distinction to Fidelity, the mutual fund company. While it is an investor in Snapchat, it was not one of Snapchat\u2019s earliest investors.An article on Wednesday about the devaluing of some hot start-ups by some mutual fund investors misstated how often mutual funds must report the value of their portfolio holdings. It is quarterly, not \u201cat least every half year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shareholders Vote With Their Dollars to Have Less of a Say", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorIn today\u2019s world of public companies, there are the haves and have-nots of corporate governance. How long can this last?The haves are armed with dual-class structures that give voting control to their founding shareholders or the private equity firm that bought them. These are companies like CBS, Ford Motor, Facebook, Google, News Corporation and Viacom, where the shareholders often have one vote or none per share and the founders 10 votes (The New York Times Company also has dual-class voting). These companies are largely free from challenge by any of their other shareholders, and control is centered with the founders, who have largely unfettered authority to hire and fire the board and the executives.The have-nots lack this dual class structure and instead have no controlling shareholder. Instead, these companies have one vote for each share. In these companies, institutional investors like mutual funds and pension funds wield great control and the ability to influence, if not outright direct, the company\u2019s actions.The difference is stark \u2014 the haves can function largely free of worry from challenge. The have-nots are on the run, living in fear of activist hedge funds. And it\u2019s not just the hedge funds. These companies are also buffeted by increasingly vocal institutional investors that pressure the companies to adopt good corporate governance. The problem is that even the shareholders cannot agree on what exactly is good corporate governance, and one result is that companies can be pushed in one direction or another based on the flavor of the month.Debated off and on since the 1980s, this situation exists because of a quirk in the legal rules. Back in the 1980s, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that prevented companies from having anything other than one vote per share of stock. The S.E.C. was responding to a challenge led by General Motors, which wanted to have dual-class stock for a subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems, that it was about to take public.The S.E.C. acted in the name of shareholder democracy. It wanted to prevent a situation in which a powerful shareholder could control the votes in a company without having much economic stake. That might encourage the shareholder to press the company\u2019s directors to cater to that shareholder\u2019s needs rather than do what was best for the company as a whole.For example, in the last three years CBS and Viacom have each paid more than $10 million a year to the 92-year-old chairman of both companies, Sumner Redstone, who owns only 10 percent of each company but controls the votes. Did he get this pay because he earned it or because he had control?Many defend dual-class stock because it may insulate a company from pressure to take short-term actions at the behest of shareholders. It also allows the founders to take a long-term approach and invest in the company in a way that may not produce immediate results. And finally, defenders point out that institutional investors are often conflicted in their desires, and that dual-class stock allows more deliberate consideration of shareholder issues.The S.E.C. rule would have given all companies the same voting structure. But it was struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which held that the S.E.C. did not have the power to require all companies to have the same voting rights. In the decision\u2019s wake, both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq adopted rules that prohibited companies that were already listed from adopting dual-class shares, but that permitted a company to adopt dual-class stock in an initial public offering. The idea was that all shareholders would agree to this structure by buying their shares at the conception of the public company.A great divide thus sprang up: existing companies with one share, one vote and at the mercy of the markets versus companies with dual-class stock.Still, many thought an I.P.O. of a company with dual-class stock would be harder for shareholders to swallow. Few companies adopted the structure. That changed when Google chose to adopt the mechanism, giving control to its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Today, dual-class stock is all the rage, and the majority of initial public offerings have it. It\u2019s not just technology companies like Facebook and Zillow. Shake Shack and Fairway, both decidedly nontech firms, also have a dual-class mechanism.More than 13.5 percent of the 133 companies listing shares on United States exchanges in 2015 have set up a dual-class structure, according to the data provider Dealogic. That compares with 12 percent last year and just 1 percent in 2005.About half the companies choosing the structure were in the technology industry.Some big institutional investors have come out against this trend. Calpers, the California pension fund, has taken the position that it will not invest in I.P.O.s with dual-class stock. And yet, this seems like a finger in the dike. Dual-class initial offerings keep coming as other shareholders keep buying. It\u2019s an odd state of affairs. The same shareholders who repeatedly assert that they care about corporate governance and are for a shareholder voice do not seem to care about that voice at the initial offering stage.Perhaps this says a lot about how much shareholders value their vote, and it may be very little. Certainly institutional investors talk a good game and are increasingly taking steps to influence companies. But when push comes to shove, they seem ready to drop the vote for a good I.P.O. deal.Perhaps the time has come to decide whether dual-class stock makes continued sense and for either all companies or no companies to be able to adopt it. Or perhaps the conversation should include other possible mechanisms that are more accommodating to shareholders.For example, France has adopted a tenure voting structure for its public companies under the so-called Florange law. In companies with tenure voting, shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold shares. In France it is two votes after a year, but the number of votes over a period can really be any number. France adopted the law to cement the power of the French state against activists, but tenure voting is an intriguing idea. If votes really do matter, why not reward shareholders for holding shares? And this would result in others besides the founders having a say.Alternatively, why not require a sunset provision on dual-class shares? It might make sense for a founder to have control at the beginning, but years later the founder may not have the same interests or desires at stake.And finally, it may be that certain types of shareholders like index funds should have no vote at all. After all, they have no choice in their ownership. They also hold shares forever.All of this is to say that perhaps it is time that some hard thinking be given to the shareholder vote, how shareholders value that vote and whether empowering founders over shareholders is a good or bad idea. What is best for companies over the long term, and can one-size voting mechanisms fit all?It is better to do it now, thoughtfully, before the have-nots say enough is enough and push for change that may not be as thoughtful. After all, even 3-year olds know that if one sibling has candy, the other must get it, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making an Adviser Relationship Work", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth Special SectionIn spring 2001, after losing about $75,000 in the dot-com crash, Jerrie Champlin and her husband, Robert Baranowski, decided it was time for professional help.The couple, then living in Rockland County, a New York City suburb, found a local financial adviser who seemed to have strong Wall Street experience. They were further reassured by a 90-minute interview with him in which they discussed their goals and the adviser\u2019s philosophy.Over the next three years, however, the relationship deteriorated.\u201cHe was not really paying attention to who we are,\u201d said Ms. Champlin, 62, a former business manager. \u201cBob would have an idea, and it would be, \u2018No, that doesn\u2019t really fit with the plan.\u2019 He decided what level of risk we would be willing to take.\u201dThe couple moved their $562,000 portfolio to a larger firm after Mr. Baranowski met one of the principals at a retirement-planning workshop at BMW, where Mr. Baranowski was a senior manager. (Mr. Baranowski, 64, and Ms. Champlin have since retired and live north of San Antonio.)\u201cThere was a chemistry that worked\u201d with the new adviser, Mr. Baranowski said. \u201cHe took into account all the other aspects of life that go with financial planning, including our five dogs.\u201dMore than one-third of households in the United States regularly use a financial adviser to assess an overall financial situation and set up an investment strategy, according to Cerulli Associates, a global financial services research firm based in Boston. The average such household has $406,000 in investable assets.Among the biggest concerns are personal rapport and communication, along with investment returns. Other issues include location, staff turnover, a desire for more control and outright misconduct.\u201cIt\u2019s like developing a friendship,\u201d said Leslie C. Quick III, a partner at the investment advisory firm Massey Quick & Company, based in Morristown, N.J., which manages $2.6 billion. \u201cYou may have gotten your wires crossed, but if there is trust, you can always figure out how to get back on the same wavelength.\u201dAfter a first-year \u201choneymoon,\u201d client loyalty slips over the next three years, then stabilizes, the PriceMetrix report found.The strongest relationships start with a detailed discussion of matters like lifestyle, risk tolerance, goals, investment strategy and the kind of communication the clients want. After that, there will typically be performance reports at least quarterly; an annual in-person meeting lasting one hour or more, preferably at the adviser\u2019s office; and additional meetings, video chats, emails or phone calls as needed.At the Wescott Financial Advisory Group, based in Philadelphia, which advises on $2.3 billion in assets for more than 500 clients, Catherine M. Seeber, a senior financial adviser, said she contacted her clients every six weeks and sent cards for birthdays, weddings and the like. \u201cIf you don\u2019t communicate,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople think no one\u2019s looking at their needs.\u201dIn talking with clients, advisers emphasize that markets fluctuate and investors need to be patient for the long term. It is unfair, they say, to fire an adviser based on returns over less than three to five years.Nevertheless, when the bear inevitably lumbers in, \u201csome clients are going to jump around from adviser to adviser, looking for a person who\u2019s going to have a crystal ball,\u201d said Robert Gerstemeier, who until last month was chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.In about one-third of those cases, he added, fellow members persuade the unhappy colleague to keep the adviser, by suggesting \u201cwhat was a reasonable expectation, given the complexity of the market.\u201dBecause the best relationships are deeply personal, anything that breaks the one-on-one bond can also be a reason to change.People often seek a local replacement if they move to a new area. If the advisory firm undergoes major personnel or ownership changes, or if the client\u2019s particular adviser leaves, \u201cyou should reassess your relationship,\u201d suggested Paul Smith, president and chief executive of the CFA Institute, a trade group that administers certification exams.\u201cPeople should be more engaged with their advisers, more questioning,\u201d he said.On the other hand, some investors might balk at spending hours re-explaining their circumstances to a new person. To avoid that situation, advisers work in pairs at Modera Wealth Management, the Boston-based firm that Ms. Champlin and Mr. Baranowski now use. Thus, when one adviser relocated to California early this summer, her 60 clients still had her teammate, said Mark Willoughby, chief investment officer of the firm, which manages $1.7 billion for 950 families.\u201cI looked at what he was charging, and I said, \u2018I can do this myself,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Blasco, a former sales representative and interior designer who has begun a career coaching young people about money, incorporating neuroscience and behavioral economics to help clients rethink their financial habits. She transferred her portfolio to a self-directed online brokerage firm, although she consults regularly with a new financial planner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Warner Cuts Profit Expectations, and Media Stocks Dip", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedia giants have fallen back into a ring of fire.The company, which owns Turner networks, HBO and Warner Bros. film studios, reduced its outlook for next year, citing the effects of foreign exchange rates as well as the company\u2019s increased spending in content and technology. Although the investments are intended to improve the TV viewing experience, the costs could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Time Warner has now cut its forecast for its adjusted earnings per share for 2016 to $5.25 from its previous forecast of $6 a share. Executives said that the company continued to work through its budget process, so other factors could influence the outlook.In August, a crash of eight major media stocks wiped out a combined $37 billion in market value on one day. That was prompted by Disney\u2019s reducing growth expectations for its large cable network division.\u201cWe\u2019re back to Dante\u2019s inferno,\u201d said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cToday, there seems to be more concern that while the top line may have stabilized, the ecosystem will need more investment.\u201dJeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, emphasized that the company was preparing itself for long-term growth rather than short-term profitability.\u201cNow is the time for us to press our advantages, and I\u2019m confident these investments in content, capabilities and the consumer experience will position us for continued strong growth in the years to come,\u201d he said in a conference call.Mr. Bewkes added that investing solely in content was no longer sufficient. He said the company planned to devote more resources to technology initiatives, such as the HBO Now stand-alone streaming service, which does not require users to have a traditional cable subscription. He also outlined how the company would expand its data and analytics capabilities, which would help create new advertising products as well as assist the company\u2019s marketing and content development.\u201cWhile we are living in the golden age of television programming, for many consumers, the television viewing experience is stuck in the Bronze Age,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.Mr. Bank, the RBC analyst, called Mr. Bewkes a Jerry Maguire, referring to the movie about the sports agent who loses nearly all of his clients after expressing a moral epiphany.\u201cHe is getting up and saying what I think takes real guts to say: You really need to reinvest in the consumer experience and in technology and in content,\u201d Mr. Bank said. \u201cIn my view, that is the absolute right thing to say, but it will cost you some profitability in the near term, and it is coming at a time when foreign currency headwinds are extreme.\u201dTotal revenue at Time Warner increased 5 percent to $6.6 billion, helped by growth at the company\u2019s Warner Bros. studios and Home Box Office premium cable network. Dragging down revenue was a 2 percent decline in sales at Turner, which reported lower subscription video-on-demand revenue because of foreign exchange rates, as well as a decline in domestic subscribers. Turner also reported a 1 percent decline in advertising revenue.Warner Bros. reported a 15 percent increase in revenue to $3.2 billion, driven by higher video game licensing fees because of the releases of titles like Lego Dimensions and Mad Max. Television licensing revenue benefited from the distribution of \u201c2 Broke Girls\u201d and \u201cPerson of Interest.\u201dAt HBO, revenue increased 5 percent to $1.4 billion, because of an increase in subscription revenue and higher domestic licensing fees. Executives said HBO\u2019s stand-alone streaming service, HBO Now, contributed some revenue during the quarter and was expected to deliver \u201cattractive financial results\u201d over the long term.Richard Plepler, chief executive of HBO, said the service was still in its early days and declined to reveal statistics about its use or audience.Like Time Warner, executives at Fox emphasized their focus on the future. John P. Nallen, chief financial officer of Fox, said that starting in fiscal 2017, the company would change its approach to providing financial guidance by eliminating specific dollar earnings targets. It will instead provide \u201cquantitative and qualitative information\u201d on the company and business trends.\u201cWe are very confident in our ability to execute against the opportunities we have ahead to sustain long-term growth, but we don\u2019t want to chase the short-term targets through changes in our operating plan,\u201d Mr. Nallen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for our management team and it\u2019s not good for our shareholders.\u201dRevenue for Fox\u2019s filmed entertainment group fell nearly 28 percent during the quarter. The company was hurt by the box-office flop of \u201cFantastic Four\u201d as well as a tough comparison with the previous year, which included the theatrical release of \u201cDawn of the Planet of the Apes.\u201dNet income was $675 million, or 34 cents a share, down 35 percent from $1 billion, or 47 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding certain items, earnings were 38 cents a share.Fox also said that it was holding to the financial guidance expectations for this fiscal year that it made three months ago.Fox highlighted the potential of its films coming in the final months of the year, including \u201cThe Peanuts Movie,\u201d opening this weekend, and the holiday release of \u201cJoy,\u201d starring Jennifer Lawrence.Fox\u2019s cable network group \u2014 which includes Fox News, FX Networks and FS1 in the United States \u2014 reported a 7.2 percent increase in revenue to nearly $3.5 billion, driven by increases in affiliate fees and advertising revenue.Revenue in the company\u2019s television group was about flat at $1 billion, as growth in retransmission revenue \u2014 or fees that cable and satellite providers pay to carry its channels \u2014 offset a 5 percent decline in advertising revenue. The dip in advertising was, in part, the result of one week fewer of National Football League broadcasts as well as lower revenue from political-ad spending and lower ratings at the broadcast network.An article on Thursday about quarterly earnings for various media companies misstated the percentage decline in 21st Century Fox\u2019s net income last quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter. Net income declined 35 percent, not 53 percent.Advertisement"}

In September, Expedia closed its acquisition of a fellow travel site, Orbitz Worldwide, for $1.6 billion including debt. Also this year, Expedia purchased Travelocity from Sabre Corporation for $280 million in cash. Other brands under the Expedia umbrella include Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and Trivago.But Expedia said in a call on Tuesday that this acquisition would be different from others it has done because HomeAway would be run almost autonomously out of Austin, Tex.In conjunction with the deal announcement, HomeAway said it was changing its business model to charge travelers a fee, based on a sliding scale. The company did not disclose details but said it was expected to add an average of 6 percent to most transactions. Traditionally, HomeAway generated revenue by charging property owners to list their rentals. HomeAway also plans to lower commission rates for these pay-per-booking customers.HomeAway has recently existed largely in the shadow of Airbnb, even though their businesses are somewhat different. Airbnb has attracted much attention because it is one of the most highly valued private companies, most recently valued by investors at $20 billion. Airbnb allows people to rent out their homes or apartments on a short-term basis, while HomeAway focuses on vacation rentals.The acquisition will give HomeAway distribution, technology and expertise from Expedia, Brian Sharples, the chief executive of HomeAway, said in a statement.The companies expect the transaction to close during the first quarter of 2016. Stocks of both HomeAway and Expedia increased in after-hours trading.HomeAway also said on Wednesday that revenue increased 11.6 percent in the third quarter, to $130.7 million, from the same period a year ago.Advertisement"}

The main Shanghai share index lost 5.5 percent.Shares had been on the rebound in recent months, after a summer of turbulent trading set off by the Chinese government\u2019s attempt to prop up the market and by the central bank\u2019s surprise devaluation of the currency, the renminbi, in August.From its recent low in late August, the main Shanghai index had risen 24 percent, to 3,635.55 points, as of Thursday.In percentage terms, the plunge of nearly 200 points on Friday was the biggest single-day drop for Shanghai stocks in three months.In the sell-off, investors appeared to be cashing out of their current holdings to invest in initial public offerings set for next week. The I.P.O.s are the first to be allowed since July, when the government banned new listings.I.P.O.s had been a popular investment, as most companies rose by the maximum 44 percent allowable on the first trading day, with subsequent trading capped at a gain or loss of 10 percent. The big first-day spikes were the result of speculative investment and of government policy designed to make sure deals did not overvalue the businesses being listed.In addition to the new inquiries into Citic Securities and Guosen, Guotai Junan International Holdings, the Hong Kong unit of one of China\u2019s other big brokerage firms, said this week that the company had been unable to make contact with its chairman for several days.

{"Headline": "Brazil Hedge Fund Star Looks Elsewhere for His Next Big Bet", "Date": "2015-11-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Luis Stuhlberger\u2019s Brazilian hedge fund has had an astonishing run \u2014 even in the face of his country\u2019s sinking economy.But he has grown increasingly bearish about the economic outlook for Brazil, and he is no longer placing most of his bets here, deciding to look elsewhere for investment opportunities.\u201cBrazil is going to get much worse before it gets better,\u201d he said.Given his record, when Mr. Stuhlberger talks, Brazil watchers pay attention. His flagship fund Verde, known for its big-picture calls on economic trends, has returned an average of 29 percent a year, after fees, since it was founded in 1997.Brazil\u2019s stock market returned 10 percent a year, on average, and its main bond market benchmark returned 16 percent a year over the same period.And while Brazil has been practically synonymous with economic volatility, Verde has had only one down year ever \u2014 2008, during the global financial crisis, when it lost a modest 6 percent.These numbers are in Brazil\u2019s currency, the real, in which Mr. Stuhlberger\u2019s fund is priced, and most of his clients are Brazilian retail investors. But even in dollars, Verde\u2019s average annual return has been over 20 percent.A Brazilian who had given him 35,000 reais, the cost of a sport utility vehicle at the time, would now have 4 million reais, enough for a couple to retire in comfort.\u201cHe has the best long-term track record in Brazil,\u201d said Arm\u00ednio Fraga, head of the Brazilian asset manager G\u00e1vea Investimentos, and former managing director of the investor George Soros\u2019s firm. \u201cLike all great investors, Luis thinks big and he thinks creatively, without dogma or formulas.\u201dGlobal players have taken note. Credit Suisse bought Mr. Stuhlberger\u2019s firm, Hedging-Griffo, in 2006. When his noncompete clause ended last year and Mr. Stuhlberger became independent again, the Swiss bank bought a minority stake in his new firm, Verde Asset Management.\u201cHe\u2019s a legend here, so we benefit from being able to offer our clients meetings with him and early access to his views,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Olympio Pereira, chief executive of Credit Suisse Brazil.The hedge fund giant Blackstone recently allocated part of its $3 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund to Mr. Stuhlberger, alongside names such as Goldman Sachs and Cerberus.Mr. Stuhlberger is not a stock picker, and he rarely holds a big position in a single company. Instead he tries to identify economic trends, to allocate funds among asset classes to get ahead of these trends, and to use hedging strategies to smooth out the ride while he waits for his bets to pay off.\u201cMost of the time I do nothing except read and study,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I go the whole year without changing allocations. Then I make a big change and wait.\u201dHe got a little too far ahead of local trends early last year, as his decision to exit Brazil\u2019s stock market, short its currency and keep his bond holdings conservative kept Verde slightly in the red for most of 2014.But in September 2014 markets came around to his bearishness, and Verde ended the year up 9 percent. So far this year, it is up 24 percent.Such returns were below the fund\u2019s historical average, but Alberto Jacobsen, chief executive of Risk Office, a S\u00e3o Paulo investment consultancy for institutional investors, said Mr. Stuhlberger\u2019s performance was \u201chighly impressive\u201d given the country\u2019s environment. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to make money when the stock market is falling and interest rates are rising. Many other hedge funds here lost money.\u201dBut despite his past success, Mr. Stuhlberger concluded last year that there were too few opportunities in Brazil for a fund of Verde\u2019s size to be fully invested. So he has begun to return, in installments, 40 percent of its 14 billion reais ($3.8 billion) to investors.\u201cIt\u2019s much too early to buy the stock market here. My clients don\u2019t pay me to hold cash for them,\u201d he said.Verde is required by regulations to keep 80 percent of its assets inside Brazil. But Mr. Stuhlberger, long unusual among fund managers here for investing globally \u2014 he bet big on German real estate in 2011 \u2014 opened a new fund this year that is available only to qualified investors, and therefore has no limit on how much it can invest abroad.His main bets in this go-anywhere fund, called Horizonte, are that developed-country equity markets and the dollar are not done rising; China will devalue its currency; and emerging markets will stay in the doldrums as low interest rates, low commodity prices and slow growth persist for the foreseeable future.Some are cautious about his new venture. \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant, but we\u2019re not certain that he\u2019ll have the same competitive advantage outside Brazil that he does at home,\u201d Mr. Jacobsen said.\u201cThe country isn\u2019t financially viable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has tried to build a European social democracy in the third world. The numbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d\u201cThere will have to be a major crisis before the population accepts cuts in social spending,\u201d Mr. Stuhlberger said.And though outrage at the way some of that spending is diverted has led to a groundbreaking investigation into corruption, Mr. Stuhlberger said the corruption was so endemic he feared that no new, clean political institutions existed to replace the old ones.While he waits for the crisis to deepen, his Brazilian allocation is mostly in local inflation-protected bonds. He also holds currency derivatives that will profit if the real falls further, and has a small position long on Petrobras bonds and short on the stock.For both the government and Petrobras, the energy giant, he said, \u201cDefault is not a risk, for now.\u201dMr. Stuhlberger came late to the hedge fund business. Planning to work in his father\u2019s construction company, he studied civil engineering, but found that math interested him more.In 1980 he started to work in a small brokerage house trading first coffee, then gold, at a time when many Brazilians sought the precious metal as a defense against hyperinflation, since the government forbade holding foreign currency as an investment.When Brazil lifted most capital and currency controls in 1990, Mr. Stuhlberger began to trade stocks and bonds on the newly important futures exchanges.He was 42 years old when he opened Verde in 1997. He started with under a million dollars. Success quickly brought clients, and he closed the fund to new investors in 2002.For all his gloom about Brazil\u2019s economy, Mr. Stuhlberger, now 60, says he loves life here.\u201cThe people are incredibly talented, and the Brazilian way is to help each other out. There\u2019s not the ruthlessness that you see in the U.S. Here you can be friends with your competitors.\u201dHe said work left him little time for socializing or hobbies, though he and his wife of 36 years have a passion for movies from Argentina.He now spends several months a year traveling internationally, and some members of his team are abroad more often than they are at home.\u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re looking for investments now,\u201d Mr. Stuhlberger said. \u201cOutside of Brazil.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hidden Costs of Terrorism", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhat is the economic cost of terrorism?The conventional wisdom is that an act of terrorism accounts for a mere blip in economic damage. Economists often point to research showing that after the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the London subway bombings in 2005, gross domestic product in those countries barely budged and showed little direct correlation to the attacks.Even in the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, consumption remained relatively stable, though investment fell. (There have been bigger impacts on places like Bali and Tunisia, whose economies depend heavily on foreign tourism.)If the stock market can be considered a barometer of economic confidence, it is remarkable to see how quickly it typically rebounds after a terrorist event. In the case of New York, Madrid and London, the market briefly dropped but then recovered, often within weeks. In the case of Sept. 11, the S.&P. 500-stock index returned to where it had been before the attacks just 30 days later.On Monday, market participants steeled themselves for a steep decline, but the indexes in the United States were up more than 1 percent, and markets in Europe were close to flat.But that reaction \u2014 and the reaction to previous attacks \u2014 may belie the true cost of terrorism and, more important, underestimate the potential cost of the Paris killings.\u201cThe aftermath of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks may not in itself prompt extensive market-based volatility,\u201d Citigroup wrote in a report, suggesting that financial markets \u201ctreat such developments as idiosyncratic and the unfortunate reality of a world where large-scale carnage has become an almost daily, if sickening, development.\u201dThe report, however, said, \u201cWe think this time is different.\u201dThat view is consistent with the opinions of some security experts, who in recent days have said that the attack in Paris represents just one in a continuum.\u201cWe have upgraded the risk of terrorist attacks not only in the Middle East but also in the West, as well as the likelihood of increased international military intervention in IS strongholds in Syria, Iraq and Libya,\u201d Citigroup said, referring to the Islamic State.The attack in Paris could have far-reaching implications for the future of the eurozone and for companies doing business there. The events in Paris could add to the pressure to close borders in the eurozone. It is also reigniting a debate about privacy and surveillance that could have big implications for technology companies.Over the weekend, Evercore ISI, the research arm of the investment bank Evercore, published a note to its clients suggesting that the events in Paris could threaten the political support inside Germany for its chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has been a big supporter of open borders, of the Syrian migration and of limiting electronic surveillance on civil liberty grounds.\u201cThe connection between the terror threat and migration flows threatens to rupture the border-free Schengen zone,\u201d the note said, describing the borderless, passport-free zone known as the Schengen area. \u201cIt challenges Merkel\u2019s position at home and in the wider E.U., nudging higher the tail risk that Europe\u2019s indispensable leader could fall from power.\u201dThe economic implications of this are significant, to say the least. Evercore ISI even speculated it was possible that Ms. Merkel could ultimately be replaced by Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, who has seemingly been inclined to let Greece leave the eurozone.An analysis of the cost of Sept. 11 conducted by The New York Times added up the physical damage ($55 billion) and the economic damage ($123 billion). It also included other costs: the cost of developing the Homeland Security Department ($589 billion), war funding ($1.6 trillion) and what was determined to be the continuing cost of those wars and taking care of veterans ($867 billion).Some economists might say much of that actually increases economic growth. That\u2019s true. Sort of. The truth is it\u2019s an unproductive form of spending. And the development of Homeland Security and the war creates a so-called economic friction in the system that slows down just about everything; it\u2019s hard to measure, but it\u2019s there.One place to look at the cost of terror is Israel. An academic study that examined the economic damage of the attacks in Israel between 1994 and 2003 showed that the country\u2019s per-capita G.D.P. \u201cwould have been 8.6 percent higher than it was\u201d had there been peace.Conducted by Dotan Persitz, a scholar at Tel Aviv University, the study found that \u201cPalestinian terror increased the shares of consumption and government expenditures\u201d while it \u201cdecreased the shares of investment and trade balance in G.D.P.\u201dThe study is hard to fully appreciate on its face, but even if the damage in Israel were only half what was reported, it would have been billions of dollars.Let\u2019s hope the attacks in Paris were a one-off. But the study is a reminder that the cost of terrorism could be greater than we think.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peabody Energy Agrees to Greater Disclosures of Financial Risks", "Date": "2015-11-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe coal giant\u2019s concessions came in response to a two-year investigation by the New York attorney general that found that Peabody had not been forthright with investors and regulators about threats to its business that the company projected in private.The Peabody agreement will not include a monetary settlement. Its impact will surely pale in comparison with the other problems Peabody faces as demand for coal plummets, replaced by cleaner-burning natural gas.Shares of Peabody, which is based in St. Louis, have lost more than 90 percent of their value over the last year as the entire industry has been overwhelmed by crippling debts and more stringent regulations on coal burning by electric utilities.\u201cThis case represents an unprecedented first step in the absolutely critical work of forcing coal and other fossil fuel companies to start being honest about the damage they are doing to our planet,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement, \u201cand the risks they create, both for the public and for shareholders.\u201dOil and coal companies have come under rising pressure from pension funds and other investors to disclose more about the risks their businesses face in their annual reports and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings \u2014 including the risks that they will not be able to extract all their reserves in the future. Similarly, future carbon taxes, the trading of carbon-emission permits and a variety of local and state regulations could raise the price of fossil fuels relative to other energy sources and result in a decline in demand.\u201cThe N.Y.A.G. concludes that Peabody\u2019s disclosures denied its ability to reasonably predict the future impact of any climate change regulation on its business,\u201d the settlement says, \u201cwhile the company and its consultants projected severe impacts from certain potential regulations that would materially affect Peabody.\u201dIn its next filing to the S.E.C., Peabody agreed to a fuller disclosure of the risks as well as projections by the International Energy Agency of lower global coal demand in the future, should stronger regulatory action be taken around the world. The risks noted will include unfavorable lending trends for financing coal-fueled power plants overseas as well as divestment campaigns targeting the investment community, \u201cwhich could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities.\u201d\u201cThere is no acceptance or denial of their findings\u201d from his company, said Vic Svec, a Peabody senior vice president. He added, in an email statement, that future company disclosures that include projections and predictions \u201cshall be accompanied by a statement that Peabody has made projections of the impact of scenarios involving certain potential laws and regulations relating to climate change or coal, which could result in materially adverse effects on its markets.\u201dDavid M. Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s environmental crimes section, described the agreement as \u201ca modest settlement.\u201d But he added, \u201cIt stands for an important principle about the need for honesty and transparency in financial statements.\u201dUnder New York\u2019s Martin Act, the attorney general has broad powers to investigate companies that are suspected of misleading investors or regulators. Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s aides noted that they could have negotiated fines as part of a settlement but concluded that any dollar amount would have been small, potentially diminishing the impact of the resolution.The attorney general\u2019s office served its first subpoena on Peabody in 2007, while Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo held the office, seeking information and documents relating to its disclosure to investors on climate change and related regulations. In late 2013, Mr. Schneiderman requested additional documents and information.The settlement noted two primary defects in Peabody\u2019s past annual reports and other filings, one being an \u201cincomplete discussion of the findings and projections of the International Energy Agency\u201d regarding future coal demand.Most important was Peabody\u2019s repeated statement that it was \u201cnot possible\u201d for the company \u201cto reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on (Peabody\u2019s) results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\u201dThat statement, according to the settlement, neglected to take into account a March 2013 company projection that aggressive regulatory action could reduce the dollar value of the coal mined out of the southern Powder River Basin by 38 percent and of the Illinois Basin coal by 33 percent by 2025.And in March 2014, an outside consulting firm commissioned by Peabody projected that the enactment of a $20-per-ton carbon tax would reduce the demand for coal as a source for electric power generation in the United States by 38 to 53 percent compared with 2013 levels.Commenting on the settlement, Brandon L. Garrett, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, said, \u201cThe most interesting question is whether this will be a template for further disclosure and greater transparency by other companies, particularly energy companies.\u201dAn article on Monday about Peabody Energy\u2019s agreement to disclose more to its investors about the financial risks it faces related to climate change described the company incorrectly. It is a private sector company as opposed to a government-owned one, but it is not privately owned. (It is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man Who Hates E.T.F.s", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBearded and tanned, Peter S. Kraus, the chief executive of AllianceBernstein, strode with assurance into a Midtown Manhattan conference room full of financial advisers from a large investment bank.He was there to pitch them on Alliance mutual funds and promote the expertise of his stock and bond experts who manage these investment pools.But the financial advisers had been doing a nice little business ignoring these types of actively managed funds and steering their clients into cheaper, index-tracking exchange-traded funds, thank you very much.So Mr. Kraus had a gloomy message for those dazzled by the ascent of E.T.F.s.\u201cLet me bring it down to reality,\u201d Mr. Kraus said. \u201cYou guys woke up one morning in August and the Dow was down 1,090 points. And on that day a $40 billion E.T.F. traded at a 30 percent discount.Mr. Kraus, who is 63 and spent 22 years at Goldman Sachs, wore a dark blue suit and a pink shirt that he matched with a similarly colored tie and a pink polka dotted Swatch. He addressed his audience in a cocksure manner that is often seen in Goldman executives who, failing to rise to the top there, move on to firms with a lesser pedigree.\u201cThat should never happen, and if your client traded on that day, you will never get that back. Never. These funds may have low fees but they are not safe, and your clients need to understand that.\u201dMr. Kraus, as an active investor losing market share to E.T.F.s, has an open bias in this debate \u2014 as he freely admits.It is also true that he has not been the only person issuing such warnings.As the E.T.F. industry has grown (with close to $3 trillion under management globally, there is as much money is invested in E.T.F.s as there is in hedge funds), so have concerns that too much money has been lured into hard-to-trade areas of the market and into risky investment strategies.Critics have included Stanley Fischer, vice chairman at the Federal Reserve, and investors like Carl C. Icahn and Howard Marks. And their complaint has been consistent: What happens if a wave of selling hits these funds, and investors can\u2019t get their money back?The concern stems from the view that a rush of money into funds that promise instant liquidity is favoring those with a short-term, trading-driven market outlook as opposed to the patient, longer-term perspective espoused by buy-and-hold investors.The stock market swings in recent weeks have heightened these fears.For example, large E.T.F.s promise immediate liquidity in illiquid areas \u2014 such as emerging-market bonds, leveraged loans and credit-default swaps.Also on offer are funds that borrow three times the amount of their assets to bet on various markets going up or down in value.AllianceBernstein, or AB as the firm has recently rebranded itself, represents the opposite of this trend: It is an old-school money manager that offers, for a fee, a range of stock and bond funds that promise to beat benchmark stock or bond indexes.The problem is that since 2010 many of the so-called active funds offered by AB and its peers have trailed their benchmarks, not least offerings that invest in large American companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.As a result, assets have steadily flowed from fund companies with an active orientation like Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Franklin Templeton to larger firms like BlackRock and Vanguard that specialize in passive investment styles.For example, the firm\u2019s assets under management remain broadly where they were when Mr. Kraus was hired to revive the firm\u2019s fortunes in December 2008 \u2014 $463 billion. In a business that prizes asset growth above all else, that is not necessarily a track record to brag about.Of course, actively managed mutual funds still make up two-thirds of the mutual fund market. But it\u2019s the increasing size and growth of the passive fund market that Mr. Kraus sees as a threat.From Wall Street to Washington and in the towers of academia, people are buzzing about what some say is the pernicious focus in corporate America on short-term profits.\u201cIf you absorb too much liquidity, there is just not enough grease to make the wheel work,\u201d Mr. Kraus said to the brokers. \u201cWe have seen much higher volatility and much faster price reactions over the past few years, and the main reason is this shift from active to passive investing.\u201dWhile finance chiefs often criticize their peers behind closed doors, it is rare for a chief executive to raise pointed questions about a rival\u2019s business model openly.When Mr. Kraus says that the dominance of Vanguard and BlackRock, whose passively managed funds amount to more than $4 trillion, is a risk for investors, people \u2014 and the firms \u2014 take notice.Vanguard a threat to the market?Joel M. Dickson, a senior executive within the indexing giant\u2019s strategy unit, has been on the receiving end of many complaints and criticisms from beaten-down active managers, but he said this broke new ground.\u201cE.T.F.s reflect the market environment; they do not dictate it,\u201d Mr. Dickson said in an interview at a Morningstar conference for E.T.F.s last month. \u201cWe are just agents for our 20 million investors who are making their own investment decisions.\u201dAnd Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, by far the largest E.T.F. provider, rejects Mr. Kraus\u2019s contention that E.T.F.s will experience more sharp price drops as they did in August.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the problem \u2014 this was a market structure problem,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cAug. 24 was a big event, but 90 minutes later everything was fine.\u201dSome of BlackRock\u2019s largest E.T.F.s plummeted from 25 to 35 percent on that day \u2014 large moves for funds containing more than $60 billion in investor assets.BlackRock has issued a research paper that concludes that the sharp price drops were the result of panic selling by investors and a lack of trading information, which prevented market makers from coming in as buyers to support prices.For all the eyebrows that Mr. Kraus is raising for his anti-E.T.F. crusade, he may be better known for his lucrative job-hopping spree in 2008.In March of that year, Mr. Kraus retired from his post as co-head of Goldman\u2019s asset management division, not long after some of the firm\u2019s largest hedge funds experienced sharp falls in 2007.In September, Mr. Kraus joined Merrill Lynch at the behest of his good friend from Goldman, John A. Thain, then chief executive. Mr. Thain sold Merrill to Bank of America a few days later.The more conservative executives at Bank of America did not appreciate Mr. Kraus\u2019s colorful ways \u2014 he favored a green BlackBerry and displayed expensive art in his office \u2014 and by December of that year he had moved on to the top job at AB.During the worst financial crisis in a generation, Mr. Kraus was paid close to $30 million by Merrill and on joining AB three months later, received an upfront bonus of $6 million and restricted stock worth $50 million at the time. Under the terms of his contract, he gets no bonus and does not receive the stock until 2018.AB was a troubled firm when he joined it. Assets under management were half their $800 billion peak in 2007, and in the early years of his tenure many of the company\u2019s funds continued to lose investors because of shoddy performance.In recent years, however, performance has improved, and most AB funds invested in the United States stock market are now beating their indexes, according to the asset management tracking firm eVestment.Nonetheless, inflows have been muted as investor cash keeps pouring into Vanguard and BlackRock E.T.F.s.And Mr. Kraus\u2019s advice to investors now is to move opposite of the herd: \u201cPeople are just not assessing the risks right \u2014 these funds are free riders and they are not safe. You should be short them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tullett Prebon in Talks to Buy ICAP\u2019s Global Brokering Business", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British brokerage firm Tullett Prebon said on Friday that it was in discussions with its British counterpart ICAP to acquire ICAP\u2019s global brokering business, which acts as a middleman for trading stocks, currencies and commodities.The transaction, if completed, would expand Tullett Prebon\u2019s traditional intermediary business at a time when so-called interdealer brokers have been hurt by lower trading volumes as they face uncertainty in the global markets and higher regulatory costs.The deal would include ICAP\u2019s global brokering business; associated technology and brokerage platforms, including its electronic interest-rate swap platform iSwap; ICAP\u2019s associated information services revenue; and some of ICAP\u2019s joint ventures.Under the deal, Tullett Prebon said it would expect to issue new stock equal to more than 100 percent of its existing share capital. A majority of the new shares would be distributed to ICAP\u2019s shareholders, and ICAP would retain a minority stake in Tullett Prebon.Both ICAP and Tullett Prebon have found themselves caught in recent years in a scandal over the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor.Three former brokers from ICAP and one former broker from Tullett Prebon are on trial in London on criminal charges that they conspired to manipulate Libor.In 2013, ICAP agreed to pay about $87 million in fines to British and American authorities related to accusations of attempted manipulation of Libor as it was tied to the Japanese yen.ICAP\u2019s global brokering business acts an intermediary for businesses and individuals looking to trade a variety of asset classes, including bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates and stocks.The global brokering business focuses on so-called voice brokering, in which orders are negotiated on the phone, rather than through electronic orders, as well as a hybrid of voice brokering and electronic trading. It had 1,458 voice brokers as of the end of March.The business operates in 37 locations in 23 countries, including one in Jersey City.It is by far ICAP\u2019s largest revenue generator, but it has experienced declining revenue in recent years and has been less profitable than the company\u2019s remaining electronic trading and post-trade risk businesses. The businesses being sold generated revenue of 808 million pounds, or about $1.2 billion, in ICAP\u2019s 2015 fiscal year, which ended in March. That is down from revenue of \u00a3913 million in fiscal 2014 and revenue of \u00a3992 million in fiscal 2013.After extraordinary items, those businesses only generated a profit of \u00a321 million in fiscal year 2015.

{"Headline": "China Plans to Lift Moratorium on I.P.O.s by End of Year", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA spokesman for the regulator said that after \u201cperfecting\u201d the system for initial public offerings, China would allow an initial group of 28 companies to proceed with listings in the coming weeks and would seek to streamline and strengthen oversight of the listing process, Xinhua said.In addition to suspending I.P.O.s, those measures included a harsh crackdown backed by the police against any investors betting against stocks, orders for state-owned brokerages to buy stocks on behalf of the state, and banning large shareholders of companies from selling their stakes.The timing of the move is opportunistic, as Chinese stocks have recently staged a rebound. From its low in late August, the main Shanghai share index has risen 23 percent.Getting the I.P.O. process right has proved challenging for Chinese regulators, who have suspended and resumed new listings several times in recent years when markets have become too volatile.New listings are a favored target of speculators because, under current regulations, the shares are permitted to rise as much as 44 percent on their first day of trading. Trading on subsequent days is capped at a daily gain or loss of 10 percent, as it is for all other stocks.As part of their increased oversight, financial regulators have been cracking down recently on insider trading, which analysts say is rampant on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets.With the resumption of I.P.O.s, the spokesman for the securities regulator, Deng Ge, said on Friday that the agency intended to simplify the approval process for smaller companies and heighten the responsibilities of the brokerages that bring new listings to the market.The new measures would \u201cincrease protections for the rights and interests of investors and further reform and perfect the I.P.O. system,\u201d Mr. Deng said, according to Xinhua.In a separate development Friday evening, China\u2019s central bank and securities regulator jointly published long-delayed guidelines for investment firms in mainland China and Hong Kong to gain access to each other\u2019s markets.The quota will be capped at the outset at a relatively modest 300 billion renminbi, or around $50 billion, for flows in each direction. But the move is a significant development, giving international asset managers their most direct access yet to mainland investors.The mainland\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said the publication of the detailed guidelines would allow the pilot program to move forward immediately.The start of the arrangement had been highly anticipated in Hong Kong, where international funds operate freely but have struggled to gain access to the mainland\u2019s still-restricted market for investment products.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-11-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySluggish traffic and a buildup of inventory at Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom last week prompted a broad market sell-off in retail stocks. And investors fretted that consumers were not feeling flush despite a brightening economic outlook and a strong recovery in the job market. But Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer by sales, on Tuesday posted positive sales numbers for the fifth consecutive quarter, though it said income declined as it continued to invest in its e-commerce operations and higher wages for its workers.Home Depot and the discount retailer TJX also posted strong sales growth on Tuesday.The upbeat numbers \u201cindicate that the consumer is, on average, still in decent shape,\u201d Christopher Horvers, a retail analyst at J.P. Morgan, said in a note. The department store woes, he said, were \u201cmore of an apparel issue\u201d because of an unseasonably warm October that blunted early demand for winter boots and coats.Sales at stores in the United States open at least a year rose 1.5 percent, led by an 8 percent jump in sales at Walmart\u2019s smaller-format Neighborhood Markets. Walmart\u2019s same-store sales logged the fifth consecutive quarter of growth, buoyed by a 1.7 percent increase in traffic over all.Operating income fell 8.8 percent, and international sales fell 11.4 percent during the quarter, hurt partly by a strong United States dollar, which erodes the dollar value of overseas earnings. E-commerce sales growth slowed to 10 percent.Walmart said back-to-school and Halloween sales had been strong, with some weakness in early October because of the warm weather. Apparel sales rose, while consumer electronics sales declined because of slower sales of television and wireless products. Inventory in the United States, a concern at many of Walmart\u2019s peers, grew at about half the rate of sales and declined on a comparative store basis.For the holiday season, Walmart has simplified its sales offerings and will carry most of its in-store deals and so-called doorbusters online. Greg Foran, chief executive of Walmart U.S., said last week that the retailer\u2019s focus over the holidays would be on execution and the store experience \u2014 an approach he has taken to revamp Walmart stores over all, with better in-stock supply and customer service.\u201cWe do expect it to be competitive,\u201d Mr. Foran said. \u201cIt always is.\u201d He said he expected Walmart to log same-store sales growth of about 1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 1.5 percent last year.Still, some analysts cautioned that the somber mood after the Paris attacks \u2014 and nervousness over the safety of crowds and public spaces \u2014 could affect retailers\u2019 Black Friday sales at a time the rush to clinch deals was already losing its appeal.Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of the consumer consultancy Strategic Resource Group in New York, cautioned that Black Friday had already gotten a bad reputation for security after stampedes and rowdy fights at stores in recent years. Any terrorism fears would add to those concerns, he said.\u201cInstead of going family shopping with the parents, the grandparents, the grandkids, what you could see more of instead is shoppers leaving the kids at home,\u201d he said. \u201dOr consumers might skip Thursday and Friday, and shop in December instead, because they expect to be able to find deals then too,\u201d he said.Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen, warned of what he called a \u201cCNN effect\u201d of consumers becoming more frugal with holiday purchases, and devoting more attention to news watching.To address any concerns over security, the Mall of America, the country\u2019s largest shopping center, announced that it had put in place extra security precautions, but that only some of the measures would be noticeable to guests. Dan Jasper, a spokesman for the mall, based in Bloomington, Minn., declined to elaborate.Jesse Tron, a spokesman for the trade group International Council of Shopping Centers, said that shoppers should expect to see additional police, including K9 units, at malls.Mr. Foran of Walmart said he had not seen any change in shopper sentiment or spending after the multiple attacks in the French capital on Friday. Walmart has not bolstered security at stores beyond measures that would normally be taken heading into the Black Friday sales rush, officials said.Mr. Flickinger said that extra security measures might reassure consumers, but \u201ccould also remind them of dangers that they may not have been thinking about last year.\u201d\u201cAnd over all, the mood is less likely to make people want to spend,\u201d he added. \u201cThey feel blessed to be alive. They schedule more time with family and friends. They spend less time shopping.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are offering financial and investment advice tailored just for females.But do they really need specialized help \u2014 any more than the sort of personalized attention that many consumers crave? Or are these firms, backed by big investors, simply grasping for women\u2019s growing wallets?\u201cI know they don\u2019t like what is out there,\u201d Ms. Steinberg, a programmer, said of her subscribers, who, on average, are 38 years old and earn $78,000. \u201cMy mission from the beginning was about empowering women to build net worth.

They generally earn less than men, are more likely to take breaks from the work force, and live longer, all intractable issues that demand societal and policy changes, like less male-focused workplaces and policies.She declined to provide details about the service, but here is hoping Ms. Krawcheck will veer far from her Wall Street roots and use her stature to provide the kind of low-cost, comprehensive advice that is still more difficult for nonwealthy people to come by.The women at WorthFM, as the firm will be known, both divorced single mothers with an unstoppable entrepreneurial drive, have already mapped out their approach and raised $2 million from investors \u2014 all divorced women. They will focus on the mass affluent, generally someone with less than $500,000 to invest. That amount is usually not enough to capture the attention of many human advisers (who generally charge 1 percent of assets) because of sheer economics.But an integral part of WorthFM\u2019s approach is to act a tad more like a human adviser \u2014 that is, build a relationship first and then get into all the money stuff.So how does one go about building a relationship with a robot? Apparently, by making a woman feel that she has been heard.With that information in hand, the service will personalize the woman\u2019s path through the site, taking into account her financial circumstances and knowledge about finance.The women who value money as a means to pleasure might first be presented with a video featuring the co-founders, in an attempt to engage them.

And one of the biggest weaknesses of robo-advisers is that they fail to address a person\u2019s entire financial picture as a human adviser might, instead focusing on the handful of investment accounts they offer. Ms. Steinberg said she wanted to address the whole picture, including debt management, but that would come later.According to a 2009 report by the Boston Consulting Group, there is a huge opportunity to capture women\u2019s wallets \u2014 \u201cone that can be immensely profitable for financial institutions,\u201d the report said, noting that women continually feel exasperated by the poor way financial companies treat them.\u201cThe economics of the industry are tough,\u201d said Manisha Thakor, director of wealth strategies for women at Buckingham, an investment advisory firm.\u201cThey are more likely to be in the plan, they save more when they are in the plan, they trade less and they take advantage of professional management,\u201d she added.Their problem? Even though they squirrel away more, the average man\u2019s account balance is about 50 percent larger, largely because women earn less on average.And that can\u2019t be solved by any robo-adviser.An earlier version of the picture caption with this column reversed the identities of the two women shown.

{"Headline": "John Kerry Confronts Human Rights as He Zips Through Central Asia", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporter\u2019s NotebookCentral Ashgabat is almost entirely made of white marble, even the under-construction American Embassy, whose marble content has been of particular interest to Mr. Berdymukhammedov. But Mr. Kerry wanted to focus on other issues, including the jailing of suspected dissidents and religious practitioners on flimsy charges, Turkmenistan\u2019s recent slowness to pay American contractors for work they have done \u2014 a result of a downturn in gas prices \u2014 and the matter of what the Central Asian states might look like if they put together a network of electricity grids and gas pipelines, rather than relying on selling to markets in Russia and China.\u201cI am not here to lecture you,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, a line he has repeated often on his four-day tour of the five \u201cStans\u201d of the former Soviet Union. He discovered, however, that many of the leaders in the region were ready to lecture him, unloading their grievances about extremists flowing in from Afghanistan and the troubles of balancing larger powers on their borders: Russia, China and Iran.Mr. Kerry\u2019s trip has been an experiment in both power-balancing and sleep deprivation. He has flown from the potholed streets and crumbling architecture of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, near China\u2019s western border; to the cozy, tree-lined streets of Samarkand, Uzbekistan; and then far north to snowy Astana, Kazakhstan, which looks vaguely like Las Vegas.But for pure weirdness, it is hard to beat Ashgabat. No Turkmens were allowed anywhere near the reception site to see their president as he walked down a pathway between the palace\u2019s cascading fountains, past his goose-stepping guards, to greet Mr. Kerry.But by some measures, Mr. Berdymukhammedov is a reformer. He returned the country to a normal calendar; his predecessor, Saparmurat Niyazov, had named days of the week after family members. Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Berdymukhammedov does not insist that his image appear on every piece of currency; just some. The statue of Mr. Niyazov rotated so that it always faced the sun; the new, gold-coated one of Mr. Berdymukhammedov is stationary. And he insists that he did not really want it.Two years ago he explained that his electorate demanded that it be erected. \u201cMy main goal is to serve the people and the motherland,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd so I will listen to the opinion of the people and do as they choose.\u201dAs Mr. Kerry has traveled along the steppe, he has been adjusting his language on human rights, becoming more forthright with every stop. It is a hard thing to calibrate. Say too little, as he did when he initially urged leaders in the region to think about the \u201chuman dimension\u201d of development, and critics might accuse him of bending to some of the most authoritarian governments in the world. Say too much and the conversation is shut down.In a speech to students in Astana, Mr. Kerry made his most direct case that Central Asian states had gone too far in the crackdown against Muslim extremists.\u201cWe have to understand that the terrorist presence doesn\u2019t give authorities a license to use violence indiscriminately,\u201d he said. Evoking some language from the Vietnam War, in which he fought, he said: \u201cWe can\u2019t rescue a village from Daesh or Boko Haram by destroying it,\u201d referring to militants of the Islamic State and extremists based in Nigeria. \u201cAnd terrorism is not a legitimate excuse to lock up political opponents, diminish the rights of civil society or pin a false label on activists.\u201dMr. Berdymukhammedov said each situation involved \u201ctechnical issues\u201d that would have to be followed up by \u201cexperts.\u201d At a meeting in Washington two weeks ago, a senior Turkmen official offered a lecture about the United States\u2019 use of capital punishment and the percentage of Americans who are in the prison system.The hard question in each of the countries Mr. Kerry visited is how to tie progress on human rights to the economic and diplomatic relationship.Mr. Kerry knows he has leverage now, thanks to the economic downturn in the region and the nervousness about Russia. But it is unclear whether the Central Asian leaders value new ties with the United States more than efforts to oppose what they view, perhaps out of paranoia, as direct threats to their rule.Mr. Kerry\u2019s trip has dropped him into one of the least globalized corners of the Earth. Internet service is spotty and almost always monitored. When he gathered the foreign ministers of the five Central Asian countries in a meeting in Samarkand, chosen because it was once a crucial trading post on the Silk Road, it was clear that when they broke free of the Soviet Union, the countries did just the wrong thing: They devised their rules and their infrastructure to keep from trading with one other, valuing independence over interconnectedness.\u201cTwenty-five years ago we were all linked, through Moscow,\u201d one of the foreign ministers, who declined to allow his name to be used, said at the end of the session. But mutual suspicions, border and water disputes, and fears of openness have kept them from unifying; each has its own currency and bizarre import rules.Mr. Kerry made it clear that the United States has to make up lost time; 23 years between visits, he said in Ashgabat, is \u201cfar too long a time.\u201d His message struck a chord with the students he spoke to, many of whom have studied in the United States and Europe. Some of the leaders he visited, on the other hand, had a look that said they had heard it all before, in a land where larger powers come, make promises and go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... British Columbia", "Date": "2015-11-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate14 PhotosA COTSWOLD COTTAGE-STYLE HOME IN VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA1,699,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS ($1.291 MILLION) This three-story Cotswold Cottage-style home in Victoria, on Vancouver Island, offers mountain and sea views from its south-facing back deck. Dating to 1936, the 4,930-square-foot house, with five bedrooms and four and a half baths on a half-acre lot, has stucco exterior walls and cedar shingles and is set into a slight incline.The main entrance, at midlevel, opens to a foyer with parquet floors and a staircase on the left. On the right are a bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, next to a den and a powder room that could be converted together into a sixth bedroom. On the left is the kitchen, which was updated in 2007 with white painted cabinets, granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances, including a Viking range and a Sub-Zero refrigerator. Beyond the foyer are a living room, a dining room and a family room, all of which abut a wraparound deck of about 1,140 square feet with a brick wood-burning fireplace. The living room has a working gas fireplace of marble. Floors on the main level are oak. The cottage has original leaded windows and other details.The top floor of the home has three bedrooms, including the master, which has an en-suite bathroom, walk-in closet and a gas fireplace. The other two bedrooms share a bathroom. The floors upstairs are fir, and the bathrooms have in-floor heating. The lower level of the house has a large open expanse, set up as a combination games room, rec room and media room, that opens to two patios. Also on the lower level are a bedroom/den, a bathroom, a laundry and storage rooms. Furniture is not included in the asking price but is negotiable. MARKET OVERVIEWVictoria, a city of roughly 80,000 in a greater metropolitan area of about 345,000 on Vancouver Island, has had a robust single-family housing market in the last several years, said Bill Ethier, the president and managing broker of Royal LePage Coast Capital Realty.\u201cIn single-family dwellings, we\u2019re seeing price increases as high as 15 percent year-over-year in some areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the market in general, if we add in condominiums and townhouses, we\u2019re looking at increases of 4 percent.\u201dHome prices did fall by about 10 percent to 15 percent in the global real estate crisis of 2008, but they recovered relatively quickly, brokers said. Inventory is low, and the health of the housing market in the much larger city of Vancouver on the mainland, which has about 600,000 residents in a greater metropolitan area of about 2.4 million, is pushing up Victoria\u2019s home prices, Mr. Piercy said. In October this year, the average price of a single-family home in central Victoria was 608,200 Canadian dollars, or about $462,232; that was a 9.4 percent increase over the average price in October 2014 of 555,900 Canadian dollars, or about $422,484, said Julie Rust, a sales representative with Newport Realty. \u201cWe\u2019re now definitely a seller\u2019s market,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is much more competition and multiple offers fueled by low interest rates, increased demand and the sudden discovery of this wonderful community.\u201dThe priciest housing market on Vancouver Island, Mr. Ethier said, is Oak Bay, a municipality in the greater Victoria area, which includes the affluent neighborhood of Uplands. Single-family homes in Uplands can range from one million Canadian dollars, or about $760,000, for a tear-down, up to 10 or 15 million Canadian, or $7.6 million to $11.4 million, he said.Within the city of Victoria, the most desirable neighborhoods are Fairfield and Rockland, Mr. Ethier said. \u201cIf people are looking for the equivalent of blue-chip stocks in real estate, Fairfield, Rockland, Oak Bay are where home prices are the first to go up and the last to go down,\u201d he said.WHO BUYS IN VICTORIANeither the government nor the real estate industry regularly collects data on foreign homeownership on Vancouver Island, since the numbers of foreign homeowners are small, brokers said. Most home buyers are Canadian, typically from British Columbia, though there are also retirees from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario, Ms. Rust said. United States citizens, the largest group of foreign home buyers, diminished after the global real estate crisis, but have begun to return in larger numbers with the strong United States dollar, brokers said.There are also growing numbers of Chinese home buyers, as well as a small percentage of European home buyers, Mr. Piercy said.BUYING BASICSForeigners face no restrictions when buying homes in Canada, though financing a property with Canadian lenders can be harder, typically requiring a 35 percent down payment, while Canadians can buy with as little as 5 percent down, Mr. Ethier said.Transaction fees for home buyers include legal fees _ \u2014 buyers generally hire a lawyer \u2014 which are typically around 800 to 1,500 Canadian dollars, and property transfer tax, which is 1 percent on the first 200,000 Canadian dollars and 2 percent on the balance, brokers said. If this house sold for the listing price, the property transfer tax would be about 32,000 Canadian dollars, or around $24,320, Mr. Piercy said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, French; dollar (1 Canadian dollar = $0.76)TAXES AND FEESThe 2014 property taxes on this house were 9,894 Canadian dollars, or about $7,519.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Ackman\u2019s Enigmatic Approach to Valeant Pharmaceuticals", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookOver the years, Mr. Ackman has made the case that his investments are guided by a strict moral code. He says he believes that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme targeting low-income people, and has resolved to bring it down because people hurt by the company \u201care not in a position to defend themselves.\u201d He has also said he won\u2019t invest in Coca-Cola because, \u201cI think it\u2019s bad for children and bad for people.\u201dWhat?How can Mr. Ackman find comfort in Valeant\u2019s management \u2014 which has expanded its business by buying rival companies, slashing their research and development arms and then raising drug prices \u2014 while at the same time calling Herbalife\u2019s chief executive \u201ca predator\u201d running a \u201ccriminal enterprise\u201d?When I reached Mr. Ackman on Monday, he told me, \u201cThe premise of your entire article is false.\u201d He said it made no sense to compare Herbalife to Valeant. More on that in a moment.This column is not meant to judge Herbalife or Valeant as investments. Nor is it a judgment on the tactics of Mr. Ackman and other investors who made big bets against stocks \u2014 selling them short, in Wall Street parlance \u2014 and then publicizing those bets. (Herbalife has fought back against Mr. Ackman, not only denying his accusations but asking the government to investigate his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, for market manipulation.)Instead, it is worth taking note of the confounding, and at times contradictory views of Mr. Ackman, one of the market\u2019s most influential investors, whose fund was up more than 40 percent last year. Mr. Ackman\u2019s moves are closely followed by fellow activists and mutual funds, notwithstanding missteps like his investment in J. C. Penney and now Valeant. (This year, after a steep fall in Valeant\u2019s share price, his fund has dropped nearly 20 percent.)Forbes magazine compared him to Warren E. Buffett, putting him on its cover with the headline \u201cBaby Buffett.\u201d It is a comparison, of course, that Mr. Ackman welcomes and sometimes makes himself. \u201cThe structure of Pershing Square historically is one that is used by many hedge funds, but it\u2019s really much more similar to Berkshire Hathaway in terms of approach,\u201d Mr. Ackman has written.More recently, he likened Valeant\u2019s acquisitive business model to Berkshire\u2019s, a comparison that drew the ire of Mr. Buffett\u2019s partner, Charlie Munger. Mr. Munger told Bloomberg News that Valeant was engaged in \u201cprice-gouging\u201d and was \u201cdeeply immoral.\u201dMr. Ackman is no charlatan; he genuinely believes what he says. But he also seems to be able to compartmentalize his views and rationalize his investment philosophy in contradictory ways. His declaration that he will never own Coca-Cola because its products are unhealthy is tough to square with his ownership of a position in Burger King.Wall Street is fascinated by Mr. Ackman because he makes big, bold bets and is never shy about talking about them. He is seemingly interested only in home runs, which means he\u2019s also likely to strike out with some frequency.Andrew Left, the analyst at Citron Research, first raised flags about Valeant, and has also noted the difficulty in squaring Mr. Ackman\u2019s short position in Herbalife and his big investment in Allergan.\u201cIf Mr. Ackman feels so much moral indignation about a company selling health shakes to people and takes such umbrage at their sales channel that he launches a full-on jihad against them,\u201d said Mr. Left, \u201chow can he stand by a company that charges $300,000 a year to cure Wilson\u2019s disease?\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Ackman said he wasn\u2019t defending Valeant on moral grounds. \u201cIf it turns out Pearson has been found to have committed a crime, he\u2019ll be out,\u201d he said. But, Mr. Ackman added, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be convicted unless he\u2019s proven guilty.\u201dHe went on to say, \u201cValeant makes products that save and improve lives and no one has questioned the efficacy of its products.\u201d (He added that Herbalife\u2019s model, on the other hand, is based on a questionable business opportunity for the prospective sellers and the dubious efficacy of its products.)Mr. Ackman said he believed that Valeant\u2019s business model and management had been badly mischaracterized by the media. He believes that Valeant\u2019s strategy of cutting research and development budgets has been wildly overstated, suggesting the company only eliminates wasteful research and development. Still, he acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m not a supporter or defender of buying drugs and marking them up\u201d and noted that Valeant had pledged to stop the practice.As for not investing in Coke but owning Burger King, he compared Burger King to a supermarket. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be against owning a supermarket and they sell Coke,\u201d he said, drawing a distinction between soda, which he believes has no redeemable value, and a business that sells many products and allows consumers to make their own choice.In a call with clients on Monday, Mr. Ackman said he recognized that given his high profile and his disappointing Valeant investments, he was in the cross hairs: \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to accept a fair degree of snide comments in the press.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wine Gift Options Abound for Thanksgiving", "Date": "2015-11-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourA good Thanksgiving guest has one responsibility and one elective. The responsibility is to carry out with good will whatever tasks, if any, have been assigned. The elective (and let\u2019s face it, good manners would call this a responsibility, too) is to bring a little something for the hosts.That little something can be a box of chocolates, hand towels or the like; always appreciated. But if the hosts enjoy wine, what better gift than a well-chosen bottle?Before selecting a wine, it\u2019s worth reiterating the two ironclad rules of giving: First, the gift is for the hosts to enjoy at their leisure. You must never give a gift of wine with the expectation that you yourself will enjoy it. Hosts may choose to open the bottle with you, in which case you may be pleasantly surprised. But they are never obliged to do that, because it is a gift for them, not a treat for you.Which leads to the second rule: A good gift must be something that your hosts will value. Even better, something you also value. This precludes regifting, unless you know for a fact it is something your hosts will enjoy.More often with wine, you may have no idea of their tastes. In that case, the all-purpose, can\u2019t-go-wrong gift is a bottle of Champagne. Any bottle is a nice gesture, but a good bottle, not necessarily expensive, is even better.In the lower price range, about $30, Duval-Leroy Brut is a fine choice. A step up, around $50, offers more nonvintage choices. A name brand, like Bollinger Special Cuv\u00e9e, or an excellent small producer, like Pierre P\u00e9ters Cuv\u00e9e de R\u00e9serve, offers a wonderful selection. And if you really want to make an impression, a magnum is the way to go. Billecart-Salmon makes a terrific brut ros\u00e9, but it will set you back around $170 for the magnum.If even a lower-end Champagne exceeds your bank account, plenty of thoughtful gifts are available for around $15. At that price, it\u2019s hard to find a better value in white wines than a good Muscadet. Top producers like La P\u00e9pi\u00e8re, Jo Landron\u2019s Domaine de la Louvetrie, Luneau-Papin and Domaine L\u2019\u00c9cu all sell bottles in that range. Any number of good Italian reds are available for around $15, too. A casual search at that price finds a Rainoldi Rosso di Valtellina, a nebbiolo wine from Lombardy, and a lively Barbera d\u2019Asti Tre Vigne from Vietti.Want a story to go with your gift? Get a bottle of dry, earthy Lambrusco, the real thing, not the sweet junk wine that was so popular in decades past. You can tell your hosts how, in Emilia-Romagna, dry Lambrusco is the wine of choice with the fatty, filling cuisine. Come to think of it, Lambrusco would be great with the Thanksgiving feast, too. Look for good producers like Rota, Saetti, Lini 910 or other small growers recommended by your wine merchant.Beaujolais comes by its association because Beaujolais Nouveau, the quaint custom of making an easy wine from the just-completed harvest, is always released the third Thursday of November. Mass-market nouveaus tend to be more confectionary than interesting, though you can find some good ones from small producers. Personally, I\u2019d stick to cru Beaujolais, a more serious wine that can combine complexity with joyousness. Good producers like Michel T\u00eate, Jean-Paul Brun, Julien Sunier, Dutraive and many others sell for around $20 to $30.Sometimes nothing will replace a bottle of booze. I personally prefer the spicy liveliness of rye to the smooth sweetness of bourbon. Rye went from being the quintessential American whiskey in the 1940s and \u201950s to nowhere by the end of the 20th century. Now, in just a few years, it has become so popular that the stocks of aged whiskey have been largely drained. Younger ryes can nonetheless be delicious. Jim Beam Straight is the real deal, for around $30 a bottle. But if you want to go local, many small distillers around the country are making their own versions. Here in New York, Van Brunt Stillhouse in Brooklyn makes a fine rye, as does Tuthilltown in the Hudson Valley. Either runs about $35 for a half bottle.Not to be overbearing, but it\u2019s essential that you remember to give freely without the expectation of partaking. If you yearn for a taste, buy two.An earlier version of this article misspelled a region of Italy. It is Emilia-Romagna, not Emilia-Romania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanksgiving for All", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is no more inclusive holiday on the American calendar than Thanksgiving \u2014 and perhaps no more ambitious for the home cook. From turkey to the trimmings, Sam Sifton, Melissa Clark, Julia Moskin, Eric Asimov and the editors of The New York Times Food department tell you everything you need to know to plan the menu, prepare the food and serve it all with style and grace.The pitfall to avoid is repeating ingredients: If you are serving pecan pie for dessert, don\u2019t put out spiced pecans as an hors d\u2019oeuvre. Both may be delicious, but the pie just won\u2019t be as appealing by the time dessert rolls around. Variety is especially important at Thanksgiving, when you are likely to be serving guests with different tastes, allergies and aversions.If you\u2019re unsure how to start, think about colors. The basic palette for Thanksgiving is heavy on dishes that are white (mashed potatoes, creamed onions) and brown (turkey, stuffing, gravy). It needs the ruby red of cranberry sauce, the warm orange of pumpkin pie and sweet potatoes, to make it interesting. Add something green and snappy.Roasting two whole turkeys at the same time demands a giant oven. Carving said fowl is a daunting task requiring at least several helpers if you want to get the meat onto the table while it\u2019s still hot.Instead, try roasting one bird to use as your centerpiece for the big Norman Rockwell moment (get your phone cameras ready), while simultaneously roasting a tray of turkey parts on a separate rack underneath. The parts cook quickly, are incredibly easy to carve, and you can tailor them to your group, eliminating any fights over dark meat or white.Think of it as the Thanksgiving analogue to the wedding-cake trick: At large affairs, there\u2019s always one tiered cake done up for show, and several other plain sheet pans full of cake that are easy for the caterers to slice and quickly serve. MELISSA CLARKYou don\u2019t have to cook in bulk, so try out recipes that are a little more creative than classic. Have a guest bring the mashed potatoes, so you can make a sweet potato gratin instead. Buy some puff pastry and play around with it to make cheese straws, pumpkin turnovers or an apple tarte Tatin. Roast a turkey breast and use the extra oven space to bake a dressing that\u2019s new to you. (If you already have a signature dressing, make both \u2014 having two is a Thanksgiving dream.)Take the opportunity to fuss over the table and the guests a little more than usual. Get out the linen napkins, polish the candlesticks, dust off the ramekins and serve individual stuffing cups or vanilla custards to each guest. JULIA MOSKINFood need not be piping hot, particularly when the table is large, but it should never be cold. Here are some tricks for keeping everything warm.Heat plates and platters before putting food on them. Stack them in a low-temperature oven for a few minutes, or on a shelf above the stove if you have one. Some dishwashers have a plate-warming function. In a pinch, run hot water from the sink over them to heat, then towel them dry.Keep a quantity of hot turkey stock going on the stove. Use a ladleful of it to refresh and reheat sliced turkey on a warmed platter before sending it out to the table. You can do the same with dressing.Put that slow cooker to work! There is no better ersatz chafing dish for mashed vegetables or dressing. Set it on \u201cwarm\u201d and forget it. SAM SIFTONIt is possible for one cook to satisfy both camps, but it requires some ingenuity. Adding new ingredients to the old favorites is not the way; instead, add one or more new dishes to perennials on the table, and make sure they have modern, fresh flavors.Some things should not be messed with. Glazing a turkey with pomegranate or rubbing it with chipotle won\u2019t change anyone\u2019s mind; people either like turkey or they don\u2019t. Adding celery root, Cheddar and the like to the classic mashed potatoes is risky. These days, plain, buttery, homemade mashed potatoes are a treat that everyone seems to look forward to at the holiday.Beyond that, make sure there\u2019s a creamed vegetable on the table \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be onions \u2014 and a jellied cranberry sauce (canned is fine), so the reactionaries will be happy.For the neophiles, your first move is adding a sprightly green vegetable, whether raw, roasted or blanched. A little salad of fresh herbs is very refreshing, but broccoli, string beans or spinach can also nestle in nicely on the table.Next, prowl for recipes that include ingredients from different culinary traditions \u2014 Asian condiments, Moroccan spices, Middle Eastern syrups. These can add a welcome note of surprise to an all-too-familiar menu. JULIA MOSKINFor 90 percent of the pies I bake, I use an all-butter crust because I love that sweet dairy flavor. But lard also makes a dough that\u2019s a little easier to handle. I can\u2019t do without the flavor of butter, so I generally mix the two.Look for a lard brand that pleases you; lard varies in flavor depending upon how it\u2019s rendered. Sometimes it\u2019s flavorless, and sometimes it has a slight porky funk, which for me is part of the appeal. Its mild savoriness goes well with those sweet pecan and pumpkin pies we bake this time of year, and the airy texture makes apple pies seem lighter.Seek out rendered leaf lard from a good butcher or specialty market, or try your local farmers\u2019 market. It\u2019s the purest and best quality pig fat to use in a crust. Avoid processed lard at all costs; it has been hydrogenated to increase shelf life and can sometimes have an off or mildly rancid flavor, as well as consequences for your arterial health.Substitute lard for other fats in your favorite pie crust, or use ours, which combines butter and lard. MELISSA CLARKWhat you want to do is bring unity to the table and offer as many dishes as possible that everyone can eat and (this is crucial) enjoy.Whatever you do, try to avoid any truly arcane ingredients, or foods you\u2019re uncomfortable cooking with (perhaps tempeh, textured vegetable protein or xanthan gum). Pretty much everyone can eat roasted autumn vegetables with garlic and herbs, and will be pleased to do so. And chances are that that vegan gravy recipe with nutritional yeast, mushroom powder and Marmite isn\u2019t half as good as a simple version you can easily make yourself. MELISSA CLARKThanksgiving dinner can feel like a high-stakes race among the cook, the guests and the turkey. In this sprint, the casserole is your greatest friend. It does not have to include cream soup or canned vegetables. It does not have to be layered or topped with a crust. It can be messy in the pan and still look and taste great on the plate. Just think of a casserole as a roasting pan where almost anything can be assembled and even cooked well in advance, then left in the refrigerator until you remember its existence about an hour before dinner.Starchy vegetable pur\u00e9es (celery root, carrot, potatoes, squash) work especially well, but almost any baked or braised side dish can fit this model: mashed potatoes with plenty of butter and sour cream; red cabbage with apples, which can be braised in the oven instead of on the stove, then refrigerated; diced squash with fresh rosemary and garlic, which keep their pungency.Just leave plenty of time to reheat the casseroles at 400 degrees before the meal. Many casseroles (except very dense ones like mashed potatoes) can go into the oven when the turkey comes out. Remove them from the fridge first thing Thanksgiving morning so they are not completely chilled. JULIA MOSKINThe highest-impact change you can make may be mastering a new recipe for turkey. But because smoking, spatchcocking and deep-frying all require at least one test run, here are some alternatives: a more sophisticated vegetable side, a fancier pie crust or a snappy modern touch like an herb salad.It\u2019s fun to mess around with mashed potatoes, if your family will allow it. Pipe them into puffs that can be baked at the last minute. Top them with whipped cream and broil to make pommes chantilly, or make patties and pan-fry for garlic-potato cakes, crisp rounds that taste like supersize Tater Tots. JULIA MOSKINSome items on it are obvious: turkey, cranberries, sweet potatoes. But there are several other ingredients that will prove invaluable to have on hand. (Buy them early if you can. Running out to the supermarket the night before Thanksgiving is the last thing any cook, whether a planner or a procrastinator, will want to do.)Make a fast cranberry sauce on the stove while the turkey cooks, then get it into the fridge to set. Make gravy from the pan drippings, and serve it with the bird, the vegetables and the cranberry sauce. Buy a pie, or outsource it to a guest. SAM SIFTONTurkey is great, but chicken will do. You\u2019ll need a lot of stock, all day long: for gravy, for warming the sliced turkey, for refreshing dressings, for deglazing pans. If you\u2019re jammed for time, simply make a fast broth: Put the neck of the turkey, an onion and a carrot or two into a pot and bring to a simmer. You can start to use it as stock after about an hour, and it\u2019ll only improve over the course of the day. SAM SIFTONGranted, most cooks agree that for best results, the turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing must be started from scratch on the day itself. Even for these outliers, though, some tasks can be done beforehand to ease the last-minute work.Free the turkey from its packaging and plastic a day or two in advance, and use a simple dry brine so it can go straight into the roasting pan on Thanksgiving morning. Mashed potatoes, like any cooked potatoes, don\u2019t usually refrigerate well, but they will if you mix them with chives, butter and sour cream, and bake them like a casserole. You will hear no complaints. (The texture will be smooth and dense, not fluffy.)Most stuffings and dressings can be assembled in advance. If your stuffing is moist enough, it can even be cooked ahead of time and reheated like any other casserole without compromising flavor. Cover tightly when reheating, and add tablespoons of stock as needed to keep the dish soft and fragrant.Drier stuffings and dressings should not be cooked in advance; they will dry out even more during reheating. JULIA MOSKINChocolate cakes and tortes hold up well, as do cheesecakes, flans, puddings, ice cream, parfaits, mousses and sticky gingerbread cakes. A general rule of thumb is that if your dessert needs thorough chilling before you serve it, it can probably sit for a day or two in the freezer or refrigerator.As for other cakes, denser, heavier specimens hold up better than lighter, fluffier ones, which are prone to drying out. Frosting, fondant or any kind of syrupy glaze acts as a preservative, keeping the cake fresher longer.The one traditional Thanksgiving dessert that will suffer if made more than 24 hours ahead is pie. But you can make the dough up to a month ahead and store it in the freezer. MELISSA CLARKAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Lives and Rocky Markets Have Some Pension Systems Recalibrating", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, state and local pension systems thought of themselves as America\u2019s ultimate long-term investors.Companies could go bankrupt by the thousand; corporate boards could show C.E.O.s the door. But the states and cities would be there forever. That meant their pension funds \u2014 and the local taxpayers who guarantee them \u2014 could invest aggressively, even if that meant taking more risk. In an infinite time frame, today\u2019s loss would always be offset by tomorrow\u2019s gain.Or so the thinking went. Now, a long-living baby boom generation, rapidly fluctuating global markets and municipal bankruptcies are blowing holes in the notion that for public pension funds, time is infinite. It turns out that the short term matters too.And it matters now more than ever. According to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, virtually all public pension funds are in what is called a \u201ccash-flow negative\u201d state. That means that every year, they pay more in benefits to retirees than they receive in contributions. And that signals, for some at least, an urgent need to reconsider traditional investment strategies.The trustees of California\u2019s giant pension system, known as Calstrs, are among them.\u201cIt\u2019s really very simple,\u201d said Allan Emkin, co-founder of Pension Consulting Alliance, in a recent presentation to the board of the organization, officially the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System.\u201cThe actuary is saying that you\u2019re going to get 7.5 percent every year,\u201d he said, referring to the grail-like investment assumption that virtually all public pension boards factor into their decisions, which affect millions of people and trillions of dollars.\u201cAnd that may well be your average,\u201d he said. \u201cBut getting to that average, if you take a really big hit in the early periods, you may not be able to recover.\u201dMr. Emkin was helping Calstrs\u2019s trustees with an asset-allocation review, a monthslong process in which the board was examining its investment approach in detail and considering changes. The board is scheduled to vote on a proposed new approach, called Risk Mitigating Strategies, this month. The general idea is to cut back on stocks and increase investments that are expected to rise when the stock market falls.It was necessary, Mr. Emkin said, because reducing the $194 billion pension fund\u2019s exposure to another stock-market rout is \u201cthe single most important decision you\u2019ll make on the investment side.\u201dIndeed, cutting back on stocks means backing away from the approach that virtually all public pension funds have taken for decades. Some of the trustees seemed concerned that none of their peers were going this way, but Mr. Emkin told them that company pension funds had been moving away from stocks for years.Public pension funds have \u201cmatured,\u201d and that means doing things differently, he urged. Plans that were young in the 1950s or 1960s now have lots of retirees, who are living longer, healthier lives than their actuaries assumed they would. Assuming shorter life spans meant setting aside less money, and this is one reason so many state and local pension funds have shortfalls today.This is not a death knell, but it means investment losses have outsize impact.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got negative cash flow, the math gets wicked bad,\u201d said Sean McShea, president of Ryan Labs Asset Management, an investment management firm that specializes in bonds. \u201cPoor performance gets amplified.\u201dSince annual contributions do not cover the payouts, pension funds with negative cash flow generally rely on investment income to close each year\u2019s gap. They need every year to be a good year, but they tend to invest heavily in equities, and the stock market can, of course, fall. A couple of back-to-back bad years \u2014 like 2001 and 2002, or 2008 and 2009 \u2014 can wreak havoc.\u201cIf the pension fund has a bad sequence of returns, all of a sudden it\u2019s, \u2018How are you going to pay this?\u2019\u201d Mr. McShea said. \u201cYou can\u2019t grow your way out. It\u2019s almost mathematically impossible to close the gap.\u201dThe crash of 2008 showed what can happen. Public pension funds in growing, relatively prosperous places could fall back on their local taxpayers to fill the giant holes that opened. But not all \u201cmature\u201d pension funds are sponsored by wealthy states or cities. In many places, the obligations that workers and retirees have earned now dwarf the jurisdictions that sponsor them.Many of the roughly 1,700 California school districts paying in to Calstrs are like that. And there is an added complication: The annual pension contributions are set by state lawmakers in Sacramento, not by Calstrs.From Wall Street to Washington and in the towers of academia, people are buzzing about what some say is the pernicious focus in corporate America on short-term profits.For years, lawmakers set Calstrs\u2019s rates far too low to cover what its promised benefits cost. Time passed, the system matured, cash flow went negative and then came the crash of 2008.Calstrs lost $54 billion and could not bounce back. By 2014, it was paying out $12 billion to roughly 270,000 retired teachers and surviving spouses, and taking in only $6 billion a year in contributions. By conservative measures, it had an $80 billion shortfall. Even if it achieved its long-term investment-return assumption of 7.5 percent, its actuary said, it would probably run out of money around 2047. And if it missed its target, it would run out of money even sooner.In 2014, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law to substantially increase the money going to Calstrs every year, starting at $450 million a year and rising to $4.5 billion. The biggest increase, about $3.2 billion, is to come from California\u2019s school districts, community colleges and other local governments. Additional amounts are to come from the state, and from Calstrs\u2019s 480,000 teachers and other school employees.If everyone does their share, Calstrs projects it will close the gap in about 30 years as long as the invested money returns an average 7.5 percent per year over the long term. It is not going to be easy. Fitch Ratings has warned that less affluent school districts may have a hard time keeping up as the amounts rise. Until 2014, they were expected to contribute 8.25 percent of each payroll to Calstrs; by 2021 it will be 19.1 percent.And for the state, a temporary tax increase that helps cover the increase will expire in 2019.It was hard to get the promised billions, and the last thing Calstrs wants is to put the money into stocks, then see it vanish in another stock crash.Calstrs still aspires to 7.5 percent average annual returns \u2014 otherwise everybody would have to kick in even more \u2014 but it now wants to \u201creduce downside risk\u201d at the same time. The idea behind Risk Mitigating Strategies is to attempt that by selling off as much as $20 billion of its equities and placing the money instead in Treasury securities, two types of hedge funds and possibly infrastructure projects.Specifics were deferred until later. Much of the board meeting was devoted to comparing the results of modeling various hypothetical portfolios. Calstrs\u2019s current portfolio was shown to have about a 30 percent chance of another big fall by 2019 \u2014 the year, ominously, when the state tax increase is scheduled to expire.Other modeled portfolios seemed to have a lower probability of a crash in the near term.\u201cI\u2019m putting on my skeptic\u2019s hat,\u201d said one trustee, Paul Rosenstiel. \u201cThis sounds too good to be true, that we have figured out a way to eliminate downside risk, without sacrificing return, but no one else has.\u201dBut Mr. Emkin quickly countered: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about eliminating risk. We\u2019re talking about reducing it at the margin,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do here is to minimize potential for there to be increased costs to the employer, or the employee, going forward. That\u2019s the goal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valeant Shows the Perils of Fantasy Numbers", "Date": "2015-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameInvestors often say they learn more from investment losers than from winners. That suggests that Valeant, the beleaguered pharmaceutical company whose market value has fallen by almost $60 billion since August, offers a bounty of teaching moments.Let\u2019s start with the perils of relying on earnings forecasts and stock valuations based on fantasy rather than reality. Such a reliance may have lulled some recent investors into believing they were paying a small premium to own Valeant shares when in actuality it was costing them the moon. (The stock is still a winner for those who bought shares before the autumn of 2013.)Valeant is among a growing number of companies that regularly present two types of financial results: those that adhere to generally accepted accounting principles, and those that help executives put the best spin on their operations.In accounting parlance, such adjusted figures \u2014 which exclude certain costs from calculations of a company\u2019s earnings \u2014 are known as pro forma or non-GAAP numbers. But let\u2019s call them what they really are: a false construct.Part of the problem with these adjustments lies in the freedom companies have to choose which costs they want to strip out. One company may exclude stock compensation costs from its earnings calculations while another in the same industry does not. That makes it difficult to compare the two companies\u2019 operations.\u201cThere is a lot more of this going on,\u201d Mr. Ciesielski said in an interview. \u201cThe companies are really pushing it.\u201dThis creativity is common practice in the pharmaceutical industry, so Valeant is certainly not atypical. But the difference between the company\u2019s real earnings and its adjusted numbers is far greater than it is for its large competitors, making Valeant a prime example of this problem.Valeant strips out a laundry list of expenses from its revenue, including those related to stock-based compensation, legal settlements and costs associated with restructuring and acquisitions.Most significant, perhaps, for Valeant are costs related to acquisitions. Generally accepted accounting principles require companies to recognize over time the diminishing value of intangible assets they acquire when buying another company \u2014 or amortization. Valeant excludes those costs.At Valeant, an acquisitive company, this is a big number. This year alone, Valeant has paid $15 billion for six deals in which terms were disclosed.Excluding acquisition-related costs from its pro forma figures, including amortization, makes the company look far more profitable than it is.The company says it publishes pro forma figures to provide investors with \u201ca meaningful, consistent comparison of the company\u2019s core operating results and trends for the periods presented.\u201d Valeant goes into detail on the expenses it is excluding, so diligent investors can do their own analyses.A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment further.Valeant took another blow on Thursday when the nation\u2019s three largest drug benefit managers said they would stop doing business with a pharmacy that sold Valeant products. The hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who is one of Valeant\u2019s biggest stockholders, defended the company in a marathon three-hour conference call on Friday, yet its stock continued to plummet.Looking at Valeant\u2019s real earnings compared with its make-believe ones exposes an enormous gulf. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the company earned $912.2 million in 2014. But Valeant\u2019s preferred calculation showed \u201ccash\u201d earnings of $2.85 billion last year. That gap is far wider than at other pharmaceutical companies presenting adjusted figures.It\u2019s easier to justify paying up for a stock when you\u2019re relying on ersatz results. Valeant\u2019s shares, at their peak of $262, were trading at 98 times 2014 earnings. Set against the fantasy figures, though, the stock carried a multiple of just 31 times. Not a bargain, perhaps, but also not insane.Given that the Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies reporting pro forma figures to publish GAAP numbers in tandem, you might assume investors would stay focused on the facts. But academic research appears to show that adjusted numbers drive stock prices.In an interview, Mr. Sloan said he was concerned about the proliferation of companies reporting non-GAAP figures and the challenges that posed to investors.\u201cI can see the advantages of letting a company with a good management team do its own voluntary disclosure to help investors understand over and above what\u2019s in the GAAP filings,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. \u201cBut what goes along with that is companies that use their own numbers to put them in a better light and to mislead investors.\u201dHelping perpetuate these kinds of earnings myths, Mr. Sloan said, are Wall Street analysts who use companies\u2019 invented figures in reports and stock price forecasts.\u201cYou\u2019d hope that Wall Street analysts would recognize you can\u2019t really value a company like Valeant whose business model is to pay cash to make acquisitions by ignoring the amount of cash it is using in those acquisitions,\u201d Mr. Sloan said.Recent Wall Street research on Valeant highlights this problem. In an Oct. 1 report from Morgan Stanley, Valeant\u2019s pro forma earnings are identified as \u201cE.P.S.,\u201d leading many readers to assume a GAAP number. A figure identified in a table as net income is actually Valeant\u2019s adjusted number, which is far larger than the GAAP version.Two recent UBS reports are also confusing. On Page 1 of both reports, the analyst cited Valeant\u2019s pro forma figure as \u201cE.P.S.\u201d Later in the report, the analyst identified the figures as \u201ccash E.P.S.\u201dAt Merrill Lynch, the Valeant analyst does a better job, presenting both GAAP and pro forma figures so investors can see the vast differences between the two.Analysts may feel compelled to use a company\u2019s adjusted numbers when they reflect standard industry practice. At the same time, however, going along with a numbers game may also be a way to stay on good terms with a company\u2019s executives. Analysts who exert independence can find that managers may refuse to answer their questions or otherwise turn off the crucial information spigot.Mr. Sloan thinks it may be time for a new rule. \u201cWhen they did Reg G, things calmed down for a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cNow things are getting out of control again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Measuring How Financial Advisers Handle Uncertainty", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyRemember how you felt during the financial crisis in 2008? People were scared. Even the professionals were uncertain about what might happen. I know, because I was scared, too.But I couldn\u2019t show it. Whatever was going on, my clients still needed me to provide thoughtful advice and to help stop them from doing something stupid.At that point in my career, I\u2019d survived the market dip in 1998 and handled Y2K. Even during the tech bubble, I didn\u2019t panic. But the situation in 2008-9 was different. I felt it, and my clients felt it.I still remember the exact moment when my uncertainty trumped my confidence. It happened at the end of a meeting with some longtime clients. They were really nervous and wanted to know, \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d The best answer I could give them wasn\u2019t very satisfactory. \u201cStay the course,\u201d I told them.This advice was based on a couple of things. One, they had a well-designed portfolio, and it made zero sense to sell into a down market. And two, the weighty evidence of history suggested it was the best advice I could give them.After discussing their situation for a little longer, they took confidence in my confidence. But to this day, I remember leaving that meeting and thinking, \u201cMan, I hope I\u2019m right.\u201dNot long after, a good friend called me. After years of hard work, he was close to wrapping up the sale of his business. The amount of money involved would mean a comfortable life for him and his family \u2014 if it was managed wisely.He wanted to know how I thought he should invest the money. But uncertainty weighed so heavily on me that for the first time in my career I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dWhat many of us experienced in 2008-9 introduces something new to think about when you\u2019re hiring a financial adviser or planner. Specifically, how well does he or she deal with uncertainty?Because here\u2019s the thing: We can reduce some of our financial risk. But there\u2019s still irreducible risk left over from events we cannot predict and life events we cannot control, and that creates uncertainty. How does an adviser or planner deal with this irreducible uncertainty? And if we consider an adviser\u2019s behavior and performance in this area an important criterion, how do we measure it?An important question to ask the adviser is: Walk me through any changes in your investment process over the last 10 years.People forget things, but the great thing about financial advice is that we leave a trail of our decisions. Professionals who have been in the business should be able to trace the advice they shared with clients. How did their advice change over time?The warning signs you\u2019re looking for are disclosures of major changes every two or three years. When I say major, I mean something like switching from tactical asset management (picking stocks or asset classes that they expect to outperform other parts of the market) to buying-and-holding one year, and then back again in the next. That can be a sign that financial advisers aren\u2019t exactly sure what they\u2019re doing.Subtle tweaks around the edges are to be expected, and they may even be a good sign that this person is willing to adapt as things change. But let\u2019s be clear: There\u2019s a big difference between thoughtful changes and random, hard-to-explain changes. By asking this question, you can gain a sense for how this person deals with uncertainty. Do they look for ways to tweak around the edges and adapt? Or do they toss everything aside and hope that the next new thing will work better?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Barry Diller\u2019s Business Model Bears Fruit", "Date": "2015-11-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookIf you guessed Disney or Microsoft, as most people do, you\u2019d be wrong.In 2008, Mr. Diller began a grand experiment of breaking up IAC, which is based in New York. There\u2019s Expedia, TripAdvisor (a spinoff of Expedia), Ticketmaster, LendingTree, Interval Leisure Group, HSN and now Match. At the time, IAC was considered by some to be suffering under what skeptics called the \u201cDiller Discount.\u201d A 2006 Barron\u2019s article, \u201cBarry Diller\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d argued that IAC\u2019s assets were vastly undervalued as a conglomerate, but even when he began to split the company up, the stocks of the spinoffs initially underperformed.But today, the numbers tell a different story.If you invested $1,000 in IAC in August 1995 when Mr. Diller began the business \u2014 at the cusp of the dot-com boom (and subsequent bust) \u2014 you\u2019d have about $16,000 today, assuming you reinvested dividends and held on to shares of the various companies spun off from IAC. By comparison, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that tracked the Nasdaq index, you\u2019d have about $4,800 today. In other words, you would have done more than three times better with Mr. Diller.\u201cI had no idea in my head,\u201d Mr. Diller said in an interview, when asked whether he set out to create this unusual business model from the outset. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve ever done is one foot in front of the other.\u201dBut he said he did recognize that IAC could act as a sort of \u201ccentral flywheel\u201d to create, buy and finance companies to later be spun out. It occurred to him, he said, when he was talking to the chief executive of Ticketmaster, which was then a wholly owned company of IAC in the mid-2000s.\u201cI first realized it\u201d when the unit\u2019s chief executive \u201ccame into my office and said that he wanted to spend money on technology and that he wanted approval,\u201d Mr. Diller said, because the investment would reduce operating profits by half. \u201cI said, \u2018So you mean I\u2019m like your daddy and you\u2019re coming to ask me permission to do this thing?\u2019\u201dIt was at that moment, Mr. Diller said, that he decided the business would be better off as a stand-alone entity in the public market. \u201cIf you were on your own,\u201d he told the chief executive, \u201cdo you really think you\u2019d go out in one year and take your operating income in half with nothing else to say about it?\u201d Mr. Diller added: \u201cThat night I thought, \u2018You know what? The shining light should not be shielded. The guy\u2019s actions should be subject to real-world conditions rather than the false condition of being inside this so-to-speak capital-allocated company.\u201dAnd so began what has turned IAC into a minifactory of spinoffs. \u201cI\u2019m really an anti-conglomerateur,\u201d Mr. Diller said.He is not the only media chief executive whose anti-conglomerateur tactics have paid off. Three other companies that have aggressively spun off assets \u2014 Dish Network, Time Warner and Liberty Media \u2014 performed even better in the stock market than IAC.And it is a business strategy, Wall Street analysts say, that might be deployed by that other Internet giant, Google, which recently reorganized its corporate structure. Earlier this year, Google changed its name to Alphabet and reorganized the company to give its many divisions more independence from its dominant search and advertising business. Alphabet\u2019s founders have said they intend to keep all of the divisions as part of the company, but it\u2019s only logical that Alphabet could one day spin off Google Life Sciences or its Nest Labs home products unit.Unlike the Google guys, Mr. Diller did not start IAC in a garage. In 1995, after a successful Hollywood career, Mr. Diller struck out on his own, acquiring a 20 percent controlling interest in Silver King Communications for $10 million. Silver King was a small media company, but it broadcast the Home Shopping Network, which became his vehicle to make acquisitions, eventually renaming the entire company as HSN. In 2004, it became IAC/InterActiveCorp, which, at least in architecture circles, is best known for its Frank Gehry-designed headquarters along the West Side Highway in Chelsea.Invariably, skeptics say that all of these restructurings and spinoffs are nothing more than financial prestidigitation. So I put the question to Mr. Diller: Isn\u2019t this not so much a business model as it is a bunch of paper shuffling? Shouldn\u2019t all these businesses have the same value, together or apart?\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of paper shuffling,\u201d Mr. Diller snapped back, somewhat outraged by the question. \u201cIt is the total distribution of shares in a multibusiness company into a successive number of independent companies, some of which may be controlled or not, but that\u2019s not the issue.\u201d These companies, he said, \u201care under the scrutiny of a set of shareholders only wanting to own that business. I think that\u2019s very healthy.\u201d\u201cNothing fundamental changed,\u201d Mr. Diller said, except that TripAdvisor was public and had to swim on its own. \u201cThe result of it was of course that TripAdvisor was a much better company.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Announce More Charges in Hacking of JPMorgan Chase", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBilling it as the largest hacking case ever uncovered, federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Tuesday described a global, multiyear scheme to steal information on 100 million customers of a dozen companies in the United States and use the data to advance stock manipulation activities, illicit online gambling and fraud.Before long, investigators had uncovered a trail of 75 shell companies and a hacking scheme in which the three defendants used 30 false passports from 17 different countries. The group\u2019s activity goes back as far as 2007, and it has reaped \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds,\u201d some of it hidden in Swiss accounts and other bank accounts, prosecutors said.The data breaches \u201cwere breathtaking in their scope and size,\u201d said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a news conference on Tuesday. The activity, described as a 21-century twist on tried-and-true criminal activity, unveiled the existence of \u201ca brave new world of hacking for profit,\u201d perhaps signaling the next frontier in securities fraud.The accused \u2014 two Israeli citizens and a United States citizen \u2014 face 23 counts of fraud and other illegal activities, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday that added hacking to manipulation and fraud charges that were filed against the three in July. The charges are the first directly linked to the JPMorgan hack.A separate indictment on Tuesday outlined seven charges against Anthony Murgio, a Florida man previously accused of running an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange. That exchange was owned by Mr. Shalon, whom prosecutors described Tuesday as the founder and leader of the sprawling criminal enterprise.Lawyers for the four men could not immediately be reached.Another man facing fraud charges, Yuri Lebedev, has not been charged with hacking. Mr. Bharara said on Tuesday \u201cthere are discussions between the parties.\u201dProsecutors charged that the group led by Mr. Shalon hacked seven financial institutions and two newspapers to get contact information with which they could advance their pump-and-dump stock manipulation scheme. They \u201ctook the classic stock fraud scheme and brought it into the cyber age,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.Prosecutors said the group was involved in a broad array of activities, including processing payments for illegal pharmaceutical suppliers, running illegal online casinos and owning an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange.Nearly all the activities \u201crelied for their success on computer hacking and other cybercrimes,\u201d prosecutors said on Tuesday.According to the indictment, the three used a rented computer server based in Egypt to try hacking into customer databases at the brokerage firms TD Ameritrade and Fidelity Investments as well as JPMorgan. The ring also gained access to a computer network at what was called \u201cVictim 8,\u201d or Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, containing up to 10 million customer email addresses, prosecutors said.Prosecutors in Atlanta said they had uncovered online chats in which Mr. Shalon and an unnamed hacker discussed their plans to use stolen customer contact information to build their own brokerage database for peddling stocks to investors.The New York indictment also charges the three men with hacking two software development companies to obtain information to advance their online gambling activities, and they targeted a market intelligence firm to support their card-processing activities.The men operated at least 12 unlawful Internet casinos and marketed them to customers in the United States through extensive email promotions. The casinos generated \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in unlawful income,\u201d prosecutors said, at least $1 million in profits a month.JPMorgan confirmed on Tuesday that it was identified as \u201cVictim 1\u201d in the superseding indictment.\u201cWe appreciate the strong partnership with law enforcement in bringing the criminals to justice,\u201d the bank said in a statement. \u201cAs we did here, we continue to cooperate with law enforcement in fighting cybercrime.\u201dIn a statement, Scottrade said, \u201cWe continue to work closely with the authorities by providing any and all information and resources we can to support their investigation and prosecution of the criminals.\u201d Scottrade, based in St. Louis, previously said 4.6 million client accounts were targeted.Dow Jones said in a statement on Tuesday, \u201cThe government\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with law enforcement.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Slowdown Raises Questions About Long-Term Growth", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The short-term economic signals out of China have not been reassuring.Policy makers bungled a stock market bailout over the summer. The central bank made a surprise devaluation of the currency. Growth slipped to its slowest pace since 2009.These developments rattled global markets and unnerved investors. But the bigger question is, what, if anything, has changed in the long-term outlook for China\u2019s growth?Some experts on emerging markets look at China\u2019s sputtering growth rate and see signs of deeper problems ahead. Others are undeterred, taking China\u2019s current economic deceleration in stride. To them, it is a natural and necessary part of the switch to a more sustainable development path.\u201cThe last couple of decades were all about ever-faster growth in everything in China, and the next couple of decades will be about slower growth rates in almost everything,\u201d said Andy Rothman, a San Francisco-based strategist at Matthews Asia, one of the biggest investment firms in the United States dedicated to Asia.\u201cWe need to get comfortable with that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Communist Party is comfortable with that, but over here, we\u2019re freaking out about it.\u201dBob Browne, the chief investment officer at Northern Trust in Chicago, describes the question of the Chinese consumer as \u201cone of the fundamental long-term decisions an investor has to make about China.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t be agnostic or neutral on it: Is that transition to a services-based economy, as the middle class expands, going to continue inexorably \u2014 with bumps along the way \u2014 or not?\u201dGiven the volatile short-term outlook, investors have been cashing out of Chinese-related stocks in recent months, part of a broader sell-off that has affected most emerging markets.Selling pressure appears to have stabilized in recent weeks, but as of late October, the one-year estimated flow out of emerging market stocks totaled nearly $70 billion, according to data from EPFR Global, a fund tracker, as cited by Citigroup. Of that global total, money flowing out of funds in China and Hong Kong was more than $30 billion.In the near term, investors are worried about China\u2019s growth. In recent monthly surveys of fund managers conducted by Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit, a potential recession in China was cited as the biggest outlying risk to the global economy. In the bank\u2019s October survey, 39 percent of respondents said China was the biggest such risk, though that was down from 54 percent in September.Mr. Browne is among those who see China\u2019s slowdown as a near-term risk, but his longer-term faith in its ability to make the transition to a consumption-led growth model is unchanged.\u201cClearly with China, it\u2019s more of a top-down-driven economy, but so were Korea and Japan for much of their postwar development,\u201d he said. \u201cThat transition from a manufacturing- and investment-dependent economy to a services and consumer-led economy is fairly consistent.\u201dChina has a long way to go. Its state-directed economic model has overemphasized investment for years, and this has made growth increasingly unbalanced. The result is that private consumption today accounts for only around 38 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product. That is a sharp contrast to the industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where consumption on average accounts for more than 60 percent of G.D.P.Addressing this imbalance poses pressing risks for China. Because of a reliance on state investment \u2014 often in wasteful projects or loss-making industries \u2014 the country accrued record levels of debt, which stands at nearly 300 percent of G.D.P.That debt burden looks increasingly precarious as economic growth slows, raising the risk of deflation, or falling prices, which can lead companies to curtail investing and individuals to spend less. Deflation also makes debt relatively more expensive to repay \u2014 even at a time when revenue and profit at many businesses are crumpling.\u201cGiven the economy is slowing down and deflation is a major risk, if the government cannot push through necessary reforms, China may well follow the Japanese path of having a balance-sheet recession,\u201d said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation in Hong Kong. He was referring to a type of recession in which spending on debt repayment takes priority over making new purchases or investments.Mr. Liu forecasts that private consumption will rise to about 44 percent of G.D.P. in the next five years \u2014 a slow but significant shift because consumption is expected to outpace the economy\u2019s general growth rate, replacing investment as the key engine.This forecast, like others that see China making the gradual shift to a consumption-led growth model, rests in part on changes underway in how ordinary citizens manage their finances.On average, Chinese households save roughly 30 percent of their disposable income, the most of any major country. By comparison, the net saving rate is nearly 6 percent in the United States, 7 percent in Europe and just over 2 percent in Japan.But there are signs that a younger, urbanized generation \u2014 one that has not experienced the privation of the past \u2014 is taking a less conservative approach to spending than their parents or grandparents did.That includes people like Yu Ying, 22, who dyes her hair blond and works as a hostess and greeter for corporate functions and other events, making as much as 6,000 renminbi, or about $940, a month.Asked about her saving and spending habits while on a recent shopping trip to Sanlitun, a popular Beijing neighborhood of cafes and shops, Ms. Yu said: \u201cI don\u2019t save. I can\u2019t save any.\u201dMs. Yu moved to Beijing from the northeastern province of Jilin three years ago, and says she spends about half of her income on cosmetics and clothes. She spends a further 1,800 renminbi a month on rent in an apartment that she shares with friends.\u201cI also spend money on going out with friends and having dinner with them,\u201d she added.But even if younger Chinese are more free-spending, analysts say getting most Chinese to open their wallets more will require financial and other regulatory overhauls that Beijing has so far shied from undertaking. Among the priorities are easing or abolishing the nationwide system of household registration, or hukou.The system as it stands generally prevents new migrants from the countryside from gaining access to urban school placements, health care and other social services, which can be provided only in one\u2019s official place of residence. Analysts say liberalizing this system would deliver a tremendous stimulus to labor mobility and also help reduce the need for migrants to save so much to meet health care and other costs.\u201cChina needs to let people live where they can make the most money, which obviously they don\u2019t do now,\u201d said Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.The risk of failing to execute on these and other reforms, he said, is falling into a phenomenon known as the middle-income trap, where growth and earnings reach a plateau before a country can become broadly wealthy and achieve developed-nation status.\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean by stagnation: China doesn\u2019t continue to climb the ladder of prosperity; it stalls,\u201d he said.\u201cOf course, the Chinese have the capacity to reinvigorate the economy,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they\u2019re not implementing those kinds of reforms, and you cannot be a heavily indebted, aging middle-income country and continue to do well.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders reject suggestions that the economy could stagnate, pledging to remain watchful against an even faster downturn by undertaking interest rate cuts, infrastructure spending and targeted loans to favored projects.\u201cWe will be fully capable to deal with the situation once signs indicate that the economy is sliding out of the reasonable range,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not making an empty promise when I say that the Chinese economy will not head for a \u2018hard landing.\u2019\u201dCao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Stock Math: Fewer Shares, Pricier Shares", "Date": "2015-11-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesMicrosoft has been on a roll. Late last month, it did something it hadn\u2019t pulled off since Bill Gates was chief: Its share price reached a new high.The achievement was so long in coming \u2014 the last peak was on Dec. 27, 1999 \u2014 that it seemed to elicit more snide comments than outright celebration: \u201cIf you\u2019ve stuck with it over the last 16 years, congratulations on finally getting back into the black!\u201d the Bespoke Investment Group wrote to its clients.First, the new highs aren\u2019t real, by which I mean the $53.60 peak of 1999 would amount to $76.56 today in inflation-adjusted numbers, and while the stock rose again last week, it is still trading below $55. In real dollars, Microsoft still has a long way to go. Second, in achieving its current share price, Microsoft has engaged in stock buybacks, a form of financial engineering that is both popular and controversial.Microsoft has used buybacks well, in his view, though its need to do so says some uncomfortable things about the company and our current situation. \u201cI applaud Microsoft for being realistic,\u201d he said. Microsoft still generates a lot of cash, but it no longer is a hyperkinetic engine of growth, he added.\u201cTech companies live in dog years,\u201d Mr. Damodaran said, \u201cand being 10 years old in tech is often like being 70 years old for a company like Procter & Gamble.\u201d Microsoft began showing its age in the late \u201990s and has gradually accumulated self-knowledge, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a 61-year-old who has become comfortable with himself and has decided to act appropriately.\u201dBasically, he said, Microsoft has used substantial sums of money to change its stock market profile by shrinking itself. In December 1999, its market capitalization was more than $600 billion. Today, its market cap is only about $430 billion.For years now, Microsoft has been systematically buying back its shares, reducing its total share count. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, tabulated the numbers. Over the 10 years through June, Microsoft spent $123.6 billion buying back shares. That is more than any other company (though Apple, with $90.2 billion in buybacks, has been catching up). Going back to 2004, Microsoft has bought $136 billion in shares through June, Mr. Silverblatt\u2019s figures show, reducing net share count by 26 percent.For any company \u2014 and many of them are doing it \u2014 reducing share count through buybacks has great advantages. If earnings stay the same but share count falls, then earnings per share rise, as if by magic. That will, not incidentally, help executives whose compensation is often tied to earnings-per-share targets, which are suddenly easier to reach.Before the Securities and Exchange Commission clarified buyback rules in 1982, dividends were far more common as a means of funneling money to shareholders, which buybacks do, too. But nowadays buybacks are more popular, partly because they are a more flexible instrument for chief financial officers, Mr. Damodaran said. \u201cInvestors often expect dividends to be permanent, like coupon payments for bonds \u2014 even though, legally, dividends can be canceled \u2014 and they\u2019re shocked when that happens,\u201d he said. Paring down buybacks is more easily accepted by the markets, he said.Microsoft\u2019s approach is both disturbing and admirable, he said. \u201cAs citizens, we are getting the worst of both worlds, but under current tax laws and with interest rates as low as they are, the buybacks are very smart,\u201d Mr. Damodaran said. Under current circumstances, many intelligent C.F.O.s will be strongly motivated to use them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Sours on Whole Foods Market", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosSales of organic and natural products are soaring \u2014 but you would never know it from the share price of Whole Foods Market, the premier purveyor of such merchandise.Shares are almost 50 percent lower than they were in February, the high point of the year.Investment analysts are almost uniformly negative on the company, worried that competition from mainstream retailers, which are increasing the amount of organic and natural items in their mix, will impede the growth of Whole Foods.Costco, for instance, claims to be the biggest seller of organic foods, and Walmart now sells Wild Oats, a brand of organic products, at the same price as similar conventional brands.\u201cConventional retailers can get it into their stores more cheaply, and they can be more predatory on pricing,\u201d said Mark Retzloff, a pioneer of the natural and organic foods retail business. \u201cIf one of those stores is just down the street from a Whole Foods, there\u2019s a big segment of their customer base that isn\u2019t going to shop at Whole Foods anymore.\u201dThe encroachment of traditional retailers onto turf historically dominated by Whole Foods has reminded consumers of the old nickname for the chain, Whole Paycheck, Mr. Retzloff and others say.\u201cTheir single biggest problem is their price image,\u201d said Meredith Adler, who follows the company for Barclays Capital. \u201cSure, Whole Foods is working to lower prices in produce \u2014 but if it\u2019s also selling fish that\u2019s $45 a pound, it will be hard to convince people that prices are good.\u201dJohn Mackey, co-founder and co-chief executive of Whole Foods and, in many way, its personification, agrees that there is more competition, but he objects to the conventional wisdom that the cure is to lower prices. \u201cThe Whole Foods Market brand may never shake that label,\u201d Mr. Mackey said in a wide-ranging interview during a recent trip to New York.Walter Robb, the other co-chief executive, argues that Wall Street\u2019s relentless pressure on the chain to reduce prices is \u201ca race to the bottom.\u201d\u201cSure, we could sell cheaper farmed salmon \u2014 but it\u2019s terrible for the environment,\u201d Mr. Robb said. \u201cOur products are not the same\u201d as what other grocers are selling.Besides, he said, Whole Foods has worked hard to address price when it feels it can, and the effort upset Wall Street because it put a slight dent last quarter in the dollar value of the average basket at checkout.The company\u2019s financial performance is one of the envies of the grocery industry. Its sales per square foot in the last quarter were $990, which is thought to be among the highest in the industry. (Trader Joe\u2019s sales per square foot are thought to be much higher, but the privately held company does not report such data.)Whole Foods also has strong enough cash flow to finance new store development without resorting to borrowing, and almost no debt. That, combined with its low stock price, has made it a target of takeover rumors.\u201cWall Street tends to understand the transactional much better than deep customer relationships,\u201d said Paddy Spence, a veteran of the natural foods business who is chief executive of Zevia, which sells a naturally sweetened, zero-calorie soda. \u201cNatural grocers, like high-end retailers, have a relationship with their customers that goes way beyond the transactional and is very hard to put a value on.\u201dThere can be drawbacks to those close customer relationships as well. An example of that is the damage done to sales after the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs called out Whole Foods for mispricing some merchandise based on weight. The department found an average discrepancy of $2.75 between prices Whole Foods was charging for things like fruit plates and packaged chicken and the prices it should have been charging based on weight.In its news release, the department did not mention infractions it had found at other grocers during its inspection of 120 stores in the city earlier this year. In three Gristedes stores it inspected, for instance, the average price discrepancy was $1.18, while at Key Food it was 20 cents and 12 cents at C-Town. Associated, Fine Fare and other grocery stores also had infractions.After New York City\u2019s findings went viral, sales at Whole Foods plummeted. In the two weeks after the announcement, comparable-store sales growth fell to just 0.4 percent, after running on average at 2.5 percent in the weeks before the findings were released. \u201cIt actually hurt us worse outside New York City,\u201d Mr. Mackey said.The company, which apologized for the problem while emphasizing it is a common one in the grocery business, has hired a third-party auditor to monitor weights and measures in its stores and strengthened its training programs for new employees. Still, the issue continued to hurt sales in the following quarter, Mr. Robb told analysts.Since then, Whole Foods has announced a number of changes aimed at appeasing Wall Street. It said it would cut its employee ranks by 3,000, though 1,500 of those employees are likely to get different jobs in the company, Mr. Mackey said.It also struck an alliance with Infor, an enterprises software business, to build a system that will help it get a better read on its supply chain, improve its data analysis and reduce costs.Whole Foods also bought a stake in Mendocino Farms, a tiny, popular chain of sandwich shops in Los Angeles. It will open Mendocino Farms outposts in some of its Whole Foods stores, starting with one in Irvine, Calif. Mr. Robb said that would enhance its prepared food business, which generated about $3 billion of sales in the last fiscal year.But what everyone is waiting for is the first of its new stores, called 365, which will be smaller and sell a more limited mix of cheaper goods.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see what Whole Foods does differently with 365. Are they really going to be different?\u201d said Joe Dobrow, who has worked at several natural foods companies and is the author of \u201cNatural Prophets,\u201d a history of the business. \u201cOr will it just be a downsized version of Whole Foods with a particular attention to price? I hope it\u2019s not too little too late.\u201dMr. Dobrow said the new stores could be a little more like Trader Joe\u2019s, which gets about four-fifths of its sales from higher-margin private-label products, and Sprouts, which spends less to open stores and has lower labor costs because it has no prepared foods.But Sprouts, which declined to comment, is not any more popular than Whole Foods with investors. Its stock is down about as much from its high this year as are the shares of Whole Foods.Mr. Mackey is bemused by the interest in 365. \u201cIt\u2019s not a revolutionary idea,\u201d he said, noting that he expects the 365 concept to be to Whole Foods what Nordstrom Rack is to Nordstrom.\u201cIn Whole Foods, you can find a wedge of brie for $2.99, and you can find a wedge of triple cr\u00e8me brie from France that\u2019s made with milk from grass-fed cows that sells for $40,\u201d Mr. Mackey said. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any $40 brie at 365.\u201dThe 365 stores will be less expensive to build, deploy more technology and be more self-service than Whole Foods stores.More than 90 percent of the product selection and pricing for 365 will be set centrally, from Whole Foods\u2019 offices in Austin, Tex., whereas such decisions are made for Whole Foods stores by regional teams and even at a store level. \u201cEverything will be a lot more streamlined,\u201d Mr. Robb said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very different from Whole Foods Market.\u201dThe first of the stores will open in Los Angeles next year. But Mr. Mackey and Mr. Robb believe 365 will do more than just add valuable new business to the company; it will help Whole Foods introduce its philosophy of food and values to neighborhoods that cannot sustain stores\u2019 selling $40 blocks of cheese.As Mr. Mackey says, \u201c365 can go places Whole Foods can\u2019t.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Charitable fund-raising campaigns or requests for race-for-the-cure pledges are a different type of plea, too.Instead, the increasing number of personal appeals like this represent a muddled middle, where people who do not have enough ask for help to make life better. The requests lie somewhere along the murky wants-versus-needs continuum, but it would be hard to agree on exactly where they sit.We are not used to this, the sheer nakedness of people putting a number to their problems and disclosing it to the world. But more financial transparency is almost always better than less, and the Internet provides an emboldening platform. Then, it is up to everyone to push the button to give money or not.Plenty of people are making the requests. GoFundMe plays host to about 3,300 new personal campaigns (as the company refers to them) each day. The most common category is medical expenses, followed by memorials and funerals, general emergencies and education costs.So who are these people who are giving and taking?Those gift requests were strictly wants. Other kinds of requests that are further down the necessity continuum began appearing on sites like Indiegogo a few years ago and complicated the proceedings. Yet it didn\u2019t make much sense for users to see requests for help with something like fertility treatments next to fledgling art projects in need of money.One advantage that all such sites offer is that you don\u2019t have to look anyone in the eye when making your request. You can ask everyone without having to ask anyone in particular. It\u2019s also less aggressive than making a one-on-one plea.Or perhaps it\u2019s just passive-aggressive. There is always the possibility that the person who is asking is making a list and checking it twice (and then 50 times more) to see who has pitched in and who has not. But Dana Nowakowski, who made the van appeal with her brother, Luke, said that she was not doing that at all.\u201cI dreaded doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing it in my head every morning for the last couple of weeks, in the shower, getting ready, just dreading writing this story.\u201dSo why do it? \u201cThere is an element of desperation,\u201d she said. Hers, she explained, is a family that does not ask for things. They work for what they get and they buy what they can afford and that\u2019s just how it has always been. They do not expect things or feel entitled to them.But her parents, she said, had done so much for so many people for so long, baking cookies and making casseroles and giving rides and handing out gift cards. Her father is a retired teacher. And few people knew just how desperate things had become in recent weeks, when her mother moved into the dementia care home and the costs became clear. \u201cThey were the first ones there for friends and family,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I guess I kind of thought, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s their turn. It\u2019s time for everyone to return the favor.\u2019\u201dIn an odd coincidence, Ms. Nowakowski works as a writer for an ad agency. So was this just another \u201ccampaign,\u201d as GoFundMe puts it, except one where she had to sell her family\u2019s plight? \u201cSelling implies exaggerating, calculating, sometimes even manipulating the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sad truth is I didn\u2019t have to sell anything. This crappy situation sells itself.\u201dEven introducing the idea of commerce here, however, ought to make us all deeply uncomfortable. Is this what we\u2019ve been reduced to, weighing pitches for charity from people we know and pitting them against strangers online, or the needy whom more traditional charities serve?What was I to make of my own cynicism as I found myself deep in the weeds on these sites this week, evaluating a newly fatherless child. Should I support her, given that I was pretty sure that a seven-figure settlement would be coming her way because of the circumstances of her father\u2019s accidental death?That, at least, is how family, friends and fans of the Nowakowskis seem to be seeing it. As of this writing, they\u2019ve raised $20,830, more than 80 percent of their goal.

{"Headline": "As Investors Shun Debt, Banks Are Left Holding the Bag", "Date": "2015-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent years, Wall Street firms have reaped big profits in the scrappy reaches of the credit markets, selling the debt of companies with weak credit ratings to investors who crave higher returns.But now, as investors have suddenly grown skittish, some big Wall Street banks have been stuck with piles of debt that they are struggling to sell. As a result they are starting to book multimillion-dollar losses as they write down the value of these positions.The investment banks that focus on this market appear to be sitting on potential losses that may exceed $600 million, according to an analysis by debt market specialists of several deals that are struggling. These deals have not closed yet, but the markings are based on the lower prices investors are demanding.None of the banks would comment on the calculations.If the market recovers, the value of the troubled debt may rise again, shrinking or reversing any losses. The hits are also a fraction of those that the banks suffered in the financial crisis of 2008.Still, they are a reminder of how Wall Street can be wrong-footed at crucial turns in the market. The problems in the debt markets could also weigh on merger activity. Banks that are unable to sell debt may now become more stringent in their lending for acquisitions.Among those markets is the one for leveraged loans, the type of debt that is causing many of the losses right now for the banks.Banks make these loans to companies that have junk credit ratings in the hope of quickly selling the debt to investors, including mutual funds, hedge funds and entities called collateralized loan obligations.Investors have been eager to buy up the debt obligations because their returns have been higher than those on less risky debt.Private equity firms have been huge users of leveraged loans. They finance their purchases of companies with the loans \u2014 and then put the debt on the balance sheet of the acquired company.After the crisis, bank regulators, concerned that the banks might stoke and then get hurt by excesses in the debt markets, have told the banks to avoid leveraged loan deals that would overburden companies with debt.But even within such constraints, the leveraged loan market has ballooned. Since the end of 2008, for instance, corporations have borrowed $4.6 trillion with leveraged loans, according to data from Thomson Reuters.But the market has lately begun to sag. So far this year, companies have borrowed some $700 billion in leveraged loans, compared with $940 billion for all of last year, according to Thomson Reuters.Fears about what a rise in rates might do to speculative markets are a reason investors have stepped back. At the same time, recent events have made them less keen on certain industry sectors within the market. The problems swirling around Valeant, a pharmaceutical company, have, for instance, dampened demand for loans issued by other drug companies.When demand dries up for leveraged loans and junk bonds, Wall Street traders know which banks are stuck with which debt. They also look at how far the prospective prices in the market have dropped for the debt the banks are holding.Banks build financial cushions into deals to protect themselves against losses. But on some deals, the prospective prices have fallen so far that they appear to have blown through those buffers, leaving the banks with paper losses that they in theory will reflect in their income statement and balance sheet. The losses could become permanent if the banks sold at the lower price.The estimate of $600 million in losses was attributed to several struggling deals by the market specialists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deals publicly.The debt taken on for Carlyle\u2019s purchase of Veritas is a big source of pain right now.Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have taken a lead role in underwriting Veritas\u2019s $5.5 billion debt package, which consists of both leveraged loans and junk bonds. Traders and bankers estimate that the losses on the Veritas deal, after taking the cushion into account, are about $250 million, or 4.5 percent of the deal total. Since lead banks underwrite around 20 percent of the deal, this analysis suggests that the three lead banks could each have around $50 million of paper losses on the Veritas debt.The losses may be smaller or larger depending on the terms of the deal.Other debt deals are also contributing to the potential losses.Some of the debt used by Apax Partners, a private equity firm, to take a controlling stake in Fullbeauty, an apparel company, was being offered to the market with as much as a 15 percent discount to its face value, according to a person briefed on the terms. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were among the underwriters on the deal.Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are providing financing for Sterling Partners\u2019 acquisition of eBay Enterprise from eBay, which is also experiencing difficulties, the people said. Belk, a department store chain in the South, agreed in August to be acquired by the private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $3 billion including debt. Its underwriters are also facing tough market dynamics, they said.An article on Friday about Wall Street banks that are facing multimillion-dollar losses on company debt they are unable to sell misstated the position of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase in regard to debt used by Apax Partners, a private equity firm, to take a controlling stake in Fullbeauty, an apparel company. While both banks were underwriters on the deal and once held some of the debt, neither held the debt at the time the article was published. The article also referred imprecisely to the discount on the Fullbeauty debt. The debt was being offered at as much as a 15 percent discount to its full value in mid-October, when the deal was completed, not at the time of publication. The article also misstated the circumstances of the acquisition of parts of eBay Enterprise by Permira Funds, an investment firm, and Sterling Partners, a private equity firm. While Sterling used debt to finance its purchase of parts of eBay Enterprise, Permira did not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shares of Square Soar by 45% After Public Offering", "Date": "2015-11-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat company now has to prove it is much, much more.Square began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, at one point surging more than 64 percent above its initial public offering price of $9. It ended the day up 45 percent, closing at $13.07.\u201cWe have a great beginning,\u201d said Jack Dorsey, Square\u2019s chief, striking an upbeat note in an interview on Thursday, which was his 39th birthday. \u201cI don\u2019t see negativity as necessarily something that detracts from our work.\u201dThe I.P.O. ordeal illustrates the difficulties \u2014 some might say guesswork \u2014 of accurately valuing companies, both when they are private and when they go public. And Square, which closed its first day trading with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, now faces the challenge of moving on from the fund-raising event, solidifying its business and building itself up.\u201cI want to get back to a steady state and back to business,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Square\u2019s strategy now was \u201cto continue to save people trips to the bank. We\u2019re not going out there to say we\u2019re getting rid of the banks or card networks. We\u2019ve just put a much cleaner face on that infrastructure.\u201dAbout 10 percent of the deal was allocated to retail investors and 90 percent to institutional, said one of the people. A large portion of the volume that helped drive the stock up on Thursday was derived from an abundance of investors who did not get shares in the I.P.O., the person said.\u00a0But while Square takes a cut of every transaction that it processes, it must split that among a number of financial intermediaries. Investors also worry about Square\u2019s ability to grow, versus competitors like Verifone and PayPal, along with other financial incumbents.Square is building other businesses beyond payments, though it is unclear how well those may flourish. The company offers subscription services that handle a company\u2019s payroll or scheduling for appointments. Caviar, a start-up Square acquired last year for roughly $100 million, delivers food for restaurants that do not otherwise offer that service. And Square Capital, the company\u2019s merchant cash advance program, has extended more than $300 million to small businesses.Many of those concerns weighed on Square\u2019s I.P.O., resulting in the offering price of $9. That lower-than-expected price helped set off certain provisions that some of Square\u2019s investors had put into place to protect themselves against a drop in the company\u2019s value, prompting an additional 10.3 million shares for later investors. The extra shares came at the expense of earlier investors, whose stakes were diluted.The I.P.O. price was lower than Square\u2019s Series D round, which was sold to Rizvi Traverse and JPMorgan Chase in September 2012 for $11.01 a share. The Series E of $150 million was conducted in the middle of 2014, and then an addition of $30 million in October 2015, for $15.46 a share to the same investors.Square and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a nonprofit organization, sold $243 million worth of shares through the I.P.O., about 25 percent less than the $324 million they were aiming to raise.\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s suddenly going to be a cliff where valuations are radically lower, but we\u2019re already seeing an adjustment in terms of private deals,\u201d said Sandy Miller, a general partner at Institutional Venture Partners.At Square, the company can still count on loyal merchants. When Mr. Dorsey was releasing the credit card reader in 2009, he passed a woman named Cheri Mims every morning while she sold flowers outdoors near his apartment. She became Square\u2019s first merchant.\u201cHis vibe felt genuine,\u201d Ms. Mims said in an interview.On Thursday in front of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s mother purchased a bouquet of flowers from Ms. Mims. To accept payment, Ms. Mims used a Square reader.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Media Earnings Results Are Awaited, a Bit Warily", "Date": "2015-11-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt looked as if the world was coming to an end across the media business three months ago.This week, as media giants including Disney, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner are scheduled to report quarterly earnings, the short-term outlook for the industry appears brighter.Fears of a rapid acceleration of cord-cutting, consumers canceling subscriptions to traditional pay television services, were overblown based on the recent results from cable and satellite providers, analysts said. And while ratings remain challenged, the advertising market appears to have been somewhat stronger in the third quarter. But while the sky has not fallen yet, questions about the long-term future of the industry remain pressing. Investors are looking for media executives to show how they are adapting for survival. That includes providing innovative offerings in the traditional cable and satellite bundles and exploiting new digital distribution outlets, like streaming and mobile.\u201cNobody standing still will be O.K.,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media analyst with Pivotal Research Group. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are standing still.\u201dAll eyes will be on Disney, the world\u2019s largest entertainment group, which is scheduled to report its fiscal full-year and fourth-quarter results after markets close Thursday.The company ignited concern across the industry when it reported results in August and issued reduced growth expectations for its large cable network division. The group contributes about half of Disney\u2019s operating income and is anchored by the sports network ESPN, long considered one of the industry\u2019s strongest performers.In part because of subscriber losses attributable to cord-cutting and more tailored programming bundles, the company said then that its Disney Media Networks group would achieve \u201cmidsingle digit\u201d operating income growth between 2013 and 2016, instead of the previously expected \u201chigh single-digit\u201d growthThe comments scared investors, who worried that the rest of the industry was in peril if even ESPN, with its valuable sports programming, was not immune to the threat of cord-cutting. On Aug. 5, eight major media stocks crashed, wiping out a combined $37 billion in market value. Since then, shares in the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner have all been down.\u201cESPN has the most subscription fees, so has the furthest to fall with cord-cutting,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, a media industry analyst with Nomura. \u201cAt the same time, for a lot of households, ESPN is one of the most important networks.\u201dThe second quarter of 2015 was the industry\u2019s worst for pay television subscription losses. That downturn is bad news for the media companies that sell programming to cable and satellite distributors.\u201cThe United States is a slowly melting ice cube,\u201d Mr. DiClemente said. \u201cIt is just a question of how quickly the ice cube melts.\u201dOne big question media executives are likely to face this week is whether people are signing up for the slimmer bundles of channels that cable and satellite companies are introducing. The television companies could come under pressure if they are not included in those bundles.\u201cThe bigger issue here is not just whether people cut the cord, but who has the bigger negotiation leverage: the distributors or the media companies,\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar, a media analyst with Barclays. He noted that Comcast recently reduced its forecast for the amount of money it would have to spend on programming for the second year in a row.\u201cWhatever is the upside for cable is the downside for media,\u201d Mr. Venkateshwar said. \u201cSome of the negotiating leverage seems to be moving to the distributors.\u201dThis week, media executives are likely to highlight their ventures in streaming as potential new revenue sources; those efforts include creating stand-alone streaming services and selling their programming to streaming services and mobile providers. Time Warner\u2019s HBO, and CBS Corporation\u2019s CBS and Showtime, for instance, have introduced stand-alone services outside the traditional cable subscriptions. Verizon\u2019s Go90 free ad-supported mobile streaming service offers popular shows from ESPN and Viacom\u2019s Comedy Central.James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said in an investor conference this fall that business rules were changing. He added that while the company had had a long relationship with Netflix, it was also working more with Hulu, the streaming service that Fox owns with Comcast and Disney.\u201cShould media companies trade near-term pain for long-term gain?\u201d Mr. DiClemente asked. \u201cSome companies are continuing to sell to Netflix, but some are taking a more militant position.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Filings Show Rocky Quarter for Many Hedge Funds", "Date": "2015-11-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the richest investors on Wall Street on Monday gave the world a glimpse of how they make their money. Or, in the case of the last quarter, how many of them lost money for their clients.Investors like William A. Ackman, Larry Robbins, Leon G. Cooperman, Daniel S. Loeb, David Einhorn, Jeffrey W. Ubben and many more lost billions of dollars in large measure because the shares of the companies they placed bullish bets on plummeted over the summer and fall.Shares of Valeant fell by more than 28 percent over the quarter that ended Sept. 30. They have plunged further into the red since then and are down 59 percent since the end of the third quarter.These investors were among the thousands of hedge funds and other investment firms that made public information about which stocks they bought when they filed regulatory disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Known as 13Fs, the reports are filed four times a year. They offer investors a chance to see which sectors these traders were betting on when the quarter ended, roughly 45 days ago.Valeant has been a feature in this quarter\u2019s filings. In early August, the company rewarded investors as its shares surged to an all-time high of $262. But since then Valeant has ranked as one of the worst performing pharmaceutical stocks, facing concerns about a federal investigation into the company\u2019s drug pricing policies and its reliance on a little-known mail-order pharmaceutical firm to distribute some of its products.While closely watched, the filings are an imperfect window into the holdings of money managers because they are inherently backward-looking. They include only stocks traded in the United States and do not include short positions, or bets managers might have made that a stock will fall in price. The filings also do not disclose what price a firm bought or sold a stock at, making it difficult to determine how much a hedge fund lost or made in trading a given stock.Mr. Cooperman\u2019s Omega Advisors, for instance, disclosed that it bought 485,000 shares of Valeant in the third quarter. But the firm did not appear to hold on to them for long. Steven G. Einhorn, Omega\u2019s vice chairman, speaking at the Reuters Investment Summit on Monday, said the hedge fund had since sold its shares in Valeant.But one thing the filings do show is that Wall Street\u2019s biggest and wealthiest money managers continue to look a bit like a thundering herd when it comes to the stocks they buy and sell.Take Kraft Heinz, the giant food conglomerate.Mr. Loeb also continued to build up his position in Baxter International, the medical equipment maker, and now has a 9.8 percent stake in the company. In August, he announced he was seeking two seats on the board of directors. Citadel, which was founded by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin and York Capital also bought shares in Baxter, which makes devices like intravenous pumps and dialysis systems. Jana Partners, the hedge fund founded by Barry Rosenstein, became one of the company\u2019s biggest shareholders, buying up a 2.3 percent stake.Starwood Hotels, which on Monday agreed to be acquired by Marriott International, was another favorite in the quarter. Paulson bought 3.6 million shares, making it the biggest shareholder in the Starwood. Viking built a new 3.1 percent stake, while Citadel now owns a 2.4 percent stake after scooping up shares in the quarter.SunEdison has been a favorite of David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who recently called it one of the few stocks that was a \u201csuccessful winner\u201d in a portfolio that has lost investors billions. Glenview Capital, the hedge fund founded by Mr. Robbins, sold 1.6 million of its shares but stills has a 3.1 percent stake.On Monday, Mr. Einhorn also disclosed that Greenlight had sold some of its position in SunEdison. But he is still the company\u2019s third-biggest shareholder, with a 5.9 percent stake.An article on Tuesday about money-losing bets placed by some investment firms in the last fiscal quarter described incorrectly the business of Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, the Boston-based financial firm co-founded by Jeremy Grantham. It is an asset management firm that runs hedge fund portfolios, mutual funds and other investment products; it is not a hedge fund.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BTG Pactual, Brazilian Bank, Seeks to Calm Investors After C.E.O.\u2019s Arrest", "Date": "2015-11-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 With its chief executive in jail, BTG Pactual tried to calm investors on Friday, saying that it would cooperate with any investigation.The Brazilian investment bank also sought to distance itself from the executive, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, who has been its driving force, not to mention its largest shareholder.The bank\u2019s interim chief executive, Persio Arida, on Friday sent a letter to clients, saying, \u201cWe continue running BTG Pactual and its businesses as we have always done.\u201dHe highlighted the bank\u2019s financial strength and emphasized that \u201cBTG Pactual, as everyone is aware, is not the target of any investigation or accusation.\u201dShares of BTG Pactual have tumbled more than 26 percent in trading in S\u00e3o Paulo since the news of the arrest. In a research note, Goldman said that a prolonged absence of Mr. Esteves \u201cwould most likely hamper the bank\u2019s ability to retain private banking and asset management clients, affect cost and availability of funding and hurt investment banking origination.\u201dLuis Miguel Santacreu, a financial sector analyst for the Brazilian credit ratings agency Austin Rating, said, \u201cThe risk isn\u2019t to BTG\u2019s balance sheet, just to its reputation, but reputation for a bank is everything.\u201dIn an interview on Friday with the Brazilian newspaper Valor Econ\u00f4mico, Mr. Arida acknowledged that Mr. Esteves \u201cwas always the most emblematic face of the bank.\u201d He noted that \u201call the partners always found it convenient for the bank to be associated with a face.\u201dBut he added: \u201cThe people who run the bank are the partners. The bank is much bigger than any emblematic figure.\u201dWhile BTG Pactual towers over others when it comes to deal-making \u2014 it is the top merger adviser in Brazil, with 36.5 percent of the market, according to Dealogic \u2014 it is just Brazil\u2019s seventh-largest bank as measured by assets. The country\u2019s banking system is highly concentrated in the big four: Banco do Brasil, Ita\u00fa, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal and Bradesco. BTG Pactual is only about a sixth the size of the fourth-largest bank, Bradesco.And analysts say that there are unlikely to be any ripple effects from the crisis at BTG Pactual.\u201cWe don\u2019t see any systemic risk from BTG,\u201d said Gilberto Tonello, banking sector analyst with the brokerage GBM Corretora in S\u00e3o Paulo, noting that the bank\u2019s credit portfolio is only about $13 billion.Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging markets sovereign at Aberdeen Asset Management, agreed, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any systemic implications.\u201dThis week, BTG Pactual tried to project that it was business as usual at the bank. The same day that its board named Mr. Arida as the interim head, the bank announced a share buyback and kept investor events previously scheduled for wealth management clients.An executive at BTG Pactual, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in an interview that 350 people attended the event on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro and 450 attended one in S\u00e3o Paulo.So far there are no signs of a loss of confidence. A head trader of a rival S\u00e3o Paulo asset manager said that BTG\u2019s proprietary trading operations, which are its biggest source of revenue, were operating normally.BTG Pactual has also sought to dispel market rumors that it would now have to be sold.The BTG Pactual executive when asked about a potential sale said, \u201cNo, we are not considering that. Not at all.\u201dThe bank\u2019s fundamentals remain strong. It posted a net profit of 1.51 billion reais ($381 million) in the third quarter, and has $58 billion in assets under management as of the end of the third quarter.Still, news of the arrest clearly rattled Brazil\u2019s financial industry. Mr. Esteves is accused of colluding with Delc\u00eddio do Amaral, a leading senator from President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, to offer a star witness millions to flee the country and keep him from signing a plea agreement with prosecutors.Beyond the question of whether the accusations against Mr. Esteves will be proved is whether the investigation will be limited to Mr. Esteves, as BTG has assets in oil and gas, including in companies affected by the corruption investigation. The bank also acquired Petrobras assets in Africa in a deal that raised some eyebrows.Yet, if the scandal stays limited to Mr. Esteves, the bank\u2019s stocks and bonds, which have fallen sharply since the arrest, would probably recover, Mr. Santacreu of Austin Rating said.\u201cIt\u2019s a very solid bank. And other banks here are providing it with lines of credit in case it needs the liquidity.\u201dVinod Sreeharsha reported from Rio de Janeiro, and Dan Horch reported from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. & A. Why Are More Companies Passing on Going Public?", "Date": "2015-11-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States stock market is thought to have played a heroic role in the country\u2019s history. Over the decades, thousands of public companies have raised many billions of dollars in the markets \u2014 money that has propelled economic growth, innovation and employment. Without the public markets, corporate America would not have had a vast, cheap and powerful pool of capital.But work by John Asker, a professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles; Joan Farre-Mensa, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School; and Alexander Ljungqvist, a professor of finance at the New York University Stern School of Business indicates that corporate executives may have started to believe that being public is a hindrance, and opt to keep their companies private.In an interview on the N.Y.U. campus, Mr. Ljungqvist answered some questions about their innovative, and perhaps unsettling, work. The interview has been edited and condensed.Q. What prompted you and your colleagues to start this research?The name of the game becomes not falling short of shareholders\u2019 expectations, because when firms do, their share prices slump. One widely tracked summary measure of shareholders\u2019 expectations is consensus earnings, which is based on Wall Street analysts\u2019 quarterly earnings forecasts. A popular version of the short-termism story, then, is that managers fixate on meeting quarterly earnings targets rather than investing for the long term.Another problem firms encounter once they have gone public concerns communications. Managers feel that it\u2019s difficult to communicate with their shareholders, especially when there is a need to change the business model or do something drastic, such as cut a dividend to fund a promising investment opportunity. All the market observes is the dividend\u2019s been cut. That\u2019s going to be interpreted as bad news, and managers find it hard to convince the market that it\u2019s not bad news.But doesn\u2019t the large information flow from public companies \u2014 the financial disclosures and the analyst reports \u2014 lead to better investment decisions over all?Stock market regulation in the U.S. is built on the principle that sunlight is the best disinfectant. But it doesn\u2019t follow that there are no problems with being a stock-market-listed firm. On the one hand, you get relatively cheap capital in exchange for having a very high level of disclosure compared to most other countries around the world. But on the other hand, it comes with certain obligations that are onerous to companies, one of which is to live up constantly to shareholders\u2019 expectations.What about the current debate over buybacks? If you ask corporate executives, \u201cWhy are you spending money on repurchasing shares when you could be using it for investing?\u201d They might respond, \u201cWe\u2019d love to invest but don\u2019t see the opportunity, and we don\u2019t want to invest just for the sake of investing.\u201dSo if it\u2019s truly the case that public firms do not find anything worthwhile investing in, how come the private firms do? What\u2019s different about the private firms? Are they just better at spotting investment opportunities, or can they go after them in a way that\u2019s less subject to frictions?Has the extra investing by private companies increased their profitability?I\u2019d like to think that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening, but the data tie our hands. The nature of investing is that it is long term. You are taking a hit to profitability in the short term to fund the investment. And we just don\u2019t have enough data to follow these companies after they make the investments to see whether or not their profitability does increase.So, private equity firms, of course, take companies private. But you generally don\u2019t think of large amounts of investment going on at a company in the years after it is taken private? Or is that, in fact, happening?There is a lot of research that suggests that, actually, companies are more long-termist after they are taken private. But I know public perception is a different one.The decline in public companies sounds as though it could be a positive thing for the country in some ways, no?We have to be careful not to say that the public markets are for everybody and the private markets are for everybody. But what I think is very interesting is the trend \u2014 away from the stock market. There is something that\u2019s prompting companies to opt out of the public limelight, and I think reforms should try and tackle that.Are there a couple of things that you\u2019d especially like to see?So, some policy makers and politicians are thinking about how they can tackle short-termism. Fine. Good luck. But there are other reasons why companies aren\u2019t going public. That includes the ever-increasing regulatory burden.Anything else?There is a trend on the stock market toward a one-size model fits all. What we\u2019ve lost over the last couple of decades is that exchanges experiment with rules for different-size companies.But stock markets have experimented with that.There was a world when there was more experimentation. But that\u2019s not the world we live in now.What about the Jobs Act? Has that eased the way for companies wanting to go public?It\u2019s made it easier for companies to dip a toe in the water, to see if there\u2019s demand for their shares before they file publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"Headline": "A Tough Year for Hedge Funds? Not That Real Estate Has Noticed ", "Date": "2015-11-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Manhattan penthouse on the Upper East Side with sweeping views of both the Hudson River and the East River was sold this summer for $37.9 million. The person behind the purchase was hidden behind a limited liability company with the cryptic name CRE Acquisition.It turns out that the mystery buyer was not a wealthy foreigner, but a local Wall Street celebrity: Larry Robbins, the hedge fund manager and founder of Glenview Capital Management, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times and conversations with people knowledgeable about Mr. Robbins\u2019s personal investments.That the buyer is a hedge fund titan may not be so surprising. Hedge fund managers own some of the most expensive properties in Manhattan. In September, for example, Kenneth Griffin, founder of Citadel, reportedly spent about $200 million to buy several floors in a new luxury condo tower being built at 220 Central Park South.Still, Mr. Robbins\u2019s big real estate deal comes during a particularly trying time for his $8.8 billion hedge fund. Last week, he wrote an apology to investors for losing 15 percent of their money so far this year.In the seven-page mea culpa, Mr. Robbins told investors, \u201cI\u2019ve failed to protect your capital.\u201d He promised to forfeit his pay for this year.His letter combined with his latest purchase illustrate a fundamental truth about the biggest hedge fund managers: They may have had a rough year with volatile markets, but they remain incredibly wealthy.Mr. Robbins\u2019s hedge fund stumbled after several years of knockout returns. Mr. Robbins, 46, has profited handsomely from his firm\u2019s strong performance and has a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes.Glenview Capital charges a yearly administration fee of 2 percent of investor capital and 20 percent of the annual gains, helping Mr. Robbins to earn $570 million in 2014, according to a report by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine.His new apartment in the Charles condominium on First Avenue will be used as a second home, according to mortgage documents. Mr. Robbins\u2019s primary residence is a sprawling mansion located on more than four acres in Alpine, N.J. The Manhattan penthouse he purchased was created by combining two duplex penthouses. It now totals 11,740 square feet, including private terraces that cover 1,300 square feet. Monthly fees are $10,547.The property was bought through a limited liability company that was incorporated in Delaware. Mr. Robbins took out a $22 million mortgage to finance the purchase, according to documents filed with the New York City Department of Finance.A family member shielded by another limited liability company bought an adjoining penthouse in the Charles for $20.7 million.The second penthouse purchase was for investment purposes. It was acquired with a limited liability company called Charles NCP and was financed with a $12.9 million mortgage, according to the documents.Mark Horowitz, the president at Glenview, is the authorized signatory on both mortgages. He is the authorized signatory for Mr. Robbins\u2019s house in New Jersey and serves in a similar capacity for Glenview Capital on regulatory filings.Because most of Mr. Robbins\u2019s net worth is tied up in the hedge fund, Mr. Horowitz acts as a signatory for Mr. Robbins\u2019s personal, tax and estate affairs, according to someone with knowledge of Glenview who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Robbins did not respond to a request for comment.The price for Mr. Robbins\u2019s new apartment is the highest paid for any apartment on the Upper East Side, east of Third Avenue, according to real estate tracker CityRealty. The average apartment price for the neighborhood is $1.5 million, cheaper than apartments located between Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue in part because the area is farther away from transportation.\u201cIt\u2019s a very big number for that area,\u201d said Gabby Warshawer, the director of research at CityRealty.Yet the price for both penthouses at the Charles combined still pales in comparison with other recent luxury apartment acquisitions by billionaire hedge fund managers.Besides Mr. Griffin\u2019s record purchase in September, William A. Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, is part of a group of investors that earlier this year closed on a deal to pay $91.5 million for a splashy six-bedroom apartment at One57, another luxury residential tower in Manhattan.Mr. Robbins is not the only hedge fund manager who is struggling this year. Some of the industry\u2019s best known and most skilled investors have lost billions of dollars of investors\u2019 money. Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square, for example, is down 19 percent so far this year.The value of Mr. Ackman\u2019s position in the Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant has plunged about $2.2 billion in recent weeks as the drug maker has come under criticism from short sellers, raising broader questions about its distribution networks and pricing policies for some of its drugs.Mr. Robbins told investors in his Oct. 26 letter that Glenview Capital did not hold a position in Valeant because \u201cto the best of our current knowledge, they are guilty of what looks to be poor judgment in historical price increases on acquired products.\u201dIn that same letter, Mr. Robbins told investors that he thought his portfolio of stocks, which include drug companies, hospital and managed care, and pharmaceutical supply chains, was \u201ca bedrock of strength in a world of choppy seas.\u201d\u201cThat judgment,\u201d after several months of market turbulence, \u201cwas 100 percent incorrect,\u201d he wrote.In recent years, he has made handsome sums for his investors with campaigns like a proxy battle against Health Management Associates, and with bets on health care stocks like Humana, Thermo Fisher Scientific and HCA Holdings.Even with a disappointing performance, Mr. Robbins in his letter sought to solicit new investment for a new fund that would charge no fees.\u201cUnfortunately, opportunity often feels like a punch in the face,\u201d he wrote.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ackman Defends Fund\u2019s Valeant Losses and Digs at \u2018Snide Comments\u2019", "Date": "2015-11-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe billionaire investor William A. Ackman, whose firm is among the worst-performing hedge funds this year, used an investor conference call on Monday to take a swipe at the media and those on Wall Street who he said relished \u201cbetting against\u201d him.In a separate call for investors on Monday, Mr. Ackman complained that news accounts of the earlier call had focused unfairly on the time he spent defending the Valeant investment to investors, who include some of the nation\u2019s biggest pension funds. In reality, he said, most of the time was devoted to answering investors\u2019 questions. He added that in doing so, he was prepared to accept a \u201cfair degree of snide comments from the press.\u201dMr. Ackman\u2019s defense came as he discussed the performance of Pershing Square and its investments. Pershing Square is down 19 percent for the year, in large measure because of the big plunge in shares of Valeant, but also as a result of several of the firm\u2019s other stock bets on publicly listed companies.Mr. Ackman also said he was aware there were a fair number of \u201cpeople betting against Pershing Square\u201d by taking opposing positions in stocks his firm owns and positioning themselves for the possibility that Pershing Square will have to sell some of its holdings.Some of Mr. Ackman\u2019s critics on Wall Street have questioned whether he might be forced to sell off some of his firm\u2019s holdings if too many investors seek to redeem some of their money at year\u2019s end. In response to that speculation, Mr. Ackman countered that roughly 50 percent of his firm\u2019s capital is not subject to periodic investor redemptions.Still, his firm\u2019s investment in Valeant has become a lightning rod for criticism, putting pressure on the investor at a difficult time. He has lost about $2.2 billion on his investment in Valeant, assuming an average purchase price of $200 a share. Pershing began buying shares in the Canadian drug manufacturer on Feb. 9, when the stock was trading at around $160, and continued buying as the price quickly climbed to about $200. By the middle of March, his firm disclosed it had accumulated 19 million shares, a 5.7 percent equity stake, in Valeant.Much of the tone of Monday\u2019s call, which lasted just under two hours, was defensive. The average hedge fund is posting barely positive returns this year, as measured by Hedge Fund Research, and the S.&P. 500 is up just under 1 percent for the year. Some of the industry\u2019s biggest names, like David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management, have generated headlines for investors\u2019 losses of hundreds of millions of dollars over the last quarter.More so than other hedge fund managers, Mr. Ackman attracts attention for his success \u2014 last year he finished the year up nearly 40 percent \u2014 and for an investing style that focuses on taking outsize positions in companies in which he has either a strong conviction or has been agitating for corporate change. The strategy has its risks because it leaves Pershing Square with highly concentrated stock positions, making it more vulnerable than other hedge funds to sudden moves in a particular company\u2019s stock price. When the strategy pays off, however, it can do so handsomely.Mr. Ackman reaffirmed his bet on Valeant, saying that at the current stock price it was an \u201cextraordinary bargain.\u201d But the pharmaceutical company has come under intense scrutiny after a report published by a prominent short-seller that accused Valeant of fraud connected to its drug pricing. The company\u2019s share price has dropped by 44 percent since the report was published on Oct. 21.Valeant also faces a federal investigation into some of its drug-pricing strategies and questions about the nature of its relationship with a specialty pharmacy group called Philidor Rx Services.While Valeant initially defended its relationship with Philidor in a conference call, it moved quickly to cut those ties after accusations that Valeant was using the pharmacy to create phantom sales.As the stock got pummeled in the face of controversy over its relationship with Philidor two weeks ago, Pershing Square quickly acquired another two million shares. Valeant, by market value, is now the fifth-largest position in Pershing Square\u2019s portfolio, a position Mr. Ackman said on Monday he thought was appropriate.With the share price under pressure, Mr. Ackman decided to hold his own conference call and webcast on Oct. 30 to defend his firm\u2019s investment in Valeant. During the marathon event, Mr. Ackman criticized Valeant for being too \u201cscripted\u201d in its call to investors and said he was disappointed in the company\u2019s response to the furor.But Mr. Ackman said he still believed in Valeant\u2019s long-term prospects, even though the company might well end up paying a penalty to regulators for its reliance on Philidor to sell certain drug products.Mr. Ackman\u2019s unusual and lengthy defense of Valeant in that call did not do the stock much good. Shares of Valeant fell 16 percent that day.The stock\u2019s plunge prompted Mr. Ackman to send an email to Mr. Pearson in which he wrote that he and his firm \u201cshare the board\u2019s confidence in you and your leadership.\u201d Mr. Ackman\u2019s representatives made sure copies of the supportive email were released to the news media.Valeant has since announced that it will sever the relationship with Philidor and that it will hold its own conference call on Tuesday to discuss its future business practices without Philidor.During the call on Monday, Mr. Ackman periodically interrupted his own analysts, whom he had brought on the call to discuss his firm\u2019s particular stock holdings, to offer his own views. Introducing the question-and-answer period of the call, Mr. Ackman speculated that some people submitted questions to his conference calls simply \u201cto have their questions read so that they can make a point.\u201dIn addition to its troubles over Valeant, the firm has also had a disappointing result with Herbalife, the nutritional supplement manufacturer that Mr. Ackman has argued for the last three years is an unlawful pyramid scheme that will ultimately collapse. In 2012, his firm initially placed a $1 billion \u201cshort\u201d bet that shares of Herbalife would plunge to zero.But just as Valeant\u2019s stock performance has turned against Mr. Ackman this year, a 48 percent rise in the price of Herbalife stock since early January has also punished his firm. As of midday Monday, shares of Herbalife were trading around $55 \u2014 roughly $14 above the price of trading when Mr. Ackman first publicly unveiled his bearish bet in December 2012.An earlier version of a capsule summary on this article described Monday\u2019s conference call incorrectly. It was a regular investors\u2019 call; it was not a \u201cmarathon conference call,\u201d which describes a call Mr. Ackman held on Oct. 30. An earlier version also rendered incorrectly a quotation from Mr. Ackman. In his investor call, he said he was prepared to accept a \u201cfair degree of snide comments from the press\u201d \u2014 not \u201csnide coverage.\u201d The error was repeated in an earlier version of the headline.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Post in Strong Stock Market Debut in Tokyo", "Date": "2015-11-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 For decades, whenever Japan\u2019s leaders had an important project to pay for, they turned to the post office.Whether it was a new bullet train line, aid for struggling small businesses or money to finance the national debt, politicians could call on Japan Post to assign a portion of Japanese citizens\u2019 nest eggs to the task, through the nationwide network of savings banks it operates through its more than 20,000 post office branches.On Wednesday, Japan Post was enlisted in a new national project: turning conservative Japanese savers into risk-taking investors by offering them the chance to buy shares in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.Japan\u2019s leaders should be happy with the early results.A glut of buy orders for shares of Japan Post Holdings meant the stock went untraded for more than half an hour on its first day on the market. It ultimately made its debut at 1,631 yen \u2014 or $13.49 \u2014 per share, 16.5 percent higher than its I.P.O. price. Two subsidiaries that operate banking and insurance businesses, which were listed separately, also faced a surplus of buy orders. Japan Post Bank finally opened at \u00a51,680, up 16 percent from its I.P.O. price, and Japan Post Insurance opened 33 percent higher.Japan Post Holdings finished 25.7 percent above its I.P.O. price at \u00a51,760. Japan Post Bank ended 15.2 percent higher at \u00a51,671, and Japan Post Insurance closed up 55.9 percent at \u00a53,430. The Nikkei 225-stock average closed 1.3 percent higher.With the economy sluggish, the Japanese government wants to persuade smaller investors to squirrel away their savings in stocks, rather than in bank accounts. Such a shift, it hopes, will spur a wealth-generating rise in asset prices. To help accomplish the move, the leadership has looked to the privatization of Japan Post, the 144-year-old national postal service that is also the country\u2019s biggest bank and life insurer.\u201cA quarter of Japanese savings are sitting in the postal bank, and for the sake of the economy we need this to become risk-taking money,\u201d said Heizo Takenaka, a professor at Keio University who promoted privatization as economics minister a decade ago. \u201cAs a private company, Japan Post will be able to lend and invest freely, which will revitalize asset markets.\u201dThe I.P.O. was aimed squarely at small investors, people who might otherwise have added to Japan Post savings accounts. About three-quarters of the stock was allocated to individual buyers in Japan. Japan Post advertised the I.P.O. on television, an unusual move to drum up interest in a stock listing, and brokerage firms reported a surge in new accounts from first-time customers looking to buy in.Demand was strong, with the I.P.O. oversubscribed. The company priced at the top of its range, raising \u00a51.4 trillion, or $11.6 billion, in the I.P.O.Japan Post, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, was the largest offering since the $25 billion debut last year of Alibaba, the Chinese Internet giant. It is also the biggest privatization in Japan since 1987, when the government began selling off the state-owned telephone monopoly.Japan joins Germany, Britain and other countries that have privatized their postal systems. Those efforts, though, have often been accompanied by heated political battles.Plans for the privatization of Japan Post began a decade ago, but it was delayed by a fierce tug of war.Some politicians wanted to maintain state ownership and the control of the vast pool of postal savings. Others said the system was obsolete and wasteful. The final impetus for privatization was provided by Japan\u2019s earthquake and tsunami in 2011, when huge sums of money were needed for rebuilding. The government says it will allocate money raised by the I.P.O. to that effort.The I.P.O. frees Japan Post to take more risks with the huge pool of funds it controls. Japan Post\u2019s savings bank holds the equivalent of more than $1.4 trillion of deposits, making it one of the world\u2019s biggest financial institutions. The insurance arm oversees tens of billions of dollars in policies. Much of the money has been invested in relatively safe but low-yielding government bonds.\u201cI hope it will further accelerate the shift from savings to investment and help to create a virtuous cycle in the economy,\u201d Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, who serves as the primary spokesman for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said when the offer price of Japan Post\u2019s shares was completed late last month.Other government-controlled financial firms have been enlisted in the campaign.The Government Pension Investment Fund, the world\u2019s biggest public pension fund with more than \u00a5120 trillion of assets, said last year that it would double the portion of its portfolio dedicated to stocks, to a target of 50 percent.Many analysts said the shift was long overdue, and would align the fund\u2019s investment strategy more closely with other big global pension funds. But some critics have accused Mr. Abe of engaging in a politically motivated effort to inflate stock prices.Postal savings have long been used to pay for government initiatives, supplementing the regular government budget.\u201cIt allowed the government to raise funds without having to levy taxes,\u201d said Gene Park, a professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, who has written a book on the history of postal savings in Japan.That function helped the government by giving it money to spend while keeping taxes lower than they otherwise would have been. But it also fostered a culture of unaccountable and sometimes wasteful spending, Mr. Park said. Favored industries could be propped up in bad times, for instance using subsidized loans backed by postal savings, with little public disclosure or input.\u201cThe beauty of it from politicians perspective was that it was invisible,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cIt allowed problems to be kicked down the road.\u201dJapan Post no longer directly finances the so-called \u201csecond budget,\u201d formally known as the Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, and the program itself is smaller and less important than it once was. But Japan Post remains a buyer of bonds issued by program-related agencies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Conversation With Martin Cohen", "Date": "2015-11-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 30-Minute InterviewI\u2019m thoroughly engaged in all the strategic initiatives that the company engages in. I\u2019m an active member of the executive committee, and all the major decisions of the firm I\u2019m involved in. We were doing extremely well up until earlier in the year. We were up around 30 percent last year, and more than 5 percent at the end of the first quarter this year in our real estate funds. And then there was some turbulence based on uncertainty \u2014 Fed policy, the course of the economy, etc. \u2014 and REITs had about a 15 percent decline. We had a great recovery in September and October. I think we\u2019re up about 2 percent for the year now. So the diversification benefits of owning real estate companies are taking place with the low-interest-rate environment, which seems to be destined to persist. Plus, one thing that is missing from many strategists\u2019 thinking is that REITs are not bonds. So yields might be 3 or 4 percent, but dividends grow every year. And this year we\u2019ve had close to double-digit growth in dividends. We expect the same thing next year. We still like the regional mall sector. The economy has yet to really accelerate, but at some point, as employment grows and consumer wealth grows, then that certainly helps retail. A lot of retailers are having issues, but the mall owners are not. We also like urban markets, because that\u2019s where my children\u2019s generation wants to live, and it\u2019s also where jobs are \u2014 services, technology. And we like the office market as a result. We have to recognize that there\u2019s a lot of new building taking place in New York City, and that gives us a little bit of pause, because when you see a bulge in supply, that could cause rents to level off. That could happen over the next year or two. Advertisement"}
