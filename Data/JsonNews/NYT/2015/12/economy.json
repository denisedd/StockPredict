{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Leader in Bind of Own Making", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyPrime Minister David Cameron of Britain has boxed himself in with one of his demands for renegotiating Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union. If Mr. Cameron doesn\u2019t find a way of extricating himself from this position, Britain may quit the bloc.Mr. Cameron\u2019s bind is entirely of his own making. A year ago, he decided that he needed to slow the flow of European Union citizens to Britain. Net migration was 180,000 in the year ended in June.The prime minister initially wanted to put a cap on migrant numbers, but he nixed that idea after he realized that other European Union leaders would block it. Free movement of people is one of the European Union\u2019s core principles.Instead, Mr. Cameron decided to stop European Union migrants receiving \u201cin-work\u201d benefits until they had lived in Britain for four years. These payments are made to low-paid workers to top up their salaries. Mr. Cameron argued that the benefits were a big attraction to people from the rest of the European Union and made removing them the central demand of his renegotiation of Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc.This demand is not economically justified. Not only are European Union migrants good for the British economy, there isn\u2019t much evidence that cutting in-work benefits would deter many people from going to Britain to work.But Mr. Cameron felt that the migration issue had become so hot domestically that he had to have some policy to address it. The snag is that the policy he chose is discriminatory \u2014 and nondiscrimination among citizens of different countries is an important European Union principle, even if not quite as sacrosanct as the free movement of people.In order to make the policy legal, the European Union\u2019s treaty would have to be changed \u2014 an elaborate process that requires the consent of all 28 countries.Hence, the suggestion in some British newspapers in early December that Mr. Cameron would campaign to take Britain out of the European Union if other leaders didn\u2019t immediately agree to a new treaty legalizing his demand. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union will probably be held next year but must take place by the end of 2017.Other leaders don\u2019t want Britain to quit the European Union, for a host of economic and strategic reasons. The timing could be hardly worse given that the European Union is buffeted by multiple crises, including the influx of refugees, jihadi terrorism, the growth of right-wing populism and the lingering economic problems in the eurozone.Despite this, other European Union countries cannot bend over backward to accommodate Mr. Cameron. Some \u2014 like Poland, about 850,000 of whose citizens live in Britain \u2014 don\u2019t want to sign a deal that would involve discrimination against their own people. Others are reluctant to set a precedent that any leader can get a special deal by threatening to quit the club.Mr. Cameron\u2019s initial idea was to bring things to a head at a summit meeting in Brussels later this week. Fortunately, Mr. Cameron changed his mind after he was persuaded that he wouldn\u2019t get his way. Although the issue will be discussed this week, he is now targeting a final deal at the next summit meeting, in February.A delay gives the chance for a compromise. There are three main options.From Mr. Cameron\u2019s perspective, the best hope is that the other leaders agree now to let him ban European Union citizens from receiving in-work benefits when the bloc\u2019s treaty is next revised. Although that could be many years away, he could claim he had got what he asked for.The second option would be for Mr. Cameron to impose the ban on in-work benefits in a nondiscriminatory fashion \u2014 for example, by denying them to Britons who hadn\u2019t worked or lived in Britain for four years as well as newly arrived European Union citizens. The problem is that would hurt British youngsters or expats returning home, depending on the exact rules.It is hard for Mr. Cameron to agree to such a proposal because his government was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on reducing tax credits received by low-paid Britons in November. But after a couple more months, maybe he could swallow this pill.The final idea would be to abandon the ill-considered in-work benefits plan and instead get some other concessions from the European Union. Mr. Cameron is already close to securing a deal on issues that are economically more important, like protecting Britain from being marginalized by eurozone countries.Maybe the prime minister could also get an emergency brake to control the inflow of migrants if there was a really big surge in numbers. The snag is that this would wouldn\u2019t reduce the current flow. What\u2019s more, Mr. Cameron has made such a big deal out of in-work benefits that he will be hard-pressed to back down.But Mr. Cameron has to find some solution. Otherwise, he may indeed be forced to campaign to quit the European Union \u2014 something it still seems he really doesn\u2019t want.Advertisement"}

Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cAnd still the rate of growth remains below the level in most years prior to the coverage expansion, while out-of-pocket costs grew at the fifth-lowest level on record.\u201dAnne B. Martin, an economist who was the principal author of the report, said that the growth of health spending last year was in line with projections by her office. The last recession, which began in December 2007 and continued until mid-2009, slowed health spending, as many people lost income and job-based coverage.Retail spending on prescription drugs increased sharply last year, rising 12.2 percent to $297.7 billion, the administration said in its report, published in the journal Health Affairs.\u201cThis rapid increase, which was the highest rate since 2002, was in part due to the introduction of new drug treatments for hepatitis C, as well as of those used to treat cancer and multiple sclerosis,\u201d the administration said. The new treatments for hepatitis C, which are highly effective, accounted for $11.3 billion in new spending.The numbers on retail drug spending do not include drugs administered at hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, where patients receive many high-cost specialty drugs. Spending at those sites is embedded in other categories of spending and is not separately reported.Many people with hepatitis receive care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people. \u201cMedicaid prescription drug expenditures grew 24.3 percent in 2014, up from growth of 4.2 percent in 2013, as a result of increased enrollment and spending for drugs that treat hepatitis C,\u201d the administration reported.Senate investigators said Tuesday that the makers of a breakthrough hepatitis drug, Sovaldi, had put profits ahead of patients in setting the initial price at $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 for a standard course of treatment.Richard G. Frank, an assistant secretary of health and human services, predicted that \u201cfaster growth in spending due to rising coverage will be temporary, and will fade in the coming years.\u201dThe report said the number of uninsured people fell by 8.7 million, or nearly 20 percent, to 35.5 million in 2014. As a result, it said, the share of the total population with insurance increased to 88.8 percent, the highest since 1987.The federal government, which generally paid the full cost of Medicaid for newly eligible beneficiaries and which subsidized private insurance for many other people, accounted for well over half of the increase in national health spending last year.Over all, federal health spending increased 11.7 percent, to nearly $844 billion in 2014, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent in 2013, the report said.In addition, it said, \u201cMedicaid spending by the federal government increased 18.4 percent in 2014,\u201d to $305 billion, compared with an increase of 6.1 percent in 2013.Private health insurance spending grew 4.4 percent and reached $991 billion in 2014, accounting for one-third of national health spending.Total Medicaid spending by federal, state and local government agencies reached $495.8 billion last year, an increase of 11 percent over the prior year, reflecting the fastest rate of growth since 2001. Enrollment in Medicaid increased by 13.2 percent, to 65.9 million people \u2014 the fastest rate of growth since 1991.But spending per Medicaid beneficiary declined 2 percent, to $7,520, as \u201cthe newly insured tended to be lower-cost individuals,\u201d the administration said.\u201cTotal Medicare spending reached $618.7 billion in 2014 and accounted for 20 percent of total health expenditures,\u201d the report said. \u201cAfter growing 3 percent in 2013, Medicare spending grew 5.5 percent in 2014. This was the fastest rate of growth since 2009 and was primarily attributable to faster growth in spending for prescription drugs\u201d and doctors\u2019 services, among other factors.Medicare spending averaged $11,700 per beneficiary last year, representing an increase of 2.4 percent. By contrast, spending per beneficiary was virtually flat in 2012 and 2013.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump had just given them new fodder to galvanize women behind her candidacy \u2014 and they used it.Behind the scenes, the Clinton campaign mobilized a wide network of female supporters to denounce Mr. Trump as \u201csexist,\u201d as a practitioner of \u201cpathetic, frat-boy politics,\u201d and as more suited to running for \u201cpresident of the fourth-grade football team.\u201dFor months, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategy was to hang Mr. Trump\u2019s more outrageous pronouncements around the necks of other Republican contenders, seeking to portray the party\u2019s entire field as extreme. But by going after Mr. Trump more assertively now than most of his Republican rivals have dared, Mrs. Clinton is projecting strength, and she is calculating that women, especially young voters, will reward her.Combativeness, after all, plays into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign theme: The blue \u201cHillary\u201d signs that blanket her rallies carry the slogan \u201cFighting for us\u201d in big block letters.But poking at Mr. Trump is not risk-free. He is unlike any rival Mrs. Clinton has confronted before, and has proved willing to say almost anything.\u201cYou have a chance to step up and do something about Donald Trump,\u201d the letter read. \u201cMost of you are, frankly, a lot smarter than he is. You at least know enough to try to hide your anti-woman policies behind the nice things you say about the women that you know.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not O.K.,\u201d said Katie Packer Gage, a Republican strategist whose firm, Burning Glass Consulting, focuses on improving the party\u2019s standing with women. \u201cGuess what?\u201d she added. \u201cIt takes a girl longer to go to the bathroom because they can\u2019t go standing up. Polite society suggests we don\u2019t talk about these things.\u201dHistory suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.The Clinton campaign\u2019s emboldened new posture toward Mr. Trump grew from months of watching how his Republican rivals struggled to challenge him.While the other candidates for the Republican presidential nomination tread carefully to avoid antagonizing Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, for Mrs. Clinton, hitting hard offers immediate benefits.It shows that she is unafraid of him, Democratic strategists said. And by focusing on Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme comments, Mrs. Clinton could excite the growing list of constituencies he has directly offended, as well as a broad range of voters who see Mr. Trump as a corrosive presence in the presidential campaign.\u201cThe contrast between her and Donald Trump could not be clearer,\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, said after Saturday\u2019s debate.\u201cThe more Trump is out there,\u201d he added, \u201cthe more these differences are clear, and what\u2019s at stake for the middle class, both in the economy and in defeating ISIS.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s assertion in the debate that the Islamic State was \u201cshowing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists\u201d amounted to something of a turning point.Though journalists and Republicans found no evidence of such videos, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides refused to take back her assertion. Mr. Trump, so often called on to admit to a falsehood or apologize, demanded a retraction from Mrs. Clinton.\u201cHell, no,\u201d Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, replied.\u201cPolls show a majority of Americans believe that Mrs. Clinton is not trustworthy,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cTelling a lie feeds the fire and opens a new front in the character wars.\u201dShe added, \u201cSwing voters won\u2019t care that she took a bathroom break, but they will care that she seems willing to say anything to get elected.\u201dRepublican candidates were quick to defend the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after Mr. Trump seemed to suggest that she had been unfairly tough on him during a debate because she was menstruating. But so far, party insiders have mainly demurred from criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s latest boundary-breaking remarks, because publicly defending a Democratic rival, even if it appeases female voters, could prove problematic.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky even joined in the mockery. \u201cCarly Fiorina has ZERO trouble making it back from commercial breaks,\u201d he wrote in a Twitter post that Mrs. Fiorina, who has had her own run-ins with Mr. Trump\u2019s gendered attacks, promptly retweeted.Even some Democrats cautioned that Mrs. Clinton should not get carried away with combativeness toward Mr. Trump.\u201cLong term, we need to be careful of not unifying the Republicans\u201d against Mrs. Clinton, said Stephanie Cutter, a former senior adviser to President Obama, \u201cwhen they\u2019re doing a good job of knifing each other.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the slogan on a Hillary Clinton campaign sign.

Nearly half of the men and women were critical of, or outright hostile to, Clinton, using the words and phrases \u201cdishonest,\u201d \u201ca liar,\u201d \u201cnot good vibes,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t trust.\u201d At the same time, no one suggested that Clinton was weak.Hart asked the 12 male participants to first consider the wide scope of responsibilities \u2014 from foreign policy to the economy \u2014 a president faces and to then indicate with a show of hands \u201cwho can do the job?\u201d\u201cHow many people say, yeah, I think Donald Trump could do the job?\u201d Hart asked. Six raised their hands. For Bush, six also raised their hands. For Carson, it was three.\u201cHow many say Hillary Clinton could do the job?\u201d Hart asked. \u201cEleven out of 12.\u201dIn the women\u2019s group, Bennett asked the question in negative terms: \u201cIs there anybody who you do not feel comfortable that they could handle the enormity and the complexity of the job?\u201d For Trump: seven raised their hands; for Bush: also seven; for Carson: 11. For Clinton: none.Her ability to walk through what she\u2019s had thrown at her just in the last six months should give you an idea that the woman has definitely got some strength. She\u2019s there. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with where she\u2019s coming from, but still, you cannot knock what that woman is like.Alan, another participant, added:I don\u2019t necessarily agree with her positions, but she is definitely strong. For lack of a better term, she\u2019s got some balls, you know. She stands up and stands firm.There is a bear in the woods. For some people, the bear is easy to see. Others don\u2019t see it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Others say it\u2019s vicious and dangerous,\u201d the narrator says as the camera follows a large bear wandering in the wood. With no reference to Walter Mondale or to Russia, the narrator continued: \u201cSince no one can really be sure who\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it smart to be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear.Clinton is determined to insulate herself from such attacks. She has taken steps to create some distance between herself and the president, staking out a more aggressive stance on ISIS than Obama.Clinton\u2019s speech shows that she and her advisers are good loyalists of the military-industrial-intelligence complex.Clinton\u2019s positions have not, so far, damaged her prospects in the nomination fight. She has, in fact, gained ground in the Democratic nomination contest over the past five weeks.Clinton currently brings some unusual strengths for a Democrat to a contest dominated by the fear of new attacks, but the crucial factor could prove to be the extremism of the leading Republican candidates.With the terrorists, you have to take out their families. When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives; don\u2019t kid yourself.O\u2019Reilly felt compelled to warn Trump against \u201cmaking statements that get you into trouble.\u201dLooking back over the past three presidential elections, Hart sized up the qualities that were valued most by voters and noted that this could change from year to year. \u201cIn 1976, political virginity and purity counted more than competence,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 1980 it was toughness that counted \u2013 can-do, stand-up type of leadership. The 1984 election was defined by Reagan, so toughness still counted.\u201dExperience is like a pair of twos in a game of poker. It\u2019s the lowest hand you can form. It\u2019s the best there is until something better comes along, but it\u2019s pretty easy for something better to come along.Trump is coming after Hillary, and others will undoubtedly follow. Experience alone will be unlikely to prevail. Under current circumstances, a candidate\u2019s credibility depends on his or her perceived \u201cability to handle international crises\u201d \u2013 a criterion that demands a persuasive combination of toughness and tactical skill.For Clinton the struggle will be to maintain her advantage on multiple fronts, demonstrating not only a titanium backbone, but subtler skills like ingenuity, cunning and that most elusive component of leadership, charisma.Advertisement"}

The company\u2019s chips are widely used in smartphones and other mobile devices that have become central to many people\u2019s daily lives.Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it had been cooperating with the European authorities and welcomed the opportunity to respond to the charges.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u201cWe look forward to demonstrating that competition in the sale of wireless chips has been and remains strong,\u201d Qualcomm\u2019s general counsel, Donald J.

{"Headline": "A Russian Revolt, Delayed", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The revolution has been postponed again.On Friday afternoon, I was speaking with the anti-Putin organizer and anti-corruption activist Leonid Volkov. He was predicting the regime\u2019s impending collapse when he glanced at his iPhone and said, \u201cIn fact, right now, as we speak, the long-haul truck drivers are blocking the beltway\u201d around Moscow. The protest had been awaited for weeks, and it was expected to be big, possibly historic.Russian long-haul truck drivers had been staging smaller protests since at least the middle of last month, demanding the repeal of a new road tax that went into effect Nov. 15. The tax, ostensibly designed to compensate the state for the damage heavy vehicles cause to roads, amounts to 1.53 rubles (less than 3 cents) per kilometer until March 1, and 3.06 rubles (almost 5 cents) thereafter. At current exchange rates, come March, a Moscow-Novosibirsk run would cost about $150 in taxes, or roughly as much as a driver would be paid for the same distance.To add insult to financial injury, truck owners are required to install a tracking payment-processing system called Platon (an acronym for \u201cpayment for tonnage\u201d that sounds just like the way Russians pronounce the name of the Greek philosopher), made by a company that belongs to Igor Rotenberg, the son of one of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s lifelong friends and closest associates.The new tax is widely perceived as nothing more than a conduit for corruption. In this country of long distances and import-dependent economy, there are nearly two million long-haul trucks. Their drivers and operators have the power and the equipment to make the Russian economy slow down and its road traffic come to a standstill.Last month the drivers began by staging rallies and a couple of kinds of protests in their own cities. The most popular came to be known as ulitka, \u201cthe snail\u201d: A number of drivers would place their trucks in all the lanes of a given road and then slow to a crawl, forcing traffic to back up. Another form of protest, tried in Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, forced traffic to stop by having a group of people constantly moving back and forth in a single pedestrian crosswalk.There is a reason some drivers chose to protest on foot rather than in their trucks, and this reason points to a fundamental difficulty with the protests. To an even greater extent than many of their compatriots, long-haul drivers are at the mercy of the Russian bureaucracy: They have driving licenses and various permits that can be revoked. Any traffic cop can take away a long-haul trucker\u2019s livelihood.If the truckers could be sure all their colleagues were taking the same risks, they might be able to disregard the traffic-police problem. But here they run up against the classic organizing issues of communication and trust. Russian labor unions are weak and often co-opted. Most media are under state control. Online forums are virtually the only organizing and communication tool the drivers have.The drivers first threatened to stage a snail protest on the beltway that encircles Moscow on Nov. 30. Then they decided to wait until Dec. 3, when Mr. Putin was scheduled to deliver his annual address to Parliament. They had written to him and apparently hoped he would mention the Platon issue in his speech. That day, the Kremlin was under even heavier guard than usual, with pedestrians banned from parks adjacent to the fortress. Mr. Putin did not mention the long-haul truckers.That night, trucks began to congregate outside the Moscow beltway. On Friday afternoon, news spread in independent media that the drivers had begun their ulitka action on the road. The traffic map seemed to bear this out: Around 4 p.m. the outer side of the beltway was jammed solid on the north side of the city.But then the traffic police announced that they had sealed off the road themselves, for reasons they would not disclose. The effect on traffic may have been the same as the protest, but technically this had prevented it.At the same time, Parliament hurriedly passed a measure drastically lowering the penalty for nonpayment of the new tax \u2014 for example, down to 5,000 rubles from 450,000 for a first fine \u2014 though it did not lower the actual tax or relieve truckers of the obligation to install the Platon system.Will this small concession be enough to stop the protest? In case it is not, the traffic police appear to have essentially closed the Moscow area to long-haul trucks. Over the weekend, about 15 trucks set up camp in an Ikea parking lot about 10 kilometers to the north of Moscow. Some more trucks took up temporary residence about 70 kilometers to the south.Drivers in the Ikea lot said that the police were not allowing more truckers to join them and that they themselves were stuck: If they drove off the lot in order to get food or fuel, they would not be allowed to re-enter. Moscow residents were bringing them food and diesel fuel so they could run their engines to keep warm.With the beltway closed to them, the drivers could still blockade Moscow by clogging the dozen or so highways that lead to it. They have the numbers to do this. But they may lack the level of organization and trust necessary to carry off such a complicated protest. Even if they overcome those obstacles, state-controlled media will likely continue to ignore them, allowing Mr. Putin to continue ignoring them as well. And if it\u2019s not televised, the protest will not be a revolution.Masha Gessen is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Brothers: The Road to an American Tragedy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A gallon of regular costs $2.01, on average, across the United States, and the motor club AAA says it is likely to plunge below $2 imminently. If you drive a car, as I do, gas that cheap is a thrill. It is an inducement to head out on the road.There is a nastier side to low prices, though: A great deal of evidence suggests that they are bad for the environment. The economics is simple. Low gas prices encourage people to drive more, and to buy more gas-hungry vehicles. Put in a contrary way, high prices are a boon because they discourage driving and limit gasoline consumption.In 2014, though, oil and gasoline prices began to fall sharply, and an all-too-familiar pattern has already begun to emerge.Recent data on new-vehicle purchases is revealing. Fuel economy for new cars, light trucks and sport utility vehicles rose fairly steadily from 20.1 miles per gallon in October 2007 to 25.8 m.p.g. in August 2014, said Michael Sivak, research professor at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Since then, based on Environmental Protection Agency ratings, fuel economy of the new-car fleet has reversed course, dropping to 25 m.p.g. in November, a decline of 0.8 m.p.g.\u201cThat is a huge decline,\u201d Professor Sivak said. It reflects a marginal shift in current buying preferences, away from smaller, efficient cars and toward bigger light trucks and S.U.V.s.While fuel efficiency and emissions for new vehicles are still substantially better than in 2007, both have begun to worsen.Because vehicles are typically used for many years, current purchases have only a gradual effect on the fuel efficiency of the overall vehicle fleet of new and old cars in the United States. But history shows that fuel efficiency responds to gas prices, among other factors. It is striking, for example, that actual on-road fuel efficiency of the average car declined to 13.4 m.p.g. in 1973 from 15.3 m.p.g. in 1936, according to a paper by Professor Sivak and a colleague at the University of Michigan, Brandon Schoettle.Most of the progress in fuel economy occurred after the oil embargo of 1973 and in the 1980s. Fuel economy rose to 21.2 m.p.g. by 1991, propelled partly by soaring prices and by Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which went into effect for the first time in 1978. After that swift progress, however, on-road fuel economy rose only modestly to 23.4 m.p.g. by 2013, the most recent figure available for the overall American car fleet. The data on fuel efficiency for newly purchased cars suggests that the gasoline price declines of recent months may slow down improvements in fuel economy for the overall fleet at the very moment when reducing dependence on fossil fuels may be becoming more urgent.To cut back on gasoline consumption, after all, the Obama administration has been counting on higher fuel economy standards, which are likely to be more palatable when fuel costs are high.\u201cWe found that a gas tax is salable if you tell people the reasons for doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cRaising taxes isn\u2019t popular, but this is not as hopeless as it might seem.\u201dThe problem remains, however, that almost no one likes paying higher taxes, and even drivers who care about the environment really like low gasoline prices. I know I do. On a sunny day, when the traffic is light and gas is cheaper than it\u2019s been in years, I want to get out on the road. Perhaps I should fight the impulse. It might be easier if the true cost of driving were reflected in the price at the pump.Advertisement"}

Certainly the Carpetbagger \u2014 your mostly trusty guide to awards-race shenanigans \u2014 was champing to write in the third person again. And, lo, it is upon us, even if only as a glittery distraction from those other campaigns underway stateside.There was a time earlier this year when the Bagger thought, fleetingly, that perhaps the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should take a page from the Pulitzer Prize board and not award a best picture Oscar at all. This was after the bellwether Telluride and Toronto film festivals had come and gone, and, aside from a few jewels, had largely left Oscar watchers in a state of meh.Eleven times, no fiction Pulitzer was doled out, the last in 2012, when none of the nominees \u2014 David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u201cThe Pale King,\u201d Karen Russell\u2019s \u201cSwamplandia!\u201d and Denis Johnson\u2019s \u201cTrain Dreams\u201d \u2014 received a majority of the votes. There was no prize, and people kind of freaked out.\u201cBecause it\u2019s perceived as wide open, there\u2019s even more aggressive campaigning,\u201d said one studio executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because that\u2019s what studio execs are wont to do, especially when it comes to the Oscars. \u201cBecause the race doesn\u2019t feel locked up, a lot more films on the margins are trying to make the cut.\u201dThis year is also backloaded: Three big star-studded pictures with dreams of statuette glory \u2014 David O. Russell\u2019s \u201cJoy,\u201d Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d \u2014 open on Christmas Day. Based on their pedigrees alone, and long before seeing any of them, Oscar watchistas put them near the top of their lists. Mind you, the same was done last year with Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201cUnbroken,\u201d which made a ton of money at the box office but dropped off forecasters\u2019 lists almost as soon as the credits rolled. Now that this year\u2019s Final Three are being screened, the rankings have shifted: \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is up, \u201cJoy\u201d is down and \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d wobbling. (\u201cCarol,\u201d Todd Haynes\u2019s midcentury tale of lesbian romance, is still holding strong, and on Wednesday it was selected best picture by the New York Film Critics Circle.)Meanwhile, more swashbuckling commercial fare has nosed into the race: The National Board of Review (which defines itself as \u201ca select group of film enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals, academics and students\u201d) chose \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d as the year\u2019s best, and there\u2019s growing momentum for Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cCreed.\u201d Add these to the likelihood that \u201cThe Martian\u201d will get a best picture Oscar nomination, and the prospect is raised that the Academy will become more relevant to broader swaths of the country.Both films hum with urgency and life, and it\u2019s hard to name two other pictures in the Oscar conversation that spotlight America\u2019s deepest issues so entertainingly. One delves into black culture and police violence, the other into the one percenters who plundered the economy, only to get off scot-free and grow ever more rich.\u201cCompton\u201d and \u201cShort\u201d are also directed by men who aren\u2019t in the \u201cclub\u201d: that select group of prestige filmmakers whose work is deemed worthy of Oscar consideration. F. Gary Gray (\u201cCompton\u201d) is perhaps best known for his first feature, the buddy stoner comedy \u201cFriday.\u201d And \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is directed by Adam McKay, who brought us both \u201cAnchorman\u201d movies and \u201cTalladega Nights.\u201d Yet if either of their latest films had instead been directed by, say, Mr. Tarantino, or Martin Scorsese, whose own exploration of Wall Street culture in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d was just as lewd as anything in \u201cCompton,\u201d it\u2019s not a stretch to say that Oscarologists, if not Academy members, would be giving them greater due.That said, Universal is pushing hard for \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d and Paramount has hustled to get screeners of \u201cThe Big Short\u201d to industry guilds in time for voting deadlines. Both films also gained momentum on Tuesday from the National Board of Review, which named \u201cCompton\u201d one of the year\u2019s best and \u201cThe Big Short\u201d as best ensemble film.So there you are: A season that started with a whimper might yet end with a bang.An earlier version of this column misidentified the group whose 2014 vote for best picture resulted in a tie between \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cGravity.\u201d It is the Producers Guild of America, not the Directors Guild.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Christmas Economy Thrives All Year in the Mountains of Mexico", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTlalpujahua JournalTLALPUJAHUA, Mexico \u2014 In the land of the forever Christmas, there are no elves, no reindeer and no snow. And the creepy wooden Santa that sits outside one of the stores here confronts shoppers with a gigantic beard and not an ounce of cheer.This small village, embedded in the lush mountains of Michoac\u00e1n, is no North Pole. Yet it celebrates Christmas every day of the year all the same, as a production center of handmade ornaments for the Mexican, American and Canadian markets.Despite the absence of a traditional Christmas setting, Tlalpujahua, a former mining town, does not lack for charm. The narrow cobblestone streets sweep up sharp slopes to an airy plaza, where a 300-year-old church with a pink bell tower dominates the tiled rooftops and the surrounding landscape. Stores are tiny and tidy, stacked side by side, and the village\u2019s entrance is graced with a giant Christmas tree that stays up all year.Tourists come from across Mexico and the world to shop and get a firsthand look at the craftsmanship, which renders everything from traditional Christmas balls to trumpets, candy canes and pieces of fruit. Ornaments are hand-painted by a second group of workers, whose exacting work gives the decorations the appearance of being machine-made.Craftsmen and women sit at small tables with torches, molding pieces of glass tubing with a delicate blend of glass blowing and gentle twists. The average ornament takes just a few minutes for skilled artisans, though complicated ones can take as long as 15. The ornaments delight the eye with their rich colors and shapes, hanging from ceilings, dangling off trees and piled in baskets, as if harvested from orchards of colored glass.Though high season is October to December, production takes place year-round, as it has to some extent for the last 50 years, work that keeps the local economy going and employs more than 250 families. The village\u2019s one major factory, Fimave, said it shipped close to 50 million ornaments out of the country this year.\u201cBefore we used to have to look for customers,\u201d said one of the owners of Fimave. \u201cNow the people come on their own to buy goods.\u201d She declined to give her name because, she said, she did not want too much attention.Her reticence is understandable in the context of life in the rest of the state of Michoac\u00e1n, where drug violence, kidnappings, extortion and poverty are a more defining characteristic than Christmas cheer.Not so long ago, officials and local people say, criminals extorted payments from the ornament producers. While no longer the case, especially since the uptick in tourism of recent years has bought more attention and police to the town, fears from that time linger for older members of the community. But those fears are seldom discussed, locals say.The town, after all, has survived worse. Established in the 1460s, Tlalpujahua (pronounced Tlahl-pooh-ha-wah) fell from indigenous hands to the Spanish conquistadores, who transformed it into a mining town. Mining remained its lifeblood until 1937, when a landslide destroyed the majority of the town, leaving it without an economy.But in the mid-1960s, a villager named Joaqu\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Orta, who had traveled to the United States and discovered the art of making ornaments, returned home and set up shop. Though his operation, which at one point employed about 1,000 people and was said to be the largest in Latin America, did not survive, the culture did.What emerged eventually shielded the village from the violence and notoriety of the rest of Michoac\u00e1n, turning it into a sort of holiday Brigadoon. Most residents are deeply grateful for a viable industry that not only creates jobs but also attracts tourists, and whose products adorn trees in faraway places.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mr. Mart\u00ednez yelled excitably while giving a tour of his store, showing off glass teddy bears, snowmen and fruit. \u201cIt\u2019s the secret to success.\u201dThe village seems quite unified in its embrace of an economy built on one day a year. Workshops with names like White Christmas, Christmas Milar and the House of Santa open their doors to passers-by, and the village puts on a three-month fair every year, which is billed as the definitive Christmas decoration shopping experience.It also helps that the town was named one of Mexico\u2019s so-called Pueblos M\u00e1gicos in 2005, part of a marketing campaign to rebrand certain small towns around the country as destinations for those looking to experience Mexico\u2019s colonial charm.Since then, the production and popularity of the ornaments have steadily increased. Though not the most exacting with numbers, local tourism officials (there are two) say that production has increased nearly 30 percent this year from 2014.And the number of artisans who dedicate themselves to the craft has increased. From 200 families or small artisan groups making the ornaments last year, there are now more than 250. New workers arrive from elsewhere and find work at a shop, and many then go into business for themselves within a few years. New shops are popping up all the time to meet the demand. What they lack, however, is more than one large-scale manufacturing facility to capitalize on the number of workers.Why Tlalpujahua does not have more factories connecting with clients in other countries is a study in Mexico\u2019s informal economy and the deterrence of bureaucracy. For the most part, rather than deal with the taxes, salaries and oversight required of a company, most artisans would rather stay small.\u201cI could go bigger, but clients are hard to find and the hassle isn\u2019t really all that worth it,\u201d said Luis Alberto Vidal, who works with his brothers and their families in his own little craft shop. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s mostly local customers and tourists.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposition in Venezuela Now Has to Fix the Ills That Led to Its Victory", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Now comes the hard part. The political opposition here rode discontent over a failing economy to an overwhelming majority in legislative elections on Sunday, but after years of sniping from the sidelines, members have to get down to the difficult task of delivering on promises to fix the country\u2019s many ills.The opposition, under the banner of the Democratic Unity coalition, won 112 of the 167 seats in the National Assembly, which will be sworn in Jan. 5, according to electoral authorities. The government\u2019s United Socialist Party will now have 55 seats.The victory broke the United Socialist Party\u2019s absolute hold on government institutions and it represents the first time since its founder, the leftist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, first took office as president in 1999 that the opposition has taken control of the legislature.It also sets up a power struggle between the Assembly and President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s disciple and successor.The newly elected legislators say that their first act will be to pass an amnesty law freeing political prisoners, including Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the leader of the Popular Will party, who was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for his role in leading antigovernment protests last year. His trial was widely criticized over a lack of due process, and one of the lead prosecutors later fled the country, accusing the government of using trumped-up evidence to convict Mr. L\u00f3pez.Next, the lawmakers say, they will confront the country\u2019s deep economic problems, including triple-digit inflation, a two-year recession and chronic shortages of basic goods.\u201cThe biggest problem is the economy,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, a state governor and the leader of the Justice First party, which won more than 30 Assembly seats, more than any other party in the opposition coalition. He called Venezuela\u2019s economic plight the worst crisis in its history, and said that now that voters have expressed their desire for change, they expect results.\u201cEverything should be aimed at finding a solution to the crisis and toward actions that allow Venezuela to recover economically,\u201d he said.The problem is that the principal economic levers remain in the hands of the president, and there are only limited steps the legislature can take on its own.Jos\u00e9 Guerra, a former central bank economist who won election in a formerly pro-government part of Caracas, said that he envisioned laws to create incentives for economic production, to give pensions to older Venezuelans who are not included in the current pension system, and to recover money stolen through corruption.Yet some essential steps, like repairing a crippled, three-tier exchange rate system, require cooperation with the executive branch. Others, including raising the price of gasoline and eliminating or loosening price controls, may be too politically sensitive for the Assembly to want to take on by itself.\u201cThe Assembly doesn\u2019t set economic policy,\u201d said Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThink about the basic things that have to be done in Venezuela, they\u2019re related to the need to carry out a macroeconomic stabilization, and that\u2019s done by the government, by the Finance Ministry that controls the government budget and by the central bank that controls exchange rate and monetary policy. These are really executive decisions.\u201dThere are however, ways that the Assembly could pressure Mr. Maduro to shift course economically. It can remove cabinet ministers, like the finance minister, and it can vote to remove the directors of the central bank.An alternative would be for the Assembly and Mr. Maduro to find a way to work together, particularly on economic policy, perhaps even with the president appointing some opposition members to his cabinet.So far, Mr. Maduro has given no indication that he is open to that approach. He quickly accepted the opposition victory after results were released early Monday morning, but he also blamed what he called an economic war for his party\u2019s defeat, a war that he said was being waged against his government and the country by shadowy capitalist forces.The ability of the two sides to cooperate may also have a lot to do with how the current, socialist-dominated Assembly carries out the transition over the next three weeks.Many expect that it will move to appoint a group of new Supreme Court justices to replace several whose terms expire next year and maintain the governing party\u2019s influence over the courts. It could also pass a law giving Mr. Maduro broad powers to create laws by decree.There are many risks a period of divided government brings. The first is that the Assembly and Mr. Maduro could become caught in a lengthy battle that plunges the country into a constitutional crisis.In contrast to the system in the United States, bills passed by the Assembly become law even if they are not signed by the president. But the Supreme Court, which for years has backed the leftist government, could reject laws as unconstitutional.Most in the opposition say their goal is ultimately to remove Mr. Maduro from office, making way for new elections. But there is disagreement over how to go about it.Henry Ramos, a leader of the Democratic Unity coalition who was elected to the Assembly on Sunday, predicted that the elections had begun a transition period that would end with Mr. Maduro\u2019s early exit well before his term ends in 2019.\u201cThe elections have left the government very weak, and with the internal problems and the economic crisis I don\u2019t see it reaching the end of its normal term,\u201d Mr. Ramos said on election night.Opponents say that they will act within the bounds of the Constitution and that Mr. Maduro could be hastened out the door through a recall election, a constitutional amendment that cuts his term short or a more complete constitutional overhaul. Or he could be somehow forced to resign.But some analysts say that the opposition has a problem that may upset those plans.If opposition leaders cooperate with Mr. Maduro and are successful, the public\u2019s anger over inflation and shortages could ease. \u201cIf Maduro fixes the economy he might win the recall referendum,\u201d Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said.Some in the opposition, most notably Mr. Capriles, have argued that any discussion of removing Mr. Maduro should come only after the country\u2019s economic problems have been addressed.\u201cPeople are not asking you to get rid of Maduro or to change the government, and they\u2019re not desperate for a recall referendum,\u201d said Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a pollster, speaking in a television interview on Tuesday. \u201cPeople today want them to sit down and see how they can solve the problem that there aren\u2019t any eggs or there isn\u2019t sugar or car parts or, even worse, medicine.\u201dAn article on Dec. 9 about challenges awaiting the political opposition in Venezuela, which rode discontent over a failing economy to an overwhelming majority in legislative elections, referred incorrectly to Henry Ramos, a leader of the opposition Democratic Unity coalition. He was elected \u2014 not re-elected \u2014 to the National Assembly.Patricia Torres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investing in Ukraine\u2019s Future", "Date": "2015-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsJust over a year ago, President Obama signed into law the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which provided congressional backing to sanctions on Russia following the Kremlin\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. Since then, sanctions have hurt Russia\u2019s economy and prevented individuals in President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle from traveling to the West. The Obama administration should be commended for sustaining a successful sanctions regime.But Washington must do more than just punish Russia. It must bolster Ukrainians as they struggle to build a new, reform-minded government while continuing to fight to maintain their country\u2019s territorial integrity.As winter sets in, the continuing war in Ukraine\u2019s east has devolved into an economic siege as Russia leverages gas supplies, coal shipments and debt repayment to attempt to extract concessions from a Ukrainian government that is still battling Russian proxies violating the Minsk II cease-fire. With Ukraine\u2019s economic output having shrunk by a quarter, the currency sharply devalued and a population fearful of an uncertain future, Ukraine is teetering on the brink.Support for Ukraine\u2019s democratic aspirations in the face of Russian aggression is one of the few areas where both Democrats and Republicans agree. But the gap between rhetoric and resources pledged is shockingly wide. Next year, Ukraine can expect approximately $3 billion to $4 billion in conditional support from the United States and the European Union, combined. This sum is insufficient. Lawrence Summers, the former United States Treasury secretary, called on Europeans to deliver on promises to support Ukraine\u2019s reform efforts with increased funding of $5 billion to $10 billion, calling it an important \u201csecurity investment.\u201d He\u2019s right.Congress and the Obama administration should work together to provide an additional $2 billion to $5 billion in economic support. At the same time, Washington should seek to persuade the European Union to make a similar commitment for a total of $10 billion, the optimal amount of support to allow Ukraine\u2019s government room to maneuver. If budget concerns prevent that, it is essential that together the United States and European Union find at least $5 billion in assistance, the minimum threshold to ensure the viability of an independent Ukraine that can sustain its nascent reform effort and withstand a persistent campaign of economic sabotage by Russia.This grand aid package could include loan guarantees, direct budget support grants and debt swaps, as well as assistance to support reforms in key sectors, like banking, energy and the judiciary. It could also be used to encourage investment in Ukraine. Loan guarantees, which have been the preferred method of support approved by Congress to date, should only constitute part of the package. There is a limit to how much debt Ukraine can take on before default. Loans could be paired with direct budgetary support to assist with balance of payments and with debt swaps, which have a proven track record of helping sustain young democracies: The United States granted them to Poland in the 1990s.As former American ambassadors to Kiev, we recognize one of the main challenges in providing economic support to Ukraine: corruption. This is why any future assistance package must be made conditional on the Ukrainian government\u2019s commitment to accelerate reform and root out corruption. The current Ukrainian leadership is far from perfect, but the seeds of accountability have been planted, and Ukraine\u2019s robust civil society ensures a steady supply of nurturing sunlight. The recent resignation of a notoriously corrupt parliamentary kingmaker and the appointment of a new top anti-corruption prosecutor are signs of Ukraine\u2019s progress.Longtime observers of Ukraine who are impatient for change have criticized the pace of reform. But the move toward market pricing in the gas sector, cleaning up the banking sector by closing insolvent banks and introducing transparency checks into banks\u2019 ownership structures are commendable. So is the creation of the National Reform Council, the development of an official anti-corruption strategy and the gradual adoption of e-government and other transparent-governance tools.A new Ukraine was born in the Maidan, but the United States and Europe have thus far failed to make an adequate commitment to its success. That must change. The West must now provide support commensurate with the military and economic threat Kiev faces, while also pushing the Ukrainian government to reform. A global order based on rule of law is at stake. Defending it cannot be done on the cheap. For the West, a Ukraine impoverished by Kremlin aggression will be far more costly.John E. Herbst, director of the Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council, was American ambassador to Ukraine from 2003-6. Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was ambassador to Ukraine from 1998-2000. William B. Taylor, Jr., executive vice president at the United States Institute of Peace, was ambassador to Ukraine from 2006-9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Travel Industry in Motion as Visas Are Reviewed", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Obama on Sunday blamed a special visa travel program for allowing one of the San Bernardino terrorists into the country, a chill swept through the American travel industry.As it turns out, the reference to the program was simply a slip of Mr. Obama\u2019s tongue during his Oval Office address. As investigators had previously disclosed, Tashfeen Malik, the woman who the authorities say carried out last week\u2019s attack along with her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, entered the United States under a visa program for fianc\u00e9es of Americans, not the more common travel program.While representatives of the travel industry breathed easier, the respite might be temporary. The Visa Waiver Program remains under intense scrutiny as Congress and the administration scramble for ways to plug perceived security vulnerabilities and reassure nervous Americans.The House on Tuesday is set to approve an overhaul that would prevent recent travelers to Iraq and Syria from taking advantage of the Visa Waiver Program and impose other new requirements to tighten screening of travelers from 38 participating countries. A bipartisan group of senators has proposed a more stringent alternative that would put new fingerprint requirements in place, requirements some travel and security experts fear may be redundant and difficult to carry out.\u201cWe are realistic about the urgency to act after a major event when members are hellbent to show they are on the case,\u201d said Jonathan Grella, a former top House aide who is now the executive vice president of public affairs at U.S. Travel. \u201cWe are not going to be the association or the industry that says, \u2018Don\u2019t touch our program.\u2019 It was always going to have to be evaluated when the stakes are as high as they are.\u201dAs refugees from Syria and Iraq became the focus of political attention after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, Democrats and the White House were eager to shift attention away from them. Democrats raised the visa waiver program as a potentially greater threat since citizens from Europe and other nations with close ties to the United States could enter without an in-person interview. And as momentum behind the effort to block refugees slowed, the push behind the visa waiver legislation sped up.While willing to accept changes, travel industry officials marshaled their forces, which include former executive branch officials who developed the program and now defend it.Association members from around the nation in an industry that includes hotels, theme parks, airports and restaurants sought to educate lawmakers on the waiver program, which requires all visitors to provide biographical information for security screening before they are allowed entry. Industry officials say they worry that if the program is curtailed, it could cause retaliation by other nations and lead to less screening of visitors.The travel association backs the House measure, which beefs up the program by requiring all visitors from participating countries to have fraud-resistant passports and requires countries to check travelers against Interpol databases and perform other checks. Nations that don\u2019t share requested counterterrorism data could be dropped from the program.House leaders said their bill strikes the right balance between security and ease of travel. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and majority leader, said the aim is to \u201cprotect the United States\u201d but also allow those who want to visit to do so.\u201cWe want them to enjoy the freedom, see the attractions we have as well,\u201d he said.How the House plan will be reconciled with the Senate approach is not yet clear, though officials said Monday that there was a growing sense that the Senate would accept the House version. Even well-known supporters of the industry say more stringent restrictions might be necessary despite threats to the travel economy.\u201cWhat hurts the tourism industry the most are terrorist attacks,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat who heads the Senate tourism caucus and is backing the Senate measure written by Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and longtime skeptic of the Visa Waiver Program.What the travel industry really wants is a name change for the program. The idea of a waiver is not particularly reassuring, and Mr. Grella notes that the name Visa Waiver Program conjures up an aggressive third-base coach waving visitors into the United States \u2014 not the image the industry wants to send. The suggested alternative is the Secure Travel Partnership.\u201dIt is the best program with the worst name in Washington,\u201d Mr. Grella said.Advertisement"}

Any long-term solution will require profound changes in how we generate energy. At the same time, there are everyday things that you can do to reduce your personal contribution to a warming planet. Here are seven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.Yes, eating nothing but locally grown fruits and vegetables would reduce your carbon footprint the most. But for people not ready to make that leap, reducing how much meat you eat matters more than going local.If you really want to mind your carbon emissions, taking a train or a bus is best, especially for shorter trips. Or try that Internet thing: A Skype call or Google Hangout produces very little carbon dioxide.If you do get a dog, you can use it to the climate\u2019s advantage. A dog will help you get in the habit of taking walks. The next time you need to run a quick errand to a nearby store, you can walk rather than hopping in your car.Of course, these individual choices are all small measures.A sustainable solution that avoids severe damage to the planet will require fundamental changes in the global energy system: transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy and sharply reducing the number of cars that run on internal-combustion engines.Advocating public policies that support the development of clean energy and efficient transportation is probably the most climate-friendly thing you can do. But cultural and behavioral change can be part of the solution as well. Might as well start now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For French Greens, Dashed Hopes", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Energy for TomorrowPARIS \u2014 The weeks leading up to the United Nations global climate conference here could have been one of the finest hours for France\u2019s ecology movement, which is one of the oldest in Europe and was, for one brief, shining moment, one of the Continent\u2019s most politically successful.That moment came in 2009, when the country\u2019s main green party, Les Verts, scored 16.28 percent of the vote in French elections to the European Parliament, the highest total ever for a French environmental party in any election.Since then, the party, now known as Europe \u00c9cologie Les Verts, or E.E.L.V., has imploded. Some of its leading members have split to found a new group, and others are casting about for a political future before French regional elections this month and a presidential vote in 2017.This tumult pushed the E.E.L.V. party off the stage as France was preparing to host the ambitious COP21 climate conference, which is viewed as a chance for President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and his Socialist government \u2014 still loosely allied with the greens \u2014 to shine in the international spotlight.For Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who headed the French ecologists\u2019 list in 2009, the collapse of E.E.L.V. is a painful memory. \u201cWe created an incredible hope and then that hope was destroyed,\u201d he recalled in a recent telephone interview. But Mr. Cohn-Bendit, known for his leading role in the May 1968 student protests in Paris, takes the long view on the influence of the ecologist movement on the climate-change debate.\u201cOld Europe \u2014 France included \u2014 is deeply conscious of the problem, and about the necessity to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe software is there; now we have to put in the hardware. The thinking is done; now is the time for doing.\u201dHe credits a grab bag of associations, local groups and old-fashioned \u201cmilitants,\u201d or activists, with having raised consciousness about the environment, food safety and climate change. The movement in France has been helped by such media-savvy personalities as Nicolas Hulot, a television host who is Mr. Hollande\u2019s envoy to the COP21 conference, and Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, an activist whose causes have included battling the spread of fast food. Even Pope Francis has had an affect, with his insistence on the need to act on climate issues.\u201cThe terrain was prepared and that is what has allowed society to move forward,\u201d Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. One result is that a large majority of citizens in most European countries \u2014 from 64 percent to 82 percent \u2014 blame human activity for global warming, compared with only 54 percent in the United States, according to an Ipsos Mori global poll in 2014. Another is that Europe is widely considered to be in the lead on climate change, despite some glaring setbacks. In October, the European Union\u2019s 28 countries were collectively able to show that they were on track to meet, or even surpass, the goal of reducing 1990-level greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. Such an achievement was \u201cunimaginable\u201d just five years ago, Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. In his view, the ecologists\u2019 most significant advances and influence have in fact taken place on the European \u2014 rather than national \u2014 level. National debates in European countries have varied widely. In Germany, which historically has had a strong environmental party, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to close the country\u2019s nuclear reactors by 2022 has spurred not only the search for alternative energy but also a greater reliance on coal \u2014 an industry that is both a major cause of pollution and a major employer.In France, by contrast, where more than 75 percent of electricity is produced by nuclear power, the debate about a nuclear-free future gets little political traction.Mr. Hollande\u2019s record on the environment has been inconsistent. A 2012 campaign promise to close an aging nuclear plant at Fessenheim in eastern France remains unfulfilled, though government support for renewable energy has been increased.In late October, the French government\u2019s claim to be a leader in the fight against pollution and climate change took a beating when it joined with a majority of European governments in backing a European Union measure to allow the maximum levels of nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel cars to double from the current level until 2017. The vote in Brussels was quickly and widely denounced by opponents as a concession to Europe\u2019s automobile industry.Mr. Cohn-Bendit attributes the E.E.L.V.\u2019s political failure to its refusal to open the ecologist movement to the entire political spectrum, as has happened in Germany. Instead, the French party got swept up in the clannish politics of the French left \u2014 what Mr. Cohn-Bendit calls \u201cleftist infantilism\u201d \u2014 resulting in amoeba-like splits along personal and ideological lines. (It is interesting to note that two major figures in France\u2019s ecological movement are not French-born: Mr. Cohn-Bendit, born in France of German parents, chose German nationality as a youth, and Eva Joly, who ran for president in 2012 \u2014 garnering just 2.28 percent of the vote in the first round \u2014 is a native of Norway. Both now have French citizenship.)Mr. Cohn-Bendit believes that as a political force, French environmentalists have difficulty translating popular awareness into the kind of political action that can hold its own against powerful lobbies and economic interests at a time when the French economy is stagnant. \u201cThere is resistance from industry, from oil companies and producers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also need to reduce consumption, which is not always popular.\u201dLike temperatures, awareness levels have been rising around the world. \u201cWith Obama, the U.S. is going in the right direction, and now China is going in the right direction for the simple reason that its cities are suffocating,\u201d Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. \u201cNow we have the momentum to go forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bush\u2019s presidency \u2014 a debacle not just for the nation, but for the Republican Party, which saw Democrats both take the White House and achieve some major parts of their agenda \u2014 to inspire some reconsideration of W-type policies. What we\u2019ve seen instead is a doubling down, a determination to take whatever didn\u2019t work from 2001 to 2008 and do it again, in a more extreme form.Start with the example that\u2019s easiest to quantify, tax cuts.The point is that while the mainstream contenders may have better manners than Mr. Trump or the widely loathed Mr. Cruz, when you get to substance it becomes clear that all of them are frighteningly radical, and that none of them seem to have learned anything from past disasters.And if this happens, it will be important to realize that not being Donald Trump doesn\u2019t make someone a moderate, or even halfway reasonable. The truth is that there are no moderates in the Republican primary, and being reasonable appears to be a disqualifying characteristic for anyone seeking the party\u2019s nod.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Final 3rd-Quarter Estimate Shows U.S. Economy Growing 2%", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe government revised its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter down slightly on Tuesday, as consumer spending helped sustain a modest growth rate despite a dip in net exports caused in part by the stronger dollar.\u201cThe Achilles heels of the second half of 2015 are inventories and trade, which remain a drag on growth,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. \u201cThe good news is that consumers are showing a willingness to carry the economy into the new year.\u201dAfter a big buildup of goods in warehouses and on shelves in the first half of 2015, inventories proved to be a headwind in the third quarter.Businesses have been cautious about spending, while plunging oil prices have prompted energy companies to cut back on new investments. A weaker trade balance also exerted pressure, reducing growth by 0.3 percentage point.In a separate report on Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell by 10.5 percent in November, an unexpected plunge that the group and private economists attributed to the start of new government rules that may have slowed down mortgage closings.\u201cWe expect delayed sales activity to be recouped in coming months as the real estate industry adjusts to these new regulations,\u201d Barclays said in a note to clients on Tuesday.For all the blows the economy has absorbed in recent years, it has maintained a remarkably even keel.Consumer demand, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic activity, has been rising at a rate of roughly 3 percent. Similarly, employers continue to hire at a steady pace and average hourly earnings are showing signs of life after years of stagnation.Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, said he was struck by a seemingly obscure but telling data point in the third quarter report: a 2.9 percent increase in final sales to domestic purchasers, which strips out the negative impact of inventory changes and net exports.\u201cThat\u2019s a very respectable top line figure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economy\u2019s underlying growth rate is more in the neighborhood of 3 percent than 2 percent.\u201dEconomists expect the growth rate in the current fourth quarter to be similar to that of the third quarter, with the economy\u2019s rate of expansion for 2015 expected to be just over 2 percent.One major source of weakness recently has been the strong dollar, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. The dollar\u2019s rise hurts American companies by making American exports more expensive for overseas buyers. At the same time, the picture for growth in both Asia and Europe remains cloudy.\u201cEmployment has been holding up but the big economic story has been downward pressure from a strong dollar,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cAnd the rest of the world, unfortunately, is still weak.\u201dIndeed, last week\u2019s interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which came as some other central banks overseas were maintaining more accommodative monetary policies, could push the dollar even higher.\u201cThe negative effect from inventories is temporary,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said, \u201cbut weak exports will be part of the U.S. picture for at least another year or two.\u201dTuesday\u2019s revision is the last of three estimates by the Commerce Department of economic growth in July, August and September. The downward adjustment had been expected, with economists predicting before the report that growth would be revised down to 1.9 percent.The first estimate, in October, showed growth of 1.5 percent. That was revised upward to 2.1 percent last month.A fresher take on the economy\u2019s prospects will come on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reports data for consumer spending and income in November. Economists are forecasting a pickup in spending, with incomes growing more modestly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese Company in India, Stumbling Over a Culture ", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe China Factor | Part 7SHINDE, India \u2014 When a Chinese truck company wanted to open a factory in India, its president looked at sites that had a mountain in back and a river in front \u2014 especially auspicious locations in the traditional practice of feng shui.The company, Beiqi Foton Motor, found a seemingly ideal spot, securing 250 acres of farmland in this western Indian village. Foton wants another 1,250 acres nearby to build an industrial park for suppliers.But the mountain here is sacred to many Hindus. For at least 2,000 years, the cliffside caves have been home to generations of monks. One of the most revered Hindu saints is said to have attained a pure vision of his god during the 17th century while meditating in the highest cave overlooking what is now Foton\u2019s site.The culture clash was immediate.Foton erected barbed-wire fences and hired uniformed guards to keep out trespassers. Cattle herders and Hindu pilgrims have repeatedly trampled the fences. The monks do not want a noisy neighbor.\u201cIn today\u2019s life, spirituality and science are both important, and neither should deny the other,\u201d Kailash Nemade, a monk, said during a pause from chanting religious poems. \u201cBut this factory should not come here, because it will ruin the spirituality of the mountain.\u201dChinese companies have embarked on ambitious overseas expansion efforts, snapping up land in dozens of countries to build factories, industrial parks, power plants and other operations. While the investments provide critical support for many economies, Chinese businesses are struggling to navigate complex cultural, political and competitive dynamics.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.China\u2019s economic slowdown this year, along with a stock market plunge and a currency devaluation, have not deterred the country\u2019s companies. Many have accelerated their global shifts as their home market becomes less attractive.But Chinese enterprises lack the experience of their Western counterparts, which have spent decades developing international operations. As Chinese companies have built their businesses largely at home, they haven\u2019t had to address the same challenges.In China, companies with strong Communist Party connections can bulldoze communities and religious sites. The Chinese government bans independent labor unions. While strikes and other labor protests are becoming more common, they are quickly squelched by the government if they show signs of spreading.As Chinese companies now venture overseas, they are dealing with a wave of resistance.In Africa, workers at Chinese-run oil fields and copper mines have gone on strike over low pay and dangerous working conditions. The Myanmar government halted China\u2019s construction of a hydroelectric dam there after protests over environmental damage and the displacement of villagers. And in Nicaragua, residents have resisted the planned resettlement of villages to make way for a canal proposed by a Chinese businessman.In India, Foton\u2019s experience provides a look into the internal struggle that countries face.India desperately needs outside investment to support the 13 million young people entering its labor force every year and to begin relieving chronic unemployment in its countryside. Indian and Western factories within a few miles of Foton\u2019s site have created thousands of jobs.Western companies have tried to tread more carefully in India, in some cases learning from past mistakes. They have worked closely with communities, explaining their projects to residents. The companies have typically sent teams of executives, often with overseas experience.Foton strongly defends its plans. The company says that its plant and supplier park will create a much-needed economic boost.\u201cBecause of these projects, the employment of thousands of people, even tens of thousands, will be accomplished,\u201d said Zhao Jingguang, Foton\u2019s executive vice president.But Foton keeps revising production plans and delaying construction. With the project stalled, the promised jobs have not materialized.Foton\u2019s corporate style has also caused friction. It managed the project mainly from Beijing, sending executives to India for two-week visits. When Foton\u2019s Indian managers needed to work with the main office, they sat through videoconferences that lasted hours, with Chinese executives often speaking at length in Chinese.Mr. Zhao denies that the company picked the location for its feng shui, which the Chinese government condemns as superstition. Still, he acknowledged that \u201cthere is a river, should be good feng shui.\u201dBut the land deal has been less than harmonious.Regulations mandate that factories be located at least 500 meters from temples, preventing construction on half of Foton\u2019s site. A state agency also reserved land for a 15-yard-wide dirt access road to help pilgrims reach a footpath to the caves.Despite Foton\u2019s efforts, many villagers and monks say the factory would still be too close. Pilgrims, who can number over 5,000 during religious festivals, would have only a half-acre site to pitch their tents.Sitting cross-legged in a pink-painted cave, the monks\u2019 leader, a Hindu holy man named Vishwanath Maharaj, listened closely when asked for his view on Foton\u2019s plans. But he merely gave a slight smile and shrugged his shoulders, preserving his 35-year vow of silence.When President Xi Jinping of China arrived in India a year ago for a visit, he was welcomed at each stop by gleaming military honor guards, including a row of turbaned cavalry lancers on horseback.Mr. Xi and his host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, smiled as a succession of deputies and executives exchanged more than a dozen commercial and cultural agreements with one another. One of the agreements called for the creation of the supplier park, where Foton would rent out space to Chinese parts manufacturers.China and India both want to strengthen their economic ties, even as their militaries remain wary of each other. The $300 million Foton project, including the plant and the industrial park, is one of China\u2019s largest investments in India.\u201cYour vision cannot be too small,\u201d Mr. Zhao said. \u201cNowadays, people say you must have an international vision.\u201dFollowing the lead of the United States, Japan, Europe and other big economies, Chinese companies are diversifying overseas to find new customers, markets and opportunities.A decade ago, China\u2019s overseas purchases of companies, land, equipment and other physical assets totaled just $20 billion a year. Last year, China\u2019s total was $120 billion. It trails only the United States, and American overseas investments have been heavily aimed at limiting taxes.Pune and its environs have long been a hub of foreign investment, tracing their industrial roots to a munitions factory built in 1869 under British rule. Big assembly plants now churn out Chevrolets, Mercedes, Mahindras and other cars. A Corning plant makes fiber-optic cables. A General Electric factory creates wind turbines.For Foton, India offered cheaper labor than its home country and a strong market for its products. India\u2019s position between Southeast Asia and Africa provided a natural hub to supply other developing markets as well.Even without the supplier park, Foton has leased the biggest site in the area, 250 acres, for 95 years. Corning, G.E. and others nearby have less than 100 acres apiece for their factories. A Bridgestone tire factory occupies 185 acres.In Shinde, speculators have bid up the price of land, expecting that the state government will buy it and lease it to Foton. But many villagers are opposed to selling, since the deal would eliminate much of the farmland that is left.Kaluram Kendale, who grows onions and raises buffaloes, does not want to sell. He is upset that the state government already forced him to sell five of the 12 acres that his family farmed for generations.\u201cIf I sell the land, it\u2019s one-time money,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my land is beautiful, it\u2019s fertile, and it\u2019s a permanent source of income for my family.\u201dChhaya Shinde, who grew up in a mud-walled sharecropper\u2019s cabin with dirt floors, was a star student, learning to read and write Hindi and Marathi, the local tongue.Her father, unlike most in her impoverished hamlet, wanted his daughter to get an education. He paid $16 a year for Ms. Shinde to attend a school in a nearby village. She dreamed of becoming a social worker to help the elderly.Ms. Shinde\u2019s education ended after Foton came to town.While landowners got paid for their fields, sharecroppers got nothing. Ms. Shinde\u2019s father, a millet farmer, lost much of his income. Ms. Shinde had to drop out of school a year ago.\u201cI had no money,\u201d said a tearful Ms. Shinde, 18. \u201cI was at home, so I had to be married off.\u201dSince the arrival of Foton, the gulf between the rich and the poor here has widened.The Panmands, who owned the land where Ms. Shinde\u2019s family farmed, sold half of their 58 acres for the Foton factory and two other factories. With the proceeds, they built a 10-bedroom villa with a large courtyard and a fish pond.\u201cFor people who are rich, it\u2019s beneficial because they can buy a lot of things,\u201d said Vijay Panmand, 28. \u201cBut for the poor, it is not good. Where will they work?\u201dWhen Suresh Ghanwat sold land, he invested a portion of the money in a three-story apartment building, renting out the top and bottom floors. He also set up a concrete-block business, producing a daily profit of $80.But many families are like Ms. Shinde\u2019s, trying to survive in cramped, dark cabins.Indian laws on land deals are fairly generous by developing-country standards, calling for compensation for tenant farmers and sharecroppers. But to qualify, they need to live on the land or record the arrangement in official logs. Ms. Shinde\u2019s family did neither.Ms. Shinde, who wears a pair of simple barrettes to hold back her dark hair and slim golden bangles that encircle each wrist and ankle, now labors part time on one of the Panmand family\u2019s remaining fields.\u201cI wish they had never come here,\u201d she said of Foton, wielding a hand-held scythe to cut pearl millet. \u201cThose who were rich became richer, and the poor, poorer.\u201dWhen Foton acquired the land here three years ago, young babul trees sprouted as soon as the farmers left. Today, Foton\u2019s site has roughly 12,000 full-grown babul trees, a widely loathed plant with two-inch thorns.Their height, up to 10 feet, brings a tree preservation ordinance into play. When Foton eventually starts building, it will have to get permission from the forestry ministry to cut the trees down.As the babul trees flourish, Foton\u2019s leadership has agonized over what to build, according to five former executives. The original plan called for welding, assembling and painting heavy-duty trucks.Mr. Zhao of Foton said the company hoped to start building the factory by early next year. The first vehicle most likely will not roll off the factory line until at least 2017.The supplier park looks less certain.Both the Beijing government and the New Delhi establishment regard the deal as important. But Foton did not enlist the support of local bureaucrats, and a civil servant in Mumbai could ultimately derail the project.The state land agency, the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, has to approve the deal. And the agency\u2019s chief executive, Bhushan Gagrani, has resisted, citing a dearth of farmland and earlier disputes with families like the Ghanwats. He wants to steer the supplier park farther inland, where unemployment is more acute and farmland abundantly available.But the alternative sites would require supply trucks to haul parts for several hours. Foton, Mr. Gagrani said, did not send anyone even to look at them.The Indian prime minister, accompanied by an entourage that included Mr. Gagrani, traveled to China in mid-May. Chinese officials pressed the case for the Foton supplier park again.But a deal may not be possible now.Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer, has decided to build a mobile phone factory nearby. Foxconn negotiated its deal directly with the state government.\u201cAny land left,\u201d Mr. Gagrani said, \u201cwe are giving to Foxconn.\u201dJonah Kessel contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Brands in Paris Look Ahead With Hope", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a midweek morning, with a month to go before Christmas, the entrance halls of Galeries Lafayette, one of the busiest department stores in Paris, appeared to be bustling with shoppers.From a snaking line of Chinese tourists waiting to claim tax refunds to sales assistants arranging displays of luxury chocolates and liqueurs, it seemed business as usual for the retailer, just a little more than a week after a series of terrorist attacks killed 130 people in the French capital and horrified the Western world.But upstairs told a different story. On the first floor, a nervous sales associate for an Italian luxury house, who declined to be named because he was not allowed to comment, estimated that sales had dropped 40 percent in the week after the attacks. Another recalled how, days earlier, the sound of a Chanel concession awning being unfurled inside the store had been mistaken for gunshots, sending dozens of panicked shoppers, already on edge because the police were searching a car out front, diving for cover.\u201cIn the past week, we\u2019ve noticed a change in the people who come to our boutique: Less people are casually strolling around the store,\u201d he said, adding that store security measures had been toughened after the attacks, with more guards and plainclothes agents. \u201cThe people who come are here to buy and then leave.\u201dOver on the Rue St. Honor\u00e9, few people had come to shop on a street that is home to dozens of the city\u2019s most popular luxury boutiques.\u201cHotels nearby say they\u2019ve seen a considerable amount of cancellations, and we are feeling that decline,\u201d said an associate from the doorway of a glittering but deserted flagship store for a British accessories label. (The store manager agreed to speak on condition that neither he nor the brand would be identified, as he is not allowed to speak for the house.)\u201cWe expect the locals to come back more quickly than international customers,\u201d the manager said. \u201cFrom abroad, the attacks are all they think about now when they hear the word Paris.\u201dEven before the attacks, the global market for luxury personal goods was heading for its weakest year since 2009, according to research conducted by Bain & Company, the management consulting agency, as a combination of volatile stock markets, a strong dollar, slowing economic growth in emerging markets and geopolitical turmoil hurt bottom lines.But after the attacks on Nov. 13, and with as much as 30 percent of annual sales made in the year-end holiday quarter, its performance in 2015 could turn out even worse than expected.\u201cThe timing of the attacks is unfortunate given the market was already softening, particularly at the higher end. They have come in what was already a muted global consumer environment,\u201d said Luca Solca, an analyst for Exane BNP Paribas. Stocks of major luxury groups such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering dropped when markets opened Nov. 16, the Monday after the attacks, but then they moderated, with travel companies having the greatest losses.\u201cLuxury sales are concentrated to a very small number of major cities and Paris is in the top three \u2014 if not the top destination \u2014 in which these sales are made,\u201d Mr. Solca added. \u201cIn the short term, we are seeing tourists pausing before traveling to Europe, and this will go on for some time. The events will undoubtedly weigh on the next quarter for companies. The question now is how much.\u201dSales of luxury goods in France reached $20.2 billion last year, according to research from Euromonitor International, with more than 50 percent of purchases made by tourists. Fflur Roberts, the head of luxury goods at the market research company Euromonitor, added that the decrease in Chinese travelers in particular, already dropping since Beijing\u2019s decision to lower the value of the renminbi this summer, would have a considerable impact.Meanwhile, Michel Jauslin, general manager of the Palace Hotel Park Hyatt Paris-Vend\u00f4me and Park Hyatt\u2019s vice president for France, confirmed that bookings had taken a sizable hit as visitors stay away because of fears of further attacks.\u201cNaturally, occupancy is drastically decreasing in the wake of the attacks,\u201d he said last week, having noted earlier this year that the Charlie Hebdo shootings in January also had an \u201cenormous impact\u201d on the first few months of the year.\u201cWe noticed a lot of cancellations right after the attacks for the following days and weeks, with the decrease more significant on bookings from the leisure traveler segment than the business one,\u201d Mr. Jauslin said.The situation is not dissimilar to the aftermath of previous attacks. Travel dropped drastically after the London bombings in 2005 and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, prompting companies and governments to encourage shoppers to continue going about their daily lives. \u201cI ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy,\u201d President George W. Bush said in a televised address in September 2001. Though executives at many luxury companies have avoided making public comments in the current climate, with many declining to be interviewed for fear of appearing insensitive, statements from some have echoed the president\u2019s sentiments 14 years later.\u201cOnce again Paris suffered from a terrorist attack with a scale and horror unprecedented in France,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of Kering.\u201cThis attack is an attack against our way of life, against our values, against liberty and against humanity,\u201d he added. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the most appropriate attitude is to continue living normally, by showing courage, solidarity and vigilance.\u201dSome shoppers appeared to be listening. At the corner of the Place Vend\u00f4me and the Rue St. Honor\u00e9, Betty Hyatt of San Diego, along with her husband, daughter and granddaughter, said she did not regret their decision to come to Paris. \u201cWhen we learned about the attacks, we did not think twice about canceling our trip,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are feeling very safe and having a great time in the capital.\u201dBut Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a senior partner at Bain based in Milan, said caution was likely to define shoppers\u2019 spending in coming months, with the effect from Paris being felt in other European shopping cities such as London, Rome and Milan.\u201cThe negative impact is likely to be major as these kinds of levels of mass violence and geopolitical unpredictably do not create a positive emotional and psychological background that make people inclined to shop,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople tend to stay home, particularly as they don\u2019t feel safe in crowded locations, including shopping streets or malls that are seen as high-risk targets for further attacks.\u201dShe also suggested that there could be positive effects, including sales increases in e-commerce or local consumption by travelers from farther afield, particularly China.In the long term, luxury buyers will return to Paris, Ms. D\u2019Arpizio predicted, as the city is always going to be a popular destination and be associated with luxury, with the heritage of many high-end brands deeply rooted in the French capital and its way of life.\u201cBut the key now for brands will be trying to stay close to their customers and maintain a sense of close personal relationships,\u201d she said.\u201cHistorically we\u2019ve seen own-brand stores perform better than wholesalers in uncertain climates, with clients drawn to what they know,\u201d she added. \u201cCompanies that preserve those bonds will be the ones most likely to weather the storms of the coming months ahead.\u201dJulie Carriat contributed reporting in Paris.Advertisement"}

And in proportional voting for parties, the opposition coalition crushed the United Socialist Party that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez founded.\u201cThese guys ruined everything that Ch\u00e1vez left behind,\u201d said Pablo Rodr\u00edguez, 37, who sells soccer jerseys across the street from the stadium that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez built, several blocks from a house where Mr. Ch\u00e1vez spent part of his childhood. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said he was a loyal Chavista until Dec. 6, when for the first time he cast his ballot for another party. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I voted for the opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cI voted against all of this that\u2019s going on. It\u2019s like the president said, it was a slap in the face. He understood that much.\u201dA customer buying a baby-size soccer shirt and shorts said that he, too, had voted against the government for the first time. But the customer, Ronald Rivero, 26, said angry voters wanted to see results from the opposition-controlled National Assembly.\u201cNow these guys have to go to work, and if they don\u2019t deliver, we\u2019ll vote them out, too,\u201d Mr. Rivero said.Similar sentiments are being heard around the continent, where political dynasties are falling or under intense pressure and where protests and social unrest are on the rise.In Ecuador, protesters angry at President Rafael Correa have taken to the streets to demonstrate against budget cutbacks necessitated by vanishing oil revenue.\u201cWe said, \u2018Enough,\u2019 \u201d said Mariela Baiguera, 42, a store clerk in Buenos Aires who said she had broken with her usual Peronist affiliation to vote for Mr. Macri because she was tired of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s combative style. But she was also wary of Mr. Macri. \u201cHe has no room to abandon his promises,\u201d she said, vowing to vote against him in the next election if he did so.The strains are being felt most keenly by leftist governments, but analysts say that something other than ideology is at work here. South America saw robust growth in the century\u2019s first decade, thanks to a historic boom in the value of raw materials and other commodities that are sold to the rest of the world.High prices for oil, natural gas, coal, copper, gold, silver, bauxite, soy beans and other products led to steady growth, a sharp drop in poverty and an expansion of the middle class throughout the region. That growth, in turn, brought political stability, with leaders and parties being repeatedly re-elected. Many of those were on the left, having come to office on a wave of public discontent following a lengthy period of economic stagnation.Venezuela has had 17 years of Chavismo. The Workers\u2019 Party in Brazil has held the presidency for four straight terms. In Ecuador, Mr. Correa has been president since 2007. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales has been in office since 2006.But change is rolling across the region. The price of oil \u2014 vital to the economies of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador \u2014 has plunged to less than $40 a barrel from more than $100. The prices of copper (a key product in Peru and Chile) and soybeans (staples of Brazil and Argentina) have dropped to less than half of their recent peaks.\u201cPredictions of the left\u2019s demise in Latin America are exaggerated,\u201d Mr. Winter said.In Venezuela, the monetary fund estimates that inflation this year will be 159 percent and that the economy will contract by 10 percent, both figures the worst among the countries the organization measures worldwide. Many economists point to disastrous economic policies of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, including strict controls on prices and foreign exchange. But the government is hamstrung by the sudden drop in the price of oil, which accounts for nearly all of the country\u2019s export income.Many of the policies that Mr. Maduro has stuck with were inherited from Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who had benefited from the bonanza of oil money.Here in Barinas, the state capital, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez had, by many accounts, more misses than hits. The soccer stadium, though in use, remains incomplete \u2014 some parts of the roof were never finished. A cancer hospital sits unfinished, the work suspended for more than a year. A costly new sugar mill failed.And yet the steady flow of oil money helped obscure many errors and excesses. That is less of an option for Mr. Maduro, who has presided over a depletion of reserves that has the country\u2019s bondholders worrying about a possible default.\u201cCh\u00e1vez covered up problems with money,\u201d said Miguel Agu\u00edn, a Barinas policeman who became disillusioned with Chavismo years ago. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think about the future. He just gave out handouts to get through today.\u201dHis adherents often shrugged off Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s failings during the boom years, but the elections last week showed that in lean times they are less forgiving.While the election result was a direct response to the economic crisis, the future of politics here and elsewhere in the region may have taken on a different tone as new members of the middle class seek to hold onto their gains and make new demands of their leaders.And as some families fall back into poverty, protests and unrest will grow.\u201cExpectations have increased not only in the middle class but in all levels of society in Venezuela and across the region,\u201d said Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a pollster in Caracas. \u201cIt\u2019s a generational change. Millennials are a digital generation, better informed and better connected, even in the lower classes. They are more demanding.\u201dIn Barinas, Freddy Garc\u00e9s, 50, a farmhand who takes care of a herd of skinny cattle in a formerly rock-solid Chavista hamlet called El Corozo, said he hoped the victorious opposition lawmakers could quickly produce economic improvements.\u201cIf they don\u2019t deliver,\u201d he said, \u201cthen the people are going to pay them with the same coin they paid these guys.\u201dReporting was contributed by Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro; Patricia Torres from Barinas; Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz from Caracas, Venezuela; and Jonathan Gilbert from Buenos Aires.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What \u2018The Big Short\u2019 Gets Right, and Wrong, About the Housing Bubble", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFiscal MeltdownIt is the strongest film explanation of the global financial crisis.Spoiler alert: In the end, the global economy collapses.\u201cThe Big Short\u201d makes a big deal of its protagonists realizing that there was a giant housing bubble in the middle of the last decade at a time no one else could see it. But that\u2019s not quite right. When no-money-down home loans were commonplace and home prices were soaring, there was widespread discussion of the possibility that the United States was experiencing a housing bubble.It\u2019s true that plenty of those articles quoted economists and real estate industry representatives arguing there was no bubble and nothing to fear, but there are also clips discussing the possibility it could end with tears.So plenty of people were at least discussing the possibility of a dangerous bubble. But there\u2019s a big difference between identifying at the macro level that something is going on, and understanding the financial plumbing that would allow a person to profit from that insight.What the characters portrayed in \u201cThe Big Short\u201d figured out that people writing housing bubble stories didn\u2019t was how the rot from bad mortgage loans that helped fuel the housing bubble had come to permeate supposedly safe securities. There were billions of dollars of highly rated bonds floating around that were in fact worthless, or at least worth far less than advertised.The key transmission mechanism that turned a simple correction in the housing market into a global financial crisis were those bonds. Global banks had loaded up on these supposedly safe securities, and were at risk of becoming insolvent when their true value became known. Some banks blew up; others were bailed out. Either way the global credit system froze.The movie captures this well, as the characters face a crisis of confidence when foreclosures begin to rise and their big bets against mortgage-backed securities aren\u2019t yet paying off. (\u201cI may have been early, but I\u2019m not wrong,\u201d says one character, the hedge fund manager Michael Burry as portrayed by Christian Bale. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing,\u201d a skeptical investor retorts.)Indeed, the movie has a glancing reference to how hard it is to translate the basic insight about mortgage securities into profits. We hear of a Morgan Stanley trader who had the insight that B-rated mortgage securities were at major risk, but believed that AA-rated securities would be fine, and so offset his bet against the former with a bet for the latter. It cost the firm billions.One simple lesson of this is kind of obvious: It is hard to make a boatload of money trading financial assets, even if you are brilliant. But there\u2019s a broader one, which explains why most everyone, including regulators (and journalists), was caught by surprise by the ferocity of the financial crisis.A lot of people thought a decade ago that there might be a housing bubble. Few of them understood the connections between housing prices and poor lending practices; the connection from poor lending practices to complex, highly rated securities; the connection between those securities to the balance sheets of major banks; and the peril to the economy if just a few of them faltered.At each link in that chain, there were people aware that something was wrong, but who lacked the ability to put those pieces together and connect bad lending in Florida suburbs with the existential risk being taken by companies like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.The impossible job for the regulators (and journalists, and credit rating agencies) of the future is to better understand how the pieces within the infinitely complex economy and financial system connect with one another.\u201cThe Big Short\u201d is a powerful reminder of how hard that will be.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anger at South Africa\u2019s Leader", "Date": "2015-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThis month, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa did the sort of thing that has become common in his administration: He abruptly fired a respected finance minister who had tried to put the brakes on irresponsible government spending and put in an obscure political hack. To Mr. Zuma\u2019s surprise, South Africans erupted in anger this time, compelling the president to yank his new appointee in favor of a trusted former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan. But that failed to calm the waters, and it should not. Mr. Zuma has done far too much damage to his country to be let off the hook.The African National Congress knows this is not the sort of governance South Africa longed for when the immoral system of apartheid was finally ended in 1994. At the outset of the new era, Nelson Mandela led South Africans to a flowering of democracy and tolerance. But as the A.N.C. became entrenched, winning five successive national elections, corruption and cronyism inevitably spread their tentacles, often under the pretext of setting aright the injustices of apartheid.The slide has been egregious under Mr. Zuma in the two years since Mr. Mandela died. He has routinely put cronies and relatives into senior positions, degrading public institutions; he has done nothing to contain the spread of corruption; he has recklessly enlarged the public work force, which consumes about 40 percent of the budget; he spent millions of dollars of public money to build himself a fabulous estate.What made the finance minister\u2019s firing so intolerable was the erosion of South Africa\u2019s economy, largely because of a collapse of commodity prices. Growth has plummeted, unemployment has soared, and the rand has lost nearly 50 percent of its value against the dollar since 2010.Mr. Zuma refused to recognize the economic realities and became angry when the finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, put the brakes on spending. Mr. Nene\u2019s exit intensified doubts among investors and credit rating agencies.There is little chance that Mr. Zuma\u2019s retreat on the Finance Ministry marks a serious conversion. Fortunately, many South African institutions, most notably the courts, have not been suborned by Mr. Zuma or his cronies, providing a foundation on which to rebuild an honest and competent government. For that to happen, the A.N.C. must examine itself and the ravages of more than 20 years of continuous power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Confidently Embraces Bill Clinton\u2019s Economic Record", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe recalled one of his favorite refrains as a candidate \u2014 \u201cIf you want to live like a Republican, vote like a Democrat\u201d \u2014 and suggested Mrs. Clinton find a snappy line of her own, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversation.She did. \u201cThe economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in her opening statement in the Oct. 13 debate.And that pithy argument has since become the core of her economic message. Leaning heavily on her husband\u2019s record of lifting wages and creating jobs, Mrs. Clinton is at the same time castigating Republicans for embracing policies that she says led to the economic downturns that Mr. Clinton and President Obama inherited.Mr. Clinton has expressed regret for approving the Defense of Marriage Act, the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that barred gays and lesbians from serving in the military, and the 1994 crime bill, which led to an increase in police officers and tougher sentencing for minor drug offenses.Her recent and repeated embrace of her husband\u2019s economic successes \u2014 the sort of message she would be likely to take to general election audiences \u2014 speaks to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s growing confidence in her position in the Democratic primary.While Mr. Clinton presided over one of the healthiest economies in recent memory, his pro-business pragmatism and emphasis on open markets are somewhat out of sync with a restless Democratic primary electorate worried about growing income inequality and wary of new trade deals.For months, it appeared that Mrs. Clinton, fighting to secure the support of labor unions and contending with Mr. Sanders and a potential run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., had staked out positions to the left of Mr. Clinton.The former president, for example, signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement; in October, Mrs. Clinton withdrew her support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that Mr. Obama has championed and that she supported at the State Department.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Mrs. Clinton has also pledged to do more to regulate Wall Street; her husband oversaw a period of deregulation that critics say played a role in causing the 2008 financial crises.More recently, Mrs. Clinton has proudly and frequently declared that she comes from \u201cthe Clinton school of economics.\u201d\u201cTalking about the Clinton economy, evoking the success of Bill Clinton\u2019s economy, she is positioning herself as a growth Democrat,\u201d said Jon Cowan, a former Clinton administration official who now heads the centrist think tank Third Way.\u201cI helped lead the effort as a member of the House financial committee against Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton \u2014 maybe you know him, maybe you don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Sanders said tartly in Saturday\u2019s debate.And Mr. O\u2019Malley has invoked both Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street veteran, and Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Rubin\u2019s successor as Treasury secretary under Mr. Clinton, as the sort of people he would not consult for economic advice.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers say any criticism of Mr. Clinton on economic issues is revisionist history, and cite powerful statistics: 7.7 million people lifted out of poverty, 22.7 million jobs created, a budget balanced.\u201cThe only time every segment of society, from the lowest quintile to the middle through the top, saw their wages growing,\u201d said John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, who was a White House chief of staff to Mr. Clinton.During the 2008 Democratic primary campaign, Mrs. Clinton leaned heavily on the economic successes of her husband\u2019s administration. (\u201cI always wonder what part of the 1990s they didn\u2019t like,\u201d she would say about political rivals, \u201cthe peace or the prosperity?\u201d)But this time, advisers say the strategy is twofold: Mrs. Clinton can bask in her husband\u2019s economic accomplishments while trying to connect Republican policies to the 2008 financial crises that confronted Mr. Obama. \u201cThe point is, Republicans go in and screw it up,\u201d said Joel Benenson, the Clinton campaign\u2019s chief strategist and pollster.Mrs. Clinton often gives voters a quick history lesson covering the last 35 years.\u201cWe\u2019ve had five presidents, three Republicans and two Democrats,\u201d she said at a campaign event in Urbandale, Iowa, this month. \u201cI know both of the Democrats,\u201d she added, sparking laughter. \u201cI know they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessor.\u201dShe often tells of Mr. Clinton\u2019s being asked, shortly after his first inauguration, what he uniquely brought to Washington. \u201cHe thought to himself for a minute and said, \u2018Probably arithmetic,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said.At the same time, Mrs. Clinton reminds voters that she is not running for anyone\u2019s third term. \u201cIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s saying she\u2019s going to do everything Bill Clinton did,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and policy director of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cThe point is there is a broad approach, and that broad approach is very different from Republicans\u2019.\u201dIn Saturday\u2019s debate, when asked what her husband\u2019s role would be in a Hillary Clinton White House, Mrs. Clinton made it clear that she had given the matter some thought.\u201cI am probably still going to pick the flowers and china for state dinners and stuff like that, but I will certainly turn to him\u201d to provide advice, she said, on \u201chow we\u2019re going to get the economy working for everybody, which he knows a little about.\u201dAnd he does not mind saying so.Mr. Clinton will have the chance to remind voters about the robust economy he oversaw when he returns to New Hampshire next month to campaign for his wife.It is a message he plainly enjoys delivering. \u201cLet me remind you, we had one time in 50 years when we all grew together,\u201d he said at a rally in Des Moines in October, waving a long finger at the crowd. \u201cWhen I had the honor of serving as your president.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are spurring a great leap forward in the use of electronic transactions, which could make it much harder for corruption to flourish. Many say the government should act quickly with added incentives \u2014 like tax breaks linked to the use of the cards \u2014 to take advantage of the moment.\u201cOnce you get a lot of people with a lot of cards, it becomes a snowball effect,\u201d said Nikos Vettas, an economist at Athens University and one of the authors of a recent report on the subject, which estimated that under various scenarios Greece could see billions more in tax revenues. \u201cThere is a chance here to really do something.\u201dGreece has long been awash in cash, a state of affairs that has facilitated the country\u2019s huge shadow economy, estimated at 20 to 25 percent of its G.N.P. with as much as $12 billion in tax revenues being lost, according to Costas Bakouris, the chairman of the Greek chapter of the anticorruption organization, Transparency International.But since July, Greeks, unable to get their hands on large amounts of cash, have been forced to use the cards they had tucked in the back of their wallets. At the same time, banks have issued more than 1.2 million new debit and credit cards, many to older people who had never used them before, but who suddenly found themselves unable to get to any of their money when only the country\u2019s automated teller machines were functioning last July.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The use of cards does not come easy for many Greeks, who still favor bankbooks to keep track of their accounts and who are used to standing in line each week for face-to-face encounters with tellers.Critics say the government has in some ways encouraged such behavior. Many Greeks pay their taxes in cash. And even quasi-government agencies, like the water and electricity company, will take only cash if customers pay their bills in local offices. Tourists often notice the country\u2019s attachment to cash when they visit its many museums, only one of which, the Acropolis Museum, accepts cards.Even with the capital controls, many Greeks say they would rather not use plastic money.\u201cIf you have 10 euros in your pocket, you know what\u2019s what,\u201d said Nick Pavlakis, 38, who works for a windshield replacement company. \u201cWith the cards you only see what you did at the end of the month.\u201dBut the events of the last few months, experts say, have given Greece a unique opportunity to change all that and cut into the country\u2019s shadow economy.In a recent report for the Athens-based Foundation for Economic & Industrial Research, a public policy institute, Mr. Vettas points to South Korea as an example of a country that helped reduce its shadow economy with various incentives to use electronic transactions, including offering tax deductions to those who could produce credit or debit card receipts for a certain amount.Other steps could help, too. Government officials say they are considering a broad package of measures that would include making it mandatory for new businesses to accept cards.Tryfon Alexiadis, a deputy finance minister responsible for Greek tax revenues, said that an increase in the use of cards would bring several benefits, including getting taxes into government coffers much faster.\u201cPlastic money should have been done years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the right things happen and we organize correctly, the results could be impressive.\u201dBut Ms. Tzakou-Lambropoulou, too, says the government must act quickly. \u201cIf there is no action, the mentality of cash could just slip back,\u201d she said.Before the crisis fewer than 150,000 businesses even had the terminals necessary to process card transactions. But with more and more Greeks needing to use cards because they have no other way of getting to their money, banking officials are optimistic that this will change fast.Still, some experts are skeptical that it will have a broad effect on the black market, even suggesting that electronic transactions could heighten the level of corruption. Francesco Pappad\u00e1, a research economist at Banque de France who has recently studied the issue of tax evasion in Greece, points out that knowing more about the tax base will only be helpful if tax enforcement also improves.If the tax authorities are corrupt, the information may only allow dishonest tax collectors to put more pressure on the taxpayer to pay higher bribes.\u201cFor sure the more cash you have around the better for the black economy, \u201c Mr. Pappad\u00e1 said, \u201cbut getting people to use cards alone is not enough.\u201dAs Greece continues to put in place the harsh round of austerity measures it agreed to this summer to get yet a third bailout, workers have reacted angrily, prompting a new round of general strikes, including one on Thursday. Organized by two major unions, workers are objecting to overhauls that will translate into severe pension cuts and increases in retirement age.At the Athens meat and fish market, many customers said that they had gotten a debit card in the last few months. But many said they had done so only as a security measure in case the banks closed again. They still did their errands with cash, out of habit if nothing else.One retiree said his wife had made him get a card, though when she moved away to get a closer look at some lamb chops he added that he considered the cards \u201cevil.\u201d Behind such thinking, experts say, is a profound distrust of authority and the fear of having one\u2019s purchases recorded.Vassilis Korkidis, the head of Confederation of Commerce and Entrepreneurship, said such distrust was not hard to understand, as Greeks in the last few years had been subjected to a tax code that changed every two or three months, at times introducing retroactive or inconsistent measures. For instance, Mr. Korkidis said Greeks were asked in 2015 to pay extra taxes for 2013.Mr. Vettas agreed, saying that in 2009 the government gave incentives to Greeks to buy new cars, prompting some to take advantage of the tax break and buy big cars. Two years later, the government increased taxes for owners of big cars.\u201cPeople just believe that three years down the road the government is capable of coming back and saying let me see what you spent,\u201d Mr. Vettas said. \u201cThe politicians don\u2019t see how important it is to establish trust with the people.\u201dPavlos Zafiropoulos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Do I need to finish the sentence?The Korona had a fast-enough shutter and a sensitive-enough plate to capture rapid movement in a frame. Daniels, a first-time photographer, was following, whether he knew it or not, in the footsteps of Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Tournachon, known to his public and to posterity as Nadar, the French artist and entrepreneur who had the brilliant idea, a half-century before the miracle at Kitty Hawk, of going up in a hot-air balloon with a camera. Our vision of the world \u2014 quite literally, our sense that the surface of this planet can be flown over and surveyed from above \u2014 owes as much to Nadar as our ability to circumnavigate it owes to Orville and Wilbur Wright.Nadar died in 1910, having anticipated and then lived to witness the birth of motion pictures, which custom has fixed in 1895. The Wright Flyer arrived on the scene early in the new century, in time to give the nascent art of movies (invented in America by Thomas Edison) one of its great subjects. And for more than a century since, the visions of cinema and the experience of flight have worked together in ways both obvious and mysterious. Movie cameras and airplanes are the twin manifestations of ancient human desires that dwelled, for most of our existence as a species, in myth and fantasy. Our ancestors made likenesses of everything under the sun in various media, to bridge the strange chasm between thing and idea. They conjured legends of bird-gods and parables in which the urge to take wing was a symbol of aspiration and of hubris.What if we could counterfeit reality so completely that the representation would partake of the essence of the original, closing the gap between the world and our imagination of it? What if we could fly? The two dreams link up almost effortlessly, and the technologies of their realization complement each other. The first movie to win a Best Picture Oscar was \u2018\u2018Wings.\u2019\u2019 The most recent was \u2018\u2018Birdman.\u2019\u2019 The camera has learned not only to record flight but also to replicate its rhythms and feelings \u2014 to swoop and soar, to blast off and fall to earth, to hover over rooftops and leap tall buildings in a single bound.When a dream comes true, though, it touches down amid the dross of ordinary life. Moving pictures and flying machines became less marvelous as they became ubiquitous. We take them for granted, and have even come to resent them.The camerawork is similarly primitive and ingenious. No fast cuts, no dollies or cranes to mimic and counterpoint the movement of the objects within the frame. The little window in your laptop screen opens on a charmingly and almost absurdly simpler time, a collection of antique moments that is also a foreshadowing of the present.Did you see \u2018\u2018Furious 7\u2019\u2019? Not technically a flight picture, but an automotive movie that extends the highway into the clouds. Do you remember when the cars parachuted out of the belly of the transport plane and hit the mountain running at full speed? Or when the red sports coupe \u2014 was Vin Diesel driving? Michelle Rodriguez? \u2014 went zooming around inside the big glass tower in Abu Dhabi and then smashed through the window and sailed over to the other tower and kept going? Oh, man! Pure adrenaline. And pure slapstick sublimity. How did they do that? How did they even think of it?The fun, however, has always cast a shadow. The \u2018\u2018Furious 7\u2019\u2019 skyscraper sequence, thrilling though it is, can\u2019t help evoking the Sept. 11 attacks. An instant clich\u00e9 after the planes hit the twin towers was \u2018\u2018It was like something out of a movie.\u2019\u2019 In the years since, movies have fought to reclaim the imagination of disaster as their special purview and to restore the innocent anarchy of impact, velocity and flight. We want the thrill without the danger. But the danger is there, alongside the liberation. These machines \u2014 airplanes and movie cameras \u2014 bring terror along with wonder.\u2018\u2018Le Voyage Dans la Lune,\u2019\u2019 1902It was Hollywood that would develop a practical aesthetic link between film and aviation, most famously in \u2018\u2018Wings,\u2019\u2019 the inaugural Oscar winner (in 1929) and a blockbuster of the pre-talkie era. An elaborate and expensive production, filmed on location around a San Antonio military base and directed by William Wellman, a decorated former fighter pilot, \u2018\u2018Wings\u2019\u2019 was perhaps more admired for its technical innovation than for its rather conventional story. In that regard, it was an early example of what has become a sturdy Hollywood genre: the effects-driven blockbuster.For decades, aviation pictures like \u2018\u2018Wings,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Devil Dogs of the Air\u2019\u2019 and, for the less military-minded, John Ford\u2019s \u2018\u2018Air Mail,\u2019\u2019 were Hollywood staples. The genre fed off the public\u2019s interest in the real-life exploits of Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart and other celebrity pilots. When the United States entered World War II, the military commissioned Ford and other prominent directors \u2014 notably Frank Capra, William Wyler, George Stevens and John Huston \u2014 to bring carefully packaged images of the fighting into American movie theaters. In \u2018\u2018Five Came Back,\u2019\u2019 his detailed chronicle of these five wartime auteurs, the journalist Mark Harris notes that before long, \u2018\u2018generic sops to patriotism and adroit use of newsreel footage were no longer enough to stir a jaded public or to make a war documentary worth showing in theaters. Moviegoers didn\u2019t want the story behind the war \u2014 they wanted the war, brought home in pictures they couldn\u2019t see anywhere else.\u2019\u2019To this end, Wyler and his crew embedded (as we might now say) with the 91st Bomb Group. They took their 16-millimeter cameras on bombing runs, in Harris\u2019s words \u2018\u2018lying flat along the belly of the B-17 so they could shoot footage through the ball turret, the position on the plane\u2019s underside that allowed a gunner to fire in all directions.\u2019\u2019 Wyler, who won his first Oscar for \u2018\u2018Mrs. Miniver\u2019\u2019 while overseas, would later be awarded an Air Medal for participating in five sorties and suffer severe damage to his hearing on a subsequent assignment in Italy. The results of his time with the 91st Bomb Group were assembled into a short documen\u00adtary called \u2018\u2018Memphis Belle\u2019\u2019 (1944), which James Agee praised for its immediacy.\u2018\u2018I could not guess which shots were re-enacted and which were straight records,\u2019\u2019 Agee confessed, and postwar movies would often aspire to induce precisely this confusion. Agee had an ethical commitment to documentary, and a temperamental suspicion of artifice, and during the war his insistence on the literal, visceral truth reflected the biases of the filmmakers themselves, who often battled Army censors over how much unvarnished reality they could show. But the line between truth and trickery is not always so clear. When the fighting stopped, filmmakers used some of the documentary techniques tested in combat to blur it in new ways, in the service of sensation rather than home-front morale.Nowadays, we\u2019ve turned Agee\u2019s moral puzzlement into a formalist game. The famous \u2018\u2018Ride of the Valkyries\u2019\u2019 sequence in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u2018\u2018Apocalypse Now\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the helicopter assault, led by Robert Duvall\u2019s sociopathic Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, on a Vietnamese hamlet \u2014 partakes of some of the immediacy of documentary. Those are actual helicopters in literal space, and the flames are real, too. And so was Coppola\u2019s war, even if the film is a pure fantasia rather than a factual record. The X-wing fighter attack on the Death Star in the movie we now call \u2018\u2018Star Wars: Episode IV \u2014 A New Hope\u2019\u2019 has its own sense of reality, even if it\u2019s all taking place in a long-ago-and-far-away zone of make-believe.Which might mean that we have arrived in a version of the Futurists\u2019 Utopia, a world defined by violence and speed, ubiquitous flying machines and nonstop moving pictures. We can take to the air on the backs of mythical birds or with the assistance of bulky metal suits (like Iron Man) or extraterrestrial super powers (like Superman). We can fling imaginary bodies into virtual space with a few swipes and keystrokes. Our machines are so refined they don\u2019t even seem like machines anymore.11 PhotosWe inhabit a time of first-person video games and drone warfare, in which the distance between the cockpit and the screen has all but collapsed, and physical space seems more and more abstract. We can\u2019t tell if we\u2019re rocketing through the ether or sitting perfectly still.Air travel is nothing special. Quite the opposite: It is the realm in which the petty indignities and dubious conveniences of modern life are most heavily concentrated. For the price of an economy ticket, we can endure the rote dumbness of state authority (\u2018\u2018Place your shoes directly on the belt\u2019\u2019) and the false friendliness of corporate power. So many choices to fill the dead time \u2014 Panda Express; Starbucks; Brookstone \u2014 none of them quite what we want. Including the choices for in-flight viewing on the headrest in front of us.All too often, our practices of moviegoing and -watching are similarly alienated. We shuffle into identical, charmless multiplexes in suburban malls or chain-store-clogged downtowns, grumble at the rudeness of our neighbors who text or talk or kick the back of our seat, eat snacks we don\u2019t really like and fidget through the trailers as we wait for the feature. At home we have the illusion of more control, more choice and better snacks, but we end up frittering away hours browsing the various menus and queues before settling down to the same old thing.There\u2019s an old song that says we\u2019ll know we\u2019ve seen it all when elephants fly. Which we have, in \u2018\u2018Dumbo,\u2019\u2019 the movie that wrote the last word on cinematic flight way back in 1941, the time of Pearl Harbor and the Blitz, maybe the darkest year in the short history of actual human flight. \u2018\u2018When I See an Elephant Fly\u2019\u2019 is the theme song, a jaunty revolt against the idea that anything is impossible, and \u2018\u2018Dumbo\u2019\u2019 is one of Disney\u2019s early feature-length parables of gumption and tenacity.It\u2019s hard to imagine a more earthbound creature than an elephant with big, floppy ears. But as Disney and other cartoon artists discovered, the charm of animation lies in its complete defiance of the laws of physics. You do not need to rig a crane, attach a camera to a glider or hunker down in the ball turret of a flying fortress. With a steady hand and a trained eye \u2014 with a labor force of draftsmen and colorists and cel cutters \u2014 you can reverse gravity and make your audience feel the giddiness and grace of unassisted flight.\u2018\u2018Dumbo\u2019\u2019 is a cartoon, but it is also an aviation picture, a fantasy that models the movement of organic creatures on the flight of machines, rather than the reverse. Dumbo is a flyboy, but he\u2019s also a plane, requiring the help of Timothy Q. Mouse for navigation and \u2018\u2018Contact!\u2019\u2019 His first sortie is accompanied by crows flying in V-formation, more like a fighter squadron than an avian flock. (They also embody Disney\u2019s unfortunate fondness for racist stereotypes.) The elephant takes off in a cloud of dust, and the first thing he sees when it clears is his shadow moving across the land below, an uncanny sight familiar to every jet traveler lucky enough to score a window seat on a clear day. Dumbo\u2019s climactic, triumphant flight, under the big top at the circus, is a barnstorming tour de force of the kind that brought crowds to the fairgrounds in the \u201920s and \u201930s, and the theme music is accompanied not by animal noises but by airplanelike buzzing and zooming. A potentially terrifying spectacle turns into a circus act.It\u2019s this whimsy, this absurdity, this absolute indifference to the dictates of biology, gravity and cinematic coherence \u2014 even a child will notice that the proportions are seriously out of whack \u2014 that make \u2018\u2018Dumbo\u2019\u2019 the greatest of all in-flight movies. It establishes an essential truth that can be perpetually redefined and rediscovered. The whole idea of flight is crazy. We are earthbound creatures, gray and lumbering and cursed with long memories. We harbor dreams of liberation, of transcendence, but who are we kidding? We can\u2019t fly.And yet we do.An article on Dec. 13 about the history of flying in cinema misstated the rank of the character Robert Duvall plays in \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d The Character is Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore, not Lt. Bill Kilgore.A. O. Scott is a chief film critic for The Times.

{"Headline": "Water as a Climate-Change Gut Punch in a City Defined by an Ocean", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMiami JournalMIAMI \u2014 The ordinary man settled into his ordinary ritual.He lay down at the bottom of the empty, cubelike aquarium with his fluffed-up pillow, crawled under his sheet and shut his eyes. But he was roused abruptly by a stream of water, and in less than a minute he was a man whose day had turned topsy-turvy: He floated and twisted, rose and sank, fought and surrendered. Then, just as suddenly, the water level dropped, only to rise and fall again for the next 45 minutes while spectators sat mesmerized.But today Miami and particularly ritzy Miami Beach across the causeway are more vulnerable to sea level rise than almost any other place in the country, and now the bill has come due. Roads must be raised, water pumps updated, homes built high off the ground, sewage plants safeguarded, and estuaries and the Everglades protected from encroaching saltwater. And no one knows if that will ever be enough.\u201cI know how exposed Miami is, and Florida,\u201d said Mr. Jan, 37, who developed the concept for his installation after seeing the damage wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and stumbling across a particularly vivid photograph of a major flood in Pakistan. \u201cIt was classically beautiful, but it depicted a horrific situation. It opened a door that I walked through, and I kept walking.\u201dMr. Jan, who lives in Los Angeles and is half-Afghan, half-Polish, immersed himself in research on floods and climate change. In time, his visualization of rising seas in mundane situations led him to the human aquarium, where the idea plays out in eight scenes. They depict everyday life jumbled by the rise and fall of water and arrived via video submissions from the public.Inside the aquarium rising from the middle of a well-trafficked plaza, there is a man tuning a guitar. A woman putting on and taking off an abaya, the overgarment worn by Muslim women. A couple engaged in a duet. There is hose guy \u2014 a man in sneakers and jeans who begins to coil and uncoil a garden hose (a frustrating task even on land). The aquarium fills and empties unpredictably, over and over. The hose wafts from his clutch, and as it does he tumbles into fits of pique, resignation, futility and determination. Later, a fruit seller in Indian finery sits in the empty tank with her basket of persimmons. As the water rises, the persimmons float away. Sometimes frantically, sometimes placidly, she gathers them once again.The project, Mr. Jan said, is as much about the ability to adapt as the ability to fight back. And while it was serendipitous that world leaders gathered this week to discuss climate change, Mr. Jan said he was hoping to reach people in a way that eschewed statistics and scientific treatises.\u201cThe conversation needs to happen on the street,\u201d he said.Pulling off the project took imagination as well: calibrating the hydraulic rise and fall of water; allaying the fears of sponsors who worried about performers drowning (they can breathe at the surface); training performers to hold their breath for extended periods (sometimes more than three minutes); designing costumes that are waterproof yet billowy (the bedtime sheet is actually a shower curtain).\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that in all of these situations you feel yourself adapt,\u201d said Geoff Sobelle, 40, the choreographer and performer who coils the hose, describing life in the tank. \u201cThere is a sense of surrendering.\u201dFor Jannet Dannon-Mairena, 45, watching \u201cHoloscenes\u201d with her three home-schooled children, an element of fear courses through the water scenes. A Miami resident, she joked that she was already building her boat in her backyard, just in case. But she said the scenes also depict a loss of control, which is really where the fear is rooted.\u201cThey are struggling to do all the things they used to but, with all the changes, now they can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThe water coming up and down, it\u2019s like the points in your life when you think, now I have it under control, and you don\u2019t.\u201dRoseanne Friedlander, 62, a retired airline employee, could not resist making a political quip as she watched the performance. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that with all the water rising around Florida, our governor doesn\u2019t want us to mention climate change,\u201d she said.Ms. Friedlander was referring to reports this year from former state environmental protection employees who said that Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration had unofficially banned the term \u201cclimate change.\u201d Mr. Scott has said no such policy exists.Yet, there is no question the topic remains contentious. Climate change, and its proposed solutions, is equally unpopular among Republican presidential candidates, who express skepticism about the science and a reluctance to act in ways they say could hurt the economy.Watching the man in the tank struggle with the hose, Ms. Friedlander concluded that he was not adapting very well. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight water,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated Lars Jan\u2019s ethnic background. He is half Afghan and half Polish, not half Pakistani and half Polish.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When White Diamonds Won\u2019t Cut It", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersIF there is a holiday gift almost guaranteed to make a recipient swoon with joy, it is a diamond. But while such stones remain appealing as jewelry, the value of certain colored diamonds has increased while traditional white diamonds have fallen.Diamond dealers are talking about pink, blue and red diamonds as investments, citing a recent track record of double-digit returns. This new interest in such rare gemstones can make a holiday gift 10 to 20 times more expensive than a similar, high-quality white diamond. Yet there are others in the trade who question whether these stones will pay the dividends people imagine in the Christmases to come.\u201cFancy colored diamonds are the flavor of the year \u2014 they\u2019re hot, they\u2019re sexy, they\u2019re great,\u201d said Martin Rapaport, chairman of the Rapaport Group, which is considered a primary source of diamond pricing information.\u201cIf someone said, \u2018I want to buy something great for my wife,\u2019 I\u2019d say, great, buy fancy colored diamonds; you\u2019re a billionaire,\u201d he added. \u201cBut anyone who wants to invest in the flavor of the month shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dUnderstanding the lust for colored diamonds begins with understanding the broader forces pushing and pulling diamond prices.The white diamonds that adorn engagement rings and will dangle from ears and wrap around bracelets this holiday season have fallen in value over the last year. Prices for one-carat diamonds have dropped 7.15 percent as of Dec. 1, according to an index Mr. Rapaport developed.Mr. Rapaport said demand for white diamonds had dropped globally because of a slowing Chinese economy, currency devaluation in Russia and low oil prices in the Middle East. Yet on the supply side, the cost of rough, white diamonds has stayed high, which has hurt the rest of the diamond trade\u2019s ability to make a profit.During the same time, colored diamonds have surged in value. Buyers have sought them out for their beauty, extreme rarity and investment potential.The best-known pink diamonds, for example, are from the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. That mine, which supplies 90 to 95 percent of the world\u2019s pink diamonds, will be exhausted by 2020, and the scarcity has driven up prices.\u201cArgyle pink diamonds outperform any other,\u201d said Leibish Polnauer, president of Leibish & Company, a colored-diamond dealer. \u201cThey\u2019re less and less available and more and more in demand. Fifteen years ago we bought Argyle pink diamonds for $10,000 a carat. Today it\u2019s $150,000, $200,000, $250,000 a carat.\u201dDealers say wealthy buyers in volatile economies view rare, colored diamonds as a hedge against economic uncertainty. A diamond can also be a discreet way to put a tremendous amount of money into something smaller than an aspirin tablet.\u201cYou can buy a large house for $1 million, or about one-half of a carat of a red diamond,\u201d said Yaniv Marcus, founder of the Diamond Investment and Intelligence Center. \u201cA one-carat red diamond could be valued at $2.5 million.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about rarity,\u201d said Frank Everett, vice president and sales director in the jewelry department at Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cThe best ones stand out like a great piece of art.\u201dIn the last year, Sotheby\u2019s has sold two well-known blue diamonds for record-setting prices. A 9.75-carat blue diamond that belonged to the socialite Bunny Mellon sold in November 2014 for $32.6 million \u2014 or $3.3 million a carat. Last month, the auction house sold the 12-carat Blue Moon for $48.5 million \u2014 or just over $4 million a carat.Those prices far outstrip the 100-carat white diamond Sotheby\u2019s sold in April for $22 million \u2014 or $220,000 a carat.More broadly, a one-carat fancy pink diamond in a cushion cut is 11.50 times as expensive as a one-carat cushion-cut white diamond that has been judged to be internally flawless and carries the highest color rating, said Eden Rachminov, head of the advisory board of the Fancy Color Resource Foundation. A blue diamond is 20.8 times as expensive as a similar white diamond.But it is not so simple to jump into the trade just based on the soaring prices. Investors also need to understand the very different ways white and colored diamonds are judged.With white diamonds, it is the widely known measures of color, cut, clarity and carat weight that drive prices. But investing in white diamonds is a lot like picking quality stocks. There are established measures of quality, relatively transparent pricing, knowable transaction costs and liquidity, at least in smaller carat sizes.Mr. Rapaport views investments in white diamonds as a way to capitalize on the growth of the global middle class who will buy them as gifts and drive prices back up.In the world of colored diamonds, what determines value is more subjective. The range of prices for any given colored diamond can vary wildly, corresponding not only to the rarity of their colors but also to the vividness of the color itself. (The so-called chocolate diamonds that mall jewelers are advertising are not considered investments; until fairly recently, they were used for industrial purposes because they are so common.)\u201cIt\u2019s the strength of the color,\u201d said Jordan Fine, president of JFine Inc., a dealer that specializes in colored diamonds. \u201cA light yellow could be $3,000 a carat and a vivid yellow could be $15,000 a carat. A one-carat light pink could be $75,000 to $700,000 a carat for a vivid pink.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom how expensive and rare that little stone is.\u201d\u201cColored diamonds don\u2019t have a price list or somebody managing the value,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a true supply-and-demand free trade. It\u2019s like real estate. Its value is what someone will pay for it.\u201dMr. Rachminov said the prices of yellows have been stable, tending to track the stock market, but the pinks and blues have soared in value, which has made some industry experts like Mr. Rapaport skeptical. (Red diamonds are at the top but they are exceedingly rare.) \u201cThere\u2019s more interest from high-net-worth individuals, just like there\u2019s more demand for art and wine and luxury items in general,\u201d Mr. Rachminov said.Colored-diamond dealers talk of the stones as a store of value, and they have shown to be over decades. But they are not the easiest investments to sell.\u201cThe approach should be long term,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trading commodity first of all because of liquidity. The return is exponential over time.\u201dHe also divides colored diamonds into two categories: jewelry and investments. This is by quality but also by the color itself. He said there are not enough orange, green, violet, and purple diamonds to create the liquidity for an investment market. Therefore, most investors focus on blue, pink and red diamonds.Yet that line between jewelry and investment can get blurred. Sam, who owns a medical business in New Jersey but asked that his last name be withheld for security concerns, has amassed a collection of dozens of colored diamonds. He bought his first pink diamond in a ring as a gift for his wife in 2005. Then he bought a green diamond and realized that the stones could be used to finance his children\u2019s college education.\u201cI put some money into that green diamond and that started a collecting bug,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it became trying to find some of the best examples of different colors of vivid colored diamonds.\u201dMr. Fine, who sold Sam many of his stones, said some of his pink diamonds had doubled in value in 10 years. But Sam said he also was aware that his timing was right.In 2007, he bought a half-carat vivid pink diamond in the Argyle tender \u2014 an annual private auction of the best pink diamonds from the mine. But this year, he bid four times the price for a smaller pink diamond of lesser quality and lost.Still, as with any thing of beauty, it can be a lot harder to look rationally at sparkling colored diamonds than a list of company names in a securities portfolio.Sam said he had amassed a collection valued at $6 million of 41 colored diamonds in almost every different hue but can\u2019t bear to sell them. \u201cNow I keep them securely in a vault and I go down and look at them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of concentrated wealth in a thing of great beauty.\u201dThe Wealth Matters column on Saturday about the investment value of colored diamonds included a quotation from Yaniv Marcus, founder of the Diamond Investment and Intelligence Center, that misstated how much of a red diamond could be purchased for $1 million. About a half a carat of a red diamond, not 1/16 of an ounce, would cost that amount. The column also miscalculated the equivalent value of a 100-carat white diamond that recently sold at Sotheby\u2019s. The diamond sold for $22 million, or $220,000 a carat \u2014 not $2.2 million a carat.Advertisement"}

More important: That frog isn\u2019t so frail. The flourishing of debate and discussion about the art of humor, a distinguishing hallmark of the current comedy boom, actually represents a sign of artistic health.Nesteroff is a former stand-up comic whose arcana-rich Twitter account has made him a popular online presence. His sprawling and savvy book should burnish his reputation. It\u2019s a serious history without a trace of self-\u00adseriousness, comedy\u2019s answer to Luc Sante\u2019s \u201cLow Life.\u201dHis descriptions of legends are as blunt as backstage gossip; Ed Sullivan comes off as a dim jerk, and Jack Paar a virulent homophobe. His prose is often colloquial and punchy in a manner that matches the subject matter. \u201cDean Martin was a struggling crooner with a massive schnoz,\u201d begins a typical section.While he leans more on history than on criticism, Nesteroff does nicely evoke the distinct styles of long-ago comedians, often by making the most unlikely connections. He says the under-the-breath delivery of Bert Williams, the most famous black star of the 1920s, was like that of Jim Gaffigan, a popular, family-friendly star today.Nesteroff stuffs his chapters with obscure trivia and arguments that challenge common wisdom. Did you know that the Mafia, according to one source, was responsible for the term \u201cstand-up comic\u201d? Or that Buddy Hackett was known as the dirtiest comic in the business? Nesteroff punctures the myth that getting booked by Johnny Carson on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d would make your career; calls the Catskills scene overrated; and makes a persuasive case for the greatness of Shecky Greene, who has become shorthand for a kind of outdated Vegas style. His book also reveals his strange preferences, among them a rather cursory appreciation of the legacy of Steve Allen, the first host of \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d This is no traditional history, and Nesteroff\u2019s oddball passions can send him down some strange tangents, like a rather long consideration of whether Groucho Marx took LSD.The book\u2019s thematic obsessions reflect an unsentimental, raised-eyebrow sensibility. Nesteroff never misses a chance to point out how a comic stole jokes \u2014 you finish this book wondering if any great comic wasn\u2019t a thief \u2014 and the way he traces the influence of advertising and the fear of technology on the evolution of comedy is fascinating.But Nesteroff\u2019s real bias is toward the lost star and the overlooked gem. Instead of dedicating space to Joan Rivers and Phyllis Diller, he focuses on Jean Carroll, a female comic who predates them both. Everyone knows Don Rickles, but what about Jack E. Leonard, the insult comic Rickles supposedly stole his act from? Nesteroff not only reminds us of these artists but follows them to their often sad and lonely ends. Through his elegiac attention, these forgotten comedians become almost romantic figures, the stars of a secret history of laughter.Friedlander is best known for his role as the nerdy writer with a signature baseball cap on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d where he played a soft-spoken version of his longtime stand-up persona, a preposterously confident buffoon dispensing self-aggrandizing advice, political solutions and a bizarre brand of self-help. His nickname, often plastered on his shirt or cap, is World Champion.So it\u2019s something of a surprise to find this new work so whimsical, sly and modest. In rough illustrations that appear to have been dashed off on a bar napkin, he creates little cracked worlds with a simple image and a few words. These are silly jokes with a hint of the macabre, like the rabbit running across a field with the skeleton of a human foot for good luck around his neck. Another drawing reveals a man in a sink covered in plates, a fork stuck through his hand, with the caption: \u201cThen one night, the dishes did Jeffrey.\u201dIt offers a history of his career and his life from the perspective of a devoted but cleareyed daughter, but is most interesting as a character portrait.Carlin was a provocative radical onstage in several different eras (in the 1980s, I once saw him tell an abortion joke that made two rows of a crowd exit; he seemed pleased), but here he comes off as a loving family man sometimes conflicted about his own obsessive work ethic.Apart from the drugs and the fame, the Carlins\u2019 home life, full of domestic spats and money concerns, appears remarkably mundane. Kelly writes about the family dynamics unblinkingly, and while the book is clearly a deeply felt love letter to her dad, there are hints of the dark side of being raised by a celebrity truth-teller. When she sees her father praise her to Jay Leno, she writes: \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew for sure that he was so proud of me \u2014 because he said it on TV.\u201dO\u2019Rourke began this project at National Lampoon, the comedy magazine that became the farm team for the original \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d He was editor in chief during the Carter administration and, in the spirit of contrarianism, wrote about a political type he called the \u201cpants-down Republican\u201d (later rebranded as the \u201cRepublican Party Reptile\u201d) who \u201clook like Republicans and think like conservatives,\u201d but \u201cdrive a lot faster and keep vibrators and baby oil and a video camera behind the stack of sweaters on the bedroom closet shelf.\u201dOnce he left the Lampoon, O\u2019Rourke became a frequent writer for Rolling Stone and The Atlantic, where his essays and foreign dispatches positioned him as a kind of gonzo William F. Buckley. In his yarns, liberals were always aging, tedious and boring. He might lash government for waste and inefficiency, but \u201cthe real problem,\u201d he writes, \u201cis that government is boring.\u201dO\u2019Rourke packages his \u201cBill and Ted\u201d worldview inside a florid, often witty style that apes Robert Benchley more than a talk radio host. But make no mistake: He\u2019s the antecedent of today\u2019s television populists, not to mention the red-state phenomenon Larry the Cable Guy. His best comic essays lean, at heart, on politically incorrect jokes and xenophobia. His travels abroad inevitably lead to confirmation of Ugly American stereotypes. The French are snooty. And the Koreans, wouldn\u2019t you know it, they really do all look alike.His funniest work was in the 1980s, when he employed the ironic pose of early \u201cLate Night With David Letterman\u201d: Halfway serious, indulging in Cold War triumphalism while gently mocking it at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019re the big boys, Jack,\u201d he says in a burp of macho, knowing patriotism, \u201cthe original, giant, \u00adeconomy-sized, new and improved butt kickers of all time.\u201dIn recent decades, O\u2019Rourke travels less and strokes his chin more, his style shifting from a jocular right-wing foreign correspondent to a novice public intellectual. He writes earnest explications of the economic theories of Adam Smith and belligerent defenses of the Iraq War. He makes fewer references to drugs and girls and more to W.H. Auden and Thoreau. That may be age or perhaps a sign of the times, since in the era of the Tea Party and Donald Trump, the backdrop of his comedy \u2014 that many assume conservatives are establishmentarian squares \u2014 seems outdated.Gilliam begins by confessing that he set out to make a refined coffee-table book, and it still has the look of a high-end production, with photography artfully integrated into the text and vivid graffiti scrawled on the volume\u2019s page edges declaring ME ME ME. But this book turned into more of an impressionistic autobiography full of gossip, pet theories and comedy influences. Gilliam has a good story to tell, since he has been something of a comedy Zelig, who moved from the vibrant underground comics scene in the 1960s to London, where he joined the seminal show \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d and then to a Hollywood where he built a new reputation as the dark, imaginative auteur of eccentric fantasies like \u201cTime Bandits,\u201d \u201cBrazil\u201d and \u201c12 Monkeys.\u201dGilliam hung out in Harlem with Robert Crumb and was mentored by the Mad magazine editor Harvey Kurtzman. Gilliam is an undiplomatic name-dropper, which is exactly the quality you want in a Hollywood memoirist. He will tell you how he turned down Stanley Kubrick\u2019s offer to do animated titles for \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d and he nurses an amusingly bitter grudge against Steven Spielberg, whom he mocks multiple times \u2014 for, among other reasons, buckling under studio pressure on \u201cE.T.\u201d and stealing a shot from \u201cBrazil.\u201d His collaborators aren\u2019t free from ridicule either, particularly Terry Jones, who co-directed \u201cHoly Grail\u201d with him. He jokes that they did one Python reunion because of Jones\u2019s mortgage payments.Gilliam is most articulate on his influences, including Disneyland, which he describes as a kind of artisanal theme park. His praise of the craftsmanship and imagination of its rides is even more effusive than Steve Martin\u2019s in his memoir, though as Gilliam gets older he comes to see the park\u2019s \u201csubliminal Auschwitzness.\u201dGilliam got involved with Python through John Cleese, whom he met working on a satirical magazine, and he says the cultural differences could be an issue, since, as an American, he could miss the rest of the group\u2019s shared references. He also says he was simply not as verbal as the rest. \u201cSome of the violence in my Monty Python animations would come at my frustration at not being able to express myself as clearly as everyone else,\u201d he writes. He adds that while Eric Idle liked the flamboyance of his work, Michael Palin and Terry Jones were slower to embrace him. But he does not go into detail on the making of sketches and movies. \u201cIf you want chapter and verse on the hour and day everything happened,\u201d he writes, \u201cyou\u2019d probably be better off reading Michael Palin\u2019s diaries.\u201dWhereas Gilliam pokes fun at the Python industry, Palin discusses the group, and much else, with sober intent. Over the course of the decade covered in this book, Graham Chapman, one of the members of Python, becomes ill and eventually dies, and this is treated movingly. But even here, Gilliam steals focus. In one entry, he and Palin meet a sickly-looking Chapman not long before his death. In the aftermath, Palin describes an \u201cair of doom about him.\u201d Then he segues into Gilliam\u2019s response, which is to point out that being the only homosexual and alcoholic member of Python was not enough for Mr. Chapman: \u201cHe wants to be the first to die as well!\u201dJason Zinoman, who writes the On Comedy column for The Times, is the author of \u201cShock Value: How a Few Eccentric Outsiders Gave Us Nightmares, Conquered Hollywood and Invented Modern Horror.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia, Squeezed by Low Oil Prices, Cuts Spending to Shrink Deficit", "Date": "2015-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe official Saudi news media reported that the Finance Ministry would cut spending, adopt new taxes and reduce price subsidies for fuel, water and power.The cost of some grades of domestic gasoline, among the first to be affected, could rise as much as 50 percent, a potentially unsettling spike in a country where mass transit does not exist and cars are a basic necessity.The Saudi stock market fell 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday, with Saudi Basic Industries, the biggest petrochemical producer, tumbling 8.3 percent.The falling price has benefited oil-consuming nations while putting severe financial pressure on exporters like Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela.At the same time its revenue has slowed, Saudi Arabia has increased military spending, financing rebels in Syria and intervening in Yemen, where Saudi warplanes have been bombing the insurgent Houthi movement since March.The Saudi kingdom has been spending more than it takes in, and by some estimates it could exhaust its foreign exchange reserves, now roughly $640 billion, by 2020 without deep cuts in spending, a big rise in the price of oil, or a combination of both.The government ran a record deficit of about 367 billion riyals, or roughly $98 billion, in 2015, according to the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel. Under the 2016 budget, the goal is to reduce the deficit to 326 billion riyals, or about $87 billion.Analysts examining the budget said the Saudis were assuming that a barrel of oil would average about $45 in 2016. But some said even that projection was overly optimistic.\u201cSaudi Arabia must act fast and smart by starting to gradually cut down on their subsidies, reduce superfluous spending on defense and privatize selected state-owned entities to generate cash,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Sweden, a Cash-Free Future Nears", "Date": "2015-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosFew places are tilting toward a cashless future as quickly as Sweden, which has become hooked on the convenience of paying by app and plastic.This tech-forward country, home to the music streaming service Spotify and the maker of the Candy Crush mobile games, has been lured by the innovations that make digital payments easier. It is also a practical matter, as many of the country\u2019s banks no longer accept or dispense cash.At the Abba Museum, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be behind the times by taking cash while cash is dying out,\u201d said Bjorn Ulvaeus, a former Abba member who has leveraged the band\u2019s legacy into a sprawling business empire, including the museum.Not everyone is cheering. Sweden\u2019s embrace of electronic payments has alarmed consumer organizations and critics who warn of a rising threat to privacy and increased vulnerability to sophisticated Internet crimes. Last year, the number of electronic fraud cases surged to 140,000, more than double the amount a decade ago, according to Sweden\u2019s Ministry of Justice.Older adults and refugees in Sweden who use cash may be marginalized, critics say. And young people who use apps to pay for everything or take out loans via their mobile phones risk falling into debt.\u201cIt might be trendy,\u201d said Bjorn Eriksson, a former director of the Swedish police force and former president of Interpol. \u201cBut there are all sorts of risks when a society starts to go cashless.\u201dBut advocates like Mr. Ulvaeus cite personal safety as a reason that countries should go cash-free. He switched to using only card and electronic payments after his son\u2019s Stockholm apartment was burglarized twice several years ago.\u201cThere was such a feeling of insecurity,\u201d said Mr. Ulvaeus, who carries no cash at all. \u201cIt made me think: What would happen if this was a cashless society, and the robbers couldn\u2019t sell what they stole?\u201dAt more than half of the branches of the country\u2019s biggest banks, including SEB, Swedbank, Nordea Bank and others, no cash is kept on hand, nor are cash deposits accepted. They say they are saving a significant amount on security by removing the incentive for bank robberies.Last year, Swedish bank vaults held around 3.6 billion kronor in notes and coins, down from 8.7 billion in 2010, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Cash machines, which are controlled by a Swedish bank consortium, are being dismantled by the hundreds, especially in rural areas.Mr. Eriksson, who now heads the Association of Swedish Private Security Companies, a lobbying group for firms providing security for cash transfers, accuses banks and credit card companies of trying to \u201cprice cash out of the market\u201d to make way for cards and electronic payments, which generate fee income.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s something they should decide on their own,\u201d he said. \u201cShould they really be able to use their market force to turn Sweden into a cashless society?\u201dThe government has not sought to stem the cashless tide. If anything, it has benefited from more efficient tax collection, because electronic transactions leave a trail; in countries like Greece and Italy, where cash is still heavily used, tax evasion remains a big problem. Cash is certainly not dead. The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, predicts it will decline fast but still be circulating in 20 years. Recently, the Riksbank issued newly redesigned coins and notes.But for an increasing number of consumers, cash is no longer a habit.At the University of Gothenburg, students said they almost exclusively used cards and electronic payments. \u201cNo one uses cash,\u201d said Hannah Ek, 23. \u201cI think our generation can live without it.\u201dThe downside, she conceded, was that it was easy to spend without thinking. \u201cI do spend more,\u201d Ms. Ek said. \u201cBut if I had a 500 krona bill, I\u2019d think twice about spending it all.\u201d (Five hundred kronor is about $58.)The shift has rippled through even the most unlikely corners of the Swedish economy.Stefan Wikberg, 65, was homeless for four years after losing his job as an I.T. technician. He has a place to live now and sells magazines for Situation Stockholm, a charitable organization, and began using a mobile card reader to take payments, after noticing that almost no one carried cash.\u201cNow people can\u2019t get away,\u201d said Mr. Wikberg, who carries a sign saying he accepts Visa, MasterCard and American Express. \u201cWhen they say, \u2018I don\u2019t have change,\u2019 I tell them they can pay with card or even by SMS,\u201d he said, referring to text messages. His sales have grown by 30 percent since he adopted the card reader two years ago.At the Filadelfia Stockholm church, so few of the 1,000 parishioners now carry cash that the church had to adapt, said Soren Eskilsson, the executive pastor.During a recent Sunday service, the church\u2019s bank account number was projected onto a large screen. Worshipers pulled out cellphones and tithed through an app called Swish, a payment system set up by Sweden\u2019s biggest banks that is fast becoming a rival to cards.Other congregants lined up at a special \u201cKollektomat\u201d card machine, where they could transfer funds to various church operations. Last year, out of 20 million kronor in tithes collected, more than 85 percent came in by card or digital payment.\u201cPeople give more money to the church now because it\u2019s electronic and easy,\u201d said Mr. Eskilsson, adding that the church saved on security costs by handling less cash.Despite the convenience, even some who stand to gain from a cashless society see drawbacks.\u201cSweden has always been at the forefront of technology, so it\u2019s easy to embrace this,\u201d said Jacob de Geer, a founder of iZettle, which makes a mobile-powered card reader.\u201cBut Big Brother can watch exactly what you\u2019re doing if you purchase things only electronically,\u201d he said. But for Mr. Ulvaeus, the music magnate, such concerns are overblown.\u201cEverything speaks in favor of a cashless society,\u201d he said as he strolled past the Abba Museum to retrieve his car. \u201cIt\u2019s a utopian thought, but we\u2019re very close to it.\u201dHe paused at a hot-dog stand for a snack. But when he was ready to pay, the card reader was broken.\u201cSorry,\u201d the vendor said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to use cash.\u201dChristina Anderson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That was what his homemade business cards said, along with a picture of a bicycle and his phone number.Back in the late 1990s, Rafael Cossio would put on his backpack and walk from restaurant to restaurant on the main strip of Jackson Heights, Queens, handing out his cards and telling staff members he could fix their delivery bikes on the spot.\u201cIf I saw people on the street, I would help them,\u201d Mr. Cossio said recently in Spanish. \u201cThey would call me to people\u2019s houses and restaurants, and I\u2019d show up with the backpack.\u201dThat was how Mr. Cossio, 42, an immigrant from Quecholac, Puebla, in Mexico, built his clientele until he found a permanent home. For the past seven years, that home, Jimmy\u2019s Bike Shop, has been a neighborhood fixture near 93rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue, on the border of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst.The shop, named for Mr. Cossio\u2019s brother, who is the official owner and silent partner, has become a beacon for deliverymen. Its sign beams the green, white and red of the Mexican flag and the awning below declares its specialty: \u201cHospital de Bicicletas Mexico.\u201d No cases are beyond hope.\u201cMy favorite part is when bikes come in with a bent wheel or frame,\u201d Mr. Cossio said. He sees a twisted frame as a challenge. \u201cIn other shops, they won\u2019t do it, they\u2019ll toss it. But here, we fix it. People get surprised when they walk in and their bike looks like a Mexican sombrero. But we\u2019ll align it for them.\u201dWith its hanging jungle of wheels, frames and tires, this shop is part of the thriving immigrant economy of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, around the corner from taco stands and bakeries, doctors\u2019 offices and clothing stores with signs in Spanish.Jimmy\u2019s is also the Queens outpost of the Cossio family shop in Mexico, Taller de Bicicletas el Rosario, which is partly named for the main church in that community.Mr. Cossio was a teenager when he started working for his father. He developed a reputation not only as a quick fixer, but also as an expert painter of frames.Seeking a more lucrative life in the United States, Mr. Cossio came to Queens in 1992 as a young man. He left behind his wife and a son, Omar, but spoke with them often and supported them. Three months ago, Omar Cossio, now 23, left his grandfather\u2019s store to join his father in Queens.\u201cWhile it\u2019s strange for me to see him and strange for him to see me, it\u2019s nice to talk to him, to learn about what it\u2019s been like for him here and to tell him what it was like in Mexico,\u201d Mr. Cossio said in Spanish, sharing a meal with his father from nearby Tacos Al Suadero. It was delivered to the store \u2014 by a customer.Mr. Cossio arrived in New York in September, in the middle of a birthday celebration held for his father at the shop. Mariachi musicians played on the sidewalk, and hundreds of people from the neighborhood attended, the older Mr. Cossio estimated. \u201cI brag about him,\u201d the son said shyly. \u201cI know what he suffered to have this business.\u201dFor the first three years in New York, Mr. Cossio worked in a kitchen before filling in for a bicycle mechanic at a shop owned by a Colombian woman. She constantly screamed at him, he said, but he made good money. But when she failed to pay her rent, her shop closed, Mr. Cossio said. Unwilling to return to restaurant work, he struck out on his own with a backpack full of tools. He eventually found space for his own shop, which moved into its current spot in 2008. This past year, he expanded the store.On several recent afternoons, a stream of delivery people visited the shop needing alignments, air or new chains for their bikes. In the mild weather, several mechanics were working on the sidewalk. They came from Mexico and Ecuador, and one, Juan Valerio, was a mechanic for the Mexican Olympic cycling team. They spoke Spanish while dunking greasy chains into a bath of diesel fuel, as a boom box played Mexican pop music.There are fancy road bikes for sale, and models the men in the shop build themselves, melding parts from different brands. The most distinctive bike that Mr. Cossio sells is the \u201cLa Turismo,\u201d which costs $650, with its frame bearing the colors of the Mexican flag and specialized 28-inch orange tires. This is the same model that pilgrims from his town use to bike the annual 14-hour, 200-mile trek to Mexico City for the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe.Mr. Cossio has served as a neighborhood watchdog, often warning young boys and girls to stay in the busier areas on Roosevelt Avenue. He gives them free tuneups, as he once did in Mexico.\u201cHe\u2019s a good person; he always tries to collaborate with the community,\u201d one of Mr. Cossio\u2019s mechanics, Alfredo Romero, said.Mr. Cossio, referring to rival bike shops, said, \u201cThe thing is, when I first started, there were, like, two businesses here \u2014 now there are 10 of them.\u201d But not all of them can compete, he added. And, indeed, a small shop a few blocks away is closing.With winter here, Mr. Cossio has remedies ready for his customers. \u201cIn the winter, it can be a little slow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do well. If it\u2019s too cold, I offer them coffee \u2014 or tequila.\u201dIsvett Verde contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Plans Raids in New Year to Fight Surge in Border Crossings", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government is planning a series of raids beginning in January to round up and deport hundreds of undocumented families, hoping to discourage a renewed surge in illegal border crossings but risking a firestorm in an election year when immigration is again a dominant topic.The raids in communities across the country will begin almost two years after nearly 100,000 families and tens of thousands of unaccompanied children started illegally crossing the southern border with Mexico, mostly from Central America.That surge overwhelmed detention facilities, sending most families into American cities with little more than a court summons. Many failed to appear in court on the appointed days and were ordered deported.Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will fan out across the country to enforce hundreds of those orders, according to immigration officials who refused to be identified because they were not allowed to openly discuss an enforcement program that has yet to begin. When they find the families, agents will detain and immediately deport them, officials said. Plans for the raids were first reported by The Washington Post.\u201cOur border is not open to illegal immigration, and if individuals come here illegally, do not qualify for asylum or other relief, and have final orders of removal, they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values,\u201d said Gillian M. Christensen, press secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE.But those orders have so far been blocked in court, as Republican presidential candidates gain traction on pledges to get tough on such immigrants. Mrs. Clinton has largely sided with the pro-immigration community, but the new sweeps could test her.\u201cTo even contemplate this kind of aggressive roundup is to double down on a failed policy,\u201d said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cThese are Central American families who are seeking asylum and should be given humanitarian protection rather than being treated as illegal border crossers.\u201dA total of 5,622 unaccompanied youths were stopped at the border with Mexico, more than double the number seen in November 2014. The surge is particularly worrisome since illegal crossings typically decline during the fall and winter.Families and young people are coming mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Underlying factors include a surge in gang-related violence in El Salvador and Honduras, a deteriorating economy in Guatemala and a regionwide drought driving the exodus.The planned effort was immediately denounced by both pro-immigration groups that called it heartless, and anti-immigration advocates who dismissed it as window dressing. It comes in the midst of a political season in which illegal immigration and refugee resettlement have been vilified.After terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Paris, the administration is trying to reassure the nation that the borders are under control, and that it is effectively vetting foreigners coming into the country. But its efforts have been denounced across the political spectrum.Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said that the roundup campaign was a political smokescreen. \u201cIf they\u2019re only targeting a few hundred people, then this is window dressing designed to fool people into thinking they have things under control,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people know that if you show up at the border with kids, then you\u2019re in.\u201dAmong Mr. Obama\u2019s allies, the response was different, though. \u201cThese are children who have seen some of the worst conditions in the world, at high risk of being trafficked and killed,\u201d said Carlos Vargas, co-director of Dream Action Coalition, which has strongly supported the president\u2019s efforts to legalize the undocumented. \u201cWhen Jesus, an immigrant, said, \u2018Suffer the children to come unto me,\u2019 he didn\u2019t say, \u2018Except the Latino kids \u2014 let the gangs eat them.\u2019\u00a0\u201dOver all, illegal immigration across the Mexican border has fallen precipitously. The number of children and families crossing illegally, however, has spiked.Advertisement"}

If the concept works, it could drastically reduce the cost of putting stuff into orbit. And that successful landing was a milestone. We\u2019re still a very long way from space colonies and zero-gravity hotels, let alone galactic empires. But space technology is moving forward after decades of stagnation.And to my amateur eye, this seems to be part of a broader trend, which is making me more hopeful for the future than I\u2019ve been in a while.You see, I got my Ph.D. in 1977, the year of the first Star Wars movie, which means that I have basically spent my whole professional life in an era of technological disappointment.Until the 1970s, almost everyone believed that advancing technology would do in the future what it had done in the past: produce rapid, unmistakable improvement in just about every aspect of life. But it didn\u2019t. And while social factors \u2014 above all, soaring inequality \u2014 have played an important role in that disappointment, it\u2019s also true that in most respects technology has fallen short of expectations.The most obvious example is travel, where cars and planes are no faster than they were when I was a student, and actual travel times have gone up thanks to congestion and security lines. More generally, there has just been less progress in our command over the physical world \u2014 our ability to produce and deliver things \u2014 than almost anyone expected.Over the past five or six years, however \u2014 or at least this is how it seems to me \u2014 technology has been getting physical again; once again, we\u2019re making progress in the world of things, not just information. And that\u2019s important.Progress in rocketry is fun to watch, but the really big news is on energy, a field of truly immense disappointment until recently. For decades, unconventional energy technologies kept falling short of expectations, and it seemed as if nothing could end our dependence on oil and coal \u2014 bad news in the short run because of the prominence it gave to the Middle East; worse news in the long run because of global warming.Why does this matter? Everyone who isn\u2019t ignorant or a Republican realizes that climate change is by far the biggest threat humanity faces. But how much will we have to sacrifice to meet that threat?But now we can see the shape of a sustainable, low-emission future quite clearly \u2014 basically an electrified economy with, yes, nuclear power playing some role, but sun and wind front and center. Of course, it doesn\u2019t have to happen. But if it doesn\u2019t, the problem will be politics, not technology.True, I\u2019m still waiting for flying cars, not to mention hyperdrive. But we have made enough progress in the technology of things that saving the world has suddenly become much more plausible. And that\u2019s reason to celebrate.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

But he said that \u201cit is worth keeping in mind that the Focus is a fairly high-volume model.\u201dAbout 297,000 2012 Focus models are registered in the United States, according to Experian Automotive, a research firm.Mr. Trowbridge said the death of an 89-year-old woman in New Hampshire in September 2014 was investigated, and the agency concluded that \u201ca steering failure is most likely not implicated.\u201dHe said N.H.T.S.A. also reviewed 10 of the injury reports and found that eight of them appear \u201cto be related to trim on the steering wheel that has peeled loose and caused cuts to drivers\u2019 hands, as opposed to failure of the steering mechanism.\u201dHe added that a large number of the owner complaints involved the loss of steering when the vehicle was started, not when it was underway when it might pose a problem.Some safety experts said that both Ford and regulators should be more aggressive in dealing with the issue.Mr. Trowbridge said in an email, \u201cin general, frequency is only one of the factors that the agency considers when examining an issue.\u201dJoan Claybrook, a former head of the agency, who now works as a safety advocate, said that Ford\u2019s report of more than 100 injuries and a death involving the 2012 Ford Focus is \u201cvery significant and is certainly something N.H.T.S.A. should address.\u201dMr. Trowbridge said the agency did not have enough information to warrant opening a formal investigation, but is monitoring the situation and \u201cwill go wherever the information leads.\u201dAt the center of the concern is the car\u2019s power steering. That system, which was introduced on the Focus for the 2012 model year, uses an electric motor instead of a hydraulic pump. Automakers say it improves fuel economy and performance.But Ford has had problems with the steering system in the Focus. Twice it alerted dealers about a potential problem through a notice called a technical service bulletin. Those notices allow an automaker to tell dealers, and sometimes car owners, about how to handle a problem it does not consider a safety issue. Safety issues must be handled with a recall.In May 2011, Ford sent dealers a technical service bulletin warning that the new 2012 Focus could temporarily lose the electric power assist when the vehicle was started. It did not say the steering might be lost while the vehicle was moving. Then in February 2012, Ford sent another bulletin to dealers saying owners might complain about \u201ca steering wander at speeds over 45 miles per hour.\u201dAt this time, Ford was also telling regulators of the injuries or deaths related to steering through the safety agency\u2019s Early Warning Reporting system. Automakers are required to disclose claims they receive that blame vehicle defects for serious injuries or deaths.Ford\u2019s problems with its power steering extend beyond the Focus.In the last 19 months, Ford has recalled about 1.3 million other cars or trucks in the United States because of power steering issues. Those include the 2008-11 Escape, 2011-12 Fusion and 2011-13 Explorer.Those recalls came after Transport Canada, the counterpart to the American safety agency, had started its own investigations into the power steering problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Poland Is Turning Away From the West", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySofia, Bulgaria \u2014 DURING the recent electoral campaign in Poland, a constant question raised by pundits and politicians was not whether the country would go right, but whether it would go wrong.Would the conservative Law and Justice Party, the expected victors in the poll, go the way of Viktor Orban\u2019s increasingly authoritarian Hungary, or would it stay closer to the center? Given the nationalist, anti-liberal slant of the party\u2019s campaign platform, could Poland\u2019s seemingly consolidated liberal institutions reverse course? Law and Justice won decisively, and after only three weeks we have an answer: a distressing yes.The new government has pushed forward three staggering changes. The man chosen to oversee police and intelligence agencies is a party stalwart who received a three-year suspended sentence for abusing power in his previous role as head of the anti-corruption office, signaling that political loyalty is above the law.The government has purged European Union flags from government press briefings, demonstrating that it sees Polish national interests in opposition to European values.And it has weakened the country\u2019s separation of powers by rejecting the previous Parliament\u2019s nominees to the constitutional court \u2014 and instead appointed its own candidates, provoking a constitutional crisis.Why has Poland, the poster child of post-Communist success and Europe\u2019s best economic performer of the last decade, suddenly taken an illiberal turn? Why, despite the profound public mistrust of politicians, are people ready to elect parties eager to dismantle any constraints on government\u2019s power?For one thing, the Law and Justice Party bet on a form of illiberal democracy because it succeeded in Hungary. The Orban model of rebuking the European Union while accepting billions in aid money has worked. So have Mr. Orban\u2019s efforts to consolidate power by demonizing his political opponents. Hungary\u2019s economy has not collapsed as critics predicted; nor did Mr. Orban\u2019s party lose at the ballot box.Of course, the more countries that follow Mr. Orban\u2019s lead, the less successful his model will become: At some point there will be no European Union to blame. Indeed, Poland\u2019s drift may result in a backlash by Western Europe; already, one hears rumblings in Paris and Berlin that it was a mistake to give the new, Eastern entrants the same power within the European Union as the established members of the eurozone.But the core question is why Poles voted for a party that has a dismal governing record. After Law and Justice won its first term in 2005, its public standing dropped precipitously and it was forced into early elections two years later, and lost. (And Poles are hardly anti-democratic; a recent poll showed a majority are concerned that Polish democracy is in danger.)The answer is simple, and it is a version of what we are seeing across Europe. Even a party as historically unpopular as Law and Justice can win these days by running not just against the left, but against liberal democracy. It is transparent in its aversion to independent institutions like the courts, the central bank and the media.These populist and radical parties aren\u2019t just parties; they are constitutional movements. They promise voters what liberal democracy cannot: a sense of victory where majorities \u2014 not just political majorities, but ethnic and religious ones, too \u2014 can do what they please.The rise of these parties is symptomatic of the explosion of threatened majorities as a force in European politics. They blame the loss of control over their lives, real or imagined, on a conspiracy between cosmopolitan-minded elites and tribal-minded immigrants. They blame liberal ideas and institutions for weakening the national will and eroding national unity. They tend to see compromise as corruption and zealousness as conviction.What makes anxious majorities most indignant is that while they believe that they are entitled to govern (they are the many after all), they never can have the final say. And so they are ready to blame the separation of powers and other inconvenient principles of liberal democracy for their frustration \u2014 and readily endorse parties like Law and Justice that run against those principles.Ivan Krastev is the chairman of the Center for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, a permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driving Poland Apart", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAnd since the Law and Justice party\u2019s success in the October elections, there have certainly been some worrying Orbanesque developments.The new government has not shied away from open conflict with the Constitutional Tribunal, appointing new judges and ignoring rulings that declared large parts of new legislation introduced by the party unconstitutional. Planned changes would give the government more control over the media and, according to a newly proposed law, civil servants in leading positions in the public administration should be replaced by political appointees.Law and Justice party supporters argue that the democratic majority should not be hindered from executing its power, and a comment during a heated parliamentary debate three weeks ago \u2014 that \u201cthe good of the people comes before the law\u201d \u2014 was met by a standing ovation in the ranks of the ruling majority.With the breathtaking tempo of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s power grab, the prospect of Budapest in Warsaw no longer seems quite so distant. But the parallels between Poland and Hungary should not be overstated. The real crisis in Poland is not that the country is uniting behind the nationalist right. It is that Polish society is cleaving between traditionalism and liberalism, with no end in sight.It\u2019s an unfavorable comparison: Despite high productivity growth in the last 10 years, average wages in Poland are among the lowest in the European Union. The average Finn or Briton earns around twice as much.Civic Platform\u2019s refusal, or inability, to offer a vision for the country\u2019s future beyond market reforms, stability and pride in Poland\u2019s past achievements left a space to the right that the Law and Justice party skillfully exploited with generous social promises and a narrative of the need to raise the country from its ruins.Liberals may have appeared complacent and out of touch, but nobody has contributed more to exacerbating these divisions than Mr. Kaczynski \u2014 whether through his narrative about the rottenness of Poland today and his vision of a morally sound Fourth Republic, or through his allusions that the airplane crash in Smolensk in 2010 in which his twin brother, President Lech Kaczynski, died might have been orchestrated and covered up by the Russians.For Mr. Kaczynski and his supporters, attitudes about \u201cSmolensk\u201d became the measure of patriotism and belonging to the national community. Those who debunked the plot version as a myth did not deserve to be called \u201ctrue Poles.\u201dSo, while the crisis over the Constitutional Tribunal might be the next chapter in the process of driving the two Polands apart, it is not the whole story.Social and political tensions are embedded in Poland\u2019s much deeper moral and cultural divide. Just as the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb famously described the United States as \u201cone nation, two cultures,\u201d the Polish social psychologist Michal Bilewicz says Poland is composed of two tribes who adhere to different moral and value systems.On one side are those representing conservative or Catholic values and stressing national pride and loyalty; on the other are those who highlight individual rights, embrace minorities and put universal justice before community solidarity. These two tribes have little in common. They hardly communicate, they often despise each other \u2014 and the language of the political debate on both sides is extremely polarized if not brutal.Poland found a way to overcome this in the past. In 1989 a compromise between Communists and the opposition made a transition to democracy possible in Poland, and that ability to compromise became a source of national pride and international respect. But the space in which compromises can be forged has shrunk. The center of society has been poorly served by liberals and actively riven by national-conservatives like Mr. Kaczynski.The current turmoil, provoked and consciously stirred by the Law and Justice party, will further poison the political culture in a society where the lack of social capital, polarization and refusal to compromise are the central obstacles for future development and modernization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Shipwreck Treasure Easier to Reach, a Duel Is On", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 The Spanish galleon San Jos\u00e9 was overloaded with 200 passengers and 700 tons of cargo on a summer night in 1631 when it smashed into a rock off the Pacific coast of Panama, spilling silver coins and bars into the Gulf of Panama. More than 400,000 coins and at least 1,417 bars were lost over a 40-mile trail.Four hundred years later, that shipwreck has become one of the latest to land in a legal quagmire over who should have the rights to historic artifacts trapped under the sea. This one involves the United Nations, the United States Department of Homeland Security, the government of Panama and Americans accused of being pirates. At issue is whether private companies should be able to claim and profit from historic treasures.Those questions are of particular interest to businesses in South Florida at a time when technology is making it easier to find and recover sunken loot. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that there are over 1,000 shipwrecks in the Florida Keys alone.In the case of the San Jos\u00e9 booty, commercial treasure hunters, financed in part by an adventure entrepreneur who runs tours to the Titanic, spent over $2 million and 10 years recovering portions of the treasure, only to see their permits questioned and bounty confiscated.\u201cThey called us thieves, looters, plunderers and pirates,\u201d said Dan Porter, a Florida captain who led the expedition to find the San Jos\u00e9. \u201cThat\u2019s an insult,\u201d he continued. \u201cI hold this work in the highest regard.\u201d\u201cTreasure hunters are to maritime archaeologists what astrologers are to astronomers,\u201d said Filipe Castro, a nautical archaeologist at Texas A & M University.The Department of Homeland Security has opened an investigation into the case, and several criminal complaints are pending in Panama. Those actions underscore the perils that often accompany maritime salvage recovery, particularly as nations become increasingly sensitive to the cultural significance of underwater treasures.In the colonial era, Spain sent fleets to the new world to excavate gold and silver from places like Bolivia and Peru, but hurricanes and other mishaps often sent ships and the gold they carried to unreachable depths.Pirates and plunderers have long sought to recover them. As technology to find them has improved in recent decades, many legitimate companies have begun hunting, too, only to find their discoveries challenged in court.Investors included a former Panamanian governor; a Mexican-American engineer; Mike McDowell, an Australian adventure entrepreneur; and \u2014 for a different IMDI salvage project \u2014 Pat Croce, a former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers.IMDI spent about 10 years fighting legal challenges. The company prevailed, and, with permits and court verdicts in hand, the subaquatic dig for the San Jos\u00e9 went on. Panamanian government inspectors supervised the project, and a \u201cworld class\u201d conservation lab was built to log and preserve each discovery, the company said.Among other items, divers found gold and diamond jewelry, pottery, and nearly 10,000 silver coins, worth up to $1,000 each. Only one 60-pound silver bar was recovered. Based on the contract, the government got to keep anything it considered historically relevant, plus 35 percent of everything else.Some Panamanian government officials objected to the deal and brought in Unesco, which sent a task force to Panama to review the project. Excavation stopped. Even after the haul was divided and the government received its share, the country\u2019s comptroller noted a number of irregularities in the contract, questioned its validity and requested an investigation into how it had been obtained.\u201cThe government stopped us, even though we did everything by the book,\u201d said Alberto V\u00e1squez, an IMDI vice president.This summer, when Mr. V\u00e1squez emerged from a bank in Panama City where he had gone to retrieve some of the company\u2019s share of coins that were stored in a safe deposit box, the government seized 3,000 coins, saying he did not have permission to transport them.In September, Captain Porter, who led an expedition, returned to Florida with his 100 coins, worth about $500 or $600 each. The United States Border Patrol boarded his salvage vessel, searched it with dogs for six hours and confiscated the coins.Citing an open investigation, Nestor J. Yglesias, a spokesman for Homeland Security Investigations, the criminal investigation arm of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to comment.Panamanian government officials requested a list of questions from The New York Times, but did not respond to them, despite repeated requests.Ulrike Gu\u00e9rin, who runs Unesco\u2019s underwater culture program, said it was not up to the United Nations to determine the legality of IMDI\u2019s contract, but she stressed that the agency was pleased to see Panama stepping up to stop treasure hunting.Ms. Gu\u00e9rin said Unesco was trying to stop commercial salvagers around the world because they regularly destroy sites without giving any consideration to historical preservation or environmental damage. The divers take special care to preserve valuables such as coins, but disregard precious pottery if it looks too cracked to sell, she said.\u201cThis is a fishy business of treasure hunting,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cI have not seen any case that was a success and everyone liking it. It ends up in a slaughter, destroying the heritage.\u201dJames A. Goold, a lawyer in Washington, often steps in on Spain\u2019s behalf when commercial shipwreck divers try to claim long-lost treasures, including some the government believes were fakes.\u201cThese ships are time capsules that are irreplaceable and should be preserved for public benefit for study by cultural authorities and archaeologists,\u201d he said.In October, Mr. Goold sent notice to a Tampa company, Global Marine Exploration, which is looking for ships from a 1715 Spanish fleet lost in a hurricane, warning that Spain had not given up its rights to long-lost vessels. In 2009, a leading Tampa treasure-hunting company was ordered to return 17 tons of gold and silver from the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes, which sank off Portugal in 1804.Treasure hunters are hoping for a compromise.\u201cYou should look at these more like an airplane crash or car crash,\u201d said James J. Sinclair, a marine archaeologist hired by IMDI to evaluate the finds. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave them at the side of the road and preserve them forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Nigeria, Chinese Investment Comes With a Downside", "Date": "2015-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe China Factor | Part 59 PhotosEmeka Ezelugha was excited to open a computer training center. He could teach his countrymen some skills and earn a living.But soon after the center opened in a rough, two-story concrete building in Lagos, a blaze broke out in the main classroom. The flames incinerated 30 desktop computers, as well as televisions and air-conditioners.The culprit was unmistakable: one of two dozen power strips in the classroom. The faulty equipment was made in China, even though the salesman said it was British.\u201cThe guy tried to convince me it was from the U.K. \u2014 I was surprised when it happened,\u201d Mr. Ezelugha said.Across this populous African nation, low-cost Chinese goods are everywhere, evidence of Beijing\u2019s growing dominance in global trade. The trade flow has helped keep life affordable for millions of Nigerian families, at a time when the country is struggling with economic stagnation and plunging prices, as well as the deadly costs of the Boko Haram insurgency.But shoddy or counterfeit products are a national problem in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, where impoverished consumers have few alternatives. Some shoddy goods are benign, like the Chinese-made shirts, trousers and dresses with uneven stitching and stray threads that fill street markets. But electrical wiring, outlets and power strips from China, ubiquitous in new homes and offices, are connected to dozens of fires a year in Lagos alone.But such efforts also pose new and unpredictable challenges for Beijing. China has lent heavily to commodity-exporting countries, which are now struggling with low commodity prices. At the same time, China\u2019s highly competitive manufacturing sector has devastated many smaller-scale rivals across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Mr. Xi\u2019s pledge in Africa, in part, seemed aimed at quelling criticism over what some see as a lopsided relationship that largely benefits China.To support its swelling trade in Nigeria, China is funneling billions of dollars to build roads, rail lines, airport terminals, power plants and other desperately needed infrastructure. China is the top lender to Nigeria, where political instability and violence have made Western interests skittish.Nigeria, in turn, has become the biggest overseas customer of Chinese construction companies. It is an important market for Beijing, at a time when China\u2019s own growth is slowing.But China\u2019s extensive reach is now meeting resistance in Nigeria, part of the broader risks for Beijing\u2019s global strategy.In Abuja, the capital, the new government is conducting anticorruption investigations into large Chinese construction contracts signed by the previous leadership. Nigerian state governments are struggling to pay for many of those projects, exposing China to potentially heavy losses.In Kano, angry protesters in the streets blame widespread joblessness on China, which is manufacturing African fabric designs in shimmering hues more cheaply than Nigeria. Employment in Nigeria\u2019s textile and apparel sector has plummeted to 20,000 people, from 600,000 two decades ago.In Lagos, authorities are trying to stamp out subpar Chinese electric goods. Imported power strips and wiring have inadequate copper to handle Nigeria\u2019s 240-volt system, said Wanza Kussiy, the chief safety officer of the Nigerian government\u2019s Standards Organization.Zhang Sen, the vice secretary general of China\u2019s government-controlled Electronic Product Association, said that the group was reviewing Nigeria\u2019s fires. \u201cWe still need to do some research before we can say the quality of the Chinese products is to blame,\u201d he said.Nigerian authorities are stymied. Corruption is endemic, making it more difficult to enforce safety standards. And Chinese goods are so dominant that consumer have few other choices.In Lagos, Mr. Ezelugha borrowed heavily to reopen his computer training center after the fire. But the power strips are still made in China. He couldn\u2019t find anything else.Kano\u2019s cloth industry started in the walled ancient city, a labyrinth of mud brick houses and dirt roads.The city\u2019s blue dye has long been made from the leaves of local indigo plants, which are crushed and mixed with cooking ashes and potassium. Swaths of white cotton fabric are dunked in the dye, which fills six-foot-deep pits lined with animal skins.But employment at the centuries-old dye pits has dropped to 250 people, from nearly 1,500 a decade ago. Chinese companies produce virtually identical patterns of fabrics using synthetic dyes, and their sales now dominate in Kano\u2019s open-air market.\u201cThey are learning our arts and taking them to their country and doing them similarly to us, and bringing the goods back to Nigeria and selling them to our people,\u201d said Bala Ibrahim, 45, who has labored in the pits since his early teens. Now he spends whole days idle.Such stories are common across Nigeria\u2019s garment industry. The city\u2019s tanneries, which made Moroccan leather from goatskins for centuries, have laid off most of their staffs. Dozens of modern fabric factories on the outskirts of Kano have closed.In theory, Nigeria should have a manufacturing edge, at least in labor-intensive industries like sewing.With high unemployment in Nigeria, factory owners can easily find workers willing to accept the minimum wage, just $80 a month. By comparison, garment factories in coastal China now pay around $550 a month and still can\u2019t find enough workers.Despite the high cost of labor, it remains cheaper and easier to mass-produce garments in China.One obstacle to setting up a large-scale sewing industry like Bangladesh\u2019s is that Nigeria imposes significant tariffs on imported fabric, a legacy of its past as a big producer of hand-woven fabric and as a large grower of cotton. Another challenge is that electricity from Nigeria\u2019s national grid is unreliable. So operations must rely on diesel generators, buying fuel at a cost per kilowatt-hour generated that is six times what garment makers in China pay.The Nigerian government wants to revive manufacturing, particularly given low prices now for its oil exports. Abdulkadir Musa, the recently retired permanent secretary of Nigeria\u2019s ministry of industry, trade and investment, said the government was mulling reductions in tariffs on garment materials that are not produced in Nigeria, possibly including buttons. \u201cWe want to start that all over now that oil is no longer at a high price,\u201d Mr. Musa said, adding that overreliance on oil exports \u201chas been more of a problem for us than a solution.\u201dFor now, Nigerians just can\u2019t compete.Chimezie Cyril Okwuosa scrimped for years to set up his own small garment factory near Lagos in 2005. He had 25 sewing machines, 30 workers and a noisy diesel generator. The factory failed within five years.\u201cI was spending so much on diesel that at the end of the day, I had no profit \u2014 and some days, there was no diesel at all, and I could not operate,\u201d Mr. Okwuosa said.Mr. Okwuosa now runs Greentomato Apparels, a small-scale importer of children\u2019s trousers. He pays $2.50 a pair to a factory in Guangzhou, China, and then only 10 or 12 cents a pair for shipping. He sells the pants for about $3.25 a pair, leaving him a small profit margin.The collapse of manufacturing is more than just a financial issue.It has also fanned worries about the possible spread of Boko Haram, an insurgency condemned for its large-scale abductions and sexual enslavement of women and girls. Boko Haram has drawn young men to its ranks in destitute northeastern Nigeria, the country\u2019s poorest region.Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, the traditional ruler of Kano in northern Nigeria, has seen the devastation up close. Outside his palace, a low maroon building with battlements, is a large burn mark. Late last year, a group linked by the government to Boko Haram set off three bombs in a large crowd and then used automatic weapons to spray bullets at the survivors. As many as 500 people were killed.\u201cThe Chinese basically copy every textile product in Nigeria,\u201d Emir Sanusi said. \u201cI worry about what could happen to Kano when we have a large number of youths and large numbers of industries are down.\u201dAt a Lagos steelyard of Dorman-Long Engineering, the only activity on a recent afternoon was the welding of an oil storage tank. With the steep drop in world oil prices, longtime customers like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are no longer commissioning as many helipads and footbridges for their offshore drilling platforms.The locally owned engineering firm had expected Chinese construction companies operating in Nigeria to help offset the slump. But Chinese construction companies, mostly state-owned, have largely imported their steel girders, reinforcing beams and other materials from home.\u201cI just don\u2019t see a lot of local content in what they do,\u201d said Timi Austen-Peters, the company\u2019s chairman.Infrastructure financed and built by China was supposed to be the great hope for Nigeria.Nigeria endured coups and a civil war in the 1960s, then effectively nationalized many foreign-owned companies in the 1970s. Nigeria developed a reputation for breaking or renegotiating contracts, antagonizing many foreign partners.The risks have prompted Western companies to demand very fat profits before putting money into the country \u2014 returns on the order of 25 to 40 percent a year. Their Chinese counterparts have been willing to accept 10 percent or less.\u201cUnless the West changes its risk assessment, the Chinese will beat them to the African market,\u201d said Osadebe Osakwe, a former Nigerian banker who is now the managing director of North China Construction Nigeria. The company is a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise in Beijing. \u201cThe Chinese are trying to prove that they can do what the Western companies can do and they can do it better.\u201dChinese companies have piled into the country. Mostly state-owned Chinese construction companies have started $24.6 billion worth of projects since 2005, the highest of anywhere in the world, according to the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.\u201cAfrica has a real demand for infrastructure and industrial developments \u2014 in those areas, China has strong ability and surplus capacity to invest and build,\u201d China\u2019s prime minister, Li Keqiang, said during a visit to Nigeria last year.But as demand at home falters, Chinese companies have been shipping huge quantities of steel girders, piping and other industrial materials at extremely low prices to emerging markets like Nigeria. So there is little benefit for local players like Dorman-Long Engineering that used to fabricate much of this equipment.Executives at Chinese construction companies say they do buy some local materials. But they add that China\u2019s exports are often more readily available and better made, so they can be quickly and reliably included in complex projects.The new Nigerian government is starting to question whether all the construction projects are in the country\u2019s best interest. Many projects, like new international or refurbished airport terminals in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt, help the country\u2019s elite but may do less for the poor.The new government is now searching for signs of fraud, corruption or other misconduct in existing contracts. President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria announced on Aug. 10 that his government had already found that hundreds of millions of dollars were mysteriously diverted from one Chinese-backed rail project to other government projects, although it was not immediately clear if corruption was involved.The pride of the previous Nigerian administration, which left office in May, was supposed to be a new passenger train line that links Abuja to Kaduna. With trains traveling at nearly 120 miles per hour, the $874 million line is supposed to cut the three-hour highway trip in half.But the line may not draw many passengers.A graceful new train station is a 40-minute drive from downtown, surrounded by cornfields and cow pastures. The extension of the line into downtown Abuja has been severely delayed, and money is running short for its completion. And even though Nigeria desperately needs more freight trains, the rail line with its fragile-looking bridges is too lightly built to support heavily laden cargo cars.The fate of the line \u2014 like dozens of Chinese projects around Nigeria \u2014 is a potential problem for Beijing.Infrastructure projects in Nigeria have been fueled by the same manic lending that has also created mountains of debt for China\u2019s economy at home. State-controlled Chinese banks have lent money at rock-bottom interest rates in deeply indebted Nigeria.They have done so based on the assumption that the Chinese government will repay them if Nigeria cannot.A little-known Chinese government agency, Sinosure, has guaranteed the loans. Sinosure insured $427 billion worth of Chinese exports and overseas construction projects around the world in 2013, the most recent year available. The Export-Import Bank of the United States, by comparison, issued just $5 billion worth of credit in each of the last two years.Nigeria is a particularly shaky bet for China. The corruption investigations could prompt the government to cancel contracts outright. Government revenue has dropped by more than half since the fall in world oil prices, so the country may not have the money to make good on the Chinese deals.The riskiest projects of all may be those like the high-speed rail line that are widely viewed as the previous administration\u2019s vanity projects.A Chinese construction manager at the new station on Abuja\u2019s outskirts, who identified himself only as Mr. Zhang, said the project would be finished by next March.

As Germany has accelerated its phaseout of nuclear power, it has at times relied too heavily on coal-fired power plants, and it will need to make deeper cuts to its yearly carbon emissions if it is to meet the goal of a 40 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2020, a target that the government set for itself. (The European Union, including Germany, is committed to reaching that same goal as a bloc by 2030, as part of the Paris deal.)German consumers are being asked to bear much of the price of the energy transition, which the government projects will be at least 550 billion euros, or about $597 billion, by 2050, in order to shield energy-hungry heavy industry from higher costs. This has left households with far higher electricity rates than their counterparts in most other countries.Most recently, experts have warned that the influx of nearly one million people this year seeking asylum could cause a spike in emissions.\u201cIt is important that we address the issue of population now, or it could jeopardize our 2020 goals,\u201d said Andreas L\u00f6schel, a professor of economics at the University of M\u00fcnster and an adviser to the government.Still, Barbara Hendricks, Germany\u2019s environment minister, said she believed that the country could meet its climate goals. She said the ability to expand the economy while reducing energy use was a major achievement.\u201cThat is the decisive point for sustainability, to be as or more successful, while using fewer resources,\u201d Ms. Hendricks said on Saturday.Few thought it was possible. But since 2000, across party lines, German governments have passed laws and set regulations encouraging the production of solar, wind and bioenergy, in a program known as the Energiewende, or Energy Transition. At the same time, businesses, enticed by subsidies and prodded by Berlin, have worked with researchers on new ways to improve efficiency.The foundation for the entire effort has been the support of German citizens, who have been willing to shoulder the burden of increased costs in the short-term, in the long-term hope of leaving their children with a cleaner, more sustainable system. Seven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.Germany has already realized its goal of increasing the share of power generated by solar, wind and other renewable sources, without hurting industry or plunging the nation into darkness. Last year, those energy sources accounted for 27.8 percent of all power consumed, for the first time edging out lignite, or brown coal, the country\u2019s favorite fossil fuel. The national goal for renewables is 35 percent by 2020.Dirk Messner, a member of the German Advisory Council on Global Change, which advises the government, recalls being invited in 2011 to present a study on German climate policies at the Brookings Institution, in Washington. \u201cThe attitude then was, \u2018Go ahead, you can take the lead on this one,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Messner said. \u201cThere were many at the time who considered this a wacko-green idea.\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.That was the year an earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the consequent meltdown of atomic reactors in Fukushima managed to accomplish what decades of antinuclear protests had not: Prompting Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government to speed efforts to close by 2022 all of the country\u2019s remaining 17 reactors, a major source of low-emissions power.That made the energy transformation task even tougher, and many industry leaders complained about rising energy prices caused by the hefty taxes and surcharges that have underwritten the process. The government responded by waiving the surcharges for companies that could prove a strong need for energy; some 2,000 were exempted.The bill was passed onto consumers, and electricity prices for a three-person household have risen 68 percent since 1998, according to the German Association of Energy and Water Industries.Most countries have pledged their greenhouse gas emissions goals. The pledges are the biggest cut ever achieved, but are still not enough.Some companies have come to see the plan as an opportunity to expand the markets for their products.The Chinese have even asked if Sch\u00fcco could develop a \u201csmoke window\u201d capable of filtering the outside air, he said.Companies like Florida-Eis in Berlin, which makes specialty ice cream, have embraced low-carbon production and national energy goals, with the company\u2019s owner Olaf H\u00f6hn, even selling his private jet and cashing in his retirement plan to invest in a new factory covered in solar panels.Cartons of vanilla and Swiss chocolate chill in propane-cooled deep freezes delivered by a fleet of battery-run trucks.Amid the successes, there have been some disappointments. Germany has not fully resolved the nearly universal challenge of delivering alternative energy power to where it is most needed \u2014 and it has not been able to eliminate the need for an overlap to cover periods when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing.Lignite looms as Germany\u2019s potential Achilles\u2019 heel. While generous tariffs to accelerate investment in solar and wind power helped spur renewable energy development, no similar incentives were offered to address the dependence on soft coal, Germany\u2019s only abundant native fossil fuel.Ms. Hendricks, the environment minister, has recently called for the country to shutter its lignite-fueled power plants in 20 to 25 years. Miners\u2019 unions and businesses say that would kill jobs and overburden the power industry, but environmentalists say that is not fast enough.Germany, Ms. Hendricks said, needs to set targets and be willing to work toward them, as it did with renewable energy. \u201cEveryone is looking at us to see if we can make it,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Giving Back Isn\u2019t Enough", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDURING this season of giving, I will join millions of Americans in volunteering to feed the homeless, contributing to clothing drives and donating to poverty-fighting charities. Yet I worry that through these acts of kindness, I absolve myself of asking deeper questions about injustice and inequality. We Americans are a remarkably bighearted people, but I believe the purpose of our philanthropy must not only be generosity, but justice.The origins of formal philanthropy date from at least 1889, when the American industrialist Andrew Carnegie composed his \u201cGospel of Wealth.\u201d He drafted this intellectual charter at the peak of the Gilded Age, when inequality had reached extreme levels. Carnegie argued, as many still do, that inequality on this scale is an unavoidable condition of the free-market system \u2014 and that it was even desirable, if the promise of wealth incentivized hard work. Philanthropy, he believed, would ease the pressure of rising social anxiety that followed from inequality \u2014 ameliorating the afflictions of the market without altering the market system itself.During the 20th century, an entire field of institutional philanthropy emerged and flourished in the pattern of Carnegie\u2019s mold. Iconic American families \u2014 Gates, Knight, MacArthur, Mellon, Rockefeller \u2014 endowed and expanded foundations that built schools and libraries, developed new vaccines, revolutionized agriculture and advanced human freedom. My own organization, the Ford Foundation, has given billions to support everything from public television in the United States to microlending in Bangladesh.Our work has been indisputably for the good: Millions of people around the world have access to new tools and resources with which to improve their lives. A few months ago, the World Bank estimated that, for the first time in history, fewer than one in 10 human beings lives in extreme poverty. This is progress.And yet, for all the advances made in the last century, society\u2019s challenges may have outpaced philanthropy\u2019s resources. Today, the cumulative wealth of the most generous donors seems a pittance compared with the world\u2019s trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of need. Generosity, blooming as it may be from legacies of both Carnegie\u2019s age and the newly enriched, is no longer enough.The world may need a reimagined charter of philanthropy \u2014 a \u201cGospel of Wealth\u201d for the 21st century \u2014 that serves not just American philanthropists, but the vast array of new donors emerging around the world.Feeding the hungry is among our society\u2019s most fundamental obligations, but we should also question why our neighbors are without nutritious food to eat. Housing the homeless is an imperative, but we should also question why our housing markets are so distorted. As a nation, we need more investment in education, but not without questioning educational disparities based on race, class and geography.Our self-awareness \u2014 our humility \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be limited to examining the problems. It should include the structures of solutions, like giving itself. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said not long before his assassination, \u201cPhilanthropy is commendable, but it must not cause the philanthropist to overlook the circumstances of economic injustice which make philanthropy necessary.\u201d It is, after all, an offspring of the free market; it is enabled by returns on capital.And yet, too often, we have declined to question our own circumstances: a system that produces vast differences in privilege, and then tasks the most privileged with improving the system.Whatever our intentions, the truth is that we can inadvertently widen inequality in the course of making money, even though we claim to support equality and justice when giving it away. And while our end-of-year giving might support worthy organizations, we must also ask if these financial donations contribute to larger social change.In other words, \u201cgiving back\u201d is necessary, but not sufficient. We should seek to bring about lasting, systemic change, even if that change might adversely affect us. We must bend each act of generosity toward justice.We, as foundations and individuals, should fund people, their ideas and organizations that are capable of addressing deep-rooted injustice. We should ensure that the voices of those most affected by injustice \u2014 women, racial minorities, the poor, religious and ethnic minorities and L.G.B.T. individuals \u2014 help decide where and what philanthropy puts money behind, not in simply receiving whatever philanthropy decides to give them.We can wield data and technology, see through a diversity of viewpoints, and draw upon a century of philanthropy\u2019s success and failure to identify and address the barriers holding people back.Others in philanthropy will take different, but no less effective, approaches. Many already are answering King\u2019s call, working intensely toward a world that renders philanthropy unnecessary. Ultimately, we each must do our part to ensure that giving not only makes us feel better, but also makes our society more just.Darren Walker is the president of the Ford Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Three-Day Trek in the Highlands of Myanmar", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExplorerWe\u2019d been walking for hours on a dirt path with no shade when we came to the rice field. In a clearing, half a dozen farmers had set slanting wooden boards on the ground, arranged in a circle. They were hitting bundles of harvested rice plants against the panels so that the kernels broke away and slid down onto a tarp. Oxen waited nearby, hitched to heavy wooden carts.We were in the rural foothills of Myanmar\u2019s Shan State, in November. It was over 90 degrees and the three of us \u2014 my friends Tressa and Tanya, and myself \u2014 had been walking for two days. As we stared at the farmers, fat drops of sweat dripped down my face, and my hair lay in damp clumps on my forehead. Later, looking at photos, I would realize that I resembled a harmless, but decidedly disheveled, stranger.When we\u2019d stopped, Tar Ngye, our porter, watched us, amused. Everywhere we went, we stopped to help women pick chiles or men thresh rice. A farmer himself, Tar Ngye seemed to find our interest strange but endearing. He asked the men if we could try threshing, and soon we were hitting the bundles against the boards, first timidly and then aggressively, to the very satisfying cicada-like sound of hundreds of tiny kernels slipping to the ground.After a while, two farmers walked around, solemnly placing orange segments and wisps of rice on each board. This was an offering for good weather, and hence a good harvest. A bad harvest would spell disaster. It meant children pulled from school; meals missed; long, anxious days in a region with scarce or nonexistent public resources.They handed us, the foreign guests, some orange segments, which were among the many gifts we received during our stay in Myanmar. It was a constant flow: bananas, persimmons, a wood apple, more tiny oranges, many, many chiles. Long after I returned home, I could think of little else but what it meant for so many people to wish something refreshing on the unexpected stranger.My friends and I were on a three-day hike in the southwestern part of Shan State \u2014 farming country known mostly for narrow, silvery Inle Lake, a popular destination for travelers. Bountiful and ethnically diverse, southern Shan is a patchwork of villages and farms growing sesame, wheat, potatoes, rice and chiles in a stunning highland landscape. Dirt paths and quiet roads connect villages, some of which host markets on alternate days.With our guide, Ko Phyo \u2014 whose services we had arranged through a local guesthouse \u2014 we set out from the former British hill station of Kalaw on a road that became a dirt path, passing through a stand of mountain pines that opened to undulating valleys dotted with villages.Tar Ngye, who is in his 30s, walked ahead of us in flip-flops and a longyi, a saronglike garment \u2014 my stuff hoisted on his shoulders. (An old spinal injury prohibits me from carrying my own pack.) On the day we arrived, someone from the guesthouse had run into the market and asked if Tar Ngye could set aside his work selling cabbages for a few days.A few hours into the trek, we passed a terraced garden of onions and cabbages, and Tar Ngye nodded his head toward a cluster of huts made of bamboo woven in chevrons. Because he spoke Pa-O, a language used by one of the many ethnic groups that call Shan State home, Ko Phyo translated for us. \u201cThat\u2019s his village,\u201d he said. Tar Ngye lived there with his wife and young daughter and raised vegetables that they sold at the market. Theirs was one of the more prosperous settlements we\u2019d see, with shade trees and elegant, fenced gardens with rows of greens, garlic and eggplant.They made an odd pair: Tar Ngye, the soft-spoken, responsible father, and Ko Phyo, at 20, a goofy, gawky college kid. Ko Phyo\u2019s jawline-length hair was slicked back with gel and his bright green soccer socks were pulled up to his knees. A too-small bowler hat was perched jauntily on his head at a precarious angle, which made him look like a perpetually shrugging pop star. \u201cMy mother hates it,\u201d he said.Through farmer\u2019s field after farmer\u2019s field, Tressa, Tanya and I took turns ducking under a yellow umbrella that Ko Phyo carried, and talked about the contrasts between our lives. The terrain grew challenging, with glowing checkerboards of sesame and rice planted on steep hillsides. This was completely unlike the Himalayan treks Tressa and I had made in recent years. There were no Wi-Fi zones, no hot water, no base camps at which to Instagram ourselves. I forgot about my phone, buried deep under items I needed more readily \u2014 oranges, peanuts, drinking water.As we wandered into open country, Ko Phyo let his hand drop into a field that was the color of rust, and came up with a handful of long red chiles. \u201cTry them, they\u2019re sweet,\u201d he said, holding one out to me. They were thin, about the length of my index finger. They did not look sweet, but I bit the end off one.\u201cKo Phyo!\u201d I shouted. My mouth and lips were on fire.\u201cThey\u2019re sweet!\u201d he said, smiling mischievously. He was old enough to work as a guide, but still a kid.That first day, we walked seven hours, until we arrived in the village of Kyut Su. In the common room of a small home built on stilts, we set our packs near a shelf of Buddhist icons. Three mats were spread on the floor where we would sleep. When we poked our heads in the kitchen, our hosts, a middle-aged husband and wife, beckoned us to sit on the floor near the fire. They were joined by their daughter and her young son, and their son-in-law, who poured rice wine in small glasses. Using gestures rather than words, we made a toast.Salty, pleasant smoke floated through the room. A layer of tiny fish were roasting on a screen held over the flame. \u201cWith the rice are these fish,\u201d Ko Phyo translated from Pa-O. \u201cAt the end of the harvest, they take a car battery and \u2014\u201d He mimicked placing the cords of a battery charger into a watery rice paddy. \u201cThe fish float to the top,\u201d he explained.They passed the fish, browned and crunchy, in small bowls. Through a square cut into the bamboo wall, we could see the moon rising, while the fire chased off the growing chill. Conversation went in all directions, with Ko Phyo as the conduit, translating between English, Burmese and Pa-O. But generosity is as much a language as any other; everyone smiled and laughed at the antics of the baby, and our glasses were filled and refilled with rice wine. Soon, our muscles begged for rest; on my mat in the common room, I lowered my eyelids to the smell of wood smoke and the sounds of our hosts whispering good night to each other.In the morning we walked down into a wide, treeless valley. It was hot again, hovering just below 100 degrees, and for the first four hours we talked mostly about a river that Ko Phyo had mentioned. After lunch, we arrived at a small riverside beach. Two men \u2014 solo travelers, one Chinese and one Israeli, who had connected in Yangon \u2014 caught up to us, the first walkers who stayed with us for any length of time. They lingered nearby as Tressa and I took our shoes off and walked over the cool river stones, and then returned to the shore to watch Tanya and Ko Phyo dive into the hollows. \u201cThis is boring,\u201d one of the men said.We were sitting in the shade, on a blanket Tar Ngye had made for us from palm leaves. Nearby, young boys played Burmese pop music and wove bamboo baskets, taking breaks to run into the river. Tar Ngye had cut stalks of bamboo, sharpened them, and stuck them into the ground, hanging our sarongs and Ko Phyo\u2019s hat out to dry. Ko Phyo strode down the river like a sea monster, swinging his skinny arms and legs wildly.\u201cThis is not boring!\u201d Tressa whispered, incredulous.We needed to make it to Tadiy village before nightfall, so we forced our boots back on and hiked across the sun-baked river valley to a broad stony ridge, where we ducked back into the woods, out of the heat, and walked up to an old teak Buddhist monastery. In the courtyard, young monks played soccer, their maroon robes tied above the knees so they could run. Whenever one team scored, the other had to do push-ups. An extended family of tiger-striped cats scooted from monk to monk and up the creaking steps of the monastery, to a balcony that looked out on the soccer pitch and the valley below.Inside, we set our things to the side of the altar, taking care not to turn our bare feet toward the giant, bejeweled Buddhas, a sign of disrespect. As the sun fell, we stood in shoulder-high concrete baths, pouring bowls of cold water, cruel but delicious, over ourselves. We returned, in our least dirty clothes, and sat around a candlelit table.Earlier in the day, during one of our many stops at a farmer\u2019s field, Tar Ngye had dug into the soil and come up with a dozen tiny potatoes cradled in his palm. They were now rolling, crisped and roasted, on our plates, next to noodles and Burmese salads, or thokes, made from tea leaves and beans. The monastery was a popular place for travelers to rest, and we were joined by other young porters and cooks. As the monks disappeared into the building for final prayers, Ko Phyo, Tar Ngye and the other guides told ghost stories until we could barely make out the shape of the giant, antique temple in the dark.The three of us were quiet as the men talked, silently preparing ourselves for our final walk the next morning to the town of Indein on Inle Lake. As villagers collected water for their day, we would descend from the remote highland villages down a boulder-strewn path to the port, where we\u2019d catch a longboat taxi back to our emails and our suitcases and our return flights. My feet ached but I did not want to stop. Days of walking had dissolved something in me \u2014 a hardness, a wariness that came from living in New York, where resources are something guarded rather than shared.In the pitch dark, we sneaked back into the monastery and lay on the ground. Sleep would come quickly, as it had the night before. But in the candlelight, I kept my eyes open as long as I could. I could barely make out the prayers painted on the soaring teak framework that rose over our heads. We would wake long before sunrise to the chanting of monks. I looked forward to that moment, but before I got there, I was content to watch the shadows of cats and monks moving silently across a wooden sky. I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.December through February is the best time to visit Shan State, when rainfall is low and temperatures milder, although overnight stops may be crowded with other travelers. The walk we took is of moderate difficulty, with steep climbs and limited shade. The distance can vary depending on your route, but for a three-day trip, count on walking at least five or six hours each day.On Oct. 7, the State Department issued a travel alert, scheduled to be in effect until Dec. 20, for Myanmar, advising Americans to be cautious during the aftermath of the country\u2019s recent landmark election, in which the pro-democracy opposition led by the Nobel-Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi won a staggering parliamentary majority.Additionally, clashes erupt from time to time between rebels and government forces in the northern part of Shan State, near the border with China. Despite the country\u2019s substantial steps toward democracy, the government retains a stranglehold on the economy \u2014 it is a good idea to support local businesses and communities whenever possible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Reject New York City IDs, Leaving \u2018Unbanked\u2019 on Sidelines", "Date": "2015-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than 670,000 people have obtained the identification cards since the program began in January. One of the program\u2019s goals is to help many of those people obtain bank accounts.The banks\u2019 reluctance threatens to leave thousands of undocumented immigrants and others on the margins of the financial system. For now, many are stuck with costly alternatives like check cashing services that take out a big chunk of a worker\u2019s pay. Or they carry wads of cash around, potentially jeopardizing their safety.For years, the nation\u2019s banking giants have said they support efforts to extend basic banking services to the estimated nine million American households that are \u201cunbanked,\u201d with no savings or checking account.In the case of the New York ID cards, those efforts are bumping up against another issue facing the big banks: protecting accounts from fraud and money laundering. In recent years, banks have had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines to settle investigations that found they had failed to adequately prevent money tainted by terrorism or illegal drugs from flowing through their branches.Caught in the middle are people like Donaldo C. Espinoza, a construction worker in the Bronx, who was unable to get a bank account with the ID card; and Blanca Perez, a housekeeper in Queens, who could not cash a check at Citibank using the ID she got after seeing a commercial for it on Univision, the Spanish-language TV network.Still, their letter did not compel the banks to accept the IDs, ultimately leaving the decision up to the individual financial institutions, which must \u201cassess the risk presented\u201d by each customer.For the big banks, the regulatory guidance was not enough to ease their concerns about being held liable if fraudulent or suspicious accounts were opened with the cards, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cThese are business judgments,\u201d said Michael P. Smith, president of the New York Bankers Association. \u201cIt is ultimately the institution that has to pass muster if there were ever a problem.\u201dBank of America will accept the card only as a secondary form of photo identification. Citigroup is planning to accept the IDs as a secondary proof of identification starting next year. JPMorgan does not accept the card at all.A JPMorgan spokesman, noting that 35 percent of the bank\u2019s branches are in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, said, \u201cWe are committed to meeting the needs of communities where we do business.\u201dSome who advocate the use of the ID cards question whether the refusal to accept them has less to do with security concerns and more to do with protecting the bottom line. Regulations reining in fees have reduced the profits banks can make from low-income customers, putting the city\u2019s immigrants among the least attractive sources of potential customers.\u201cIf New Yorkers who rely on IDNYC were perceived to be highly profitable customers, the big banks would no doubt change their tune,\u201d said Deyanira Del R\u00edo, a co-director of New Economy Project, which works with community groups in New York.The lack of acceptance of the New York ID cards was among several concerns the nonprofit group highlighted in a letter last month to banking regulators. In the letter, 16 advocacy groups take particular umbrage with JPMorgan, the country\u2019s largest bank, for what they say are its failures to serve the credit needs of low-income and minority communities.The advocacy groups focused on JPMorgan in part because it is the city\u2019s biggest bank.A spokesman for the bank said that Chase Liquid, a prepaid card, \u201chas helped more than a million people gain access to mainstream banking.\u201dThe municipal ID cards are available to all New Yorkers over the age of 14. While the mayor\u2019s office says it cannot track the exact number of immigrants with the cards, it has seen some encouraging signs. In the Corona Park neighborhood of Queens, for example, about 20 percent of the area\u2019s approximately 150,000 residents have the cards, according to the mayor\u2019s office.Late Wednesday afternoon, at an unrelated event in Brooklyn, the mayor defended the ID card program, saying the cards were being accepted by many banks, credit unions and other organizations and have \u201chad a big impact on everything else in people\u2019s lives, whether it is going for a lease, going for a library card, getting into their child\u2019s school when they have to show an ID.\u201dAs for the banks that have declined to accept the card, the mayor said: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to talk to them, and we\u2019re certainly going to help them to understand.\u201d He expressed confidence that the banks\u2019 concerns could be overcome.\u201cI think we can educate these banks about the fact that it is both an extraordinarily accurate ID, but it\u2019s the right thing to do for New York City.\u201dTo obtain an IDNYC, city residents must produce a form of photo identification and proof of their address, which the United States Postal Service has to confirm. The cards also feature holographic images, laser engraving and other security features to prevent forgery.The cards are intended to give New Yorkers broad access around the city, where it is nearly impossible to get into a government or commercial office building without showing some form of government-issued ID.Since taking office in 2014, Mr. de Blasio has pledged to find ways to narrow the gulf between the city\u2019s richest and poorest residents.A part of that effort, the mayor has said, is making it easier for all New York City residents to gain access to services provided by the city and its many institutions.For Mr. Espinoza, the 54-year-old construction worker, the need for a bank account was even more straightforward. He needed a place to put his money that was safer than under a mattress in his Bronx apartment.He signed up for a card in order to open a bank account. But the employee at the Bank of America branch in Lower Manhattan told him that the bank would not accept the card as a primary form of identification, he said.\u201cI was confused,\u201d Mr. Espinoza, who is originally from Honduras, recalled in an interview. \u201cThey told me at the NY ID office that this would work to open up a bank account.\u201dIn the end, Mr. Espinoza said he had to miss a day of work and spend $70 to renew his Honduran passport, which he used to open an account at the bank.Not every immigrant, advocates said in interviews, has the documents needed or feels comfortable going to the embassy of their home country to obtain a passport. The IDNYC, which assigns a number to each card, is intended to validate a New Yorker\u2019s identity regardless of their immigration status.Banks are not required by regulators to ensure that their customers are United States citizens or whether they are living in the country legally. Regulators are primarily concerned that the banks can verify that customers are who they say they are.With that requirement in mind, the de Blasio administration and the New York Bankers Association contacted the federal banking regulators this year asking for guidance on whether the IDNYC cards could be used as a proof of identity.In April, the regulators responded with what consumer advocates interpreted as an affirmation of the cards. The cards, the regulators outlined in the letter, could be used as a \u201cmeans of documentary verification.\u201d But ultimately, the regulators left the decisions up to the banks, writing that a bank \u201cmay determine that more information than the ID Card is necessary.\u201dThe city stands firmly behind the security features of the cards, emphasizing, as they mayor did, that a dozen credit unions and smaller banks are willing to accept the cards as primary IDs.Nisha Agarwal, commissioner of the mayor\u2019s office of immigrant affairs, and Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, said the city plans to \u201ckeep talking\u201d to the banks about the cards.\u201cWe have done the work with the regulators,\u201d Ms. Agarwal said. \u201cIf there is something else we can do to be helpful with the banks, we will.\u201dIn a statement released Wednesday, Mr. Stringer said his office would contact every bank \u201cto discuss what steps they are taking to change their policy.\u201dWhile acknowledging that the guidance from regulators was far from an \u201cironclad\u201d endorsement of the cards, Keith Mestrich, the chief executive of Amalgamated Bank, said he considered the city cards as sufficient proof of identity and residency.Amalgamated still requires potential customers to produce a taxpayer ID number from the I.R.S. or the Social Security Administration, along with the city-issued cards. It has opened about 250 accounts with the IDNYC.\u201cWe think protections that are put in place are just as strong as most state drivers\u2019 licenses,\u201d Mr. Mestrich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the big banks won\u2019t take them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Grenada", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate21 Photos$2.2 MILLIONOn the southern coast of Grenada and down a narrow peninsula dotted with spacious homes sits Villa Calivigny, a contemporary five-bedroom home built in 2011 on around half an acre, with traditional Caribbean features. Its name comes from the harbor the property overlooks, said Richard Mangnall, the original owner and now the seller. Because of the home\u2019s placement on the peninsula and the layout of its bedrooms and living areas, \u201cyou can see the sea from both sides,\u201d Mr. Mangnall said.The house, built of concrete and painted a cream color, has a clean-lined, uncomplicated exterior featuring a large central gable with a smaller one on either side. From the driveway, a portico leads to double doors that open onto a lofty entrance. Down a few steps is the central living space, a great room. The 17-foot vaulted ceilings have exposed pitch pine beams, painted white. Many of the furnishings and decorative accents are also white. (The home\u2019s furnishings are not included in the purchase price but are negotiable, Mr. Mangnall said.) This luminous palette, combined with a large seafront terrace accessible from the great room, lend the central living quarters \u201ca very lofty, airy feel,\u201d Mr. Mangnall said from his home in central England; the Grenada house is a second home.To the left of the great room are an open kitchen with a central island, views of the water and the garden, and handmade cabinets imported from the United States. A dining area holds a table for eight. A study, which can also serve as a bedroom, is tucked away opposite the kitchen. Just past the front door and before the great room, a small hallway leads to three bedrooms, each with an ensuite bath. There is another bath on this level, and there are one and a half baths downstairs.\u201cWe designed the house so that the ocean breeze blows in on one side of the bedrooms and out the opposite side,\u201d so air-conditioning is seldom needed, Mr. Mangnall said. (The 5,050-square-foot home does have air-conditioning in the bedrooms and in the media room downstairs and ceiling fans throughout.) The property is on a slope, which is typical in that area. A staircase off the front hallway descends to a two-car garage, the media room, a laundry room and storage space. The bottom floor also has a one-bedroom apartment for staff, with a separate entrance.For Mr. Mangnall, the home\u2019s heart has been the covered terrace, which faces west \u2014 making it perfect for dinner or cocktails against a setting sun. From the terrace, a staircase goes down to a pool and teak lounge chairs. Below the pool deck, a wooden walkway passes over indigenous mangroves and ends at the dock. Grenada\u2019s beaches are all public, so this direct, private water access is precious, Mr. Mangnall said.There\u2019s a market nearby, and many beaches and restaurants are within a short drive. Twenty minutes away are the capital of St. George\u2019s and the airport. The home\u2019s upscale residential neighborhood, Westerhall Point, has a year-round population, not just vacationers, said Paula La Touche-Keller, the owner-broker of Century 21 Grenada Grenadines, which has the listing.MARKET OVERVIEWAs the country\u2019s economy continues to improve following the global recession, Grenada\u2019s high-end properties remain relatively affordable in the region, said Walter Zephirin, managing director of Seventh Heaven Properties, a firm based in London that specializes in Caribbean luxury real estate.\u201cPrices are still significantly cheaper than other Caribbean islands,\u201d Mr. Zephirin said. \u201cBeachfront land and hideaway homes nestled in rain forest overlooking the sea offer investors excellent value.\u201dPrices range from around $500 to $1,500 per square foot, he added. The most desirable areas with real estate investors are coastal zones in the southwest, Mr. Zephirin said.Mrs. La Touche-Keller gave a lower span, starting at $350 per square foot and reaching to around $1,000. Sales prices on those properties range from $1.5 million to $4 million. It\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, she said, with offers 10 percent to 30 percent below asking price being accepted. The vacation rental market is strong, and the island has services to help remote homeowners with maintenance and rental management, she said.Over all, the economy has begun to see growth, and there has been a recent increase in foreign investment in the tourism infrastructure, said Colin Dowe, an associate dean at St. George\u2019s University.One challenge for potential home shoppers: The inventory of homes that would appeal to discerning international buyers is limited, Mrs. La Touche-Keller said. After the country was devastated by two hurricanes about a decade ago and then by the recession, construction picked up. These newer homes like Villa Calivigny cater to that clientele, and they feature modern amenities and polished aesthetics, though with local charm, she said.WHO BUYS IN GRENADAThe high-end residential market is fueled almost exclusively by foreigners buying second homes. The majority of them come from Britain, and interest is developing in the United States and Canada, Mrs. La Touche-Keller said. Grenada has good air service, especially from Britain and the United States, she said.BUYING BASICSForeign property buyers are required to pay the government for an alien landholding license, which costs 10 percent of the property\u2019s value, said Shireen Wilkinson, a lawyer in Grenada.The annual residential property tax rate is 0.2 percent of the land value and 0.3 percent of the building value.Buyers must also pay a 15 percent value-added tax and a stamp duty of 1 percent of the purchase price, in order to register the property with the government. Purchases are handled by a local attorney, paid for by the buyer, and legal fees are up to 2 percent of the purchase price.Grenada recently revamped its citizenship by investment program, which is another avenue for property ownership there.WEB SITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish; East Caribbean dollar (1 East Caribbean dollar = $0.37)TAXES AND FEESThe property taxes last year were approximately $870.

{"Headline": "The Year of Champagnes You\u2019ve Never Heard Of", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourShopping for wine often requires plunging into the unknown. That is especially true this year for Champagne, because a new wave of small grower-producers on the shelves can mystify even the seasoned wine lover: \u00c9ric Rodez, Guillaume Sergent, Suenen, Bourgeois-Diaz, for a start. Who are these guys?If you love Champagne, you will want to get to know these small producers, some of whom I\u2019ve encountered for the first time.Once, in another universe maybe 25 years ago, shopping for Champagne was not complicated. You simply had to familiarize yourself with a few of a couple of dozen big houses.These grandes marques, or great brands, all professed to have a house style, which they adhered to year after year by blending wines from different terroirs within the Champagne region and from different vintages. Whereas fine wine from almost every other region in the world sought to express the particularities of place and vintage, Champagne prided itself on a mingled consistency year after year.But that easy world began to change in the 1990s with a trickle of grower-producers, small farmers who grew their own grapes and made their own wines, into the international market.Without the vast blending capacity of the big houses, these grower-produced Champagnes, like other wines, displayed the singular qualities of terroir and often differed from vintage to vintage. They offered a stark contrast to the too-often-bland consistency of the big houses.With time, as they became more familiar, they began to challenge the notion of what Champagne was. No longer could the big houses coast on their well-marketed definition of Champagne as a celebratory beverage of the cellar. No, the success of the grower-producers redefined Champagne as a wine and forced the entire region to raise its game.It also greatly increased demand for these smaller producers, even if they still account for only a small percentage of sales. In 2014, almost a million bottles of grower Champagne were shipped to the United States, up from about 273,000 in 2000, according to the Comit\u00e9 Champagne, a trade association. While this accounted for only 5 percent of the Champagne shipped in 2014, that percentage had more than tripled from the 1.4 percent shipped in 2000.All of which leaves American importers thirsting for new grower-producers, and accounts for the flood of unfamiliar Champagnes I\u2019m seeing on the shelves this season. Some of these names are definitely worth getting to know, like \u00c9ric Rodez, whose wines I\u2019ve come to love.Rodez is not a new producer. The family has been making Champagne for generations, but I\u2019ve only just begun to see the wines in the New York market.Rodez is centered in Ambonnay, which is known as pinot noir country, but the producer makes an unusual, superb blanc de blancs ($65) from Ambonnay chardonnay. It is richer and fuller than the blanc de blancs you might find from, say, Vertus, but pure and beautifully balanced with great finesse and minerality. Rodez also makes a more conventional blend of chardonnay and pinot noir, Cuv\u00e9e des Cray\u00e8res ($58), that is voluminous yet graceful, lively and absolutely delicious.Unlike Rodez, Guillaume Sergent is new, not having created his own brand until 2011. But Les Pr\u00e9s Dieu ($48), Sergent\u2019s extra brut blanc de blancs, will get your attention. Though it was bottled very young (Sergent doesn\u2019t have the resources to age the wines properly) it\u2019s unusually graceful and elegant, with creamy mineral flavors.I also loved an extra brut blanc de blancs ($60) from another young producer, Suenen, which showed finesse and precision along with savory, chalky flavors. Yet another delightful blanc de blancs, Conversation ($46), from J. L. Vergnon, a producer who has been available off and on in the United States, was rich, creamy and mineral-laden.I had heard of Veuve Fourny & Fils before, but somehow had never encountered the Champagne in New York. My loss. This small producer makes wonderfully interesting wines, like its entry-level Grande R\u00e9serve ($44), a beautifully detailed blend of 80 percent chardonnay and 20 percent pinot noir with great balance, finesse and tension.By contrast, the Champagnes of Bourgeois-Diaz are entirely different. A Bourgeois-Diaz brut ($46), a blend of pinot meunier, pinot noir and chardonnay, was rustic and loosely knit rather than elegant, but fresh, balanced and full of vibrant life.Not surprisingly, these Champagnes will be available in only a few markets around the United States. For one thing, most grower-producers don\u2019t make enough wine to be distributed nationally. It\u2019s entirely possible that consumers in, say, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta and Portland, Ore., will find different sets of grower-producers.For another, dealing with the complicated three-tier system for distributing wine in the United States \u2014 in which producers must often deal with different distributors (and laws) in each state to reach retailers \u2014 can be far more confusing and time-consuming for small producers than following the simpler rules of the European Union.\u201cThe U.S. is getting more attention because the economy is good, but the three-tier system is discouraging,\u201d said Sam Heitner, director of the U.S. Champagne Bureau, a marketing arm of the Champagne trade. \u201cBut if the E.U. picks up, they may go elsewhere, where they don\u2019t have to deal with multiple distributors.\u201dBy the way, Champagne lovers have long been taught that the easy way to tell the grower-producers from the bigger houses is to read the fine print on the label, where a tiny code distinguishes among NM for n\u00e9gociant-manipulants, or merchant-producers (including grandes marques); RM for r\u00e9coltant-manipulants, or grower-producers; and CM for coop\u00e9rative-manipulants, or co-ops; along with a few less important categories.But the strict definition for each category can complicate matters. Say, for example, that a family grower-producer is passed from the parents to their three children. Under French law, the estate will have to be equally divided among the siblings. Perhaps one will own the production facilities and the others the vineyards. The producer will then have to buy the grapes from the two vineyard owners, transforming what had been an RM into an NM. Same estate, just organized differently.Or a small family estate may buy a few well-chosen lots of grapes to supplement its own vineyard. This, too, renders it an NM, even though it possesses an RM point of view.As always in wine, know the producer above all else.Here are a few small Champagne producers well worth seeking out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have Your Goose and Afford to Roast It, Too", "Date": "2015-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThose who fret about the cost of holiday gift-giving can take some comfort this year that the prices of the fanciful presents, starting with a partridge in a pear tree, tracked annually as a humorous gauge of inflation have risen a scant 0.6 percent from last year.The percentages in both cases reflect the \u201call items\u201d C.P.I. \u2014 including volatile energy and food prices in the federal version and, in the PNC version, the swans, prices of which have been subject to wild swings in some years. Excluding those categories results in the so-called core C.P.I. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that the core C.P.I. increased 2 percent over the last year, compared with 1 percent for the PNC\u2019s Christmas gift index.Despite the modest run-up for the gifts, the price tag would still be a hefty $34,131, an increase of $198 from last year.\u201cLow commodity prices and a decline in energy prices this year are keeping consumer prices down,\u201d said James P. Dunigan, managing executive for investments at PNC.While the cost of the partridge\u2019s perch, the famous pear tree, increased only 1.2 percent, to $190 this year, checking the partridge off the gift list would be significantly more expensive than last year. At $25, it would cost 25 percent more than in 2014, because the game birds are becoming popular among foodies, according to PNC\u2019s research. Higher grain prices pushed up the cost of the two turtle doves in the English Christmas carol by 11.5 percent, to $290.Underscoring the negligible evidence of inflation, this was the second year that the prices of the gifts and services, perhaps whimsical and extravagant by today\u2019s standards, did not rise much, most likely because of the slow economic recovery. Last year, the outlay for the gift extravaganza rose only 0.8 percent from 2013.Flat prices, Mr. Dunigan said, \u201cmean true loves can have their goose and better afford the gas to roast it, too.\u201dAmong the fowl, the trumpeter swans, celebrated in the carol as \u201cseven swans-a-swimming\u201d remained stable at $1,875 apiece, after wide swings in demand over the decades prompted volatile prices.The price of the five gold rings listed in the song stayed constant, at $750 total, the same as the last two years even though gold commodity prices have fluctuated, keeping the gift an affordable option for last-minute shoppers.Services, and there are many in the verses of this song from an era of cheap workers, also did not get a lift this year. The costs of nine ladies dancing, at $7,553; 11 pipers piping, at $2,635; and 12 drummers drumming, at $2,855, have not budged in the last two years, in keeping with slow economic growth.The only unskilled labor, the eight maids-a-milking, also costs the same, $58, because there has been no wage increase since the federal minimum wage was raised in 2009.The only workers to catch a break were the 10 lords-a-leaping, whose cost was up 3 percent, to $5,509, from $5,348, according to information supplied by the Pennsylvania Ballet and the modern dance group Philadanco.To catch the fancy of people who may not be interested in the economy\u2019s more prosaic machinations, PNC began collecting the data annually from sources as varied as bird hatcheries, jewelers and dance troupes. Over the decades, PNC has added educational materials for teachers to promote interest among students in factors like labor costs and inflation that affect the current economy.Putting a more modern twist on acquiring the 12 goods and services, the index also tracks how much it would cost to skip shopping in retail stores, and instead order the birds and other items online. Shipping swans and other unruly fowl is not cheap. Relying on e-commerce to assemble and deliver gifts would drive up the price by an additional $9,496 this year, for a grand total of $43,627.But those with mansions equipped with aviaries, barnyards and accommodations for entertainers can shell out much more for the full complement of gifts in the repeated verses of the song \u2014 364 in all.That total would be $155,407, not far off the $150,000 that the Neiman Marcus 2015 holiday catalog of \u201cfantasy gifts\u201d charges for a 121-horsepower motorcycle designed by the actor Keanu Reeves (and a two-day chopper ride along the California coast).Either way, it would be a memorable gift package for the loved one who has everything.An article on Monday about the inflation-adjusted price of the gifts in \u201cThe 12 Days of Christmas\u201d misstated the increase in the government\u2019s Consumer Price Index for the previous 12 months. It was 0.5 percent, not 0.2 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mutual Fund Equivalent of Bankruptcy", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn DebtLast week, Third Avenue Management said it was halting redemptions from its Focused Credit Fund and would instead liquidate the fund through a trust mechanism. That is, the fund has closed its doors and will pay out when it can. No more daily liquidity for investors. It is as if the fund is in bankruptcy, without the transparency associated with the normal bankruptcy process.The key question is probably whether this spreads beyond junk bond funds. Regulators can avoid some of the political pressure here by making a kind of \u201cassumption of the risk\u201d argument: Investors who buy funds that invest in high-risk, low-quality debtor firms are simply incurring a risk they were paid to take, even if it is coming in a form slightly different than expected.But if the broader universe of bond funds were to come under pressure, regulators would have to be worried about the effects on the economy.

{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s Next Finance Chief Meets Debt Dispute Mediator", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArgentina\u2019s incoming secretary of finance met this week with the arbiter of a bitter decade-long legal dispute between the country and a group of New York hedge funds, opening a new path toward a potential resolution.Luis Caputo, a former banker and soon to be the finance secretary, traveled to New York to meet with Daniel A. Pollack, a court-appointed special master who has been tasked with mediating negotiations, according to a statement from Mr. Pollack\u2019s office.The meeting was sought by Mr. Caputo, who will begin his new role on Thursday. It follows a meeting between the group of creditors, led by the billionaire Paul E. Singer, and Mr. Pollack last week.While no negotiations to resolve litigation occurred in either meeting, Mr. Caputo expressed the intention of the new administration under President-elect Mauricio Macri to begin negotiations promptly once the new government is sworn in, according to the statement.Among Mr. Macri\u2019s priorities will be to reignite a beleaguered economy, and he has pledged to loosen currency controls and lower export tariffs. Mr. Macri has also said he would negotiate with the country\u2019s holdout creditors.The news will raise fresh hopes that both sides can resolve the protracted fight, which has left Argentina almost entirely locked out of international capital markets. Whether Mr. Macri\u2019s administration can come to an agreement with the holdout creditors will be a test of that pledge.NML Capital, a unit of Elliott Management, has led a group of holdout investors in seeking full repayment of the bonds Argentina defaulted on. After the default, the Argentine government offered to exchange those defaulted bonds with new \u201cexchange bonds\u201d that were worth significantly less.The dispute has raised ire among Argentines and fueled tensions. In Buenos Aires, graffiti of vultures is strewn across the city, referring to NML Capital, other creditors and Judge Griesa.Mr. Singer has asserted that the creditors are willing to negotiate with Argentina. But under the last Kirchner administration, neither side sat down to negotiate, Mr. Singer recently said.For now, the prospect of a new creditor-friendly administration in Argentina has been met with optimism in the market. The benchmark government bonds that expire in 2024 have rallied since Mr. Macri\u2019s ratings first went up in the polls, said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin American fixed income strategy at Nomura.\u201cI think Argentina will prioritize a normalization of creditor relations, as market access could help smooth the transition,\u201d Ms. Morden said, adding, \u201cAs a former Wall Streeter, Caputo has the perfect credentials to lead negotiations.\u201dJonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Grants Approval for Development of Giant Offshore Gas Field", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deal adds to the industry momentum in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, which could emerge as a big new source of natural gas, which is increasingly in demand around the world as a cleaner-energy alternative to coal.Although the big gas field in question is expected to help make Israel an energy exporter for the first time, Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday emphasized the national security implications, saying development of the field would give the country more energy options. Authorizing the deal, Mr. Netanyahu dismissed objections by political opponents and from the Israeli antitrust commissioner, who had opposed the agreement on the grounds that it would give too much market power to the team led by the American company, Noble Energy.The American company, which has received political support from the Obama administration, and its partners from the Delek Group, an Israeli conglomerate, have made major gas discoveries in Israeli territory in the Mediterranean in recent years. They already produce gas from a field called Tamar and now intend to develop the much bigger field, which is called Leviathan, and to expand Tamar\u2019s production.Tamar meets about half of Israel\u2019s electricity needs. But Leviathan is thought to contain twice as much natural gas, an estimated 22 trillion cubic feet, which even at current low global prices could be worth as much as $120 billion.Noble had already reached preliminary agreements to export gas to Jordan and Egypt, and to the wider market through liquefied natural gas terminals in Egypt that now stand idle for lack of supply.Noble\u2019s vice president for the eastern Mediterranean, Keith Elliott, hailed the approval of the deal on Thursday. \u201cThis enables us to move forward with development planning,\u201d he said in a statement.Mr. Elliott said in a telephone interview that demand for natural gas remained strong in the region. Egypt, Jordan and Israel are all \u201cdramatically undersupplied,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see that continuing to be the case for the foreseeable future.\u201dNoble and Delek are also involved in a consortium with rights to develop an offshore gas field in Cypriot waters in the eastern Mediterranean. In November, Noble sold a stake in that project to the British energy giant BG Group.\u201cThis deal is vital, it is vital for our security,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said after announcing the completion of the agreement during a visit to an Israeli industrial park. \u201cWe do not want to be left with only one power station that gets fired upon, or only one gas field or rig that gets fired upon.\u201dMr. Netanyahu and the Israeli energy minister had long pushed for the companies\u2019 development of the Leviathan field. But in the end, Mr. Netanyahu had to invoke a never-before-used national security clause to overrule the antitrust office. Lately, the closer the Israeli government has come to completing the deal, the more intense the popular resistance. The Zionist Union, the center-left party that leads the opposition in the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, said on Thursday that it would petition the High Court of Justice over what it described as the prime minister\u2019s cynical use of powers linked to state security.For many Israelis, however, the potential benefits of the country becoming not only self-sufficient in natural gas but also an energy exporter have been tainted by worries that Noble and its Israeli partners were becoming too powerful.Thousands of Israelis have demonstrated against the deal in Tel Aviv and in other cities.The agreement allows the Noble-Delek team to develop Leviathan in return for concessions that include the companies\u2019 reducing their stake in Tamar and selling two smaller offshore gas fields. Noble currently owns about 36 percent of Tamar and 40 percent of Leviathan.Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Pennsylvania, a Steel Mill and Its Workers at a Crossroads", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by6 PhotosBRACKENRIDGE, Pa. \u2014 For two years, Chris Cummings, a maintenance mechanic, worked 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. six days a week to help prepare for the opening of a gigantic $1.2 billion steel rolling mill that was supposed to bring hundreds of secure, well-paying jobs to the Allegheny River Valley.Since Aug. 15, Allegheny has locked out 2,200 workers at 12 plants in six states in what has become one of the nation\u2019s largest and longest work stoppages in years.As unions have weakened in recent decades, more corporations have turned to lockouts to wring givebacks from their workers. In this latest showdown, Allegheny has taken on the nation\u2019s biggest, most combative industrial union. If the steelworkers lose, it could prompt another wave of me-too concessions and represent a further humbling of organized labor just as it was starting to gain ground on other fronts.\u201cThe employer is playing hardball, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said Richard Hurd, a professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University. \u201cIt puts a lot of pressure on the workers and the union.\u201dAlready, Allegheny\u2019s three-and-a-half-month lockout has dealt a painful blow to this aging, blue-collar town, 22 miles upstream from Pittsburgh, raising doubts about whether the new rolling mill, with its bright blue walls soaring 40 feet above the river, will ever provide the big economic lift it had promised.Company executives say that they need lower labor costs and that no one will gain if the new plant can\u2019t thrive in the global economy.But many steelworkers say Allegheny is seeking to enhance its own prosperity at their expense. They contend the company is undermining the middle class in the nation\u2019s industrial heartland by demanding a two-tier contract with lesser benefits for future hires, insisting upon a four-year wage freeze and requiring many employees to pay at least $2,000 more a year for health coverage.\u201cThis is our reward for putting in all this overtime to help open the new mill?\u201d asked Mr. Cummings. \u201cI do think it\u2019s absolutely necessary for the company to stay competitive. But they\u2019re asking too much.\u201dDuring his 70-hour workweeks, Mr. Cummings said he often returned home after his son, now 6, and his daughter, now 20 months, were in bed. \u201cMy wife was telling me she felt like a single mom,\u201d he said.After locking out its workers, the company brought in hundreds of temporary replacements. The unionized workers have been picketing outside the plant around the clock, with signs mocking the replacement workers, saying things like \u201cDanger: Scabs Trying to Run Mill\u201d and \u201cScabs Equal Dishonor.\u201dInstead of picketing, Fran Arabia, president of the steelworkers\u2019 local here, said, \u201cwe should be cutting a ribbon right now.\u201dWeek by week, the locked-out workers are growing more anxious. The company terminated their health coverage on Nov. 30. Christmas and freezing weather are approaching, and their six months of unemployment insurance will run out in February.Robert S. Wetherbee, the president of Allegheny\u2019s Flat-Rolled Products division, said the company needed to drive a hard bargain because the market had shifted significantly. Stainless steel prices are down 30 percent since April and Chinese producers are gaining a greater share of the business. The company\u2019s flat-rolled division, he said, lost money in 10 of the last 11 quarters.Mr. Wetherbee said Allegheny\u2019s workers were very well paid, averaging $70 an hour in compensation, including pensions, health coverage, overtime and paid time off, some $20 higher per hour than its competitors. The union called those numbers vastly exaggerated.\u201cIt became a competitiveness issue and to some degree a survival issue for the stainless steel portion of our business,\u201d Mr. Wetherbee said. \u201cWith this mill, we invested close to $400,000 per job in the Allegheny Valley. Now we have the obligation to keep the business competitive.\u201dThe new rolling mill \u2014 four football fields long \u2014 is a marvel of automation. Workers hunch over control panels that monitor six powerful milling machines that press, squeeze and flatten two-foot-thick red-hot slabs into nearly mile-long coils of thin steel sheet in a matter of seconds.With one-third of Allegheny\u2019s blue-collar employees eligible to retire before 2020, Mr. Wetherbee said it made sense to seek a two-tier contract.\u201cWe\u2019re faced with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bend the cost curve on a major part of our costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be competitive, we have to be in a position where we have a different benefit structure for the next generation we hire.\u201dLike many unions, the United Steelworkers abhor two-tier contracts, convinced that they sell out future generations and sow tensions between older and younger workers.The steelworkers complain that Allegheny wants to replace traditional pensions with less generous 401(k)\u2019s for new workers and to give them a health plan that is not as good as the one current workers have. Under the two-tier proposal, future workers, upon retiring, would have a more meager health plan and no life insurance.\u201cThe China crisis of today doesn\u2019t mean that people who go to work for this company and retire 35 years from now shouldn\u2019t have anything in retirement,\u201d said Tom Conway, the steelworkers\u2019 vice president overseeing the negotiations. \u201cWe\u2019ve made major moves in this bargaining, to share more of the health costs, and it\u2019s just not enough for them.\u201dNot long ago, when the company was called Allegheny-Ludlum, workers endearingly called it \u201cUncle Al\u201d because of its generosity. But the steelworkers say Mr. Wetherbee, who joined Allegheny in 2010 after 30 years at Alcoa, has brought a more confrontational approach.\u201cHe told us that they couldn\u2019t be this paternalistic,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cIf this is paternalistic, I\u2019d hate to see what an abusive parent is like.\u201dAnalysts are divided over the concessions the company is seeking.Paul Clark, director of Penn State\u2019s School of Labor and Employment Relations, said Allegheny was seeking to exploit the temporary fall in prices and profits to extract deep permanent cuts. \u201cThey\u2019re using the excuse of the industry downturn,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just to adjust to the new situation; they want to go well beyond what\u2019s justified by the downturn.\u201dBut John Tumazos, a steel industry analyst in Holmdel, N.J., criticized the union\u2019s approach. \u201cLeo Gerard, the union\u2019s president, is thinking of the century-old model, holding rallies in downtown Pittsburgh and mill towns, when this company is between a rock and a hard place,\u201d Mr. Tumazos said. \u201cThe union isn\u2019t making things better. They should be holding their protest rallies in Beijing.\u201dAccording to Allegheny Technologies, the steelworkers averaged $94,000 in pay last year, including incentive pay and overtime. \u201cThat\u2019s not middle class, that\u2019s upper middle class,\u201d said Dan Greenfield, the company\u2019s vice president for investor relations.Todd Barbiaux, an overhead crane operator, derided that figure, saying it failed to take account of last year\u2019s unusual situation.\u201cIn reality we\u2019re $60,000-a-year guys,\u201d he said, even when incentive pay and Sunday differential are added to the steelworkers\u2019 base wage of $24.99 an hour. With the push to build the new mill, he made over $100,000 last year only because of \u201ca lot of 80-hour weeks, with more than 600 hours overtime.\u201d But that\u2019s not normal, he said. \u201cYou\u2019re working one and a half years in a year.\u201dThe steelworkers are further angered because they\u2019re being pressed for major concessions after Allegheny\u2019s chief executive, Richard Harshman, received $8 million in compensation last year, up 70 percent from the previous year. His 2014 pay jumped because of a larger base salary, a $1.4 million bonus, more stock awards and a pension that was valued higher.Mr. Harshman told analysts in October that the company\u2019s production was meeting expectations notwithstanding the lockout. But the steelworkers dispute that. As they spend their days picketing, they say they see far fewer trucks carrying steel coil out of the plant.The union, asserting that the company has violated labor laws, has asked the National Labor Relations Board to declare the lockout illegal and order the company to pay more than $30 million in back wages. Company officials insist the lockout is lawful.Scott Laliberte, who fixes brick linings in Allegheny\u2019s steel furnaces, said he sometimes worked 30 days in a row last year, allowing him to save extra money. But the physical strain was too much. \u201cYou feel you don\u2019t have a life,\u201d he said.The lockout is taking a further toll on his family, he said. \u201cIf this goes on,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll probably find another job and not go back. They\u2019re going to lose a lot of good people.\u201dThe union wants to return to regular workdays, after having agreed to extra-long workweeks to get the new rolling mill running. Mr. Laliberte and other steelworkers are fuming that the company\u2019s proposal would allow it to require such schedules as it sees fit, including 16-hour days and 70-hour weeks.Mr. Wetherbee said Allegheny would never have another opportunity like this to bring down costs and assure profitability. \u201cWe decided we couldn\u2019t kick the can down the road any further,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Candidates Viewing Economy\u2019s Past Through Gold-Colored Glasses", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rhetoric is rooted in concern that the Fed\u2019s efforts to revive economic growth have loosened its hold on inflation. A gold standard, proponents argue, would limit the Fed\u2019s ability to create money, thus ensuring prices remain stable.But economic historians describe this as nostalgia for a time that never was. Proponents of the gold standard generally overstate the benefits of putting golden handcuffs on a central bank, historians say, and the costs of that reduced flexibility are considerable.\u201cYou can do a lot better than a gold standard,\u201d said Michael Bordo, an economist and director of the Center for Monetary and Financial History at Rutgers University. He described the political interest in the precious metal as \u201cpretty crazy.\u201dThe gold standard was invented to constrain government spending. Nations that agreed to exchange money for gold thought twice before printing more money. And lately, Republicans have found themselves yearning for such restraint.After the 2008 recession, the Fed began a campaign to stimulate economic growth. It has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it put further pressure on long-term rates by creating trillions of dollars to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds. Both measures aimed to spur risk-taking by investors and borrowing by businesses and consumers.Instead, four years later, inflation remains unusually sluggish. Some economists and Fed officials argue the economy would benefit from a little more. But the language of the Fed\u2019s critics remains heated.\u201cInstead of adjusting monetary policy according to whims and getting it wrong over and over again and causing booms and busts, what the Fed should be doing is, No. 1, keeping our money tied to a stable level of gold,\u201d Mr. Cruz said last month during a Republican presidential debate.\u201cIf it\u2019s not going to be gold, make it the commodity basket,\u201d Mr. Huckabee said.Economists generally regard a gold standard as a crude and outdated method of inflation control. There is nothing inherently stable about the value of gold. It fluctuates, like the value of everything else, as more is extracted from the ground and as demand waxes and wanes.\u201cThe real world is a complex place,\u201d Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in a recent defense of the need for human judgment in making monetary policy. \u201cDriverless cars would veer from side to side and cause crashes if their guidance algorithm was limited to just maintaining the distance from the car in front of them, instead of assimilating more information as they went. The U.S. economy cannot be safely run on autopilot either.\u201dBarry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley, said life under the gold standard, during its heyday around the turn of the last century, more closely resembled modern central banking than is commonly recognized. The Bank of England held extra gold so it could print extra money if necessary, for example, and nations frequently suspended their standards during periods of extreme duress.But Mr. Eichengreen emphasized that these leniencies proved insufficient, and that policy makers had made \u201csteady and significant progress\u201d in the intervening decades toward improving the management of monetary policy.\u201cThere is a long history in the United States, going back to Andrew Jackson, of deep skepticism of the power of anonymous financial technocrats,\u201d Mr. Eichengreen said. \u201cThis wish to substitute simple rules partly reflects a strain of political ideology that thinks government intervention only causes problems and never solves them. And partly it reflects a lack of careful understanding of how these earlier regimes work.\u201dIn fact, the gold standard did not even work during periods of calm. What is often described as an era of stable prices was more like a roller-coaster ride that ended back where it began, after bursts of inflation and deflation.Mr. Bordo has calculated that economic volatility in the United States was significantly greater during the gold standard years, and the nation\u2019s unemployment rate, on average, was almost a full percentage point higher.\u201cWhen people look back and say the gold standard was wonderful, they forget about the short-run swings,\u201d he said.The last few years have served as a reminder that steering straight ahead is not necessarily the best policy during a storm. After the financial crisis, the Fed has embraced responsibility not just for inflation but also for economic and financial stability, and other central banks have followed its path.And congressional Republicans, while levying many of the same criticisms against the Fed as the party\u2019s presidential candidates, have proved unwilling to impose a rigid rule.The House of Representatives last month passed legislation requiring the Fed to choose its own rule for setting interest-rate levels \u2014 a Fed standard \u2014 and explain any deviations. The legislation includes a suggested rule, known as the Taylor Rule, which tries to formalize a balance between economic growth and inflation, effectively allowing some amount of extra money printing during recessions.A similar Senate bill would not require the Fed to pick a rule, but instead to compare its conduct of monetary policy with several reference rules in regular reports to Congress.\u201cWe will not fully realize robust economic growth until the Fed changes the conduct of its monetary policy,\u201d Representative Bill Huizenga, the Michigan Republican who wrote the House bill, said during the final debate on the House floor. He then emphasized that the legislation would leave the Fed free to \u201cdevelop what it believes is the best course of action on monetary policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For the first time, the National Front pulled ahead of France\u2019s mainstream parties, winning about 28 percent of the vote nationally, and taking the lead in six out of 13 French regions.Marine Le Pen, the party\u2019s leader, boasts that the National Front is now \u201cwithout contest the first party of France.\u201d If her party consolidates its gains in next Sunday\u2019s runoff elections, it will have a credible shot at taking power at the national level when a presidential election is held in 2017. That would be ominous for France and Europe, where populist parties are on the rise as fearful and economically distressed citizens revolt against governments and a European Union they feel have failed them.Mr. Hollande\u2019s new popularity could not compensate for his greatest weakness, namely his failure to deliver on the economic front. French joblessness soared in October to 10.6 percent, the highest rate in 18 years. The Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie region, where Ms. Le Pen herself ran, raking in more than 41 percent of the vote, is one of the poorest in France.But French voters who hope the National Front will do better are dangerously misguided. In addition to its alarmingly xenophobic message, the National Front\u2019s prescription to reboot France\u2019s economy by bringing back the French franc and setting the retirement age at 60 would, in fact, do much to kill the patient.France\u2019s two mainstream parties must put aside their bitter differences and unite to defeat the National Front in as many regions as possible in the runoff next Sunday. But looking further ahead, the National Front\u2019s disturbing rise is likely to continue, threatening France and Europe, unless Mr. Hollande\u2019s government creates jobs, restores faith in a more robust economic future and heals deep social divisions, and Mr. Sarkozy can persuade voters that his party represents a serious option.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s G.D.P. Grows, Avoiding a Recession", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe government said on Tuesday that the economy grew at a relatively robust pace last quarter, reversing a more pessimistic estimate it published three weeks ago.Output in Japan, Asia\u2019s second-largest economy, expanded at an annualized rate of 1 percent in the three months through September, according to the revised assessment by the Cabinet Office. The office had originally said the economy contracted by 0.8 percent.The latest report, which reflected more buoyant data on business investment and a rosier view of consumer spending, painted a broadly positive picture of the economy\u2019s recent performance. Estimates for previous quarters were also lifted, showing stronger gains and less severe reversals.The report could relieve the pressure on Japan\u2019s central bank to do more to support growth. Some economists had been predicting that the bank would soon be forced to expand a stimulus program under which it injects trillions of yen into the economy by buying up government bonds.The strategy is meant to lower borrowing costs and encourage consumers and businesses to spend, but the apparent recession, and an accompanying decline in consumer prices, had raised questions about its effectiveness.Sharp revisions to Japanese gross domestic product numbers are not unusual, though the change announced on Tuesday was larger than some in the past. The government\u2019s first estimates are announced before data on certain kinds of economic activity are fully available \u2014 notably changes in corporate investment and inventories.In an economy where trend growth is only slightly above zero, like Japan\u2019s, revisions can more easily make the difference between an increase in output and a decline.The latest numbers will be subject to further review in the future, though revisions tend to grow smaller as time passes.The Japanese stock market opened higher after the report was announced, but quickly gave up those gains, possibly reflecting lower expectations for fresh central bank stimulus. In late morning trading, the Nikkei 225 average was down roughly 0.2 percent.In the biggest change from the initial estimate last month, businesses appeared more confident in their production plans. According to the revised gross domestic product data, spending on new factories and equipment by businesses rose at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent last quarter, compared with an initial estimate of a 1.3 percent decline.Household spending increased 0.5 percent, slightly more than the first estimate of 0.4 percent, and businesses reduced their inventories less aggressively than initially believed.Through the first three quarters of the year, the economy grew at an average rate of about 1.6 percent, according to the latest data \u2014 roughly twice its typical pace of growth over the past two decades. The performance was volatile, however: Output contracted 0.5 percent in the second quarter after surging 4.4 percent in the first.Advertisement"}

A gate and a small garden lead to the front door. A separate staircase connects the four-car garage to the kitchen, said Jessica Webster of Engel & V\u00f6lkers Bogot\u00e1, which has the listing.From a small entrance hall, two steps lead down to a double-height living room with hardwood floors and a gas fireplace. At the far end, a floor-to-ceiling wall of glass with a sliding door opens to a terrace, a barbecue area and gardens. Floor-to-ceiling shelving on one side of the room continues in the library on the mezzanine above, accessible from the master suite.Two steps up to the right of the living room is a study with a sliding door to the front garden. Beyond the entrance hall, the dining room has a porcelain tile floor and a large window overlooking another garden. To the left are a floor-to-ceiling wine rack and a powder room; a door to the right leads to the Italian-style kitchen. Below its granite countertops are dark wood cabinets; glossy cream-colored cabinets hang above, and the floor is ceramic tile. Stainless-steel appliances include a wide, side-by-side refrigerator and freezer, a dishwasher, microwave and wall oven. A stainless-steel hood is above the gas cooktop. To the other side of a U-shaped counter is a breakfast room overlooking a small Japanese courtyard garden, with a waterfall spilling into a tiny pond. Behind the kitchen are staff quarters with a full bath. An office has outside access and a bathroom.To the right of the entry foyer, the staircase landing has a large window. Upstairs, the large, carpeted master bedroom suite has floor-to-ceiling glass with a sliding door to a Juliet balcony overlooking the city. Entrance to the library mezzanine is through a door on the left side of the master suite. The skylit ceramic-tiled master bath has a double shower with two rain shower heads, a double vanity with two ceramic sinks and dark wood shelves, and a toilet. A large walk-in closet is beyond the bathroom.An upstairs den, open to the staircase and three family bedrooms, has sliding louvered doors opening to a backyard with a terrace, steppingstones, a Jacuzzi and a vegetable garden. Two of the three bedrooms have a tiled en-suite bath, each with a single vanity and a shower; the third has a bathroom with a vanity and a tub.Across the terrace is a free-standing room with a sliding-glass door that can be used as a gym or playroom.At street level, the property also includes quarters for two additional staff members, a laundry area, a recycling zone and additional storage space. Doors are armored; there are eight security cameras and a panic room.Along the neighborhood\u2019s winding roads, 20 to 30 minutes from the capital city\u2019s center, are several embassy residences, said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Echenique, managing director and partner at Engel & V\u00f6lkers Bogot\u00e1. The house is close to Chico Park, museums, gyms and supermarkets. It also has easy access to the shops and restaurants at El Parque de la 93, a trendy section of the city, and high-end restaurants in the Zona T and Zona G districts. El Dorado International Airport is a 35- to 40-minute drive.MARKET OVERVIEW\u201cDuring, before and after the global turndown, the economy was very solid, so Colombia became a very interesting place for local and foreign investors, both individual investors and companies,\u201d said Ver\u00f3nica D\u00e1vila, director of Propiedades Julio Corredor, Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Colombia.Starting around 2009, real estate sales boomed, while the country was \u201cperforming very well economically and politically\u201d and there was a \u201cvery high level\u201d of confidence among local and foreign investors, Ms. D\u00e1vila said. But the market started to slow down at the end of 2013, she said.Still, during the last year, high-end properties, the strongest segment of Bogot\u00e1\u2019s market, appreciated more than 10 percent, Mr. Echenique said.The Colombian peso has declined in value by more than 40 percent on average this year, Mr. Echenique said, because of a variety of factors, including the falling price of oil, which Colombia produces and exports. As a result, the real estate market, particularly in Bogot\u00e1, developed \u201can unusual appeal to dollar-paying buyers,\u201d he said, making it possible for them to buy a property at a much lower price than previously.Nevertheless, the number of days residential properties take to sell has increased to 270 days from 180, Ms. D\u00e1vila said. Years of \u201cover investing\u201d in real estate led to too many units built and sold for investors. \u201cNow we don\u2019t have enough final users,\u201d she said, and sales have \u201cbecome slower and slower,\u201d with supply outpacing demand.\u201cThere are many units in the market both for lease and sale, especially in the commercial and residential high-end market,\u201d she said. Because there is no available land, older buildings are demolished for new projects, making \u201cthe initial costs of the new units to be built higher from the start.\u201dWHO BUYS IN BOGOT\u00c1Bogot\u00e1 is still \u201ca very local market,\u201d Ms. D\u00e1vila said. In recent years, because of foreign companies investing in Colombia, buyers have come from Spain, Venezuela and Chile, with some Americans and Europeans.Mr. Echenique said foreign buyers and Colombians living abroad seek the \u201cinnovation, design and quality finish\u201d found in the \"best and newest buildings\" in neighborhoods such as Los Rosales, La Cabrera, Chico, Santa Ana and Santa Barbara.The largest number of foreign buyers in Colombia are in Cartagena, where most properties in the Old City fetch more than $1 million, Ms. D\u00e1vila said.BUYING BASICSWhile there are no special restrictions, foreigners interested in buying property in Colombia should seek \u201cserious and professional real estate counseling,\u201d Mr. Echenique said. Buyers are entitled to acquire residency rights or a residency visa.Real estate transactions are done by a notary. An independent lawyer is recommended.Most foreign buyers pay cash.LANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; Colombian peso (1 peso = $0.00032)TAXES AND FEESFor 2015, the tax on this house was 13 million pesos, or $4,160.Fees associated with buying a home in Colombia are approximately 1.5 percent of the purchase value, according to Mr. Echenique.

A security guard says the staff has to sweep coal dust off the playground every morning. Parents whose children have developed persistent coughs blame the school\u2019s new neighbor: a huge coal-fueled power plant built by Chinese engineers with Chinese aid.The plant is one of a pair that have begun operating in the past five years in this village near the Vietnamese port city of Haiphong. A Shanghai firm completed work on a third plant this year by the old border that separated north from south during the Vietnam War. And another major plant financed by Chinese loans is under construction on the Mekong River Delta south of Ho Chi Minh City.Altogether, Chinese engineering firms have built or signed contracts to build 14 coal-fired plants along the Vietnamese coast over the past five years, most of them with the help of loans from the government\u2019s China Export-Import Bank.The building spree here is hardly unique. Since 2010, Chinese state enterprises have finished, begun building or formally announced plans to build at least 92 coal-fired power plants in 27 countries, according to a review of public documents by The New York Times.\u201cThere is just so much excess capacity in power generation equipment, so if they\u2019re not building it in China, they want to build it abroad,\u201d said Erica Downs, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington.Paul Bledsoe, an energy consultant and former adviser in the Clinton White House, said China often offered \u201cbargain basement prices abroad that are going to be difficult for many developing countries to turn away from.\u201dThe United States, Japan and other industrialized nations have helped finance the construction of coal-fired power plants in the developing world for decades, including in joint projects with China. Like China, they have usually required that contracts go to their companies. But as concerns about climate change have grown, there has been a move away from funding coal projects.In November, the 34 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including the United States and Japan, agreed to limit most state financing to \u201cultrasupercritical plants,\u201d which burn less coal to produce the same amount of electricity.But Chinese state-run firms, usually with loans from big state-owned commercial banks and the China Export-Import Bank and China Development Bank, have been expanding their support of coal-fired plants overseas, building less efficient plants that generate more carbon-dioxide emissions.Since 2010, Chinese commercial and policy banks have committed at least $25 billion to such projects, according to the documents reviewed by The Times, including bond prospectuses and news releases issued by banks. The actual figure is higher because financing figures were available for only 26 of the 92 power stations identified.By comparison, all of the O.E.C.D. nations combined provided $25 billion in government-led financing for coal projects between 2007 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council.Coal-fueled plants account for 68 percent of the electrical generation capacity built by China in the rest of Asia, and that figure is set to rise, according to a recent paper that Phillip Hannam, a scholar at the Princeton Environmental Institute, helped write. By contrast, coal-fueled plants made up only 32 percent of the operating capacity built by other nations without Chinese support.Chinese firms have also built and financed plants in South America and Africa, and this year Romania approved plans for a Chinese-built plant.Experts on international aid said a commitment by China to shift its support from coal to alternative energy projects could have a profound impact on the energy choices made in many developing countries.As other funders have backed off, China\u2019s state development banks and engineering firms have stepped up, allowing projects to go forward that otherwise would not attract investment.\u201cThey are the market leaders, both on capital costs and total costs,\u201d said Thomas Heller, executive director of the Climate Policy Initiative. If Chinese development banks were to match the efforts of the United States and other nations, about $18 billion in financing for coal-fired plants in the works would be taken off the table, and some coal projects would no longer make economic sense, according to an analysis by Mr. Heller\u2019s organization.In addition to the impact on global warming \u2014 and expanded access to electricity \u2014 these projects also mean more smog in countries that have been struggling with the economic and health costs of air pollution.\u201cThe children are in real danger,\u201d says Nguyen Van Dinh, 64, the security guard at the kindergarten here in Tam Tung. \u201cThe coal dust is terrible.\u201dThere are plans to move the kindergarten away. For Vu Thi Dung, 56, who was sitting on a curb waiting to pick up her 4-year-old granddaughter, that could not come soon enough. She said her granddaughter and her 9-month-old grandson have coughs that would not go away.When asked if their children could change schools, the villagers laughed. \u201cWe have no money,\u201d Ms. Vu said.Chau Doan contributed reporting from Tam Hung Commune.

{"Headline": "Obama, Once a Guest, Is Now a Leader in World Talks", "Date": "2015-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Six years ago, President Obama came away from a round of global climate talks bitter and frustrated, having been reduced to personally chasing other world leaders around a Copenhagen conference center and bursting uninvited into a meeting with them to salvage a pact that left many disappointed.\u201cWe met the moment,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ve shown what\u2019s possible when the world stands as one.\u201dA group of 195 nations reached a landmark climate agreement on Saturday. Here is what it means for the planet, business, politics and other areas.For Mr. Obama, the agreement represents a legacy-shaping success, destined to join his health care law in the annals of his most lasting achievements.The deal, reached after two weeks of intensive negotiating by world leaders and top diplomats, is a vindication of Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to make tackling climate change a centerpiece of his second term. As the economy improved and Mr. Obama was able to focus on other priorities, he invested substantial time, energy and political capital on forging a pact that he has described as a moral imperative.It also reflects difficult lessons Mr. Obama learned about diplomacy and global leadership along the way. In Copenhagen, he was a first-term president meeting \u201cthe stark reality of just how complicated and fractured this issue was on the global stage,\u201d a senior administration official said on Saturday. Mr. Obama\u2019s experience there \u201cunderscored that if we were going to make real progress on this, we were going to have to be patient and develop a strategy\u201d both at home and globally. Highlights from the final draft text of a climate agreement submitted to the delegates in Paris.The president, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue candidly, \u201cdeliberately and ambitiously pushed the envelope on climate.\u201d And on Saturday, Mr. Obama said the Paris agreement had been possible in large part because he had done so. This year, he issued regulations to slash carbon pollution from power plants, and last year he forged an emissions reduction agreement with President Xi Jinping of China that encouraged other nations to set their own climate goals.\u201cWe\u2019ve transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Saturday, referring to the \u201cchaotic\u201d Copenhagen talks. \u201cWe\u2019ve set the first-ever nationwide standards to limit the amount of carbon pollution power plants can dump into the air our children breathe.\u201dStill, like the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s climate agenda faces bitter opposition from Republicans, with all of the party\u2019s presidential candidates pledging to roll back the agreement if elected.Republicans have tried to block the climate plan legislatively, and more than half of the states are challenging its legality in court.In a statement, Hillary Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate, hailed the climate agreement and praised Mr. Obama for helping to deliver it. \u201cWe cannot afford to be slowed by the climate skeptics or deterred by the defeatists who doubt America\u2019s ability to meet this challenge,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. But Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, said the pact \u201cgoes nowhere near far enough.\u201dMr. Obama, while calling the agreement \u201cthe best chance we\u2019ve had to save the one planet that we\u2019ve got,\u201d conceded that the results were not perfect. \u201cEven if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, we\u2019ll only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere, so we cannot be complacent,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe problem is not solved because of this accord, but make no mistake: The Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Embattled Governor Says He Won\u2019t Run for 2nd Term", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 With Puerto Rico\u2019s debt-ridden economy still in crisis and his administration mired in scandal, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, the island\u2019s embattled governor, announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election in 2016.In a brief message tinged with anger toward his critics, including members of his own party, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla, 44, defended his record as governor and lashed out at his predecessors, who he said helped plunge Puerto Rico into runaway debt. The governor said he chose not to run for a second term so he could focus solely on the economy, jobs and trying to find a way to restructure the island\u2019s $72 billion debt.\u201cWhat is incomprehensible,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said, \u201cis that the same people who took and spent those loans and didn\u2019t leave behind anything to pay them back now criticize those who didn\u2019t take the loans and are now trying to pay them back.\u201d The governor called on Puerto Ricans to accept the politically difficult decisions that require greater \u201cloyalty to the future than to the past.\u201d Those decisions are likely to include layoffs, higher taxes, more cuts in pensions and the possibility that a federal control board may take over the island\u2019s finances. \u201cBig causes require big sacrifices,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said.In rejecting a run for a second term, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla, a member of the Popular Democratic Party, which supports continued commonwealth status, joins a line of governors from the two leading parties who have served only one term since the island sank into a decade-long recession. His two predecessors lost re-election after voters disapproved of their handling of the economic crisis, among other things.The governor\u2019s prospects for a second term were dim. A recent survey found that 12 percent of Puerto Ricans had a positive view of the governor, and he faced criticism from some members of his own party, who pressured him to step aside for other P.D.P. candidates. Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla, considered an outsider when he was elected, was also hurt by a recent corruption scandal. The scandal has embroiled the leading fund-raiser for the governing party, who is also a close friend of the governor\u2019s brother. A federal indictment, issued this month, laid out a pattern of alleged cronyism and patronage inside the governor\u2019s administration.\u201cI think all the governors, including Garc\u00eda Padilla, have the goal of trying to resolve these problems until they realize what it costs to resolve them \u2014 especially the political costs,\u201d said Orlando Sotomayor, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico. Swept into office by a slim margin in 2012, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla inherited an island overrun with debt, hit hard by the loss of manufacturing federal tax breaks and jolted by a major spike in murders. Since 2011, the island\u2019s population of 3.5 million has dropped 1 percent to 2 percent each year as Puerto Ricans, who are United States citizens, have moved to states like Florida and Texas. There are now more Puerto Ricans living outside the island than on it.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla pledged not to lay off government workers, as occurred under his predecessor, Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Instead, he tried to increase revenue and stimulate economic development by raising taxes on businesses and individuals, offering tax breaks to wealthy American investors, and requiring government workers to contribute more toward their pensions. Many of these measures proved unpopular.All the while, the situation has grown worse. The government said this month that it may not be able to make the next payment on its debts.On Monday, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla pointed to large drops in the murder rate, an increase in tourism, a jump in agricultural production and a 15,000-person reduction in the government work force without layoffs. With Puerto Rico unable to borrow any more money, the governor was also the first in a long time to cobble together a budget that did not rely on huge loans.But he has failed in trying to get bond holders to renegotiate the debt or Congress to give Puerto Rico\u2019s government utilities and other agencies access to bankruptcy laws, something supported by the Obama administration. A move is afoot among Republicans in Congress to offer some forms of relief while requiring a federal financial overseer to ensure that austerity measures are enacted.\u201cIn some way, shape or form, I suspect there will be federal control of the Puerto Rican economy,\u201d said Amilcar Barreto, a political science professor at Northeastern University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a traumatic experience for the Puerto Rican political system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Coal Industry Under Pressure, Some See Long-Term Decline", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCoal is in trouble, and that could be good news for a warming world.These trends represent good news for the environment, said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an environmentally focused research group funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund and other philanthropies.Even so, coal is under pressure in many parts of the world, in no small part because numerous countries want to limit the greenhouse gases and smog that coal-burning energy plants produce.Even China, which produced and consumed half the world\u2019s coal from 2012 to 2014, may have already reached its peak.\u201cNobody believes these cycles are coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a smaller coal industry, in the United States and all over the world.\u201dHe predicted that improving the efficiency of plants \u2014 and developing effective technologies to capture carbon at those plants \u2014 would reduce carbon dioxide emissions to more acceptable levels over time.He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to bankrupt a lot of coal companies than it is to meaningfully reduce the world\u2019s reliance on coal.\u201dThe financial health of the industry should be considered separately from the role of coal in the world economy, he said, and much of Asia will still burn coal because it is relatively cheap. That leaves the situation less than predictable, he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be shocked in 10 years to look back and see that we\u2019ve turned a corner in coal \u2014 and I would not be surprised to see a rise,\u201d he added.Dr. Yuen of Citi Research disagreed. The pressure on coal is \u201cstructural,\u201d he said, and related in part to the boom in renewable energy production.\u201cProbably, we aren\u2019t going back,\u201d he predicted.He added that, along with North America and Europe\u2019s slowing demand, even Chinese coal demand may already be coming down. And while India will continue to use coal, imports of it might drop as the country improves its own mining capability.Over time, new technologies for renewable energy will become cheaper and more efficient, he said, in a familiar \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d that creates jobs and builds new industries, leading to further advances.The deployment of renewable energy has already grown so sharply, he noted, that some American states whose political leaders oppose the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan might well find themselves in \u201caccidental compliance\u201d as their use of renewable energy reduces the need for burning fossil fuels.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s what the neoconservatives have wanted. It\u2019s what the vast majority of those on the stage want. They still want regime change. They want it in Syria. They wanted it in Iraq. They want it in Libya. It has not worked.\u201dPaul continued:\u201cOut of regime change you get chaos. From the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam. So we get this profession of, oh, my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism, and yet they\u2019re the problem because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos.\u201dPaul was right, of course, but that didn\u2019t stop the other candidates from beating the drums of war until their elbows ached.Carly Fiorina said: \u201cOne of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class \u2014 Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201dIt has been said that this Republican cycle is dominated by fear and frustration among Republican voters who are not satisfied with national politicians and are becoming increasingly afraid on a number of fronts.The anger I agree with completely, but I prefer another way of phrasing \u2014 or possibly explaining \u2014 the fear: overwhelming insecurity.I would posit that most of the issues that get traction in these debates, and indeed have gotten traction among Republican voters this cycle, have to do with a tremendous insecurity about power and safety \u2014 terrorism, the economy, immigration, gun rights, refugees, exploding drug addiction among white youth, policing, all of it.We live in an America that is changing in dramatic demographic ways right before people\u2019s eyes. Many of our largest cities are already majority-minority or soon will be. The electoral map, altered by this growing number of minority voters, makes it increasingly difficult for Republicans to win the presidency, even as they enjoy overwhelming successes on the state and legislative levels.Indeed, Marco Rubio\u2019s failed attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform as a member of the Gang of Eight may prove to be an Achilles\u2019 heel for his campaign.When Rubio suggested that the too-calculating-to-be-trusted Ted Cruz had a record of being somewhat reasonable on some areas of immigration, Cruz summoned the bad juju of every used car salesman who ever lived, and gleefully shot back:\u201cLook, I understand that Marco wants to raise confusion, it is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty bill. And you know, there was one commentator that put it this way that, for Marco to suggest our record\u2019s the same is like suggesting \u2018the fireman and the arsonist have the same record because they are both at the scene of the fire.\u2019 He was fighting to grant amnesty and not to secure the border, I was fighting to secure the border.\u201dCruz is still playing frenemy to the real estate developer, waiting for him to slip and fall, waiting for the chance to attract his supporters. But Cruz and Rubio are appealing to different wings of the party, so theirs can be a bare-knuckled brawl.Jeb Bush even sought to link the immigration insecurity to the drug addiction insecurity, saying: \u201cClearly, we need to secure the border. Coming here legally needs to be a lot easier than coming here illegally. If you don\u2019t have that, you don\u2019t have the rule of law. We now have a national security consideration, public health issues, we have an epidemic of heroin overdoses in all places in this country because of the ease of bringing heroin in. We have to secure the border.\u201dThis, I am sure, plays well among Republican voters who have made their insecurities readily apparent to pollsters.1. For Republicans, international concerns now dominate.2. Republicans broadly support an aggressive approach toward the Islamic State and global terrorism.3. Republicans are more concerned than Democrats about a number of overseas security threats.4. In September, Republicans opposed the United States decision to accept more refugees.5.

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Expected to Expand Eurozone Stimulus, as Questions of Effects Remain", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 If there were any lingering doubts that the European Central Bank would ratchet up its stimulus of the sluggish eurozone economy, they probably evaporated on Wednesday.New official data showed that the region\u2019s dangerously low inflation rate remained at an annual pace of 0.1 percent in November. That was unchanged from October\u2019s reading, and still far below the central bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent.And so, on Thursday, when the central bank\u2019s governing council meets, the policy board is expected to expand the stimulus program that it began in March \u2014 so far with little to show for it. In fact, the new inflation data showed that the core rate, which factors out volatile prices like energy and food, actually shrank last month.The question is whether any new action by the central bank will have much additional impact, as eurozone growth remains moribund and unemployment demoralizingly high \u2014 10.7 percent in October, according to the latest data.Analysts expect the governing council to increase the volume of its purchases of government bonds and other assets, which have been 60 billion euros, or about $63 billion, a month since April. The central bank may also tinker with interest rates, for example, by reducing the benchmark rate to zero from 0.05 percent and increasing the penalty that banks must pay to park money in the central bank\u2019s virtual vaults.Any new stimulus and rate cuts by the central bank would come as its American counterpart, the Federal Reserve, is on the verge of raising rates in the United States for the first time since 2006. The Fed could act as soon as its meeting on Dec. 15 and 16.The trans-Atlantic divergence in monetary policy has helped push the euro to its lowest level against the dollar in a dozen years \u2014 around $1.06 on Wednesday \u2014 as investors move money to the United States in search of higher returns.So far, many economists doubt that the European Central Bank stimulus measures, known as quantitative easing, have done much to meet one of its main goals \u2014 improving the flow of credit in countries like Italy where loans are hard to come by.Because there have been few of the hoped-for benefits from the stimulus program, almost no one is complaining about the likelihood that Mr. Draghi will announce plans to take further measures on Thursday. The lack of protest from conservatives in Germany and some other eurozone countries contrasts with the howls that preceded the central bank\u2019s decision in the spring to begin the bond-buying program.The dire consequences predicted by the critics, like runaway inflation or profligate spending by governments because of low interest rates, have not materialized.The most visible effect of the central bank measures has been to provoke a decline in the value of the euro. The euro, at Wednesday\u2019s exchange rate, was worth 15 percent less against the dollar than it was a year ago. That makes eurozone products cheaper for foreign buyers and can help eurozone companies sell their products abroad \u2014 although China\u2019s slowing economy has made times tougher this year for most global exporters.In the meantime, central bank demand has probably lowered the cost for banks to raise money on the bond market, which in theory should lead to more lending.On Thursday, the central bank is expected to increase the size of its monthly bond purchases, to \u20ac70 billion or so, and to say it will keep buying bonds beyond the previously announced cutoff date of September 2016.In an article published Wednesday in its monthly bulletin, the European Central Bank defended its efforts so far, arguing that the money it has spent on assets has been converted into loans that are available to businesses for expansion or to households for purchases.The asset purchases, as well as an earlier program allowing eurozone banks to borrow money from the central bank practically interest free, have encouraged lenders \u201cto pass on the cost relief to final borrowers by granting more credit at better conditions,\u201d the bank said.In addition, since June 2014 the European Central Bank has been imposing a penalty on banks that seek safety by storing cash in its vaults. Banks used to earn interest on the cash but now must pay interest of 0.2 percent annually. The so-called negative deposit rate is the equivalent of a bank customer\u2019s having to pay interest to keep money in a savings account.Many analysts expect the central bank to increase the penalty on Thursday. Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank in Frankfurt, said he expected the negative deposit rate to increase to at least 0.35 percent. But he questioned whether the negative rate was having the desired effect of pressuring banks to lend the money rather than hoard it.Many banks in the eurozone are still struggling with the effects of the financial crisis and increasingly strict regulations. They are reluctant to lend at any price and may also suffer from a lack of customers optimistic enough about their own futures to want to borrow.The negative deposit rate \u201chas not worked and probably won\u2019t work, because there are more variables that determine whether a bank gives out credit or not,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said.Even the decline in the euro against the dollar could start to have negative effects.George Saravelos, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, estimated that during the last year investors have pulled \u20ac500 million out of the eurozone and put it into bonds in the United States and other interest-bearing securities. Mr. Saravelos forecast that the euro would fall to 85 United States cents in 2017.At some point, the negative effects of a weak euro could outweigh the positive. \u201cThe weaker euro means there is capital flowing out of the economy,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said. \u201cWe need more investment.\u201dSome economists, frustrated by the tepid effect of European Central Bank stimulus so far, have begun urging Mr. Draghi to take more radical action.The proposal is considered far-fetched by many economists, in part because the European Central Bank is not equipped for the huge logistical challenge of distributing cash to 338 million eurozone residents in an equitable way.Said Mr. Brzeski, \u201cThat would be a real Christmas present.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Wealthiest, a Private Tax System That Saves Them Billions", "Date": "2015-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuying PowerWASHINGTON \u2014 The hedge fund magnates Daniel S. Loeb, Louis Moore Bacon and Steven A. Cohen have much in common. They have managed billions of dollars in capital, earning vast fortunes. They have invested large sums in art \u2014 and millions more in political candidates.Moreover, each has exploited an esoteric tax loophole that saved them millions in taxes. The trick? Route the money to Bermuda and back.With inequality at its highest levels in nearly a century and public debate rising over whether the government should respond to it through higher taxes on the wealthy, the very richest Americans have financed a sophisticated and astonishingly effective apparatus for shielding their fortunes. Some call it the \u201cincome defense industry,\u201d consisting of a high-priced phalanx of lawyers, estate planners, lobbyists and anti-tax activists who exploit and defend a dizzying array of tax maneuvers, virtually none of them available to taxpayers of more modest means.In recent years, this apparatus has become one of the most powerful avenues of influence for wealthy Americans of all political stripes, including Mr. Loeb and Mr. Cohen, who give heavily to Republicans, and the liberal billionaire George Soros, who has called for higher levies on the rich while at the same time using tax loopholes to bolster his own fortune.All are among a small group providing much of the early cash for the 2016 presidential campaign.Operating largely out of public view \u2014 in tax court, through arcane legislative provisions and in private negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 the wealthy have used their influence to steadily whittle away at the government\u2019s ability to tax them. The effect has been to create a kind of private tax system, catering to only several thousand Americans.The ultra-wealthy \u201cliterally pay millions of dollars for these services,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites, \u201cand save in the tens or hundreds of millions in taxes.\u201dSome of the biggest current tax battles are being waged by some of the most generous supporters of 2016 candidates. They include the families of the hedge fund investors Robert Mercer, who gives to Republicans, and James Simons, who gives to Democrats; as well as the options trader Jeffrey Yass, a libertarian-leaning donor to Republicans.In the heat of the presidential race, the influence of wealthy donors is being tested. At stake is the Obama administration\u2019s 2013 tax increase on high earners \u2014 the first substantial increase in two decades \u2014 and an I.R.S. initiative to ensure that, in effect, the higher rates stick by cracking down on tax avoidance by the wealthy.While Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have pledged to raise taxes on these voters, virtually every Republican has advanced policies that would vastly reduce their tax bills, sometimes to as little as 10 percent of their income.At the same time, most Republican candidates favor eliminating the inheritance tax, a move that would allow the new rich, and the old, to bequeath their fortunes intact, solidifying the wealth gap far into the future. And several have proposed a substantial reduction \u2014 or even elimination \u2014 in the already deeply discounted tax rates on investment gains, a foundation of the most lucrative tax strategies.\u201cThere\u2019s this notion that the wealthy use their money to buy politicians; more accurately, it\u2019s that they can buy policy, and specifically, tax policy,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cThat\u2019s why these egregious loopholes exist, and why it\u2019s so hard to close them.\u201dInstead, much of their income came from convoluted partnerships and high-end investment funds. Other earnings accrued in opaque family trusts and foreign shell corporations, beyond the reach of the tax authorities.The well-paid technicians who devise these arrangements toil away at white-shoe law firms and elite investment banks, as well as a variety of obscure boutiques. But at the fulcrum of the strategizing over how to minimize taxes are so-called family offices, the customized wealth management departments of Americans with hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in assets.Family offices have existed since the late 19th century, when the Rockefellers pioneered the institution, and gained popularity in the 1980s. But they have proliferated rapidly over the last decade, as the ranks of the super-rich, and the size of their fortunes, swelled to record proportions.\u201cWe have so much wealth being created, significant wealth, that it creates a need for the family office structure now,\u201d said Sree Arimilli, an industry recruiting consultant.Family offices, many of which are dedicated to managing and protecting the wealth of a single family, oversee everything from investment strategy to philanthropy. But tax planning is a core function. While the specific techniques these advisers employ to minimize taxes can be mind-numbingly complex, they generally follow a few simple principles, like converting one type of income into another type that\u2019s taxed at a lower rate.Mr. Loeb, for example, has invested in a Bermuda-based reinsurer \u2014 an insurer to insurance companies \u2014 that turns around and invests the money in his hedge fund. That maneuver transforms his profits from short-term bets in the market, which the government taxes at roughly 40 percent, into long-term profits, known as capital gains, which are taxed at roughly half that rate. It has had the added advantage of letting Mr. Loeb defer taxes on this income indefinitely, allowing his wealth to compound and grow more quickly.The Bermuda insurer Mr. Loeb helped set up went public in 2013 and is active in the insurance business, not merely a tax dodge. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Bacon abandoned similar insurance-based strategies in recent years. \u201cOur investment in Max Re was not a tax-driven scheme, but rather a sound investment response to investor interest in a more dynamically managed portfolio akin to Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway,\u201d said Mr. Bacon, who leads Moore Capital Management. \u201cHedge funds were a minority of the investment portfolio, and Moore Capital\u2019s products a much smaller subset of this alternative portfolio.\u201d Mr. Loeb and Mr. Cohen declined to comment.Organizing one\u2019s business as a partnership can be lucrative in its own right. Some of the partnerships from which the wealthy derive their income are allowed to sell shares to the public, making it easy to cash out a chunk of the business while retaining control. But unlike publicly traded corporations, they pay no corporate income tax; the partners pay taxes as individuals. And the income taxes are often reduced by large deductions, such as for depreciation.The wealthy can also avail themselves of a range of esoteric and customized tax deductions that go far beyond writing off a home office or dinner with a client. One aggressive strategy is to place income in a type of charitable trust, generating a deduction that offsets the income tax. The trust then purchases what\u2019s known as a private placement life insurance policy, which invests the money on a tax-free basis, frequently in a number of hedge funds. The person\u2019s heirs can inherit, also tax-free, whatever money is left after the trust pays out a percentage each year to charity, often a considerable sum.Many of these maneuvers are well established, and wealthy taxpayers say they are well within their rights to exploit them. Others exist in a legal gray area, its boundaries defined by the willingness of taxpayers to defend their strategies against the I.R.S. Almost all are outside the price range of the average taxpayer.Among tax lawyers and accountants, \u201cthe best and brightest get a high from figuring out how to do tricky little deals,\u201d said Karen L. Hawkins, who until recently headed the I.R.S. office that oversees tax practitioners. \u201cFrankly, it is almost beyond the intellectual and resource capacity of the Internal Revenue Service to catch.\u201dThe combination of cost and complexity has had a profound effect, tax experts said. Whatever tax rates Congress sets, the actual rates paid by the ultra-wealthy tend to fall over time as they exploit their numerous advantages.From Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration through the end of 2012, federal income tax rates on individuals did not change (excluding payroll taxes). But the highest-earning one-thousandth of Americans went from paying an average of 20.9 percent to 17.6 percent. By contrast, the top 1 percent, excluding the very wealthy, went from paying just under 24 percent on average to just over that level.\u201cWe do have two different tax systems, one for normal wage-earners and another for those who can afford sophisticated tax advice,\u201d said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of San Diego who studies the intersection of tax policy and inequality. \u201cAt the very top of the income distribution, the effective rate of tax goes down, contrary to the principles of a progressive income tax system.\u201dHaving helped foster an alternative tax system, wealthy Americans have been aggressive in defending it.Trade groups representing the Bermuda-based insurance company Mr. Loeb helped set up, for example, have spent the last several months pleading with the I.R.S. that its proposed rules tightening the hedge fund insurance loophole are too onerous.The major industry group representing private equity funds spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year lobbying on such issues as \u201ccarried interest,\u201d the granddaddy of Wall Street tax loopholes, which makes it possible for fund managers to pay the capital gains rate rather than the higher standard tax rate on a substantial share of their income for running the fund.The budget deal that Congress approved in October allows the I.R.S. to collect underpaid taxes from large partnerships at the firm level for the first time \u2014 which is far easier for the agency \u2014 thanks to a provision that lawmakers slipped into the deal at the last minute, before many lobbyists could mobilize. But the new rules are relatively weak \u2014 firms can still choose to have partners pay the taxes \u2014 and don\u2019t take effect until 2018, giving the wealthy plenty of time to weaken them further.Shortly after the provision passed, the Managed Funds Association, an industry group that represents prominent hedge funds like D. E. Shaw, Renaissance Technologies, Tiger Management and Third Point, began meeting with members of Congress to discuss a wish list of adjustments. The founders of these funds have all donated at least $500,000 to 2016 presidential candidates. During the Obama presidency, the association itself has risen to become one of the most powerful trade groups in Washington, spending over $4 million a year on lobbying.And while the lobbying clout of the wealthy is most often deployed through industry trade associations and lawyers, some rich families have locked arms to advance their interests more directly.The inheritance tax has been a primary target. In the early 1990s, a California family office executive named Patricia Soldano began lobbying on behalf of wealthy families to repeal the tax, which would not only save them money, but also make it easier to preserve their business empires from one generation to the next. The idea struck many hardened operatives as unrealistic at the time, given that the tax affected only the wealthiest Americans. But Ms. Soldano\u2019s efforts \u2014 funded in part by the Mars and Koch families \u2014 laid the groundwork for a one-year elimination in 2010.The tax has been restored, but currently applies only to couples leaving roughly $11 million or more to their heirs, up from those leaving more than $1.2 million when Ms. Soldano started her campaign. It affected fewer than 5,200 families last year.\u201cIf anyone would have told me we\u2019d be where we are today, I would never have guessed it,\u201d Ms. Soldano said in an interview.Some of the most profound victories are barely known outside the insular world of the wealthy and their financial managers.In 2009, Congress set out to require that investment partnerships like hedge funds register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, partly so that regulators would have a better grasp on the risks they posed to the financial system.The early legislative language would have required single-family offices to register as well, exposing the highly secretive institutions to scrutiny that their clients were eager to avoid. Some of the I.R.S.\u2019s cases against the wealthy originate with tips from the S.E.C., which is often better positioned to spot tax evasion.By the summer of 2009, several family office executives had formed a lobbying group called the Private Investor Coalition to push back against the proposal. The coalition won an exemption in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, then spent much of the next year persuading the S.E.C. to largely adopt its preferred definition of \u201cfamily office.\u201dSo expansive was the resulting loophole that Mr. Soros\u2019s $24.5 billion hedge fund took advantage of it, converting to a family office after returning capital to its remaining outside investors. The hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, a former business partner of Mr. Soros, took the same step.The Soros family, which generally supports Democrats, has committed at least $1 million to the 2016 presidential campaign; Mr. Druckenmiller, who favors Republicans, has put slightly more than $300,000 behind three different G.O.P. presidential candidates.After all the loopholes and all the lobbying, what remains of the government\u2019s ability to collect taxes from the wealthy runs up against one final hurdle: the crisis facing the I.R.S.His I.R.S. convened a Global High Wealth Industry Group, known colloquially as \u201cthe wealth squad,\u201d to scrutinize the returns of Americans with incomes of at least $10 million a year.But while these measures have helped the government retrieve billions, the agency\u2019s efforts have flagged in the face of scandal, political pressure and budget cuts. Between 2010, the year before Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, and 2014, the I.R.S. budget dropped by almost $2 billion in real terms, or nearly 15 percent. That has forced it to shed about 5,000 high-level enforcement positions out of about 23,000, according to the agency.Audit rates for the $10 million-plus club spiked in the first few years of the Global High Wealth program, but have plummeted since then.The political challenge for the agency became especially acute in 2013, after the agency acknowledged singling out conservative nonprofits in a review of political activity by tax-exempt groups. (Senior officials left the agency as a result of the controversy.)Several former I.R.S. officials, including Marcus Owens, who once headed the agency\u2019s Exempt Organizations division, said the controversy badly damaged the agency\u2019s willingness to investigate other taxpayers, even outside the exempt division.\u201cI.R.S. enforcement is either absent or diminished\u201d in certain areas, he said. Mr. Owens added that his former department \u2014 which provides some oversight of money used by charities and nonprofits \u2014 has been decimated.Groups like FreedomWorks and Americans for Tax Reform, which are financed partly by the foundations of wealthy families and large businesses, have called for impeaching the I.R.S. commissioner. They are bolstered by deep-pocketed advocacy groups like the Club for Growth, which has aided primary challenges against Republicans who have voted in favor of higher taxes.In 2014, the Club for Growth Action fund raised more than $9 million and spent much of it helping candidates critical of the I.R.S. Roughly 60 percent of the money raised by the fund came from just 12 donors, including Mr. Mercer, who has given the group $2 million in the last five years. Mr. Mercer and his immediate family have also donated more than $11 million to several super PACs supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an outspoken I.R.S. critic and a presidential candidate.Another prominent donor is Mr. Yass, who helps run a trading firm called the Susquehanna International Group. He donated $100,000 to the Club for Growth Action fund in September. Mr. Yass serves on the board of the libertarian Cato Institute and, like Mr. Mercer, appears to subscribe to limited-government views that partly motivate his political spending.But he may also have more than a passing interest in creating a political environment that undermines the I.R.S. Susquehanna is currently challenging a proposed I.R.S. determination that an affiliate of the firm effectively repatriated more than $375 million in income from subsidiaries located in Ireland and the Cayman Islands in 2007, creating a large tax liability. (The affiliate brought the money back to the United States in later years and paid dividend taxes on it; the I.R.S. asserts that it should have paid the ordinary income tax rate, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars more.)In June, Mr. Yass donated more than $2 million to three super PACs aligned with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has called for taxing all income at a flat rate of 14.5 percent. That change in itself would save wealthy supporters like Mr. Yass millions of dollars.But even if that campaign is a long shot, the richest taxpayers will continue to enjoy advantages over everyone else.For the ultra-wealthy, \u201cour tax code is like a leaky barrel,\u201d said J. Todd Metcalf, the Democrats\u2019 chief tax counsel on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201dUnless you plug every hole or get a new barrel, it\u2019s going to leak out.\u201dNicholas Confessore contributed reporting and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Teachers and employees herded about 50 children into buses and cars. Some followed on foot. Minutes later, as the caravan made its way uphill, they saw a 32-foot-tall wave of mud sweeping over their school.The copper-colored sludge wiped out more than just the school. It destroyed the entire village. At least 16 people have died, including two children. Three people are still missing and 631 lost their homes.After flooding the village, the wave of approximately 2.2 billion cubic feet of mud and mineral residue, enough to fill about 25,000 Olympic-size swimming pools, made its way to the Doce River. The river, which passes through 228 municipalities, is crucial to the region\u2019s economic life. The mineral-waste sludge has devastated the area. Several companies had to suspend operations. Local fishermen are among the most severely affected. The water supply for Governador Valadares, a city of 300,000 people, had to be cut off for a week.\u201cThe steps taken by the Brazilian government, Vale and BHP Billiton to prevent harm were clearly insufficient,\u201d the United Nations environmental experts said in a statement, adding that it was unacceptable that it took three weeks for information about the water\u2019s toxicity to surface. \u201cThe government and companies should be doing everything within their power to prevent further harm, including exposure to heavy metals and other toxic chemicals,\u201d they said.But Brazilians have good reason to be skeptical. According to government statistics, environmental lawbreakers in Brazil paid less than 3 percent of fines levied against them over the past five years. Many people suspect that Vale and BHP will go unpunished and that safety regulations for the mining industry won\u2019t be updated in light of the disaster.If history is a guide, they may be right. When the dam broke last month, dozens of fishermen in the same area were already waiting for compensation \u2014 for the damage caused by the construction of the Aimor\u00e9s hydroelectric power plant 10 years ago. The company responsible for the plant\u2019s operation is called Alian\u00e7a Energia.

{"Headline": "Silence on the Climate Pact From the Republican Candidates", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere could be two reasons for this. They\u2019re not interested in acknowledging a victory for President Obama. Perhaps more important, blocking international action on climate change is not necessarily what Republican voters want.In light of the Paris pact and broad public support, it\u2019s starting to look like a handful of Republicans against a warming world.The survey also suggests that denial of climate science is receding like so many glaciers: 75 percent of those polled agreed that global warming was seriously affecting the environment, or that it would in the future. More than half of Republicans (58 percent) agreed.That makes things tricky for a Republican candidate hoping to lure climate change skeptics in the primary, then pull more moderates in the general election \u2014 which may explain the silence. Of the nine Republican candidates who will debate in prime time on Tuesday, only Gov. John Kasich of Ohio had any substantial comment on the pact: \u201cWhile the governor believes that climate change is real and that human activity contributes to it, he has serious concerns with an agreement that the Obama administration deliberately crafted to avoid having to submit it to the Senate for approval,\u201d Mr. Kasich\u2019s spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s an obvious indicator that they expect it to result in significant job loss and inflict further damage to our already sluggish economy.\u201d The administration would argue that it avoided the Republican-controlled Congress because it would almost surely vote this agreement down, regardless of the world\u2019s support for it.Let\u2019s hope the candidates\u2019 new silence suggests that they see that when 195 nations together recognize the need for immediate action, their arguments to do nothing seem more misguided than ever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Stop Turning U.S. Corporations Into Tax Exiles", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTHE Pfizer-Allergan deal is a travesty. Pfizer, which is based in New York, will move overseas by merging with Allergan, based in Ireland, in a maneuver known as a corporate inversion. The point isn\u2019t to find corporate synergy. It is to leave behind our uncompetitive international tax system.Not only is this the largest inversion in history, but it will also open the floodgates for other companies to leave the United States, further eroding our tax base, damaging our economy and costing many thousands of jobs.This is not just me speculating. I have spoken to many chief executives who confirm they are planning to follow Pfizer\u2019s lead. But while this inversion has set off a firestorm of public statements by our leading presidential candidates and other politicians, Congress continues to do nothing.Recently, Hillary Clinton came out against this mechanism and proposed slowing the pace of future inversions by tightening regulation and imposing an exit tax on companies leaving. While I applaud her for speaking out publicly, her proposal is flawed because it fails to fix the underlying problem: Our international tax code is disadvantageous to companies based in the United States, as most countries now employ a territorial tax system, which allows companies to pay taxes only where the money is earned. More important, we can\u2019t afford to wait more than a year for the election of a new president to take action, as we will lose many more companies in the interim.Fortunately, there is a very simple and immediately available solution. Senators Chuck Schumer of New York and Rob Portman of Ohio have created a bipartisan framework for international tax reform that is supported by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Currently, we tax a company\u2019s foreign earnings at 35 percent when the money is repatriated to the United States. And even though the tax code allows for a deduction based on the tax paid to the country in which it was earned, the overall tax is still much higher than it would be in most other countries. We are one of the few countries in the world that asks our companies to pay a double tax on foreign earnings.Our uncompetitive tax code is why companies have chosen not to bring their foreign earnings back to the United States, stranding an estimated $2.6 trillion abroad. It\u2019s also exactly why companies ultimately seek corporate inversions.The Schumer-Portman framework fixes this problem by allowing companies to repatriate all that stranded cash at a reduced rate of between 8 and 10 percent (or lower, depending on the foreign tax deduction). This tax on repatriated earnings would yield the United States huge incremental revenue \u2014 an estimated $200 billion on the $2.6 trillion now kept overseas \u2014 and would allow companies to reinvest the nontaxed portion in the United States, creating thousands of jobs. The Schumer-Portman framework also includes provisions that would stop \u201cearnings stripping,\u201d a method a company uses, once it leaves the country, to reduce the tax it pays on its remaining United States-based subsidiary (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposal also addressed earnings stripping).Congressional leaders agree that passing legislation according to this framework would stop inversions, so why is Congress still not acting on it? The problem is that too many politicians (and members of the press) don\u2019t understand that there is a significant difference between \u201cinternational tax reform\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive tax reform.\u201d\u201cComprehensive tax reform\u201d means fixing both the domestic tax code and the international tax code at the same time. But this is the quintessential fool\u2019s errand because there is simply no consensus in Washington on how to fix the domestic piece of that puzzle. On the other hand, the Schumer-Portman framework for \u201cinternational tax reform\u201d has a bipartisan consensus now and would stop inversions by permanently fixing this country\u2019s antiquated double tax on foreign earnings. Without this reform, this incremental tax revenue is money this country will never receive, as most of these companies will choose to leave it abroad, or more devastating, leave the country through an inversion.In an interview only one month ago, Ian Read, the chief executive of Pfizer, suggested his company\u2019s inversion could have been prevented if Congress had simply done something to fix the issue. \u201cThe problem is our tax code is hugely disadvantageous to American high-tech multinational companies. I personally have been to Washington for the last two years,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI have tried to get this as an urgent issue that we need to fix, and I have been totally unsuccessful.\u201d After reading this statement and others he has made publicly, I believe that even though Pfizer would have to pay a breakup fee if it withdraws support for the merger, he and the Pfizer board would choose to do so if Congress were to pass this reform in the near term.During the last two months, in addition to Mr. Read, I have spoken to many chief executives of large multinational companies based in the United States with significant earnings abroad. They all feel the same way as Mr. Read, and some are planning to follow Pfizer and leave the country. They are completely justified. Chief executives have a fiduciary duty to enhance value for their shareholders. The fault does not lie with them but with our uncompetitive international tax code and with our dysfunctional Congress for not changing it.How will representatives and senators, with an election year approaching, explain to their constituents why they are out of work because their employers left the country, when it could so easily have been avoided? As the old saying goes, \u201cthere ought to be a law.\u201dCarl C. Icahn is the chairman of Icahn Enterprises.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pfizer\u2019s Long War on Taxation", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookLong before Pfizer conceived of merging with Allergan in a $150 billion deal to rid itself of what its chief executive called an \u201can uncompetitive tax rate\u201d in the United States, the company was deploying various tax avoidance strategies dating back to at least 1976.That\u2019s when Pfizer, with the help of lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry, sought to take advantage of an unusual tax credit program that legislators in Washington had passed to help spur investment in Puerto Rico. In that year, hoping to stimulate employment on the Caribbean island, Congress passed Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, a law that gave mainland companies a full tax exemption on profits earned in Puerto Rico. In addition, the local corporate tax code gave companies incentives to establish subsidiaries there. As you can imagine, Pfizer quickly set up shop in Puerto Rico. It then spent the next two decades lobbying to keep the much-criticized law from being repealed. According to a United States General Accounting Office report from 1992, Pfizer saved at least $759 million over 10 years.Pfizer wasn\u2019t alone. The pharmaceutical industry descended on Puerto Rico to take advantage of the savings. The tax break ultimately cost American taxpayers $24.7 billion in unpaid tax receipts, according to the General Accounting Office. After the tax law was scrapped in legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 that phased out the tax break over a 10-year period, Pfizer and its rivals pulled up their stakes in Puerto Rico, leading, in part, to the island\u2019s current economic crisis.So long as United States companies feel as if they have to compete on an international stage against companies in countries with lower tax rates \u2014 in Pfizer\u2019s case, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in Britain, and Novartis in Switzerland \u2014 they will seek ways to leave the country to reduce their bill.In 1934, Judge Learned Hand wrote what has become something of a mantra for those who believe there\u2019s no obligation to pay high taxes. \u201cAnyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the Treasury,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is not even a patriotic duty to increase one\u2019s taxes. Over and over again the courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible.\u201dI\u2019ve argued in previous columns that the government should consider temporary measures to prevent some of these deals from happening. Last year and again last month, the Treasury Department issued new rules intended to curb these so-called inversion deals. Still, there are ways for companies to bypass these rules, as the structure of the Pfizer-Allergan merger demonstrated. (The combination is not technically structured as an inversion, though it achieves the same goal of securing a lower tax rate overseas.)\u201cOur actions can only slow the pace of these transactions,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said last month after introducing new rules to curb inversions. \u201cOnly legislation can decisively stop them.\u201dThere are all sorts of ideas percolating around Washington about how it could make it less attractive for drug companies like Pfizer to leave the United States, some more outlandish than others, but virtually all require being more protectionist and less open. For example, one idea making the rounds would be for Medicare or Medicaid to favor buying domestic drugs over foreign ones. Another would give domestic drug companies priority in the Food and Drug Administration approval process. All those punitive steps might work in the short term, but they would create their own complications and unintended consequences.The only way to end the inversion craze, or whatever tax avoidance plan comes next, is to comprehensively reform the corporate tax code. Does that mean companies\u2019 tax rates will most likely fall? Yes. President Obama has long pushed for a simplified tax code that lowers corporate tax rates with fewer brackets, while cutting unfair tax breaks and loopholes. The White House, on its website, says, \u201cOur system has one of the highest statutory tax rates among developed countries to generate about the same amount of corporate tax revenue as our developed country partners as a share of our economy; this, in turn, hurts our competitiveness in the world economy.\u201d Tax rates will most likely always be marginally higher in the United States than elsewhere, as they should be given the benefits accorded companies based here. But the gap between rates here and other developed countries cannot be so large that it drives American companies overseas.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about Pfizer\u2019s long efforts to limit its federal tax payments, misstated, in some copies, the amount of money that the company has received in federal subsidies over nearly the last 15 years. The company received at least $50 million, not $50 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Accessibility as Challenge in Age of Uber", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkTwo years ago, in Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s last days as mayor, he promised that by 2020, half of New York City\u2019s yellow taxis would be accessible to people in wheelchairs and motorized scooters.It seemed to be a triumphant chapter in a civil rights struggle that has stretched across four decades to get access to public transportation services by people who use wheelchairs. New York had been the first city in the country to make all its buses wheelchair-accessible, a change that began with a lawsuit in 1979 and was settled in 1984 by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The subway system began \u2014 slowly \u2014 to put elevators into stations.Jim Weisman, the president of the United Spinal Association, brought the lawsuit against the state in 1979, and more than 30 years later, sued the city during the Bloomberg administration to require that future cabs could be used by people in wheelchairs. The last-minute decision to settle was a change of heart.Then along came Uber, and a slow-moving civil rights revolution ran into the big-bang moment of the \u201csharing economy.\u201dAt the time Mr. Bloomberg settled the suit, there were 13,587 yellow cabs in the city \u2014 about twice as many cars as were available through the Uber app. Today, there are more than 34,000 Uber cars in the five boroughs and still only 13,587 yellow cabs.Uber is not covered by the city\u2019s accessibility requirements for taxicabs.\u201cUber says they\u2019re not a provider of transportation, they\u2019re an app,\u201d Mr. Weisman said.Uber drivers are independent contractors, pay a percentage of their fares to the company and are free to work as much or as little as they want. Riders use the app to request a ride, and a driver responds. The billing is all done through the smartphone. No matter what it looks like, Uber says, it\u2019s not a taxi business, or a livery service; it\u2019s a company that uses software to redirect fistfuls of electrons flung by people looking for rides to other people willing to provide them.\u201cThey don\u2019t require their drivers to buy accessible vehicles, nor do they incentivize those drivers to buy them,\u201d Mr. Weisman said.Riders who need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle can use a special tab on the app to call for a car that can accommodate them, says Matthew Wing, a spokesman for Uber. About 4,000 of the 34,000 cars in the Uber system are city-licensed cabs, and 400 of them can accommodate wheelchairs. In all, 4,000 trips a month are taken by people who call specifically for those accessible cabs, Mr. Wing said, and riders are picked up, on average, within five to seven minutes.Mr. Weisman said his organization had been informally testing that feature. \u201cSometimes it works very well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had five minutes, we\u2019ve had 45 minute waits, and no-shows.\u201dMr. Wing said Uber\u2019s app had made travel better for people in wheelchairs, and for other people who could not drive themselves, like those with seizure disorders, or people who cannot see.Uber needs revisions to insurance laws that have not kept up with this new form of business. Mr. Weisman said it was a perfect moment to require Uber-type companies to have accessible fleets. He argued that the state would not have the full expense of running the paratransit system of vans that move thousands of people in wheelchairs, at a cost of $60 per trip. (Over the course of a year, that is as expensive as running a big suburban railroad.) The saving could be used to create incentives for accessible Uber-style vehicles, he said.\u201cThis would be good government,\u201d Mr. Weisman said. \u201cAnd a civil rights coup.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In 2015, European Union Faced Threats From Outside and Within", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 A refugee crisis four years in the making has deluged the Continent, which was already struggling to pay for services for the residents it had.\u2022 The prospect of violence that drove many of those asylum seekers to flee the Middle East and other conflict zones has brought terror to the heart of Europe.German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.Here are summaries of the most compelling threats forcing the leaders to find new ways to preserve their union and protect their citizens.The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.But the attacks in Paris last month, which killed 130 people, and the January attacks at the offices of a satirical newspaper and a kosher grocery, also in Paris, exemplified the modern security threats facing the union\u2019s members. The dangers posed 70 years ago by invading armies from abroad have been supplanted by insurgent threats from citizens born and raised in the heart of liberal Europe.Modern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.At stake are the obligations of member states to one another, and the fair treatment of citizens of all member countries. Negotiations with Britain over the changes it has proposed to the union\u2019s charter will be a sharp test for Germany and France, which have struggled to solidify the bloc.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Preparing to Raise Rates, Fed Underestimates Benefits of More Inflation", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThis is going to sound like anathema to all those economists who lived through the inflation of the 1970s, but there\u2019s a good case for trying to double the inflation rate.Remember Japan\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d? Around the turn of the century, as the Japanese government failed to reinvigorate economic growth \u2014 watching haplessly as the economy slid into deflation and stagnation despite lowering its short-term interest rate to nearly zero \u2014 many macroeconomists dismissed this as some idiosyncratic Japanese thing.Maybe other countries might briefly suffer from the \u201czero lower bound\u201d \u2014 in which interest rates could not be lowered any further to stimulate a stagnant economy because they had already hit the floor \u2014 but these episodes would be infrequent and quick to fix, the experts thought.Well, oops.\u201cWe\u2019ve realized that the zero lower bound on the funds rate is a bigger deal than we thought a decade ago,\u201d said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington.And that calls into question what the Fed is almost universally expected to do this week: raise interest rates for the first time since 2008, and then keep on raising them at a pace of about a percentage point per year.True, at this stage, it would probably be a mistake for the Fed not to lift its federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points this week. Its officials have been proclaiming for months that the time was nigh. Not to do so would confuse markets and raise doubts about its messaging and strategy.Still, the urgency to head off alleged inflationary pressures seems premature, especially given that the Fed and many economists on and off Wall Street have been crying wolf about inflation for years.Experience with the zero lower bound raises questions that some are now asking Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed. Why not keep interest rates at rock bottom until inflation actually picks up? Indeed, why not aim for higher inflation?Why does that matter? Because if the economy falls into a recession when inflation is very low, it might be nearly impossible for the Fed to engineer the negative real interest rates \u2014 after accounting for inflation \u2014 needed to jolt the economy back to life.Some central banks are experimenting with truly negative interest rates \u2014 requiring banks to charge people for holding their money. But in most circumstances, nominal interest rates can\u2019t easily go below zero.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.\u201cSay you need a real interest rate of minus 3 percent,\u201d Professor Mishkin explained. \u201cIf your target inflation is 2 percent, you\u2019re toast because the lowest real interest rate you can achieve when you are at the zero lower bound is minus 2 percent, but if you have 4 percent inflation, you can achieve minus 3 percent with a 1 percent federal funds rate.\u201dAt the zero bound, \u201cit turned out that the Fed has less leverage than some thought,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf said. \u201cAll the trillions in quantitative easing amounted to the equivalent of a small reduction of the funds rate.\u201dThe risk of hitting the zero bound has risen, as slow population growth, strong inflows of capital from overseas and other market forces outside the Fed\u2019s control have conspired to push interest rates down. That leaves less space to lower rates in response to a recession.The previous consensus among economists that we would rarely, if ever, reach this floor was based on analysis of the American economy after World War II, a period of mostly robust, stable growth. Extrapolating from that track, Mr. Williams calculated, a nearly two-year contraction like the Great Recession, which shaved 5 percent off economic activity, could be expected only once every 570 years.The postwar golden age, though, turned out to be atypical. Basing the analysis on broader historical data \u2014 the experience of 17 developed countries since 1870 \u2014 raises the odds to once every 23 years.\u201cBased on these metrics, recent events would scarcely be considered rare or unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote. \u201cHistory teaches us that very large downturns are not only possible \u2014 they are probable.\u201dThe chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has begun the process of raising interest rates, a move that her predecessors have taken in recent decades as they put their own distinctive stamp on the economy.\u201cThe question remains,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwhether these costs are outweighed by the potential benefits in terms of avoiding the zero interest rate bound.\u201dSo what are the odds the Fed decides higher inflation is the way to escape this quandary? Probably close to zero.A critical problem with aiming for higher inflation is how to get from here to there. The Fed has spent enormous effort anchoring people\u2019s expectations to 2 percent. Even economists sympathetic to a higher target are wary of what such a shift might do to its credibility.\u201cA perfect world, where you could commit to 4 percent and everybody believed it, would be great,\u201d Mr. Mishkin told me. \u201cWe are not in a perfect world. Moving much higher than 2 percent raises the risk that expectations become unanchored.\u201dSo here is an alternative proposal. If the Fed is too cautious to risk unhinging inflationary expectations, how about just delivering what it has promised? Among economists and investors, the problem with the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target is that just about everybody believes it is really a ceiling. That makes it even harder for inflation to rise to that level. The market expects the Fed to act pre-emptively to ensure it never goes over that line \u2014 which is what it seems to be doing now.If the Fed is not going to aim for higher inflation, the least it could do is re-anchor expectations to the goal it established, allowing inflation to fluctuate above and below a 2 percent average. That alone might help deal with the next economic crisis.\u201cWe haven\u2019t fully tested whether we can deal with this kind of crisis with a 2 percent inflation target,\u201d said David H. Romer of the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cCentral banks have lots of tools. If they say they are willing to keep using them until they get where they want, they can eventually do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Surges Past Donald Trump to Lead in Iowa Poll", "Date": "2015-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe survey, by one of Iowa\u2019s most respected pollsters, comes as Mr. Trump is increasingly hoping that a win in Iowa, whose caucuses are less than eight weeks away, will be a lightning strike on his way to the nomination.\u201cIf we win Iowa, I think we run the table,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday at a rally in Des Moines. He is far ahead in polls of the other early-voting states.But Mr. Cruz\u2019s sudden momentum in Iowa complicates Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. It could set up a protracted primary between Mr. Cruz as the choice of far-right Republicans, Mr. Trump as an anti-establishment outsider and perhaps a third candidate representing the center-right of the party.Mr. Cruz gained 21 percentage points in two months since the last Register poll. He has visited the state almost weekly, making the case that he is the answer to the right\u2019s long search for a conservative with unwavering principles and deep resources. Mr. Cruz was the top choice in the poll of evangelical Christians (45 percent) and Tea Party conservatives (39 percent). The poll provided a snapshot of how conservative Iowa\u2019s likely Republican voters are. Nearly six in 10 say climate change is a hoax. More than half want mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Six in 10 would abolish the Internal Revenue Service. With ample opportunities to see candidates up close, Iowans have distinct impressions. Mr. Cruz ranked highest on having the right temperament to be president and the right values to lead the nation. Mr. Trump, who draws the largest crowds of any candidate, nonetheless ranked behind Mr. Cruz, Mr. Carson and Mr. Rubio on the temperament question. He was seen as best able to solve illegal immigration, manage the economy and defeat Hillary Clinton in a general election.The race also remains fluid. Two out of three voters say they could be persuaded to choose someone else. That is hopeful news for Jeb Bush, in fifth place with 6 percent, and three others at 3 percent: Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.Long locked in a mutual nonaggression pact, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have teetered on the brink of hostilities in recent days.In a series of Twitter posts after his \u201cjudgment\u201d comments became public, Mr. Cruz tried to play down any rift, while Mr. Trump moved toward escalation.And in a speech in Des Moines on Friday, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Cruz\u2019s opposition to federal support for ethanol, an important state industry, and in a more audacious attack, he questioned Mr. Cruz\u2019s faith. \u201cAnd by the way, I do like Ted Cruz,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba.\u201dMr. Cruz, whose father emigrated from Cuba and is a fiery evangelical pastor, has succeeded more than any other candidate in enlisting conservative Christian support in Iowa. On Thursday, he won the endorsement of Bob Vander Plaats, a leader of the Christian right in Iowa.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated assertions that he is \u201cdoing really well with the evangelicals,\u201d his attack on Mr. Cruz\u2019s faith risks pushing away that large group of politically active voters, who in the past two Republican caucuses played a decisive role in choosing the winner, Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012.Mr. Trump sought on Friday to undermine the credibility of The Register poll even before it appeared, singling out the newspaper, the most influential in Iowa, during a customary interlude in which he attacks the news media.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard: The Des Moines Register is the worst,\u201d he said to cheers and applause. \u201cSome reporter named Jacobs, she is the worst,\u201d he said, referring to The Register\u2019s lead political reporter, Jennifer Jacobs.He accused the paper\u2019s polling, which has consistently been among the most accurate in surveying Iowa voters, of being biased against him.Mr. Trump\u2019s fear seems to be that if no candidate enters the Republican convention in July with enough delegates to win, it would trigger a stop-Trump movement with lower-performing candidates throwing their support to one of his competitors.He warned Friday of \u201cbloodsucker politicians\u201d controlling the convention and also repeated his threat to run as an independent. \u201cYou\u2019ll know in a month or two whether the establishment is treating me favorably,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

We also asked Republicans and independents nationwide to share their questions for the candidates. We teamed up with Facebook to send a campaign camper across the country over the past several weeks.Thousands of people stepped inside and recorded their questions on video.

I\u2019d like to invite each candidate to introduce himself or herself to our audience. You\u2019ll have one minute.First to you, Senator Paul.PAUL: The question is, how do we keep America safe from terrorism? Trump says we ought to close that Internet thing. The question really is, what does he mean by that? Like they do in North Korea? Like they do in China?Rubio says we should collect all Americans\u2019 records all of the time. The Constitution says otherwise. I think they\u2019re both wrong. I think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them. I think if we ban certain religions, if we censor the Internet, I think that at that point the terrorists will have won. Regime change hasn\u2019t won. Toppling secular dictators in the Middle East has only led to chaos and the rise of radical Islam. I think if we want to defeat terrorism, I think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism, we need to quit arming the allies of ISIS. If we want to defeat terrorism, the boots on the ground \u2014 the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots on the ground.As commander-in-chief, I will do whatever it takes to defend America. But in defending America, we cannot lose what America stands for. Today is the Bill of Rights\u2019 anniversary. I hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)Governor Kasich?KASICH: Thank you, Wolf. Just last weekend, just last week, a friend asked one of my daughters, \u201cDo you like politics?\u201d And my daughter said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And the reason I don\u2019t like it is because there\u2019s too much fighting, too much yelling. It\u2019s so loud, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d You know, I turned to my friend and I said, \u201cYou know, she\u2019s really on to something.\u201dAnd when we think about our country and the big issues that we face in this country; creating jobs, making sure people can keep their jobs, the need for rising wages, whether our children when they graduate from college can find a job, protecting the homeland, destroying ISIS, rebuilding defense. These are all the things that we need to focus on but we\u2019ll never get there if we\u2019re divided. We\u2019ll never get there if republicans and democrats just fight with one another.Frankly, we are republicans and they\u2019re democrats but before all of that, we\u2019re Americans. And I believe we need to unify in so many ways to rebuild our country, to strengthen our country, to rebuild our defense, and for America to secure it\u2019s place it world; for us, for our children, and for the next generation.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: Thank you Wolf.America has been betrayed. We\u2019ve been betrayed by the leadership that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton have provided to this country over the last number of years. Think about just what\u2019s happened today. The second largest school district in America in Los Angeles closed based on a threat. Think about the effect that, that\u2019s going to have on those children when they go back to school tomorrow wondering filled with anxiety to whether they\u2019re really going to be safe.Think about the mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop wondering whether their children will arrive back on that bus safe and sound. Think about the fathers of Los Angeles, who tomorrow will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children.What is Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton done to this country? That the most basic responsibility of an administration is to protect the safety and security of the American people. I will tell you this, I\u2019m a former federal prosecutor, I\u2019ve fought terrorists and won and when we get back in the White House we will fight terrorists and win again and America will be safe.(APPLAUSE) BLITZER: Ms. Fiorina?FIORINA: Like all of you I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s happening to our nation. Citizens, it\u2019s time to take our country back.Bombastic insults wont take it back. Political rhetoric that promises a lot and delivers little, won\u2019t take it back. All of our problems can be solved. All of our wounds can be healed by a tested leader who is willing to fight for the character of our nation.I have been tested. I have beaten breast cancer. I have buried a child. I started as a secretary. I fought my way to the top of corporate America while being called every B word in the book. I fought my way into this election and on to this debate stage while all the political insiders and the pundits told, \u201cit couldn\u2019t be done.\u201dI\u2019ve been told, \u201cno,: all my life. And all my life, I\u2019ve refused to accept no as an answer. Citizens, it is time to take our country back from the political class, from the media, from the liberal elite. It can be done, it must be done, join me and we will get it done.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Bush?BUSH: Our freedom is under attack. Our economy is under water. The leading democrat is under investigation. And America is under the gun to lead the free world to protect our civilized way of life.Serious times require strong leadership, that\u2019s what at stake right now. Regarding national security, we need to restore the defense cuts of Barack Obama to rebuild our military, to destroy ISIS before it destroys us. Regarding economic security, we need to take power and money away from Washington D.C. and empower American families so that they can rise up again.Look, America still is an exceptional country. We love to lead and we love to win. And we do it, when we take on any challenge and when we take - we support our friends.As president, I will keep you and our country safe, secure, and free.Thank you.BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Thank you Wolf.It\u2019s really amazing to be back in Las Vegas. I spent six years as a child growing not far from where we stand tonight. I use to sit on the porch of our home and listen to my grandfather tell stories as he smoked one of three daily cigars.One of the things my grandfather instilled in me, was that I was really blessed because I was a citizen of the greatest country in the history of our mankind. But there have always been people in American politics that wanted America to be more like the rest of the world. And In 2008, one of them was elected president of this country and the result has been a disaster.Today you have millions of Americans that feel left out and out of place in their own country, struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, called bigots because they hold on to traditional values.And around the world, America\u2019s influence has declined while this president has destroyed our military, our allies no longer trust us, and our adversaries no longer respect us. And that is why this election is so important.That is why I\u2019m running for president. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to ask you for your vote tonight. If you elect me president, we will have a president that believes America is the greatest country in the world and we will have a president that acts like it.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.America is at war. Our enemy is not violent extremism. It is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorist. We have a president who is unwilling to utter its name. The men and women on this stage, every one of us, is better prepared to keep this nation safe than is Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.We need a president who understands the first obligation of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. If I am elected president, we will hunt down and kill the terrorists. We will utterly destroy ISIS.We will stop the terrorist attacks before they occur because we will not be prisoners to political correctness. Rather, we will speak the truth. Border security is national security and we will not be admitting jihadists as refugees.We will keep America safe.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Dr. Carson.CARSON: Thank you, Wolf.Please join me for a moment of silence and remembrance of the San Bernardino victims. Thank you. You know, our country since its inception has been at war, every 15 or 20 years. But the war that we are fighting now against radical Islamist jihadists is one that we must win. Our very existence is dependent upon that.You know, as a pediatric neurosurgeon, I frequently faced life and death situations, and had to come up with the right diagnosis, the right plan, and execute that plan frequently with other colleagues.Right now, the United States of America is the patient. And the patient is in critical condition and will not be cured by political correctness and will not be cured by timidity.And I am asking the Congress, which represents the people, to declare a war on ISIS so that we can begin the process of excising that cancer and begin the healing process, and bring peace, prosperity, and safety back to America.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.I began this journey six months ago. My total focus was on building up our military, building up our strength, building up our borders, making sure that China, Japan, Mexico, both at the border and in trade, no longer takes advantage of our country.Certainly would never have made that horrible, disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion. They\u2019re a terrorist nation. But I began it talking about other things.And those things are things that I\u2019m very good at and maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m center stage. People saw it. People liked it. People respected it.A month ago things changed. Radical Islamic terrorism came into effect even more so than it has been in the past. People like what I say. People respect what I say. And we\u2019ve opened up a very big discussion that needed to be opened up.Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.Since you last debated, Americans have witnessed terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. The FBI director says the country now faces the greatest terror threat since 9/11. You all have different approaches to keeping the country safe. And that will be the focus of tonight\u2019s debate.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, as you mentioned in your opening statement, part of your strategy is to focus in on America\u2019s borders. To keep the country safe, you say you want to temporarily ban non-American Muslims from coming to the United States; ban refugees fleeing ISIS from coming here; deport 11 million people; and wall off America\u2019s southern border. Is the best way to make America great again to isolate it from much of the rest of the world?TRUMP: We are not talking about isolation. We\u2019re talking about security. We\u2019re not talking about religion. We\u2019re talking about security. Our country is out of control. People are pouring across the southern border. I will build a wall. It will be a great wall. People will not come in unless they come in legally. Drugs will not pour through that wall.As far as other people like in the migration, where they\u2019re going, tens of thousands of people having cell phones with ISIS flags on them? I don\u2019t think so, Wolf. They\u2019re not coming to this country. And if I\u2019m president and if Obama has brought some to this country, they are leaving. They\u2019re going. They\u2019re gone.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Bush, you called Mr. Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d when he proposed banning non-American Muslims from the United States. Why is that unhinged?BUSH: Well, first of all, we need to destroy ISIS in the caliphate. That\u2019s \u2014 that should be our objective. The refugee issue will be solved if we destroy ISIS there, which means we need to have a no-fly zone, safe zones there for refugees and to build a military force.We need to embed our forces \u2014 our troops inside the Iraqi military. We need to arm directly the Kurds. And all of that has to be done in concert with the Arab nations. And if we\u2019re going to ban all Muslims, how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy ISIS?The Kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies. They\u2019re Muslim. Look, this is not a serious proposal. In fact, it will push the Muslim world, the Arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy ISIS.So Donald, you know, is great at \u2014 at the one-liners, but he\u2019s a chaos candidate. And he\u2019d be a chaos president. He would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Jeb doesn\u2019t really believe I\u2019m unhinged. He said that very simply because he has failed in this campaign. It\u2019s been a total disaster. Nobody cares. And frankly, I\u2019m the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company and all I want to do is make America great again.I don\u2019t want our country to be taken away from us, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. The policies that we\u2019ve suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America great again. And Jeb, in all fairness, he doesn\u2019t believe that.BUSH: Look, he mentioned me. I can bring \u2014 I can talk. This is \u2014 this is the problem. Banning all Muslims will make it harder for us to do exactly what we need to do, which is to destroy ISIS. We need a strategy. We need to get the lawyers off the back of the warfighters. Right now under President Obama, we\u2019ve created this \u2014 this standard that is so high that it\u2019s impossible to be successful in fighting ISIS.We need to engage with the Arab world to make this happen. It is not a serious proposal to say that \u2014 to the people that you\u2019re asking for their support that they can\u2019t even come to the country to even engage in a dialogue with us. That\u2019s not a serious proposal. We need a serious leader to deal with this. And I believe I\u2019m that guy.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio \u2014 I\u2019m going to go to Senator Rubio and get his thoughts.You have said banning Muslims is unconstitutional. But according to a recent ABC News-Washington Post poll, a majority of Republicans support Mr. Trump\u2019s idea. Why are they wrong?RUBIO: Well, I understand why they feel that way, because this president hasn\u2019t kept us safe. The problem is we had an attack in San Bernardino. And we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade since 9/11, and then all the talk was about this proposal, which isn\u2019t going to happen.But this is what\u2019s important to do is we must deal frontally with this threat of radical Islamists, especially from ISIS. This is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America. They are actively recruiting Americans. The attacker in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. He was a health inspector; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people.We also understand that this is a group that\u2019s growing in its governance of territory. It\u2019s not just Iraq and Syria. They are now a predominant group in Libya. They are beginning to pop up in Afghanistan. They are increasingly involved now in attacks in Yemen. They have Jordan in their sights.This group needs to be confronted with serious proposals. And this is a very significant threat we face. And the president has left us unsafe. He spoke the other night to the American people to reassure us. I wish he hadn\u2019t spoken at all. He made things worse. Because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing now, and what we are doing now is not working.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Hugh Hewitt, you have a question.HEWITT: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve said you disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s policy. I don\u2019t want a cage match; you\u2019ve tweeted you don\u2019t want a cage match. But Republican primary voters deserve to know, with the kind of specificity and responsiveness you delivered in your nine Supreme Court arguments, how you disagree with Mr. Trump. Would you spell that out with us?CRUZ: Well, listen, Hugh, everyone understands why Donald has suggested what he has. We\u2019re looking at a president who\u2019s engaged in this double-speak where he doesn\u2019t call radical Islamic terrorism by its name. Indeed, he gives a speech after the San Bernardino attack where his approach is to try to go after the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens rather than to keep us safe.And even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.I understand why Donald made that proposal. I introduced legislation in the Senate that I believe is more narrowly focused at the actual threat, which is radical Islamic terrorism, and what my legislation would do is suspend all refugees for three years from countries where ISIS or Al Qaida control substantial territory.HEWITT: So you\u2019re saying you disagree because he\u2019s too broad and you have a narrower focus? Why do you disagree with him?CRUZ: Well, you know, I\u2019m reminded of what FDR\u2019s grandfather said. He said, \u201cAll horse-thieves are Democrats, but not all Democrats are horse-thieves.\u201d(LAUGHTER)In this instance, there are millions of peaceful Muslims across the world, in countries like India, where there is not the problems we are seeing in nations that are controlled \u2014 have territory controlled by Al Qaida or ISIS, and we should direct at the problem, focus on the problem, and defeat radical Islamic terrorism. It\u2019s not a war on a faith; it\u2019s a war on a political and theocratic ideology that seeks to murder us.HEWITT: Carly Fiorina... (APPLAUSE)... this is the Christmas dinner debate. This will be the debate that Americans talk about at Christmas. And thus far, in the first 10 minutes, we haven\u2019t heard a lot about Ronald Reagan\u2019s city on a hill. We\u2019ve heard a lot about keeping Americans out or keeping Americans safe and everyone else out. Is this what you want the party to stand for?FIORINA: What I think we need to stand for are solutions. I offer myself as a leader to the people of this country because I think they\u2019re looking for solutions, not lawyers arguing over laws or entertainers throwing out sound bites that draw media attention. We need to solve the problem.To solve the problem, we need to do something here at home and something over there in their caliphate. We need to deny them territory.But here at home, we need to do two fundamental things. Number one, we need to recognize that technology has moved on. The Patriot Act was signed in 2001, roughly. The iPhone was invented in 2007. The iPad was invented in 2011. Snapchat and Twitter, all the rest of it, have been around just for several years. Technology has moved on, and the terrorists have moved on with it.Let me tell you a story. Soon after 9/11, I got a phone call from the NSA. They needed help. I gave them help. I stopped a truckload of equipment. I had it turned around. It was escorted by the NSA into headquarters. We need the private sector\u2019s help, because government is not innovating. Technology is running ahead by leaps and bound. The private sector will help, just as I helped after 9/11. But they must be engaged, and they must be asked. I will ask them. I know them.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Christie, Americans are clearly more afraid today than at any time since 9/11. As you mentioned in your opening statement, today in Los Angeles, 650 schoolchildren didn\u2019t go to \u2014 650,000 schoolchildren didn\u2019t go to school because of an e-mail threat, this two weeks after an attack killed 14 people in San Bernardino. Is this the new normal? And if so, what steps would you take as president of the United States to ensure that fear does not paralyze America?CHRISTIE: Wolf, unfortunately, it\u2019s the new normal under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The fact is that if you listen to Hillary Clinton the other day, what she said to the American people was, as regards to ISIS, my strategy would be just about the same as the president\u2019s.Just about the same as the president\u2019s? We have people across this country who are scared to death. Because I could tell you this, as a former federal prosecutor, if a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino, California, is now a target for terrorists, that means everywhere in America is a target for these terrorists.Now, I spent seven years of my life in the immediate aftermath of September 11th doing this work, working with the Patriot Act, working with our law enforcement, working with the surveillance community to make sure that we keep America safe.What we need to do, Wolf, is restore those tools that have been taken away by the president and others, restore those tools to the NSA and to our entire surveillance and law enforcement community.We need a president who is going to understand what actionable intelligence looks like and act on it. And we need a president and a cabinet who understands that the first and most important priority of the president of the United States is to protect the safety and security of Americans.As someone who has done it, I will make sure it gets done again.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.Governor Kasich, one of the killers in San Bernardino was an American who was not on anyone\u2019s watch list. How are you going to find that radicalized person and stop another such attack?KASICH: Well, first of all, Wolf, I said last February that we needed to have people on the ground, troops on the ground in a coalition similar to what we had in the first Gulf War.I remember when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States stood in the Rose Garden and pledged Arab commitment to removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. Before we came out here tonight, I am told that the Saudis have organized 34 countries who want to join in the battle against terrorism.First and foremost, we need to go and destroy ISIS. And we need to do this with our Arab friends and our friends in Europe.And when I see they have a climate conference over in Paris, they should have been talking about destroying ISIS because they are involved in virtually every country, you know, across this world.(APPLAUSE)Now, you destroy ISIS in a coalition. You get joint intelligence with our European friends. And then here at home, there are things called the Joint Terrorism Task Force, headed by the FBI, and made up of local law enforcement, including state police.They need the tools. And the tools involve encryption where we cannot hear what they\u2019re even planning. And when we see red flags, a father, a mother, a neighbor who says we have got a problem here, then we have to give law enforcement the ability to listen so they can disrupt these terrorist attacks before they occur.We can do this, but we\u2019ve got to get moving. Pay me now or pay me a lot more later. This is the direction we need to go.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.Dana Bash, you have the next question.BASH: A crucial question is how to balance surveillance with privacy and keeping Americans safe.Senator Cruz, you voted for a bill that President Obama signed into law just this past June that made it harder for the government to access Americans\u2019 phone records. In light of the San Bernardino attack, was your vote a mistake?CRUZ: Well, Dana, the premise of your question is not accurate. I\u2019m very proud to have joined with conservatives in both the Senate and the House to reform how we target bad guys.And what the USA Freedom Act did is it did two things. Number one, it ended the federal government\u2019s bulk collection of phone metadata of millions of law-abiding citizens.But number two in the second half of it that is critical. It strengthened the tools of national security and law enforcement to go after terrorists. It gave us greater tools and we are seeing those tools work right now in San Bernardino.And in particular, what it did is the prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. When you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines.The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have Internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys.You know what the Obama administration keeps getting wrong is whenever anything bad happens they focus on law-abiding citizens instead of focusing on the bad guys.We need to focus on radical Islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Thank you.Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz is right there was bipartisan support for that. But you voted against it. So, is Senator Cruz wrong?RUBIO: He is and so are those that voted for it. There were some that voted for it because they wanted to keep it alive and they were afraid the whole program would expire.Here\u2019s the world we live in. This is a radical jihadist group that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability, for example, to radicalize American citizens, in its inability to exploit loopholes in our legal immigration system, in its ability to capture and hold territory in the Middle East, as I outlined earlier, in multiple countries.This is not just the most capable, it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. We are now at a time when we need more tools, not less tools. And that took we lost, the metadata program, was a valuable tool that we no longer have at our disposal.BASH: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Well, you know, I would note that Marco knows what he\u2019s saying isn\u2019t true. You know, Mark Levin wrote a column last week that says that the attack ads his Super PAC is running that are saying the same thing, that they are knowingly false and they are, in fact, Alinsky-like attacks like Barack Obama.And the reason is simple. What he knows is that the old program covered 20 percent to 30 percent of phone numbers to search for terrorists. The new program covers nearly 100 percent. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that that\u2019s the case.RUBIO: Dana, may I interject here?BASH: Senator \u2014 Senator \u2014 Senator Rubio, please respond.RUBIO: Let me be very careful when answering this, because I don\u2019t think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information. So let me just be very clear. There is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before.This bill did, however, take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law \u2014 and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling. Because I promise you, the next time there is attack on \u2014 an attack on this country, the first thing people are going to want to know is, why didn\u2019t we know about it and why didn\u2019t we stop it? And the answer better not be because we didn\u2019t have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attacked.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Paul, Senator Paul, I know this is \u2014 this has been a very big issue for you. You hear many of your colleagues are calling for increased surveillance by law enforcement. You call that hogwash. Why is that hogwash?PAUL: You know, I think Marco gets it completely wrong. We are not any safer through the bulk collection of all Americans\u2019 records. In fact, I think we\u2019re less safe. We get so distracted by all of the information, we\u2019re not spending enough time getting specific immigration \u2014 specific information on terrorists.The other thing is, is the one thing that might have stopped San Bernardino, that might have stopped 9/11 would have been stricter controls on those who came here. And Marco has opposed at every point increased security \u2014 border security for those who come to our country.On his Gang of Eight bill, he would have liberalized immigration, but he did not \u2014 and he steadfastly opposed any new border security requirements for refugees or students.Last week, I introduced another bill saying we need more security, we need more scrutiny. Once again, Marco opposed this. So Marco can\u2019t have it both ways. He thinks he wants to be this, \u201cOh, I\u2019m great and strong on national defense.\u201d But he\u2019s the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless. If we want to defend the country, we have to defend against who\u2019s coming in, and Marco is \u2014 has more of an allegiance to Chuck Schumer and to the liberals than he does to conservative policy.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: I want to thank Rand for another 30 seconds, because, number one, what he\u2019s pointing to is a bill last week that \u2014 amendment that he voted for that only 10 people voted for. You know why? Because it\u2019s not focused on terrorists. It would have banned anyone from coming here. Someone from Taiwan would not have been able to come here as a tourist.Number two, this program, this metadata program is actually more strict than what a regular law enforcement agency has now. If a regular law enforcement agency wants your phone records, all they have to do is issue a subpoena. But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling. And the terrorists that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. And I bet you we wish we would have had access to five years of his records so we could see who he was working with...(CROSSTALK)BASH: Governor Christie, Governor Christie...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BASH: Governor Christie, I\u2019ll come to you in a minute. Go ahead, Senator Paul.PAUL: If I was mentioned in the question, can I respond? BASH: Go ahead, please.PAUL: Marco still misunderstands the immigration issue. What I put forward was an amendment that would have temporarily halted immigration from high-risk terrorist countries, but would have started it up, but I wanted them to go through Global Entry, which is a program where we do background checks.The thing is, is that every terrorist attack we\u2019ve had since 9/11 has been legal immigration. Marco wants to expand that. I want more rules, more scrutiny, and to defend the country, you have to defend the border.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator, we\u2019re going to talk about immigration in a while. But, Governor Christie, just listening to this...RUBIO: Do I get another 30 seconds? He mentioned me.BASH: Listening to this, you talked \u2014 you heard Senator Paul, Senator Cruz talk about how important it is to protect Americans\u2019 privacy, even in a time of grave danger. Why \u2014 what\u2019s wrong with that?CHRISTIE: Listen, I want to talk to the audience at home for a second. If your eyes are glazing over like mine, this is what it\u2019s like to be on the floor of the United States Senate. I mean, endless debates about how many angels on the head of a pin from people who\u2019ve never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position.The fact is, for seven years, I had to make these decisions after 9/11, make a decision about how to proceed forward with an investigation or how to pull back, whether you use certain actionable intelligence or whether not to. And yet they continue to debate about this bill and in the subcommittee and what \u2014 nobody in America cares about that.CHRISTIE: What they care about is, are we going to have a president who actually knows what they\u2019re doing to make these decisions? And for the seven years afterwards, New Jersey was threatened like no other region in this country and what we did was we took action within the constitution to make sure that law enforcement had all the information they needed.We prosecuted two of the biggest terrorism cases in the world and stopped Fort Dix from being attacked by six American radicalized Muslims from a Mosque in New Jersey because we worked with the Muslim American community to get intelligence and we used the Patriot Act to get other intelligence to make sure we did those cases. This is the difference between actually been a federal prosecutor, actually doing something, and not just spending your life as one of hundred debating it.Let\u2019s talk about how we do this, not about which bill, which one these guys like more. The American people don\u2019t care about that.BLITZER: Thank you.Dr. Carson, you\u2019re in favor of monitoring mosques and schools where there is anti-America sentiment, what do you consider anti- America?CARSON: First of all, let me just complain a little bit. This is the first time I\u2019ve spoken and several people have had multiple questions so please try to pay attention to that. Now, as far as monitoring is concerned, what my point is, we need to make sure that any place - I don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s a mosque, a school, a supermarket, a theater, you know it doesn\u2019t matter. If there are a lot of people getting there and engaging in radicalizing activities then we need to be suspicious of it.We have to get rid of all this PC stuff. And people are worried about if somebody\u2019s going to say that I\u2019m Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness because we are at war. That\u2019s why I asked congress, go ahead and declare the war .We need to be on a war footing. We need to understand that our nation is in grave danger. You know, what the Muslim Brotherhood said in the explanatory memorandum that was discovered during the Holy Land Foundation Trial was that, \u201cthey will take advantage of our PC attitude to get us. :\u201dWe have to be better than this. We have to be smarter than they are.BLITZER: Dr. Carson, who was right in that little debate that we just heard between Senator Rubio and Senator Paul?CARSON: I think you have to ask them about that. I don\u2019t want to get in between them. Let them fight.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on a sec, we have a lot more to come and everybody\u2019s going to have their full opportunity.Governor Bush, six days after 9/11 your brother visited a mosque and said quote, \u201cIslam is peace.\u201d The conversation tonight is about banning Muslims and surveillance of mosques, are President Bush\u2019s words still relevant in today\u2019s Republican party?BUSH: They are reverent if we want to destroy ISIS. If we want to destroy radical Islamic terrors, we can\u2019t disassociate ourselves from peace loving Muslims. If we expect to do this on our own, we will fail but if we do it in unison with people who are also are at risk and threatened by Islamic Radical terrorism, we\u2019ll be far more successful.Look, the FBI has the tools necessary un-American activities in our country. It goes on, we shouldn\u2019t even be talking about it, to be honest with you out in the public. Of course they have those capabilities and we should make sure that we give the FBI, the NSA, our intelligence communities, all the resources they need to keep us safe.But the main thing we should be focused on is the strategy to destroy ISIS. And I laid out a plan that the Reagan Library before the tragedy of Paris, and before San Bernardino to do just that. It requires leadership, it\u2019s not filing an amendment and call it a success.It is developing a strategy, leading the world, funding it to make sure that we have a military that\u2019s second to none, and doing the job and making sure that we destroy ISIS there. That\u2019s how you keep America safe.BLITZER: Ms. Fiorina, as you pointed out you were a CEO in Silicon Valley on 9/11. Companies there, they say they won\u2019t help the FBI now crack encrypted communication from ISIS, should they be forced to.FIORINA: You know, listening to this conversation, let me just say, we have a lot of argument about laws but none of it solves the problem. Let\u2019s examine what happened, why did we miss the Tsarnaev brothers, why did we miss the San Bernardino couple? It wasn\u2019t because we had stopped collected metadata it was because, I think, as someone who comes from the technology world, we were using the wrong algorithms.This is a place where the private sector could be helpful because the government is woefully behind the technology curve. But secondly, the bureaucratic processes that have been in place since 9/11 are woefully inadequate as well. What do we now know? That DHS vets people by going into databases of known or suspected terrorists.FIORINA: And yet, we also know that ISIS is recruiting who are not in those databases. So of course, we\u2019re going to miss them. And then we now learn that DHS says, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t check their social media.\u201dFor heaven\u2019s sakes, every parent in America is checking social media and every employer is as well, but our government can\u2019t do it. The bureaucratic procedures are so far behind. Our government has become incompetent, unresponsive, corrupt. And that incompetence, ineptitude, lack of accountability is now dangerous.It is why we need a different kind of leadership in the White House that understands how to get bureaucracies competent again.BLITZER: But my question was: Should these Silicon Valley companies be forced to cooperate with the FBI?FIORINA: They do not need to be forced. They need to be asked to bring the best and brightest, the most recent technology to the table. I was asked as a CEO. I complied happily. And they will as well. But they have not been asked. That\u2019s why it cost billions of dollars to build an Obama website that failed because the private sector wasn\u2019t asked.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, you recently suggested closing that Internet up, those were your words, as a way to stop ISIS from recruiting online. Are you referring to closing down actual portions of the Internet? Some say that would put the U.S. in line with China and North Korea.TRUMP: Well, look, this is so easy to answer. ISIS is recruiting through the Internet. ISIS is using the Internet better than we are using the Internet, and it was our idea. What I wanted to do is I wanted to get our brilliant people from Silicon Valley and other places and figure out a way that ISIS cannot do what they\u2019re doing.You talk freedom of speech. You talk freedom of anything you want. I don\u2019t want them using our Internet to take our young, impressionable youth and watching the media talking about how they\u2019re masterminds \u2014 these are masterminds. They shouldn\u2019t be using the word \u201cmastermind.\u201d These are thugs. These are terrible people in ISIS, not masterminds. And we have to change it from every standpoint. But we should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet. And then on second, we should be able to penetrate the Internet and find out exactly where ISIS is and everything about ISIS. And we can do that if we use our good people.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Let me follow up, Mr. Trump.So, are you open to closing parts of the Internet?TRUMP: I would certainly be open to closing areas where we are at war with somebody. I sure as hell don\u2019t want to let people that want to kill us and kill our nation use our Internet. Yes, sir, I am.BLITZER: Thank you.Governor Kasich, is shutting down any part of the Internet a good idea?KASICH: No, I don\u2019t think it is. And I want to go back to two other issues. One is the metadata. We know we have to hold this data for a longer period of time. And, you know, in a lot of ways, Chris is right. Look, what a president has to do is take a position. We don\u2019t want to err on the side of having less. We want to err on the side of having more. That\u2019s good for our families.In addition to that, Wolf, there is a big problem. It\u2019s called encryption. And the people in San Bernardino were communicating with people who the FBI had been watching. But because their phone was encrypted, because the intelligence officials could not see who they were talking to, it was lost.We have to solve the encryption problem. It is not easy. A president of the United States, again, has to bring people together, have a position. We need to be able to penetrate these people when they are involved in these plots and these plans. And we have to give the local authorities the ability to penetrate to disrupt. That\u2019s what we need to do. Encryption is a major problem, and Congress has got to deal with this and so does the president to keep us safe.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.The fight against radical Islamic terrorists and ISIS has been called the war of our time. So let\u2019s talk about how each of you, as commander in chief, would fight this war and win it.Senator Cruz, you have said you would, quote, \u201ccarpet bomb ISIS into oblivion,\u201d testing whether, quote, \u201csand can glow in the dark.\u201d Does that mean leveling the ISIS capital of Raqqa in Syria where there are hundreds of thousands of civilians?CRUZ: What it means is using overwhelming air power to utterly and completely destroy ISIS. To put things in perspective, in the first Persian Gulf War, we launched roughly 1,100 air attacks a day. We carpet bombed them for 36 days, saturation bombing, after which our troops went in and in a day and a half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.Right now, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. It is photo op foreign policy. We need to use overwhelming air power. We need to be arming the Kurds. We need to be fighting and killing ISIS where they are.And let me go back to the earlier discussion a minute ago. It\u2019s not a lack of competence that is preventing the Obama administration from stopping these attacks. It is political correctness. We didn\u2019t monitor the Facebook posting of the female San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate. She made a public call to jihad, and they didn\u2019t target it.The Tsarnaev brothers, the elder brother made a public call to jihad and the Obama administration didn\u2019t target it. Nidal Hasan communicated with Anwar al-Awlaki, a known radical cleric, asked about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers. The problem is because of political correctness, the Obama administration, like a lot of folks here, want to search everyone\u2019s cell phones and e-mails and not focus on the bad guys. And political correctness is killing people.BLITZER: Thank you. To be clear, Senator Cruz, would you carpet bomb Raqqa, the ISIS capital, where there are a lot of civilians, yes or no?CRUZ: You would carpet bomb where ISIS is, not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed \u2014 and you have embedded special forces to direction the air power. But the object isn\u2019t to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists.To make it \u2014 listen, ISIS is gaining strength because the perception is that they\u2019re winning. And President Obama fuels that perception. That will change when militants across the globe see that when you join ISIS that you are giving up your life, you are signing your death warrant, and we need a president who is focused on defeating every single ISIS terrorist and protecting the homeland, which should be the first priority.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve been critical of Senator Cruz\u2019s strategy. You say his voting record doesn\u2019t match his rhetoric. Why?RUBIO: Well, let me begin by saying that we have to understand who ISIS is. ISIS is a radical Sunni group. They cannot just be defeated through air strikes. Air strikes are a key component of defeating them, but they must be defeated on the ground by a ground force. And that ground force must be primarily made up of Sunni Arabs themselves, Sunni Arabs that reject them ideologically and confront them militarily.We will have to embed additional American special operators alongside them to help them with training, to help them conduct special missions, and to help improve the air strikes. The air strikes are important, but we need to have an air force capable of it. And because of the budget cuts we are facing in this country, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force we have ever had. We have to reverse those cuts, in addition to the cuts to our Navy and in addition to the cuts to our Army, as well.And beyond that, I would say we must win the information war against ISIS. Every war we have ever been involved in has had a propaganda informational aspect to it. ISIS is winning the propaganda war. They are recruiting people, including Americans, to join them, with the promise that they are joining this great apocalyptic movement that is going to defeat the West. We have to show what life is really like in ISIS territory, and we have to show them why ISIS is not invincible, by going out and conducting these attacks and publicizing them to those who they recruit.BLITZER: Because I asked the question, Senator, because you said this. You said he, referring to Senator Cruz, voted against the Defense Authorization Act every year that it came up, and I assume that if he voted against it, he would veto it as president. That\u2019s the bill that funds our troops.RUBIO: That is accurate. Three times he voted against the Defense Authorization Act, which is a bill that funds the troops. It also, by the way, funds the Iron Dome and other important programs. And I have to assume that if you vote against it in the Senate, you would also veto it as president.He has also supported, by the way, a budget that is called the containment budget. And it is a budget that would radically reduce the amount of money we spend on our military. You can\u2019t carpet bomb ISIS if you don\u2019t have planes and bombs to attack them with. And if we continue those cuts that we\u2019re doing now, not to mention additional cuts, we are going to be left with the oldest and the smallest Air Force this country has ever had, and that leaves us less safe.BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Well, you know, Marco has continued these attacks, and he knows they\u2019re not true. Yes, it is true that I voted against the National Defense Authorization Act, because when I campaigned in Texas I told voters in Texas that I would oppose the federal government having the authority to detain U.S. citizens permanently with no due process. I have repeatedly supported an effort to take that out of that bill, and I honored that campaign commitment.CRUZ: But more broadly, you know, the notion Marco is suggesting, that somehow \u2014 he also has tossed more than a few insults this direction \u2014 let\u2019s be absolutely clear. ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism will face no more determined foe than I will be.We will utterly destroy them by targeting the bad guys. And one of the problems with Marco\u2019s foreign policy is he has far too often supported Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama undermining governments in the Middle East that have helped radical Islamic terrorists.We need to focus on killing the bad guys, not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars that don\u2019t keep America safe.BLITZER: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, let me \u2014 three points of distinction. The first is, if you\u2019re an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS, we\u2019re not going to read you your Miranda rights. You\u2019re going to be treated as an enemy combatant, a member of an army attacking this country.(APPLAUSE)Number two, we do need our defense capabilities. It is a fact that the cuts we are facing today and the cuts that Senator Cruz would have supported would leave us with an even smaller Air Force and a smaller Navy than the one we are going to be left with.And the final point that I would make is Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s strategy is to lead from behind. It sounds like what he is outlining is not to lead at all. We cannot continue to outsource foreign policy. We must lead. We are the most powerful nation in the world. We need to begin to act like it, again.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: We are going to have much more on this...PAUL: Wolf...BLITZER: We\u2019re going to have much more on this. But I want to move now back to Mr. Trump.PAUL: Wolf, this legislation...BLITZER: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. PAUL: This legislation on indefinite detention...BLITZER: We have a lot...PAUL: ... I think deserves a little more attention.BLITZER: We have a lot to discuss. I want to move to Mr. Trump right now. We have a question on this war against ISIS and how you would fight and win this war. Here\u2019s the question from Facebook. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOSH JACOB, COLLEGE STUDENT: I\u2019m Josh Jacob from Georgia Tech. Recently Donald Trump mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law.So my question is, how would intentionally killing innocent civilians set us apart from ISIS?(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: We have to be much tougher. We have to be much stronger than we\u2019ve been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on.They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back, for the most part, to Saudi Arabia.They knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television. I would be very, very firm with families. Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families\u2019 lives.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Donald, this has got...BLITZER: Governor Bush. Governor Bush.BUSH: This is another example of the lack of seriousness. Look, this is \u2014 this is troubling because we\u2019re at war. They\u2019ve declared war on us and we need to have a serious strategy to destroy ISIS.But the idea that that is a solution to this is just \u2014 is just crazy. It makes no sense to suggest this. Look, two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago he said that Hillary Clinton would be a great negotiator with Iran. And he gets his foreign policy experience from the shows.That is not a serious kind of candidate. We need someone that thinks this through. That can lead our country to safety and security.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Look, the problem is we need toughness. Honestly, I think Jeb is a very nice person. He\u2019s a very nice person. But we need tough people. We need toughness. We need intelligence and we need tough.Jeb said when they come across the southern border they come as an act of love.BUSH: You said on September 30th that ISIS was not a factor.TRUMP: Am I talking or are you talking, Jeb?BUSH: I\u2019m talking right now. I\u2019m talking.TRUMP: You can go back. You\u2019re not talking. You interrupted me.BUSH: September 30th you said...TRUMP: Are you going to apologize, Jeb? No. Am I allowed to finish?BLITZER: Just one at a time, go ahead...TRUMP: Excuse me, am I allowed to finish?BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: So...BUSH: A little of your own medicine there, Donald.TRUMP: ... again...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Governor Bush, please.TRUMP: I know you\u2019re trying to build up your energy, Jeb, but it\u2019s not working very well.(LAUGHTER)BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: Look, look, look. We need a toughness. We need strength. We\u2019re not respected, you know, as a nation anymore. We don\u2019t have that level of respect that we need. And if we don\u2019t get it back fast, we\u2019re just going to go weaker, weaker and just disintegrate.We can\u2019t allow that to happen. We need strength. We don\u2019t have it. When Jeb comes out and he talks about the border, and I saw it and I was witness to it, and so was everyone else, and I was standing there, \u201cthey come across as an act of love,\u201d he\u2019s saying the same thing right now with radical Islam.And we can\u2019t have that in our country. It just won\u2019t work. We need strength.BLITZER: Governor Bush.BUSH: Donald, you\u2019re not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency. That\u2019s not going to happen.(APPLAUSE)And I do have the strength. Leadership, leadership is not about attacking people and disparaging people. Leadership is about creating a serious strategy to deal with the threat of our time.BUSH: And I laid out that strategy before the attacks in Paris and before the attacks in San Bernardino. And it is the way forward. We need to increase our military spending. We need to deal with a no- fly zone in Syria, a safe zone. We need to focus on building a military that is second-to-none...BLITZER: Thank you.BUSH: ... so that we can destroy Islamic terrorism.TRUMP: With Jeb\u2019s attitude, we will never be great again, that I can tell you. We will never be great again.BLITZER: All right. Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash, Hugh, go ahead with the next question.HEWITT: Dr. Carson...(APPLAUSE)... you mentioned in your opening remarks that you\u2019re a pediatric neurologist surgeon...CARSON: Neurosurgeon.HEWITT: Neurosurgeon. And people admire and respect and are inspired by your life story, your kindness, your evangelical core support. We\u2019re talking about ruthless things tonight \u2014 carpet bombing, toughness, war. And people wonder, could you do that? Could you order air strikes that would kill innocent children by not the scores, but the hundreds and the thousands? Could you wage war as a commander-in-chief?CARSON: Well, interestingly enough, you should see the eyes of some of those children when I say to them we\u2019re going to have to open your head up and take out this tumor. They\u2019re not happy about it, believe me. And they don\u2019t like me very much at that point. But later on, they love me.Sometimes you \u2014 I sound like him.(APPLAUSE)You know, later on, you know, they really realize what\u2019s going on. And by the same token, you have to be able to look at the big picture and understand that it\u2019s actually merciful if you go ahead and finish the job, rather than death by 1,000 pricks.HEWITT: So you are OK with the deaths of thousands of innocent children and civilian? It\u2019s like...CARSON: You got it. You got it.HEWITT: That is what war \u2014 can you be as ruthless as Churchill was in prosecuting the war against the Nazis?CARSON: Ruthless is not necessarily the word I would use, but tough, resolute, understanding what the problems are, and understanding that the job of the president of the United States is to protect the people of this country and to do what is necessary in order to get it done.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Paul, you said ISIS grew stronger because of the hawks in your party. Do you really think that Republicans have fueled the rise of ISIS?PAUL: I think that by arming the allies of ISIS, the Islamic rebels against Assad, that we created a safe space or made that space bigger for ISIS to grow. I think those who have wanted regime change have made a mistake. When we toppled Gadhafi in Libya, I think that was a mistake. I think ISIS grew stronger, we had a failed state, and we were more at risk.I\u2019d like to also go back to, though, another question, which is, is Donald Trump a serious candidate? The reason I ask this is, if you\u2019re going to close the Internet, realize, America, what that entails. That entails getting rid of the First amendment, OK? It\u2019s no small feat.If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there\u2019s something called the Geneva Convention we\u2019re going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that is America. So when you ask yourself, whoever you are, that think you\u2019re going to support Donald Trump, think, do you believe in the Constitution? Are you going to change the Constitution?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: So, they can kill us, but we can\u2019t kill them? That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. And as far as the Internet is concerned, we\u2019re not talking about closing the Internet. I\u2019m talking about parts of Syria, parts of Iraq, where ISIS is, spotting it.Now, you could close it. What I like even better than that is getting our smartest and getting our best to infiltrate their Internet, so that we know exactly where they\u2019re going, exactly where they\u2019re going to be. I like that better.(APPLAUSE)But we have to \u2014 who would be \u2014 I just can\u2019t imagine somebody booing. These are people that want to kill us, folks, and you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re objecting to us infiltrating their conversations? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Paul, Senator Paul, I want to go back to my initial question, which is you saying that ISIS grew stronger because of hawks in your party. And do you think your own party, the people who you\u2019re describing, are responsible for the rise of ISIS?PAUL: I think that if you believe in regime change, you\u2019re mistaken. In 2013, we put 600 tons of weapons \u2014 us, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar \u2014 into the war against Assad. By pushing Assad back, we did create a safe space.We had people coming to our Foreign Relations Committee and saying, \u201cOh, we need to arm the allies of Al Qaida.\u201d They are still saying this. It is a crazy notion. This is the biggest debate we should be having tonight is is regime change a good idea; has it been a good idea.There are still people \u2014 the majority on the stage, they want to topple Assad. And then there will be chaos, and I think ISIS will then be in charge of Syria.BASH: Senator, we\u2019re going to talk about regime change in a bit.But Governor Kasich, would you like to respond to Senator Paul?KASICH: Yeah, let me \u2014 let me just suggest to everybody, and I hear \u2014 last February, I said we needed to have people on the ground in a coalition with Europe and our allies. This is not going to get done just by working with the Sunnis. And it is not going to get done if we just embed a few people.We have to go massively, like we did in the first Gulf War where we destroyed Saddam\u2019s ability to take Kuwait. We need to have a coalition that will stand for nothing less than the total destruction of ISIS and we have to be the leader. We can\u2019t wait for anybody else. I served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years and we must lead, or the job won\u2019t get done, unfortunately, for our country.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.Senator Rubio? Let\u2019s continue this conversation. This is a critically important issue.FIORINA: I hope at some point you\u2019re going to ask me my strategy.BLITZER: We will get to \u2014 we have a lot of time, Ms. Fiorina.I want to get to Senator Rubio right now. Let\u2019s talk about, one of the aspects of your strategy, you say the only way to defeat ISIS is with ground forces made up primarily of Sunni-Arab forces. Those Arab nations, though, as you well know, they\u2019ve conducted less than five percent of the airstrikes and actually none since August. What makes you think they are willing to fight on the ground if they\u2019re not even willing to fight from the air?RUBIO: Well, they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide more than what they are doing now. There\u2019s no doubt about it. And there\u2019s one \u2014 one major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition, and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president. This president cut a deal with their moral enemy, the Shia, in Iran. And this is the reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside them.But they have as much invested in this as we do. In fact, more so, for it is the king of Saudi Arabia they want to behead first. It\u2019s the king of Jordan that they want to dethrone. It\u2019s the \u2014 they want to go into Egypt the way they\u2019ve already gone into Libya.And on another point that we need to talk about, Assad is one of the main reasons why ISIS even exists to begin with. Assad is a puppet of Iran. And he has been so brutal toward the Sunni within Syria that he created the space that led to the people of Syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him. That led to the chaos which allowed ISIS to come in and take advantage of that situation and grow more powerful.And the fact that this president led from behind meant there were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered, leaving ISIS with the prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Stand by.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Ms. Fiorina, the former defense secretary, Bob Gates, says the chances of getting Sunni-Arab forces on the ground to get the job done, his words, \u201cchances very remote.\u201d What\u2019s your strategy?FIORINA: Well, first I\u2019ll just point out that talking tough is not the same as being strong. And to wage war, we need a commander in chief who has made tough calls in tough times and stood up to be held accountable over and over, not first-term senators who\u2019ve never made an executive decision in their life.One of the things I would immediately do, in addition to defeating them here at home, is bring back the warrior class \u2014 Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn. Every single one of these generals I know. Every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn\u2019t want to hear.We must have Sunni-Arabs involved in this coalition. We must commit leadership, strength, support and resolve. I\u2019ll just add that Margaret Thatcher once said, \u201cIf you want something talked about, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.\u201d(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.Governor Christie, what\u2019s your strategy?CHRISTIE: Wolf, you sit up here and you listen to this stuff, and you think that so many of these people have had so much to do in this national debate, they talk like they were bystanders. You know, we talk about our military being degraded over time, and yet we\u2019ve had folks on this stage who\u2019ve been a part of Congress who have participated in sequester; who participated in the degrading of this military over time.And that\u2019s why I think people get so frustrated with Washington, D.C. now. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so angry with the \u2014 the electorate is so angry with everybody who is involved in government in Washington, D.C. Because if you listen to the folks up here, you think that they weren\u2019t even there; they had nothing to do with this.CHRISTIE: This is a difference between being a governor and being in a legislature. See, because when something doesn\u2019t work in New Jersey, they look at me, say: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t it get done? Why didn\u2019t you do it?\u201d You have to be responsible and accountable.And so on ISIS, let\u2019s be clear, the president needs to be a force that is trusted in the world. On this I agree with Marco. You know, this president is not trusted.If you\u2019re the King of Jordan, if you\u2019re a part of the royal family in Saudi Arabia and he\u2019s made this deal with Iran which gives them $150 billion to wage a war and try to extend their empire across the Middle East, why would you want to do it now?But I will tell you this, when I stand across from King Hussein of Jordan and I say to him, \u201cYou have a friend again sir, who will stand with you to fight this fight,\u201d he\u2019ll change his mind.BLITZER: Dr. Carson, what is your strategy?CARSON: First of all, I\u2019ve been talking about this for over a year. We have to destroy their caliphate because that gives them legitimacy to go ahead with the global Jihad. We have to take their energy because they are \u2014 ISIS is the richest terrorist organization there is. We have to take their oil, shut down all of the mechanisms whereby they can disperse money because they go after disaffected individuals from all over the place, and they\u2019re able to pay them. That makes a difference.As far as the command centers are concerned in Raqqa and to a lesser degree Mosul, cut those off. Do the same kind of thing that we did with Sinjar a few weeks ago, working with our embedded special forces with the Kurds, shut off the supply route, soften them up, then we go in with specials ops followed by our air force to take them over. Those are things that work.But also, you know, this whole concept of boots on the ground, you know, we\u2019ve got a phobia about boots on the ground. If our military experts say, we need boots on the ground, we should put boots on the ground and recognize that there will be boots on the ground and they\u2019ll be over here, and they\u2019ll be their boots if we don\u2019t get out of there now.BLITZER: Thank you.Everyone stand by. We\u2019re only just beginning. Coming up, which candidates on this stage tonight want to move foreign policy in a dramatically new direction?We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN-Facebook Republican Presidential Debate here at the Venetian, Las Vegas.The war against ISIS will pose many new challenges for the next commander-in-chief. The last two presidents pursued a Middle East policy that supported toppling dictators to try to promote democracy.Senator Cruz, you have said the world would be safer today if Saddam Hussein were still in power in Iraq, Moammar Gadhafi ruled Libya, and Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt. So would it be your policy to preserve dictatorships, rather than promoting democracy in the Middle East?CRUZ: Wolf, I believe in a America first foreign policy, that far too often President Obama and Hillary Clinton \u2014 and, unfortunately, more than a few Republicans \u2014 have gotten distracted from the central focus of keeping this country safe.So let\u2019s go back to the beginning of the Obama administration, when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama led NATO in toppling the government in Libya. They did it because they wanted to promote democracy. A number of Republicans supported them. The result of that \u2014 and we were told then that there were these moderate rebels that would take over. Well, the result is, Libya is now a terrorist war zone run by jihadists.Move over to Egypt. Once again, the Obama administration, encouraged by Republicans, toppled Mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the United States, of Israel, and in its place, Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came in, a terrorist organization.And we need to learn from history. These same leaders \u2014 Obama, Clinton, and far too many Republicans \u2014 want to topple Assad. Assad is a bad man. Gadhafi was a bad man. Mubarak had a terrible human rights record. But they were assisting us \u2014 at least Gadhafi and Mubarak \u2014 in fighting radical Islamic terrorists.And if we topple Assad, the result will be ISIS will take over Syria, and it will worsen U.S. national security interests. And the approach, instead of being a Woodrow Wilson democracy promoter...BLITZER: Thank you.CRUZ: ... we ought to hunt down our enemies and kill ISIS rather than creating opportunities for ISIS to take control of new countries.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.(APPLAUSE)Senator Rubio, you supported the removal of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya. Now that country is in turmoil, as ISIS is clearly growing there. Senator Cruz says you haven\u2019t learned your lesson. Do you have any regrets for supporting President Obama\u2019s intervention in Libya?RUBIO: To begin with, Moammar Gadhafi and the revolt against Gadhafi was not started by the United States. It was started by the Libyan people. And the reason why I argued we needed to get involved is because he was going to go one way or the other. And my argument then was proven true, and that is, the longer that civil war took, the more militias would be formed and the more unstable the country would be after the fact.As far as Moammar Gadhafi is concerned, by the way, Moammar Gadhafi is the man that killed those Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland. Moammar Gadhafi is also the man that bombed that cafe in Berlin and killed those Marines. And you want to know why Moammar Gadhafi started cooperating on his nuclear program? Because we got rid of Saddam Hussein. And so he got scared that he would be next, and that\u2019s why he started cooperating.Look, we will have to work around the world with less than ideal governments. The government in Saudi Arabia is not a democracy, but we will have to work with them. The government in Jordan is not perfect, but we will have to work with them. But anti-American dictators like Assad, who help Hezbollah, who helped get those IEDs into Iraq, if they go, I will not shed a tear.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Well, it\u2019s more than not shedding a tear. It\u2019s actively getting involved to topple a government. And we keep hearing from President Obama and Hillary Clinton and Washington Republicans that they\u2019re searching for these mythical moderate rebels. It\u2019s like a purple unicorn. They never exist. These moderate rebels end up being jihadists.And I\u2019ll tell you whose view on Assad is the same as mine. It\u2019s Prime Minister Netanyahu. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said Israel doesn\u2019t have a dog in that fight because Assad is a puppet of Iran, a Shia radical Islamic terrorist, but at the same time, Prime Minister Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want to see Syria governed by ISIS. And we need to focus on American interests, not on global aspirations...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Standby. Everybody standby for a moment. Governor Kasich, go ahead.KASICH: I don\u2019t understand this thing about Assad. He has to go. Assad is aligned with Iran and Russia. The one thing we want to prevent is we want to prevent Iran being able to extend a Shia crescent all across the Middle East. Assad has got to go.KASICH: And there are moderates there. There are moderates in Syria who we should be supporting. I do not support a civil war. I don\u2019t want to be policeman of the world. But we can\u2019t back off of this. And let me tell you, at the end, the Saudis have agreed to put together a coalition inside of Syria to stabilize that country.BLITZER: Thank you.KASICH: He must go. It will be a blow to Iran and Russia.BLITZER: We\u2019re going to talk about Assad in a moment.Mr. Trump, are Americans safer with dictators running the world in the Middle East?TRUMP: In my opinion, we\u2019ve spent $4 trillion trying to topple various people that frankly, if they were there and if we could\u2019ve spent that $4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our airports and all of the other problems we\u2019ve had, we would\u2019ve been a lot better off. I can tell you that right now.We have done a tremendous disservice, not only to Middle East, we\u2019ve done a tremendous disservice to humanity. The people that have been killed, the people that have wiped away, and for what? It\u2019s not like we had victory.It\u2019s a mess. The Middle East is totally destabilized. A total and complete mess. I wish we had the $4 trillion or $5 trillion. I wish it were spent right here in the United States, on our schools, hospitals, roads, airports, and everything else that are all falling apart.(APPLAUSE)FIORINA: That is exactly what President Obama said. I\u2019m amazed to hear that from a republican presidential candidate. But let\u2019s just start with, who got it wrong? Who really got it wrong?Hillary Clinton has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong. Hitting the reset button with Vladimir Putin - recall that she called Bashar Al-Assad a positive reformer and then she opened an embassy and then later she said, over, and over, and over again, \u201cBashar Al-Assad must go.\u201d Although she wasn\u2019t prepared to do anything about it. Recall that Hillary Clinton was all for toppling Gadhafi then didn\u2019t listen to her own people on the ground. And then of course, when she lied about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, she invited more terrorist attacks.BLITZER: Thank you.Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, there\u2019s nothing to respond to. Well, people feel differently. I mean, the fact is Benghazi was a disaster because of Libya, everything just fell into place. It could not have been worse.What do we have now? We have nothing. We\u2019ve spent $3 trillion and probably much more - I have no idea what we\u2019ve spent. Thousands and thousands of lives, we have nothing. Wounded warriors all over the place who I love, we have nothing for it.And by the way - and Ben said incorrectly - and I\u2019m not saying this as a knock - he\u2019s one of finest men. You\u2019re not going to find a finer men.But I\u2019ve been talking about oil for three years. I\u2019ve been saying,, \u201ctake the oil, take the oil.\u201d I didn\u2019t say, \u201cjust bomb it,\u201d I said,\u201d take it and use it and distribute it so that the wounded warriors -\u201d People, I\u2019ve been saying this now for many years.BLITZER: All right.TRUMP: Now, all of a sudden everybody\u2019s saying, \u201ctake the oil.\u201d It wasn\u2019t so fashionable to take the oil six months ago. I\u2019ve been saying it for years.BLITZER: Thank you.FIORINA: We\u2019ve mismanaged going into Iraq.BLITZER: Dr. Carson, is the Middle East...FIORINA: We\u2019ve mismanaged going out of Iraq.BLITZER: Dr. Carson, is the Middle East better off with dictators?CARSON: No one is ever better off with dictators but there comes a time you know, when you\u2019re on an airplane, they always say, \u201cin case of an emergency oxygen masks will drop down. Put yours on first and then administer help to your neighbor.\u201d We need oxygen right now.And we need to start thinking about the needs of the American people before we go and solve everybody else\u2019s problems. The fact of the matter is, is that the Middle East has been in turmoil for thousands of years. For us to think that we\u2019re going to in there and fix that with a couple of little bombs and a few little decorations is relatively foolish.FIORINA: We actually...BLITZER: Governor Bush.BUSH: I think we\u2019re focusing a whole...BLITZER: Hold on Governor Bush., here\u2019s the question. You said, \u201cgetting rid of Saddam Hussein in your words was a pretty good deal.\u201d In light of what has happened in Iraq, do you still feel that way?BUSH: I do. I think the lesson\u2019s learned are that we have to have to have a strategy to get and a strategy to get out. Which means, that you create a stable situation.This president and this is what the focus ought to be, it\u2019s not the differences between us, it\u2019s Barack Obama does not believe America\u2019s leadership in the world is a force for good. He does not believe that our strength is a place where security can take place. He leads from behind. He creates an environment that now we\u2019re creating the most unstable situation we\u2019ve had since the World War II era.The focus ought to be on the single fact that Hillary Clinton wants to double down on a failed foreign policy and we need to be united to defeat that because we\u2019re going to be in a place that is far less secure than it is today. Don\u2019t you all agree?BLITZER: Senator Paul, was getting rid of Saddam Hussein a pretty good deal?PAUL: These are the fundamental questions of our time, these foreign policy questions, whether or not regime change is a good idea or a bad idea. I don\u2019t think because I think the regime change was a bad idea it means that Hussein was necessarily a good idea.There is often variations of evil on both sides of the war. What we have to decide is whether or not regime change is a good idea. It\u2019s what the neoconservatives have wanted. It\u2019s what the vast majority of those on the stage want.They still want regime change. They want it in Syria. They wanted it in Iraq. They want it in Libya. It has not worked.Out of regime change you get chaos. From the chaos you have seen repeatedly the rise of radical Islam. So we get this profession of, oh, my goodness, they want to do something about terrorism and yet they\u2019re the problem because they allow terrorism to arise out of that chaos.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hugh Hewitt, go ahead.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hugh.CRUZ: The question of whether we should toppling dictatorships is asking the wrong question. We should be defeating our enemies. So the problem with defeating...BLITZER: Senator, Senator, we\u2019re going to get to you. Wait your turn. We have two hours of debate. We\u2019ll have plenty of time. Let Hugh ask his question.CRUZ: Well, but let me explain, the focus should be...BLITZER: Senator, please.CRUZ: ... on defeating our enemies. So, for example...BLITZER: Senator... CRUZ: ... a regime we should change is Iran...BLITZER: You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunity.Hugh, go ahead.CRUZ: ... because Iran has declared war on us. But we shouldn\u2019t be toppling regimes...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... that are fighting radical Islamic terrorists that are helping...BLITZER: These are the rules all of you agreed to.Hugh, go ahead with your question.HEWITT: Mr. Trump, we are talking about the most important thing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s heated. And it\u2019s, you are OK with Mr. Assad staying in power, but you are also in favor of winning.If he stays in power, Iran is winning, Hezbollah is winning. Iran is winning in Yemen. They are winning everywhere. If they are winning how can we be winning?TRUMP: I think Assad is a bad guy, a very bad guy, all right? Lots of people killed. I think we are backing people we have no idea who they are. The rebels, we call them the rebels, the patriotic rebels. We have no idea. A lot of people think, Hugh, that they are ISIS.We have to do one thing at a time. We can\u2019t be fighting ISIS and fighting Assad. Assad is fighting ISIS. He is fighting ISIS. Russia is fighting now ISIS. And Iran is fighting ISIS.We have to do one thing at a time. We can\u2019t go \u2014 and I watched Lindsey Graham, he said, I have been here for 10 years fighting. Well, he will be there with that thinking for another 50 years. He won\u2019t be able to solve the problem.We have to get rid of ISIS first. After we get rid of ISIS, we\u2019ll start thinking about it. But we can\u2019t be fighting Assad. And when you\u2019re fighting Assad, you are fighting Russia, you\u2019re fighting \u2014 you\u2019re fighting a lot of different groups.But we can\u2019t be fighting everybody at one time.HEWITT: Governor Christie, is he right? Because if we step back, Iran goes nuclear. Is Donald Trump right?CHRISTIE: Well, I think we have to focus, Hugh, on exactly what the priorities are. And to me, what I\u2019ve always said is that the president has set up an awful situation through his deal with Iran, because what his deal with Iran has done is empower them and enrich them. And that\u2019s the way ISIS has been created and formed here. ISIS is created and formed because of the abuse that Assad and his Iranian sponsors have rained down on the Sunnis in Syria.And so when we empower Iran, this is why this president \u2014 and when Hillary Clinton says her theory against ISIS will be just about the same as the president, then get ready for more unrest and more murder and more violence in the Middle East.We need to focus our attention on Iran, because if you miss Iran, you are not going to get ISIS. The two are inextricably connected because one causes the other.HEWITT: Senator Paul, let me ask you, you heard Governor Kasich say Assad must go. Do you agree?PAUL: No, I think it\u2019s a huge mistake. I think regime change in Syria, and this is what \u2014 I\u2019ve been saying this for several years now. In 2013 when we first went in, I said, you are going to give arms to the allies of al Qaida, to radical jihadists? That\u2019s crazy.But the other thing I said is the great irony is you will be back fighting against your own weapons. Had Assad been bombed when he used chemical weapons two years ago, ISIS would be in charge of all of Syria now.We have to have a more realistic foreign policy and not a utopian one where we say, oh, we\u2019re going to spread freedom and democracy, and everybody in the Middle East is going to love us. They are not going to love us.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)KASICH: The foreign policy, you have to know how to pick and choose. There\u2019s no way, if Saddam had not had weapons of mass destruction, I would have gone, because I don\u2019t believe that the U.S. should be involved directly in civil wars.I opposed the U.S. involvement in Lebanon. We ended up having to withdraw our marines after our barracks were blown up.There is a difference between Iraq, where you have Sunni, Shia, and Kurds put together after the First World War by the Western powers. It doesn\u2019t work. It needs to break up into three parts.KASICH: And for the Russians, frankly, it\u2019s time that we punched the Russians in the nose. They\u2019ve gotten away with too much in this world and we need to stand up against them, not just there, but also in Eastern Europe where they threaten some of our most precious allies.BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue with Russia right now. We have another question from Facebook. Listen and watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: My name is Ashley Tofil. Ms. Fiorina, in November, you said that you would not talk to Vladimir Putin after you were elected because you would be communicating from a position of weakness. Do you believe that it is feasible to not communicate with another world leader? And do you think that that also is a sign of weakness?(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: Ms. Fiorina, as you know, U.S. and Russian warplanes are flying all over Syria right now. With so many lives on the line, is this a good time for the United States not to talk to Putin?FIORINA: I didn\u2019t say I would cut off all communication with Putin. What I said was as president of the United States, now is not the time to talk with him. Reagan walked away at Reykjavik. There is a time and a place for everything. There is a time and a place for talk. And there is a time and a place for action.I know Vladimir Putin. He respects strength. He lied to our president\u2019s face; didn\u2019t both to tell him about warplanes and troops going into Syria. We need to speak to him from a position of strength. So as commander in chief, I will not speak to him until we\u2019ve set up that no-fly zone; until we\u2019ve gathered our Sunni-Arab allies and begun to deny ISIS territory; until I\u2019ve called the supreme leader of Iran and told him new deal \u2014 new deal. We the United States of America are going to cut off the money flow, which we can do; which we don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission or collaboration to do.And I will not speak to him personally until we\u2019ve rebuilt the 6th Fleet a little bit right under his nose; rebuilt the missile defense program in Poland right under his nose; and conducted a few military exercises in the Baltic states.And let us remember one other thing. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are responsible for the growth of ISIS because they precipitously withdrew from Iraq in 2011 against the advice of every single general and for political expediency. It\u2019s not these people up here. It\u2019s Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.Governor Christie, if the U.S. imposed a no-fly zone over Syria and a Russian plane encroached, invaded that no-fly zone, would you be prepared to shoot down that Russian plane and risk war with Russia?CHRISTIE: Not only would I be prepared to do it, I would do it. A no-fly zone means a no-fly zone, Wolf. That\u2019s what it means.(APPLAUSE)See, maybe \u2014 maybe because I\u2019m from New Jersey, I just have this kind of plain language hangup. But I would make very clear \u2014 I would not talk to Vladimir Putin. In fact, I would talk to Vladimir Putin a lot. But I\u2019d say to him, \u201cListen, Mr. President, there\u2019s a no-fly zone in Syria; you fly in, it applies to you.\u201d And yes, we would shoot down the planes of Russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the Oval Office is right now.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Paul \u2014 Senator Paul, I want you to respond to what we just heard from Governor Christie. If there was a no-fly zone, you say that potentially could lead to World War III. Why?PAUL: Well, I think if you\u2019re in favor of World War III, you have your candidate. You know, here\u2019s...(APPLAUSE)... the thing. My goodness, what we want in a leader is someone with judgment, not someone who is so reckless as to stand on the stage and say, \u201cYes, I\u2019m jumping up and down; I\u2019m going to shoot down Russian planes.\u201d Russia already flies in that airspace. It may not be something we\u2019re in love with the fact that they\u2019re there, but they were invited by Iraq and by Syria to fly in that airspace.And so if we announce we\u2019re going to have a no-fly zone, and others have said this. Hillary Clinton is also for it. It is a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s a recipe for World War III. We need to confront Russia from a position of strength, but we don\u2019t need to confront Russia from a point of recklessness that would lead to war.This is something \u2014 this type of judgment, you know, it\u2019s having that kind of judgment; who you would appoint and how you\u2019re going to conduct affairs, that is incredibly important.I mean, I think when we think about the judgment of someone who might want World War III, we might think about someone who might shut down a bridge because they don\u2019t like their friends; they don\u2019t want to \u2014 you know, they want to (inaudible) a Democrat.So I think we need to be very careful.BLITZER: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: Well, Wolf, I\u2019ll tell you what reckless is. What reckless is is calling Assad a reformer. What reckless is allowing Russia to come into Crimea and Ukraine. What reckless is is inviting Russia into Syria to team with Iran. That is reckless. And the reckless people are the folks in the White House right now. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the reckless people.CHRISTIE: And if you think that a no-fly zone is a reckless policy, you\u2019re welcome to your opinion. But how is it working so far? As we have 250,000 Syrians murdered, slaughtered; millions running around the world, running for their lives. It\u2019s not working. We need to try something else. And that is not reckless.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All right, let\u2019s go back \u2014 Hugh and Dana?HEWITT: Governor Bush, a commander-in-chief question. You\u2019ve said that Mr. Trump is not qualified to be president because he\u2019s not qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin. Why are you better qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin than Mr. Trump?BUSH: Because I \u2014 first of all, I know what I don\u2019t know. I know what I don\u2019t know. I would seek out, as I have, the best advice that exists. I won\u2019t get my information from the shows. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s Saturday morning or Sunday morning. I don\u2019t know which one.(LAUGHTER)I will seek out the best advice, and I will create a strategy and I will persuade the American people what the role of America should be. I\u2019ve laid out a policy of rebuilding our military.All of the talk that we\u2019re seeing here \u2014 most of which I agree on, frankly \u2014 requires a much stronger military. We now have a lack of readiness that is quite scary. We have planes that were \u2014 that Harry Truman inaugurated, the B-52. We have \u2014 the Navy has been gutted and decimated. The readiness of the Marines is way down.If we\u2019re serious about America\u2019s leadership in the world, then we need to make sure that we have the back of the armed forces. The Armed Forces Radio is here listening to this today. I hope they know that if I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll be a commander-in-chief, not an agitator- in-chief or a divider-in-chief, that I will lead this country in a way that will create greater security and greater safety.HEWITT: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I think it\u2019s very sad that CNN leads Jeb Bush, Governor Bush, down a road by starting off virtually all the questions, \u201cMr. Trump this, Mister\u201d \u2014 I think it\u2019s very sad. And, frankly, I watched \u2014 I think it\u2019s very sad. And, frankly, I watched the first debate, and the first long number of questions were, \u201cMr. Trump said this, Mr. Trump said that. Mr. Trump\u201d \u2014 these poor guys \u2014 although, I must tell you, Santorum, good guy. Governor Huckabee, good guy. They were very nice, and I respect them greatly. But I thought it was very unfair that virtually the entire early portion of the debate was Trump this, Trump that, in order to get ratings, I guess. In order to get ratings, I guess.HEWITT: But, Mr. Trump, it\u2019s not CNN \u2014 I was on CNN last night...TRUMP: I just think it\u2019s very \u2014 excuse me.HEWITT: ... watching...TRUMP: Excuse me. I think it\u2019s very unprofessional.HEWITT: But it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t CNN. It was me. I watched you last night for 16 minutes. It\u2019s not CNN.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, I think it\u2019s very unprofessional.HEWITT: It\u2019s not CNN. It\u2019s America\u2019s watching you.TRUMP: OK, fine.HEWITT: It\u2019s America\u2019s watching.(CROSSTALK)BUSH: So I was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was mentioned, so I can bring up something, I think, right? Look, the simple fact is, if you think this is tough you\u2019re not being treated fairly...TRUMP: This isn\u2019t tough and easy. I wish it...BUSH: ... imagine what it\u2019s going to be like dealing with Putin or dealing with President Xi.TRUMP: I wish it was always this easy as you, Jeb.BUSH: Or dealing with the Islamic terrorism that exists.TRUMP: Oh, yeah.BUSH: This is a tough business to run for president.TRUMP: Oh, I know. You\u2019re a tough guy, Jeb. I know.BUSH: And it\u2019s \u2014 and we need...(LAUGHTER)... to have a leader that is...(CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You\u2019re tough.BUSH: You\u2019re never going to be president of the United States by insulting your way to the presidency.TRUMP: Well, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m at 42, and you\u2019re at 3. So, so far, I\u2019m doing better.BUSH: Doesn\u2019t matter. Doesn\u2019t matter.TRUMP: So far, I\u2019m doing better. You know, you started off over here, Jeb. You\u2019re moving over further and further. Pretty soon you\u2019re going to be off the end...(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: This doesn\u2019t do a thing to solve the problems.(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: It doesn\u2019t do a thing to solve the problems.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: One at a time. Hugh, go ahead.KASICH: It sounds more and more what my daughter said that I said in the beginning, all the fighting and arguing is not advancing us.FIORINA: It will not solve the problem.KASICH: It is not the way we\u2019re going to strengthen our country. We will strengthen our country when we come together.(APPLAUSE)And, look, you\u2019ve got Rand Paul, you\u2019ve got Ted Cruz, you\u2019ve got Marco, you\u2019ve got a lot of people on this stage that have studied these issues. You know what a leader does? A leader has a sound program, has a good policy, and then brings people together to solve problems.(APPLAUSE)Guess what? Both in Congress in balancing the budget and in Ohio fixing the economy \u2014 and, by the way, we talk about the fence. The first thing we better get going is strengthening our economy, because if we don\u2019t have a strong economy, we can\u2019t pay for all of this. And the world wants us to be able to function from strength, believe it or not. Get our economy going, get these people together in a room. We can fix this, ladies and gentlemen.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: We don\u2019t have to fight all the time. It can be done, and we will be great...HEWITT: Governor \u2014 thank you, Governor.KASICH: ... when we join together. Thank you, Hugh.HEWITT: Dr. Carson, commander-in-chief question again. You\u2019ve been the head of neurosurgery for a big hospital. You\u2019re on a lot of boards of a lot of companies. You\u2019ve traveled the world. You\u2019re going traveling again next week. But does that prepare you to command troops from Djibouti to Japan, troops from Afghanistan to Iraq to be in charge of the men and women watching on Armed Services Network tonight?CARSON: Well, you know, there\u2019s a false narrative that only the political class has the wisdom and the ability to be commander-in- chief. But if you go back and you study the design of our country, it was really designed for the citizen statesman.And we need to be talking about where does your experience come from? You know, and I\u2019ve had a lot of experience building things, organizing things, you know, a national scholarship program.One of the things that you\u2019ll notice if you look through my life is that I don\u2019t do a lot of talking. I do a lot of doing. And really, it says more about a person than how much they talk. And then some people say you\u2019re weak because, you know, you\u2019re not loud and you\u2019re not boisterous and you\u2019re not rude. But the fact of the matter is, look and see what I\u2019ve done. And that speaks volumes about strength.BASH: Thank you, Dr. Carson. We\u2019ve been talking tonight about programs and policy proposals that you all have to keep Americans safe and it\u2019s a big discussion on the campaign trail. Also about border security and immigration. So let\u2019s talk about immigration.Senator Rubio. You co-authored a bill with Democrats two years ago that allowed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Do you still support that path to citizenship, which means giving those immigrants rights, like the right to vote?RUBIO: Yeah. Immigration is not an issue that I read about in the newspaper or watch a documentary on PBS or CNN. It\u2019s an issues I\u2019ve lived around my whole life. My family are immigrants. My wife\u2019s family are immigrants. All of my neighbors are immigrants.I see every aspect of this problem. The good, the bad, and the ugly. And here\u2019s what we learned in 2013. The American people don\u2019t trust the Federal Government to enforce our immigration laws, and we will not be able to do anything on immigration until we first prove to the American people that illegal immigration is under control. And we can do that. We know what it takes to do that.It takes at least 20,000 more additional border agents. It takes completing those 700 miles of fencing. It takes a mandatory e-verify system and a mandatory entry/exit tracking system to prevent overstays. After we have done that, the second thing we have to do is reform and modernize the legal immigration system. And after we have done those two things, I think the American people are gonna be reasonable with what do you do with someone who has been in this country for 10 or 12 years who hasn\u2019t otherwise violated our laws \u2014 because if they\u2019re a criminal they can\u2019t stay. They\u2019ll have to undergo a background check, pay a fine, start paying taxes. And ultimately, they\u2019ll given a work permit and that\u2019s all they\u2019re gonna be allowed to have for at least 10 years. But you can\u2019t get to that third step until you have done the other two things, and that was the lesson we learned in 2013. There is no trust that the Federal Government will enforce the law. They will not support you until you see it done first.BASH: Senator, you haven\u2019t answered the question. You described a very long path but does that path end at citizenship?RUBIO: But I\u2019ve answered that question repeatedly. I am personally open \u2014 after all that has happened and after ten years in that probationary status where all they have is a permit, I personally am open to allowing people to apply for a green card.That may not be a majority position in my party, but that\u2019s down the road. You can\u2019t even begin that process until you prove to people \u2014 not just pass a law that says you\u2019re gonna bring illegal immigration under control. You\u2019re gonna have to do it and prove to people that it\u2019s working.And that was the lesson of 2013. And it\u2019s more true today, than it was then. After a migratory crisis on the border with minors coming over that you\u2019re seeing start up again now, after all these executive orders the President has issued. More than ever we need to...BASH: Thank you, senator.RUBIO: ... prove to people that illegal immigration is under control.BASH: Thank you, senator. Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail, Senator Rubio has said that his immigration plan is not that different from yours. Is that true?CRUZ: Well, he \u2014 he has attempted to muddy the waters, but I think that anyone who watched the battle that we had. You know, there was a time for choosing as Reagan put it. Where there was a battle over amnesty and some chose, like Senator Rubio to stand with Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and support a massive amnesty plan.Others chose to stand with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and secure the border.And let me mention, this issue is actually directly connected to what we\u2019ve been talking about. Because the front line with ISIS isn\u2019t just in Iraq and Syria, it\u2019s in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande. Border security is national security. And, you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees without mandating any background checks whatsoever. Now we\u2019ve seen what happened in San Bernardino. When you are letting people in, when the FBI can\u2019t vet them, it puts American citizens at risk. And I tell you, if I\u2019m elected president, we will secure the border. We will triple the border patrol. We will build a wall that works and I\u2019ll get Donald Trump to pay for it.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Rubio, please.RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. In 2013 we had never faced a crisis like the Syrian refugee crisis now. Up until that point, a refugee meant someone fleeing oppression, fleeing Communism like it is in my community.As far as Ted\u2019s record, I\u2019m always puzzled by his attack on this issue. Ted, you support legalizing people who are in this country illegally. Ted Cruz supported a 500-percent increase in the number of H-1 visas, the guest workers that are allowed into this country, and Ted supports doubling the number of green cards.So I think what\u2019s important for us to understand and there is a way forward on this issue that we an bring our country together on. And while I\u2019m president I will do it. And it will begin by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving to the American people.BASH: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Look, I understand Marco wants to raise confusion, it is not accurate what he just said that I supported legalization. Indeed, I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty. And you know, there was one commentator that put it this way that, for Marco to suggest our record\u2019s the same is like suggesting \u201cthe fireman and the arsonist because they are both at the scene of the fire.\u201dHe was fighting to grant amnesty and not to secure the border, I was fighting to secure the border. And this also goes to trust, listening on to campaign trails. Candidates all the time make promises. You know, Marco said,\u201d he learned that the American people didn\u2019t trust the federal government.\u201dBASH: Senator Cruz?RUBIO: No, no, give him time.CRUZ: In Florida promising to...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Ted, do you...CRUZ: go in the fight against amnesty...RUBIO: Did Ted Cruz fight to support legalizing people that are in this country illegally?CRUZ: He campaigned promising to lead the fight against amnesty.FIORINA: Ladies and gentleman, this is why the American people are standing up.BASH: Senator Cruz, can you answer that question please?RUBIO: Does Ted Cruz rule out ever legalizing people that are in this country now?BASH: Senator Cruz?CRUZ; I have never supported a legalization...RUBIO: Would you rule it out?CRUZ : I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization. Let me tell you how you do this, what you do is you enforce the law...(CROSSTALK)FIORINA: This is why the nation is fed up...BASH: One at a time please.CRUZ: Watt you do is enforcement the law...FIORINA: We have been talking about this...BASH: Ms. Fiorina, please wait your turn, we\u2019re going to get to you.FIORINA: Sorry, but you haven\u2019t gotten to me. This is why...CRUZ: What you do...BASH: Senator Cruz go ahead.FIORINA: the people are fed up with the political class.That means you stop the Obama administration\u2019s policy of releasing criminal illegal aliens. Do you know how many aliens Bill Clinton deported? 12 million. Do you know how many illegal aliens, George W. Bush deported? 10 million.We can enforce the laws and if we secure the border, that solves the problem. And as president I will solve this problem and secure the border.BASH: Mr. Trump, you like to say that you restarted this conversation in the campaign. TRUMP: I believe I did.See what the candidates are saying about gun control, immigration and more, and how their positions align with the American people.BASH: So who do you side with? Who do you side with in this, Senator Rubio or Senator Cruz?TRUMP: I have a very hardline position, we have a country or we don\u2019t have a country. People that have come into our country illegally, they have to go. They have to come back into through a legal process.I want a strong border. I do want a wall. Walls do work, you just have to speak to the folks in Israel. Walls work if they\u2019re properly constructed. I know how to build, believe me, I know how to build.I feel a very, very strong bind, and really I\u2019m bound to this country, we either have a border or we don\u2019t. People can come into the country, we welcome people to come but they have to come in legally.BASH: Thank you.Governor Bush?BUSH: Yes.BASH: Listening to this, do you think this is the tone \u2014 this immigration debate that republicans need to take to win back Hispanics into our party especially states like where we are in Nevada that has a pretty Hispanic community?BUSH: No it isn\u2019t but it is an important subject to talk about for sure. And I think people have good ideas on this. Clearly, we need to secure the border. Coming here legally needs to be a lot easier than coming here illegally.If you don\u2019t have that, you don\u2019t have the rule of law. We now have a national security consideration, public health issues, we have an epidemic of heroine overdoses in all places in this country because of the ease of bringing heroine in. We have to secure the border.It is a serious undertaking and yes, we do need more fencing and we do need to use technology, and we do need more border control. And we need to have better cooperation by the way with local law enforcement. There are 800,000 cops on the beat, they ought to be trained to be the eyes and ears for law enforcement for the threat against terror as well as for immigration.This is a serious challenge and if we can get it right, yes, we\u2019ll start winning votes again. The real problem isn\u2019t anybody on this stage, the real problem is Barack Obama has had six years to advocate a position to fix this and he\u2019s done nothing. The congress has funded these programs of building more fencing and doing all this and he hasn\u2019t done it.He wants to maintain it as a wedge issue and so does Hillary Clinton. Republicans need to fix it and when we do, we\u2019ll be better off.BLITZER: Governor, thank you very much.BLITZER: So, Dr. Carson, you recently visited a refugee camp in Jordan and you deemed it your words, \u201creally quite nice.\u201d Saying the people there didn\u2019t want to come to the United States. Do you think these camps are a long-term solution of the problem of Syrian refugees?CARSON: Well, it was very interesting having an opportunity to talk to the Syrians themselves. And I asked them: What do you want? What is your supreme desire? Their supreme desire was to be settled back in their own country. I said, \u201cWhat can Americans and other countries do?\u201d They said, \u201cSupport the efforts of those who are trying to provide safety for us, including the Jordanians.\u201dOf course, they had a brand new hospital, for instance, that was unstaffed because there wasn\u2019t enough money to do it. But here\u2019s what\u2019s really neat. If you go into Hasakah province in northeast Syria, that\u2019s an area that\u2019s as big as Lebanon. It\u2019s controlled by the Kurds, the Christians and the moderate Sunnis. And there are airstrips and hotels. You could settle a lot of people there.All we would have to do is be willing to provide them with some weaponry, some defensive weaponry. And we seem to be afraid to give the Kurds weaponry. We like to send it for some strange reason through Baghdad, and then they only get a tenth of it.And if we would support them, we\u2019d have a perfect ideal there. We don\u2019t need to set this up as we either take a bunch of refugees who will be infiltrated with terrorists, I guarantee you. For them not to be would be terrorist malpractice. And we need to \u2014 to choose the right choice, not these false choices.BLITZER: Senator Paul, you oppose letting in Syrian refugees at this time into the United States. The U.S. has already accepted 2,000 Syrian refugees, including 13 living here in Las Vegas right now. Would you send them back? What would you do with these people?PAUL: You know, I think we need to set the record straight on this, because I think Marco misspoke about the bill. On the Gang of Eight bill, there was no provisions really for extra scrutiny or safety for refugees. At the time the bill came up, two Iraqi refugees came to my home town, Bowling Green, Kentucky. Their fingerprints were on a bomb from Iraq. They were in the database, but we didn\u2019t pick them up.We relocated them here, put them in government housing, got them on food stamps. And we began providing for them, but we didn\u2019t have adequate security. On the Gang of Eight bill, on Marco\u2019s bill, we had an opportunity. There was a conservative consensus for an amendment I put forward called Trust, But Verify that would have strengthened border security on both refugees, students and those coming here. And Marco sided and I guess was more sympathetic to Chuck Schumer and to the president than he was to conservative principles.But this goes directly to national defense. And if he wants to run as a national \u2014 national defense conservative, he\u2019s got to explain why he hasn\u2019t stepped up to support border security.BLITZER: Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Well, he\u2019s just admitted \u2014 as he\u2019s just admitted, the reason why those refugees were allowed in was because they messed up in how they used the actual database. They should have know. They didn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t run the actual law as it exists now. It didn\u2019t work well.As far as the refugees are concerned, it\u2019s not that America doesn\u2019t want to accept refugees, Wolf. It\u2019s that we may not be able to, because this is an issue we have to be 100 percent right on. If we allow 9,999 Syrian refugees into the United States, and all of them are good people, but we allow one person in who\u2019s an ISIS killer \u2014 we just get one person wrong, we\u2019ve got a serious problem.And there is not a single person in the national defense apparatus of this country that can guarantee you are going to be 100 percent right. And that\u2019s why as president, I\u2019ll take this very seriously.BLITZER: Senator Paul, you didn\u2019t answer the question about the 2,000 Syrian refugees who are already here in the United States. Will you send them back or let them stay?PAUL: What my bill would do would be only for refugees going forward. So I haven\u2019t taken a position on sending anyone home. But I have taken the position that we have a lot of problems here in our country. And that one of the things that we do \u2014 charity is about giving your own money. Charity isn\u2019t giving someone else\u2019s money. To put everyone in government housing and food stamps and bring them in from around the world I think is a mistake. To give of your own money, I\u2019ve given to my church. My church has helped people that came from Bosnia. That\u2019s a good thing.But we shouldn\u2019t have a program where we just say that we\u2019re going to take care of the world\u2019s refugees. Nobody in the Middle East is doing anything. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait \u2014 all the Gulf nations are doing nothing. They need to step up and take...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: We have another \u2014 we have another question. We have another question from Facebook. Let\u2019s listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)QUESTION: My name is Carla Hernandez. I\u2019m from the University of Texas at Austin. And my question is directed to all the candidates.If the Bible clearly states that we need to embrace those in need and not fear, how can we justify not accepting refugees?(END VIDEO CLIP)BLITZER: Governor Christie, you say there should be a pause in allowing new refugees to come into the United States, including orphans under the age of five. What do you say to Carla?CHRISTIE: What I say to Carla is that the first job of the president of the United States is to protect your safety and your security and the security and safety of your family. And this debate stops with me in the discussions with the FBI director.CHRISTIE: Now, listen, I\u2019m a former federal prosecutor, I know Jim Comey. We\u2019ve worked together. He was the U.S. attorney in Manhattan when I was a U.S. attorney in New Jersey.And when Jim Comey gets up before Congress and says, we cannot effectively vet these people, for me as president, that\u2019s the end of the conversation. We have to put America\u2019s security first.(APPLAUSE)The American people \u2014 we on this stage need to open our ears. We need to open our ears. The American people are not whispering to us. They are screaming to us. And they\u2019re screaming to us that it\u2019s our job to actually make this government work.It\u2019s so dysfunctional under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s so ineffective. It\u2019s so ineffectual that the American people say, we don\u2019t trust them to do anything anymore. So I\u2019m not going to let Syrian refugees, any Syrian refugees in this country.And it was widows and orphans, by the way, and we now know from watching the San Bernardino attack that women can commit heinous, heinous acts against humanity just the same as men can do it.And so I don\u2019t back away from that position for a minute. When the FBI director tells me that he can vet those people, then we\u2019ll consider it and not a moment before because your safety and security is what\u2019s most important to me.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich.KASICH: You know, obviously, as president of the United States, we\u2019ve got to keep the people safe. That\u2019s first and foremost.But as governor of Ohio, I have an obligation to keep the 11.5 million people in Ohio safe. And we have been very effective with our Joint Terrorism Task Force, being able to make busts.In fact, we just made one three-four weeks ago against a person who was favorable to ISIS living in Akron.But let me tell you what is interesting about the administration. We had Central American miners that were placed in Ohio, and we never knew a thing about it. We didn\u2019t know where they were. And, in fact, we know now that some of them, there is a case going on where some of them may have been human-trafficked.So when the administration tells me we have a great vetting process, the proof is in the pudding. They sent these miners to us. Our schools were disrupted. We didn\u2019t know where they were. And bad things happened to them. And now they tell me that we ought to be able to admit these Syrian refugees.So, Wolf, look, people have accused me at times of having too big of a heart. You know, that\u2019s OK. But I have to also to say I must keep the people of my state safe. So we take a pause.BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.There is much more coming up. We are only just beginning. Coming up, what other global hot spots await the next president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN-Facebook Republican Presidential Debate. We\u2019re here at the Venetian Las Vegas. Tonight we have been focusing on the Middle East, but let\u2019s turn to some other world threats that you will potentially face as Commander in Chief.Ms. Fiorina, candidates here have called the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un a maniac who is mentally unstable. Last week he said he now has a hydrogen bomb. If you were elected president, what would you do about Kim Jong-Un?FIORINA: Well, first, Kim Jong-Un is a dangerous leader, without a doubt. And both Republican and Democrat administrations have been completely ineffective in dealing with him. So we must continue to isolate him. We will need China as part of that strategy.China is a rising adversary. So one of the things we have to do if we want China\u2019s support is to push back on China. They, too, recognize one thing \u2014 strength and their own economic interest.I have done business in China for 25 years, so I know that in order to get China to cooperate with us, we must first actually retaliate against their cyber-attacks so they know we\u2019re serious. We have to push back on their desire to control the trade route through the South China Sea through which flows $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year.We cannot let them control the disputed islands, and we must work with the Australians, the South Koreans, the Japanese and the Filipinos to contain China. And then we must ask for their support and their help with North Korea. Because believe it or not, China is as concerned about Kim Jong-Un as we are.BLITZER: Dr. Carson, what would you do about Kim Jong-Un?CARSON: Well, I definitely believe that he is unstable, and I do, in fact, believe that China has a lot more influence with him than we do. But we also recognize that North Korea is in severe financial straits, and they have decided to use their resources to build their military, rather than to feed their people and to take care of the various humanitarian responsibilities that they have.We can capitalize upon that. You know, we should use our economic power in lots of different ways. I think we can use that in order to keep Putin contained, because he is a one-horse show. Energy. And we have an abundance of energy, but we have archaic energy exportation rules. We need to get rid of those, allow ourselves to really make Europe dependent on us and other parts of the world dependent on us for energy. Put him back in his little box where he belongs.And, you know, we need to be doing lots of other things with the resources that we have. So economic power works just as well as military power, perhaps even better. And speaking of that, our Military needs to be upgraded. You know, you look at things like our Ohio Class submarines, they\u2019re 25 years old. Our minuteman 3 missiles \u2014 they are 34 years old. Our B-52 bombers \u2014 50 years old. You know, if we don\u2019t get the military right nothing else matters.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Dana and Hugh you have questions as well.BASH: Governor Christie, you\u2019ve said if China launches a cyber- attack against the U.S. on your watch, \u201cthey\u2019re going to see cyber- warfare like they have never seen before.\u201d What exactly would that response look like?CHRISTIE: Well, what it would like is, we have one of the great advantages of America being the open society that we are. It is, we are not hiding things from the American people, but China everyday is conducting business in a way that hides things from their people.CHRISTIE: So if they want to come in and attack all the personnel records in the federal government, which they\u2019ve done, and which \u2014 they now have my Social Security number and my fingerprints, as well as maybe some other folks\u2019 who are on this stage.The fact is, they need to be fought back on. And what we need to do is go at the things that they are most sensitive and most embarrassing to them; that they\u2019re hiding; get that information and put it out in public. Let the Chinese people start to digest how corrupt the Chinese government is; how they steal from the Chinese people; and how they\u2019re enriching oligarchs all throughout China.They need to understand that. And we need to take those type of steps. This president has seen personnel records of people who have sacrificed for the American people and for the federal government stolen by the Chinese and he\u2019s done nothing in return. This is why \u2014 this is what I said at the beginning that this administration, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton through their foreign policy, have betrayed the American people, because the weakness they\u2019ve displayed has led to Putin\u2019s incursions in the Middle East and in eastern Europe, and has led \u2014 has led to significant problems in the Middle East as well, and the death and murder of lots of folks.BASH: Governor Bush, what you just heard from Governor Christie, are you concerned that that could really escalate with China, that they would retaliate? And, for example, as the NSA has said, attack the U.S. and maybe it\u2019s power grid, which the Chinese have the capability to do?BUSH: I completely agree with Chris. And this administration has been so lax. Think about it. Hillary Clinton is using a private server for \u2014 where classified information go by. This is a \u2014 this is a serious administration?The president receives an inspector general\u2019s report that the Office of Personnel Management could be hacked into; they had antiquated firewalls; 23 million files have been \u2014 are in the hands of the Chinese allegedly, including, by the way, members of the press, it turns out, last week. Maybe that\u2019s the only part that\u2019s good news, so that you guys can get a feel for what it\u2019s like now to see this type of attack.This is something \u2014 we have to have the best defensive capabilities. We need to coordinate all of our efforts with the private sector. We need to give them liability relief so that we can do that. And offensively, we need to have capabilities second to none. We need to create a situation where they know that there will be adverse impacts if they continue to do what they\u2019re doing.They\u2019ll respect that. They\u2019ll respect a United States that is serious about protecting our \u2014 our infrastructure. If we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll continue to see what\u2019s \u2014 exactly what\u2019s happening, not just from the Chinese, by the way. The Russians and rogue actors, including ISIS \u2014 this is a serious part of the 21st century security challenge that we face.HEWITT: Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE)... Dr. Carson just referenced the single most important job of the president, the command, the control and the care of our nuclear forces. And he mentioned the triad. The B-52s are older than I am. The missiles are old. The submarines are aging out. It\u2019s an executive order. It\u2019s a commander-in-chief decision.What\u2019s your priority among our nuclear triad?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we can trust, who is totally responsible; who really knows what he or she is doing. That is so powerful and so important. And one of the things that I\u2019m frankly most proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly. And it was very important.But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ball game. Frankly, I would have said get out of Syria; get out \u2014 if we didn\u2019t have the power of weaponry today. The power is so massive that we can\u2019t just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we wouldn\u2019t care. It was hand-to-hand combat.The biggest problem this world has today is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable, this is what he\u2019s saying. The biggest problem we have is nuclear \u2014 nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. That\u2019s in my opinion, that is the single biggest problem that our country faces right now.HEWITT: Of the three legs of the triad, though, do you have a priority? I want to go to Senator Rubio after that and ask him.TRUMP: I think \u2014 I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation is very important to me.HEWITT: Senator Rubio, do you have a response?RUBIO: I do. First, let\u2019s explain to people at home who the triad \u2014 what the triad is. Maybe a lot of people haven\u2019t heard that terminology before. The triad is our ability of the United States to conduct nuclear attacks using airplanes, using missiles launched from silos or from the ground, and also from our nuclear subs\u2019 ability to attack. And it\u2019s important \u2014 all three of them are critical. It gives us the ability at deterrence.Now, some have become more critical than others; for example, the submarines. And that\u2019s the Ohio Class submarine that needs to be modernized. The air component also needs to be modernized. The B-52, as someone earlier pointed out, is an outdated model that was flown by the grandparents of people that are flying it now. And we need a serious modernization program as well on our silo-launched missiles. All three are critical for the defense of the country.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator Rubio.Some of you on this stage have questioned whether your opponents have temperament, the right temperament, to be in control of the nuclear codes.Dana, you have a question on this?BASH: Mr. Trump, just this weekend you said Senator Cruz is not qualified to be president because he doesn\u2019t have the right temperament and acted like a maniac when he arrived in the Senate. But last month you said you were open to naming Senator Cruz as your running mate.TRUMP: I did.BASH: So why would you be willing to put somebody who\u2019s a maniac one heartbeat away from the presidency?TRUMP: Let me just say that I have gotten to know him over the last three or four days. He has a wonderful temperament.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: He\u2019s just fine. Don\u2019t worry about it.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Okay.Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz, you have not been willing to attack Mr. Trump in public.TRUMP: You better not attack...(LAUGHTER)BASH: But you did question his judgment in having control of American\u2019s nuclear arsenal during a private meeting with supporters. Why are you willing to say things about him in private and not in public?CRUZ: Dana, what I said in private is exactly what I\u2019ll say here, which is that the judgment that every voter is making of every one of us up here is who has the experience, who has the vision, who has the judgment to be commander in chief. That is the most important decision for the voters to make. That\u2019s a standard I\u2019m held to. And it\u2019s a standard everyone else is held to.And I will note, you know, in the whole course of this discussion about our foreign policy threats, it actually illustrates the need for clarity of focus.You know, my daughters, Caroline and Catherine, came tonight. They\u2019re 7 and 5. And you think about the Los Angeles schools canceling their schools today.And every parent is wondering, how do we keep our kids safe? We need a commander in chief who does what Ronald Reagan did with communism, which is he set out a global strategy to defeat Soviet communism. And he directed all of his...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: I\u2019m answering the question, Dana.He directed all of his forces to defeating communism.One of the things we\u2019ve seen here is how easy it is for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to get distracted from dealing with radical Islamic terrorism. They won\u2019t even call it by its name.We need a president who stands up, number one, and says, we will defeat ISIS. And number two, says the greatest national security threat facing America is a nuclear Iran.BASH: Senator, senator, I just...CRUZ: And we need to be focused on defeating...BASH: Senator, a lot of people have seen...CRUZ: ... defeating radical Islamic terrorists.BASH: ... a lot of people have seen these comments you made in private. I just want to clarify what you\u2019re saying right now is you do believe Mr. Trump has the judgment to be commander in chief?CRUZ: What I\u2019m saying, Dana, is that is a judgment for every voter to make. What I can tell you is all nine of the people here would make an infinitely better commander in chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, senator. Thank you.CRUZ: And there is a real danger, Dana, when people get distracted.I\u2019m answering the question, Wolf.CRUZ: There\u2019s a real danger when people get distracted by peripheral issues. They get distracted by democracy building. They get distracted about military conflicts. We need to focus on defeating jihadism. ISIS and Iran have declared war on America, and we need a commander in chief who will do everything necessary to keep our children safe.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.CRUZ: And I will do everything necessary to keep our children safe.BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.We\u2019re a month and a half away now from the first real test who will be the Republican presidential nominee.Hugh, you have a question?HEWITT: My listeners tell me again and again they are worried that Hillary Clinton will win the White House because you\u2019ll run as an independent. Are you ready to assure Republicans tonight that you will run as a Republican and abide by the decision of the Republicans?TRUMP: I really am. I\u2019ll be honest, I really am.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I mean, the people have been putting me...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I really am.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Dr. Carson, last week...TRUMP: Let me just. Can I just finish my...HEWITT: Please.TRUMP: I\u2019ve gained great respect for the Republican leadership. I\u2019ve gained great respect for many \u2014 and I\u2019m going to even say \u2014 I mean, in different forms for the people on the dais, in different forms.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: In different forms.But I have great respect for the people I have met through this process. I\u2019ve never done this process before. I\u2019ve never been a politician. I mean, for the last six months I\u2019ve been a politician.But I will tell you, I am totally committed to the Republican Party. I feel very honored to be the front runner.(APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And I think I\u2019ll do very well if I\u2019m chosen. If I\u2019m so fortunate to be chosen, I think I\u2019ll do very well.Polls have come out recently saying I would beat Hillary. I will do everything in my power to beat Hillary Clinton, I promise you.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Dr. Carson, Mr. Trump just committed to stay the distance regardless of the result. How about you?CARSON: Well, you know, the statement that I made last week, that I would leave the party was contingent upon whether in fact the party acts like they have in the past with a lot of subterfuge and dishonesty, or like they\u2019re going act now because I spike to Reince Priebus, and he assured me that the Washington Post writer had it all wrong, and that they\u2019re not be engaging in anything to thwart the will of the people.That\u2019s why I got into this race, as a member of we the people, to try bring some honesty and integrity back to the process.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All right. Candidates, we have more coming up. When we come back, everyone will have an opportunity to explain why this particular candidate, each of you on the stage, believes he or she should be the Republican presidential nominee.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Now it\u2019s time for the closing statements from the candidates. Each one has 30 seconds.Senator Paul.PAUL: The greatest threat to our national security is our debt. We borrow a million dollars a minute. And whose fault is it? Well, frankly, it\u2019s both parties\u2019 fault. You have those on the right who clamor and say, oh, we will spend anything on the military, and those on the left who say the same for domestic welfare.But what most Americans don\u2019t realize is there is an unholy alliance. They come together. There\u2019s a secret handshake. We spend more money on everything. And we are not stronger nation if we go further into debt. We are not projecting power from bankruptcy court.To me, there is no greater threat than our debt. I\u2019m the only fiscal conservative on the stage because I\u2019m willing to hold the line on all spending. I hope you will consider me in the election. Thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich. KASICH: No Republican has ever been elected president of the United States without winning Ohio. Let me give you a little tip on how you win Ohio, it\u2019s reform, it\u2019s hope, it\u2019s growth, it\u2019s opportunity, and it\u2019s security.The people of Ohio are the people of America. The people of America are reflected in Ohio. Our message has to be big, and bold, and positive, and connect, not just with people\u2019s heads but also connect with their hearts.If we do it, we will beat Hillary Clinton, and we will run the White House, and we will strengthen and fix America, I promise you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: On September 10th, 2001, I was named chief federal prosecutor in New Jersey and on September 11th, 2001, my wife and my brother who are in the audience tonight went through the World Trade Center and to their offices just blocks away from the Trade Center.I lost touch with them for six hours that day and prayed that they were alive. Luckily, they were sent home. But many of our friends and others in our neighborhood lost their lives that day.Terrorism \u2014 radical jihadist terrorism is not theoretical to me. It\u2019s real. And for seven years, I spent my life protecting our country against another one of those attacks. You won\u2019t have to worry when I\u2019m President of the Untied States whether that can be done because I\u2019ve already done it. I want the chance to do it again to protect you, your children and your families.If you give me the chance and give me your vote I will protect America from the wars that are being brought to our door step.BLITZER: Ms. Fiorina.FIORINA: I too remember September 11th. I remember immediately putting into place security procedures all throughout our company that did business in 170 countries where we thought corporate interests would be attacked next. To take our country back, to keep our nation safe, we have to begin by beating Hillary Clinton.We need to unify our party. We need to better than our government, which 75 percent of the American people now think is corrupt and incompetent. They\u2019re right. We need to better than our politics. 80 percent think we have a professional/political class of both parties that cares more about its power, position and privilege than actually on getting anything done.We need to unify our party, we need a real Conservative in the White House, and we need to beat Hillary Clinton to take our country back and keep our nation safe.I can. I am. And together, if you join me, we will take our country back.BLITZER: Governor Bush. BUSH: Ask yourself, which candidate will keep you and our country safer, stronger and freer?Hillary Clinton has aligned herself with Barack Obama on ISIS, Iran and the economy. It\u2019s an alliance doomed to fail. My proven record suggests that \u2014 my detailed plans will fortify our national and economic security. And my proven record as governor makes \u2014 will give you a sense that I don\u2019t make false promises. I deliver real results.For America to be safe and sound, I ask for you support. Thank you all very much.BLITZER: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you. As we near the end of this year, we enter one of the most important elections in a generation. For what\u2019s at stake in this election is not simply what party\u2019s going to be in charge. But our very identity as a people and as a nation. For over 200 years this has been a special country. A unique place where anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. But now millions of Americans feel like they\u2019re being left behind. Insecure in their future and unsafe in the face of terrorism. This election is about electing a president that will restore our economic vibrancy so that the American dream can expand to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. And rebuild our Military and our intelligence programs so that we can remain the strongest nation on earth. Tonight I ask you for your vote.If you do this, we will rebuild this country, and together we will usher in a new American century \u2014 the greatest era in the history of this great land.BLITZER: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: Judgment, strength, clarity and trust. Barack Obama has said he doesn\u2019t believe in American leadership or America winning \u2014 he is wrong. America can win again and we will win again. Ronald Reagan reignited the American economy, rebuilt the Military, bankrupted the Soviet Union and defeated Soviet Communism. I will do the same thing.Cutting taxes, cutting regulation, unleashing small businesses and rebuilding the Military to defeat radical Islamic terrorism \u2014 our strategy is simple. We win, they lose. We\u2019ve done it before and we can do it again.BLITZER: Dr. Carson.CARSON: I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to travel to 58 different countries and I thank God everyday that I was born in this country. The most exceptional country that the world has ever known. And I want to make sure that we preserve that exceptionalism for the next generation. My mother told me if I work hard and I really believed in American principles and I believed in God, anything is possible. I believe that is true, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not anxious to give away American values and principles for the sake of political correctness.XXX of political correctness.TRUMP: Our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win on trade. We don\u2019t win on the military. We can\u2019t defeat ISIS. We\u2019re not taking care of our great people, the veterans. We\u2019re not taking care of them.We have to change our whole way, our health care system is a disaster. It\u2019s going to implode in 2017, just like you\u2019re sitting there. It doesn\u2019t work. Nothing works in our country. If I\u2019m elected president, we will win again. We will win a lot. And we\u2019re going to have a great, great country, greater than ever before.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thanks to all the Republican presidential candidates. That does it for this Republican presidential debate.On behalf of everyone at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, Facebook, the Republican National Committee, and the Venetian Las Vegas. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash.We especially want to wish everyone a very merry Christmas, happy holidays, especially to the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines protecting us around the world.Anderson Cooper picks up our coverage of tonight\u2019s debate right now \u2014 Anderson.ENDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Governor of Puerto Rico Warns of Looming Default Without Bankruptcy Plan ", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe governor of Puerto Rico redoubled threats on Wednesday of a major bond default, as an effort to help the struggling commonwealth use bankruptcy to shed debt headed for defeat in Congress.\u201cThere is no money,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a printing machine.\u201dThe governor\u2019s comments came as Congress omitted from a federal spending bill any measures to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its roughly $72 billion of debt in Federal Bankruptcy Court.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla and his Democratic Party allies in Washington have been pushing for months to allow the island to take shelter from its creditors through bankruptcy. Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which is available to cities, counties and other local governments on the mainland, specifically excludes Puerto Rico as well as states.Many Republican leaders are opposed to giving Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9, in part because of concerns that the island would blaze a trail that severely troubled states might try to follow. The proposal was also vehemently opposed by bondholders, including hedge funds, that have bought billions of dollars of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, under the assurance that it could not be cut in bankruptcy.Supporters of bankruptcy authority for Puerto Rico vowed to keep fighting for such a measure, which requires congressional approval.In a statement, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that \u201cwhile we could not agree to including precedent-setting changes to bankruptcy law in this omnibus spending bill,\u201d he had instructed various House committees to work with Puerto Rico to come up with a \u201cresponsible solution\u201d by the end of the first quarter of 2016.The Treasury Department has been among those pushing for Congress to create an orderly legal process for Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, rather than leaving it up to a free-for-all among creditors.Some analysts fear that a major default could result in just such a scramble, as creditors file a series of lawsuits seeking to protect their claims to the island\u2019s increasingly scarce cash.The Puerto Rico governor has previously raised the specter of default, saying in June that the island\u2019s debts were \u201cnot payable.\u201d On Wednesday, he did not specify whether Puerto Rico might default on all or only a portion of the debt coming due on the first of the year.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said it was becoming increasingly difficult to make debt payments while also providing essential government services.It will \u201cprobably be on Jan. 1 that I will not have money to do both things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I have to choose between Puerto Ricans and creditors, I will choose Puerto Ricans. There is no question.\u201dAbout $332 million of that bond payment is for general obligation bonds. Other large payments are due on the same day from the public corporations that operate the island\u2019s water, electricity and highway systems, among others.The bill also authorizes the Treasury to provide \u201ctechnical assistance,\u201d like helping the Puerto Rico government with its budgeting, forecasting, cash management, information technology and tax collection \u2014 enhancing the Treasury\u2019s current engagement.Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he welcomed further assistance from the Treasury.\u201cWe can now begin the process of improving basic bookkeeping in the territory and end the opacity and lack of transparency in their finances,\u201d he said in a statement on Wednesday. Republican senators on committees with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico have complained that the island has not provided enough information to warrant anything like a cash bailout.\u201cProviding blank checks without oversight or fiscal responsibility is not my preferred approach,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.\u201cCongress missed an opportunity to do the right thing,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said on Wednesday. \u201cHedge funds proved more persuasive over Congress than the well-being of 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Interpublic Acquires Russian Advertising Agencies in Long-Sought Deal ", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe advertising giant Interpublic Group of Companies is gaining a stronger foothold in Russia.In a deal that has been brewing for years, Interpublic has acquired three Russian creative agencies from ADV, its longtime partner in the country.Interpublic, which is based in New York, has done business in Russia for two decades through ADV, an advertising group that encompasses more than 40 agencies in countries including Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. But with the deal, Interpublic will now directly own advertising agencies in one of the top global markets.\u201cWe have wanted to own these agencies for years,\u201d said Michael I. Roth, the chairman and chief executive of Interpublic. \u201cWe have a number of global clients that operate in Russia that are very important, and it\u2019s important for us to have a relationship with our clients in the markets they compete in.\u201dInterpublic\u2019s clients in Russia include L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Unilever.The other top holding companies \u2014 WPP, Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe \u2014 also conduct business in Russia.At the moment, relations between the United States and Russia are particularly fraught and the Russian economy is stumbling.Last year, Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, one of the world\u2019s biggest ad holding companies, warned that the economic sanctions imposed on Russia could threaten the advertising company\u2019s profits there.Interpublic\u2019s media agency, Magna Global, expects industrywide ad spending to decrease 12 percent in Russia this year, largely because of economic strain in the country, according to an annual forecast released on Monday. (The company estimates that the Russian market will account for 40 percent of the $19.3 billion in ad sales in central and Eastern Europe.) Ad spending in Russia will stabilize in 2016, Magna Global predicts.Despite the geopolitical and economic strain, Mr. Roth said that owning agencies in Russia made sense. \u201cOur clients are still there, and they still advertise and we need to do the work,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, if we weren\u2019t there, our competitors would be doing the work.\u201dAd holding companies have also been looking elsewhere for longer-term growth opportunities. Omnicom, for instance, announced in November that one of its divisions, DDB Worldwide, had acquired Grupo ABC, an advertising group in Brazil.With the deal, Interpublic gains a majority stake in the Russian affiliates of three of its most well-known global creative agencies \u2014 McCann, Mullen Lowe and FCB. ADV shareholders will remain minority owners of the agencies. Financial terms were not disclosed, but a person familiar with the deal said it was valued at between $10 million and $20 million; Interpublic sets aside $150 million a year for acquisitions.The deal will give Interpublic control over talent and management decisions at the agencies and allow the company to record revenue from its Russian operations on its own books.ADV and the French advertising company Havas are also partners in Russia; that relationship will remain intact.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name, on second reference, of Interpublic\u2019s media agency. As correctly identified elsewhere in the article, the company is Magna Global, not Media Global.Advertisement"}

Instead of a genial, shuffling Everyman, he is an outspoken, fiery-eyed political gadfly preaching revolution. With his shrill, acrid voice, filled with nagging indignation, he wants to goad listeners into taking action. Voting isn\u2019t enough to reverse income inequality, he warns. Active involvement is necessary, he insists, as he spreads his message from a sound truck touring London.The movie begins with the Hans Christian Andersen tale \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes,\u201d about two weavers who promise the ruler a new suit that is invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent. As he parades before his subjects, they pretend that he\u2019s dressed in silk and gold until a child in the crowd pipes up and shouts that he isn\u2019t wearing anything at all.That willful blindness is a metaphor for the behavior of the masses who accept on faith the free-market doctrine, a tenet of which is the unproven \u201ctrickle-down\u201d theory that great wealth benefits everyone by seeping down from above.Mr. Brand indulges in many of the same stunts Mr. Moore has pulled, ambushing bankers and plutocrats and asking them uncomfortable questions, which they brush off. In the most clever running gag, he quizzes a group of schoolchildren with loaded questions about income disparity in Britain, and asks if it\u2019s fair, only to be answered with a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d In one assertion, not credited to a source, he declares that if all the money in Britain were divided equally, each person would get 200,000 pounds (about $300,000).The most infuriating revelations have to do with the system of tax avoidance, by which he says an estimated $21 to $32 trillion are held in offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands.\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d is moderately effective agitprop.\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes\u201d is not rated.

Most can be visited for tastings, each one drawing on a heritage of the island\u2019s environmental purity.Some use geothermal energy and lava-rock filtration, while others emphasize Iceland\u2019s unique Arctic-grazing terroir with unusual native flavors like Icelandic moss, sweet kelp and even dried sheep dung used to smoke barley.\u201cIn Iceland, we traditionally smoke meat and salmon with sheep dung rather than wood or peat, like Scotland,\u201d said the distillery\u2019s chief executive, Haraldur Thorkelsson. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much forest in Iceland, and peat has a negative environmental impact. But sheep dung we have plenty of.\u201dThe road to Iceland\u2019s craft liquor revolution was long and dry. Icelanders voted for alcohol prohibition in 1908, and hard spirits remained illegal until 1935. Even sales of full-strength beer were illegal until 1989.\u201cThere are a lot of gimmicks in vodka marketing, but the crevices and pores in lava rocks really do filter our vodka, giving it its signature characteristics,\u201d said Mr. Sigurdsson while showing me the plant\u2019s Carter Head still. \u201cBut our biggest asset is a lack of pollutants. We sent samples of our spring water to the New York lab, and they sent them back asking us to send in untreated water.

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... the Czech Republic", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate23 PhotosA FIVE-BEDROOM VILLA OUTSIDE PRAGUE$1.17 MILLION (29,990,000 CZECH KORUNAS) This three-story country home sits on a wooded hillside near the Vltava River, about a 30-minute drive from the center of Prague. Built in the 1930s, the 5,038-square-foot house was substantially renovated in 1999 and includes five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms and a heated indoor pool.The house sits on about one-third of an acre at the end of a small lane, with a stream running down the side of the property. Trails for hiking and biking lead through the forest to the stores and restaurants of the town of Roztoky, a little more than a mile away, according to the owner.The main entrance to the house is on the second floor, which includes a living room, a dining room, a study and two lounge areas and a water closet. The floors are red maple, and each room is framed with wood and glass doors. (The furniture is not included in the price.) The open kitchen features modern appliances, stone counter tops and a counter surrounded by tall stools for casual meals. The second floor also includes a glass-enclosed sunroom, with views of the garden and surrounding forest. Glass doors lead to a wide terrace overlooking the grounds and the stream.A staircase leads to the ground floor, where there are four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a workshop and the indoor pool. From the pool, large sliding glass doors lead to a wood terrace and the landscaped gardens.The top floor is used as a master bedroom, with wide views of the surrounding forest. The roof was raised and walls rearranged during the extensive 1999 renovation to create the large and open layout, the owner said. There are two rooms off the bedroom that can be used as changing rooms or a small study. The bathroom features wood floors, dual sinks and a free-standing bathtub set on a wood pedestal. A terrace with a glass-enclosed shower is accessible from the top-floor bedroom. The heating in the house is provided by a gas boiler and a gas central-heating system, according to Lukas Cichon, a property consultant with the real estate company Svoboda & Williams, which is listing this property.The grounds around the house include a two-car garage, a hot tub, a gazebo with a barbecue grill, and a flat lawn large enough for a badminton court. A glass-covered walkway leads from the front gate to the main entrance and a ground-floor patio, providing a convenient alternative entrance on cold nights, the owner said.The house is on the outskirts of the town of Roztoky, home to a castle dating to the 13th century. Roztoky also offers stores, restaurants and a 15-minute train trip to Prague. The largely rural area includes two nature reserves with hiking and biking trails. The international airport in Prague is about a 20-minute drive. MARKET OVERVIEWHome sales in the Prague area have been increasing in recent years, fueled by the improving economy and low mortgage rates, agents say. \u201cSince late in 2012, sales have been picking up significantly,\u201d said Peter Visnovsky, director of Lexxus, a Czech property company.The property market has also been benefiting from shifts in currency exchange rates. Although the Czech Republic is part of the European Union, it still uses its own currency, the koruna, which is currently undervalued against other currencies, Mr. Cichon says. \u201cThis stimulates the demand from foreign buyers as well as Czech expats working and living in the E.U.,\u201d he said.\u00a0Prices in many neighborhoods have been rising 3 percent to 4 percent a year since 2012, agents say.While demand is growing, the supply of quality homes remains limited. In Prague, developing residential projects is a long and complicated process, which has helped keep the supply of new homes low, Mr. Visnovsky said.Buyers are particularly interested in period villas built before 1948 in the high-end residential areas, Mr. Cichon said. \u201cThe long-term excess of demand over supply in this niche market is leading to continuous price increases,\u201d he said.In the Roztoky area, where this house is, prices are much cheaper than in central Prague, Mr. Visnovsky said. Homes of similar size in central Prague are \u201cdouble the price,\u201d he said. WHO BUYS IN PRAGUEAlthough Czech citizens account for the majority of home sales in Prague, there is consistent demand from international buyers, agents say. Most of the foreign buyers are from Western Europe, including Britain, Germany and Italy. But there has been a dramatic increase in recent years in buyers from Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet republics.Foreign expatriates who were renting are increasingly deciding to buy, Mr. Cichon said. There has also been an increase in Western European and British citizens taking advantage of the low interest rates and the purchasing power of the euro and British pound to buy apartments as investments, which they then offer as rentals. The number of North American buyers dropped after the global economic crisis, but has been steadily picking up in recent years, according to agents. BUYING BASICSThe Czech Republic is a member of the European Union (even though it has not adopted the euro), and the buying process is similar to that in most E.U. countries, with the same protections for buyers, agents say. There are no restrictions on foreign ownership.A notary can help search the land registry to confirm ownership and ensure there are no liens on the property. Buyers typically hire a lawyer to review contracts and confirm translations of legal documents. Escrow accounts are used to secure transactions. Although a formal inspection of the property is not required, Mr. Cichon recommends hiring a chartered building surveyor to confirm the condition of the house, \u201cparticularly when buying an older period house.\u201dWEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESCzech; koruna (1 koruna = $0.039) TAXES AND FEESA property transfer tax on sales is usually calculated at 4 percent of the purchase price. The seller typically pays the tax, but it can be negotiated during the purchase agreement. Agents are paid 3 percent of the purchase price.An annual council tax is \u201crelatively negligible,\u201d usually amounting to no more than the equivalent of a few hundred United States dollars a year, Mr. Cichon says. The annual tax on this property is estimated at about $200.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Middle Ground Between Contract Worker and Employee", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThen, in 2013, it reversed course and made its drivers full-blown employees. In addition to those various protections, they received health benefits if they worked at least 30 hours per week.The about-face suggests an ambiguity in the status of workers at Munchery and other on-demand companies like the car-hailing services Uber and Lyft. These workers have some characteristics typically associated with contractors (like working as few or as many hours as they want), and some associated with regular employees (the companies often give some form of instructions about how to perform tasks).This ambiguity has, in turn, led to pleas by technology executives and policy advocates for the creation of a new kind of worker status that would effectively split the difference between the two categories.Munchery\u2019s experience, however, suggests that the traditional employee-contractor dichotomy in the laws governing work may still hold up reasonably well when it comes to this new world. The true source of ambiguity may be confusion on the part of the companies themselves over which model best suits their business needs.While the upfront costs were lower for Munchery with a work force of contractors \u2014 who receive a 1099 form for their taxes rather than the W-2 reserved for employees \u2014 this approach was ultimately bad for business.There was too much turnover, while high-volume periods, like the Super Bowl or days with miserable weather, were a challenge.When \u201clots of people want food delivered,\u201d said Kris Fredrickson, the company\u2019s vice president for operations, \u201con a 1099 model it\u2019s tougher to compel them to show up.\u201dUnder an employment model, by contrast, the company has a much more reliable and knowledgeable work force, one that can be held to a specific standard of quality and a more consistent schedule. Company executives said the additional 20 to 30 percent in costs have more than paid for themselves.And Munchery, it turns out, is only one of many on-demand companies to have made the transition in recent years.But turnover was higher than the company preferred, and service quality was lower: There were too many missed items and too much bruised produce. It was also highly inefficient to pay drivers to make the trip from their homes to the store to the customer.This year, Instacart reimagined its model. Thanks to partnerships with leading supermarkets, teams of designated shoppers now embed in each store and respond quickly to orders. Instacart has made them bona fide employees who receive training and will be judged on how well they do their jobs.The shoppers then pass the order along to drivers, who remain independent contractors. The only requirement for drivers, who receive no training or instructions, is that they have a license and a clean record, and can navigate their way around town.While the company is still refining the business model, said Nikhil Shanbhag, an Instacart vice president, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a cadre of workers who are better, have fewer issues than we used to see before in terms of missed items, bad produce. They are getting more and more efficient.\u201dThere are certainly legitimate gray areas in the laws governing the online gig economy. In a comment that has since been widely circulated, a federal judge in California hearing a case brought by Lyft drivers brooded earlier this year that \u201cthe jury in this case will be handed a square peg and asked to choose between two round holes.\u201dBut even these hard cases often are not necessarily as hard as they initially appear. Benjamin I. Sachs, a Harvard law professor who is a former union official, notes that the drivers may only need to be paid from the point at which they have agreed to pick up a particular rider.And such cases appear to be relatively rare even in the gig economy, which itself is a tiny fraction of the economy over all, less than 1 percent of employment in the United States, according to an estimate by Mr. Krueger and Mr. Harris.More fundamentally, Uber and Lyft face the same basic questions that Munchery and Instacart do: Do they want control over their workers or not?Companies that do \u2014 and there are some indications that these ride-hailing platforms are among them, with practices like deactivating drivers who do not maintain certain quality ratings \u2014 are frequently considered employers in the eyes of the law.Both Uber and Lyft maintain the contrary. Another fear among venture capitalists and tech executives is that these innovative companies are being coerced by the threat of litigation and a crackdown by regulators to upgrade their workers\u2019 status even if they only engage in one or two practices \u2014 like training \u2014 that are common among employers.\u201cYou have regulatory bodies suing people, lawyers out there suing people,\u201d said Simon Rothman, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners, who is on the board of an on-demand firm. \u201cMany start-ups can\u2019t withstand a lawsuit even if a company is in the right.\u201dTo fix this, regulators could simply clarify the criteria that suggest employment or independent contractor status \u2014 categories that, in theory at least, already give businesses a fair amount of flexibility because no one factor carries the day. \u201cCourts and regulating agencies look at the totality,\u201d said David Rolf, president of a large service employees union in the Northwest. \u201cTraining in and of itself is not determinative.\u201dMr. Krueger and Mr. Harris are concerned that what they see as the overly crude nature of labor law means that independent contractors are not provided enough protections.But creating an entirely new category of worker would not only be politically and logistically tortuous, it would also risk depriving workers who would otherwise be classified as employees of the benefits they might enjoy.That has been the experience with intermediate categories both in Britain and Italy, according to an analysis by Valerio De Stefano and Janine Berg of the International Labor Office, which is based in Geneva.\u201cWe could do something that is unduly hasty and ends up doing more harm than good,\u201d said Labor Secretary Thomas E.

Hundreds of specially hired transit workers in bright green vests and caps helped shepherd visitors through Paris\u2019s maze of public transportation, distributing maps, leaflets and fare cards and posting giant green directional arrows in railway stations and airport terminals.At Le Bourget, Ad\u00e8le Dubrulle said that she had not previously been particularly aware of the climate issue, but she brought her son to take part in a small rally outside the conference to urge the negotiators on.Camille Grand, director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, said the government could be proud of the outcome and of how smoothly the conference was run, but those may prove to be little more than symbolic badges of honor.\u201cIt is a real success, and rightly hailed as so, but it isn\u2019t a fundamentally political discussion that unblocks other issues,\u201d Mr. Grand said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t because you were able to push over 180 countries to mobilize on climate change today that you are going to be able to push 30 countries to agree on Syria tomorrow.\u201dDomestically, Mr. Grand said, the climate deal may help Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist government renew its frayed ties with France\u2019s Green Party, but will do little else to bolster the president\u2019s standing at home, where he has struggled with a weak economy and high unemployment since he took office in 2012.In France, he said, \u201cyou can win wars, succeed in big international negotiations and be widely recognized as an influential world leader, but it has never enabled anybody to win a presidential election.\u201dThe climate conference might have given Mr. Hollande and Mr. Fabius a chance to shine on the world stage, but Parisians voting near Place de la R\u00e9publique, where people continue to mourn the victims killed on Nov. 13, did not feel that they were basking in the same limelight.Others were less impressed. \u00c9lodie Hervier, a 24-year-old theater student, said she was still reeling from the attacks and had not followed the climate conference very closely.Lionel Autissier, a 38-year-old store manager, said that the attacks were still fresh in his memory and that the climate talks were \u201cjust a facade.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really think that the conference gives France a boost,\u201d he said.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Le Bourget, France, and Caroline Chauvet from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fear of Terrorism Lifts Donald Trump in New York Times/CBS Poll", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans expressed confidence in Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to confront terrorism: Seven in 10 voters who said they were likely to vote in a Republican primary said he was well equipped to respond to the threat, with four in 10 \u201cvery confident\u201d he could handle terrorism. Only Senator Ted Cruz of Texas comes close to those numbers.But it is not only Republicans feeling renewed fear about terrorist strikes on American soil. Forty-four percent of the public says an attack is \u201cvery\u201d likely to happen in the next few months, the most in Times or CBS News polls since October 2001, just after the deadliest terrorist assault in the country\u2019s history. Seven in 10 Americans now call the Islamic State extremist group a major threat to the United States\u2019 security, the highest level since the Times/CBS News poll began asking the question last year.The public has little faith in President Obama\u2019s handling of terrorism and the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Fifty-seven percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of terrorism, and seven in 10 say the fight against the Islamic State is going badly. There have been few foreign-directed terrorist attacks in the United States in the past decade, and American officials have repeatedly said that there is no credible evidence of planning for a large-scale attack in the United States by the Islamic State or its supporters.Yet while Mr. Trump may be benefiting among Republicans from a perceived loss of safety, he remains a highly divisive figure with the broader electorate. Sixty-four percent of voters said they would be concerned or scared about what he would do if he became president. And while he occupies a commanding position among Republican primary voters, with more than twice the support of his nearest competitor, his backers are still a minority of that relatively small population.Even as he leads the Republican field in support, he also has the most Republican primary voters, 23 percent, who say they would be most dissatisfied with him as the party\u2019s nominee.\u201cIt\u2019s the things he says and how he says them,\u201d said Bill Rogers, 43, of Xenia, Ohio, who supports John R. Kasich, the state\u2019s Republican governor. \u201cHe\u2019s just too blunt and straightforward, and it\u2019s scary. He doesn\u2019t hold anything back. Some people think the way he speaks is offensive, and I\u2019m one of them.\u201dPerceptions about the likelihood of another attack are also carrying over into how Americans feel about the state of the country over all.Just 24 percent say the country is headed in the right direction, the lowest figure in a Times or CBS News survey in more than two years. More than half of the public, 53 percent, say they are dissatisfied with how things are going in Washington; another 31 percent say they are angry.This profound discontent is animating the Republican presidential race. Mr. Trump now has the support of 35 percent of Republican primary voters, a substantial increase from late October, when he was the choice of 22 percent of Republicans and was edged out by Ben Carson.Americans are more fearful about another terrorist attack than at any time since the weeks after Sept. 11, 2001, and the gnawing sense of dread is lifting Donald J. Trump to a new high among Republican voters who are most focused on nominating a strong leader, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.Mr. Trump remains the focus of the race for many Republicans, for better or worse.\u201cHe stands up to people, and he tells what\u2019s on his mind,\u201d Philip Austin, 66, a retired insurance executive in Raleigh, N.C., said. \u201cUnfortunately, even though people don\u2019t want to hear it because a lot of what he says is inflammatory toward certain groups, it is the truth, because we have a massive problem.\u201dWhat has not changed from the last survey is the reliability of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, an indication that he has a durable floor of support. While only a third of Republican primary voters expressing support for a candidate said their minds were made up, Mr. Trump\u2019s backing is far more firm: 51 percent of his supporters say their minds are made up.Twenty-six percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters said Mr. Cruz was their second choice, more than any other candidate. Mr. Cruz does well with evangelicals and voters who describe themselves as \u201cvery conservative,\u201d running closely with Mr. Trump among each group.But many Republicans are filled with both fury and fear, and it is Mr. Trump who is most effectively tapping into these boiling anxieties. Forty-four percent of Republican primary voters say they are angry about the way things are going in Washington, and of those voters, 43 percent support Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m mad about the Muslims coming in, I\u2019m mad about the economy and I\u2019m mad because we got a stupid president, and that\u2019s about it,\u201d said Manuel Hart, 71, a retired fire chief in Silver Springs, Fla., appending a pungent three-letter word onto \u201cstupid.\u201dAsked whether it was more important for a candidate to agree with them on issues or to have the best chance of winning the general election, 62 percent of Republican primary voters cited issues, while just 36 percent said electability.The country\u2019s trepidation about another act of terrorism is having less effect on the Democratic contest, but Democratic voters expressed more confidence in Hillary Clinton\u2019s ability to respond to terrorism than they did in Bernie Sanders\u2019s. Mrs. Clinton has the support of 52 percent of Democratic primary voters, while Mr. Sanders takes 32 percent, a difference that has changed little in recent weeks.What has shifted notably are attitudes on gun control. Only 44 percent of Americans favor a ban on assault weapons, 19 percentage points lower than after the mass shooting in Tucson in 2011. And while 51 percent favor stricter gun control in general, that is down from 58 percent in October.The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Dec. 4 to 8 on cellphones and landlines with 1,275 adults, including 431 Republican primary voters and 384 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults, six percentage points for Republican primary voters and six percentage points for Democratic primary voters.Megan Thee-Brenan, Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thaw in China-Russia Relations Hasn\u2019t Trickled Down", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBLAGOVESHCHENSK, Russia \u2014 Lured by warming relations between the two countries, Li Lihua, a Chinese entrepreneur, has invested all of her money in this frigid Russian outpost on the border with her country. She has opened Chinese restaurants, purchased factories and started a $120 million housing project to build affordable apartments aimed at young, upwardly mobile Russians.But Ms. Li says that capital for the housing development has dried up as the Russian economy sinks. She now worries that she will have to sell off other parts of her business to move forward on the project.\u201cThe two countries are desperate to cooperate with each other,\u201d said Ms. Li, 48. \u201cOn the ground, the joint action is not that obvious.\u201dBut this remote corner of Asia \u2014 where Blagoveshchensk, Russia, sits on one side of the border and its sister city, Heihe, China, on the other \u2014 shows how the diplomatic handshakes haven\u2019t yet translated into closer cooperation.Businesses on both sides of a border remain hamstrung by poor infrastructure, a shortage of financing and Russia\u2019s severe economic troubles. The challenges illustrate how far ties between the two former Communist rivals must progress to significantly decrease their dependence on the United States and Europe for investment, technology and exports.The Chinese and Russians in these two border towns, though separated only by the narrow Amur River, were driven apart by political ambition and a cultural divide for much of their history. In 1900, after China\u2019s imperial troops shelled Blagoveshchensk, Russian officials forcibly expelled the Chinese from the town, causing thousands to drown in the Amur. During the Cold War, when a nasty ideological schism turned the Communist compatriots into bitter enemies, the border was sealed off with barbed wire and bunkers.With the coming of economic reform and \u201copening up\u201d in China, the frostiness began to thaw. Trade between Heihe and Blagoveshchensk reopened in 1986, and in 2000 a small special economic zone was formed along the border to encourage commerce. Shop fronts in Heihe display signs in both Chinese characters and Russian Cyrillic.Still, the two cities remain worlds apart in many respects.The only way across the Amur River is a pricey ferry ride in a cramped motorboat (except in the middle of winter, when vehicles can drive across the frozen waterway). That bottleneck greatly limits the volume of people and goods that can travel from town to town.The communities barely intermingle. The ferry\u2019s operators don\u2019t allow Russians and Chinese to travel together in the same boat, alternating the two groups instead. Residents in Blagoveshchensk are more likely to speak a bit of English than Chinese.The barriers to doing business with Russia have also remained stubbornly high.Wang Xin, 31, started importing Russian chocolates, cookies and candies in 2008 and marketing them to Chinese shops and consumers over the Internet. Today, he sells around $150,000 worth of Russian goodies a month from his office in Heihe.Yet bringing his products over the border is time-consuming and expensive. After a 10-day journey by truck from Moscow, Mr. Wang must wait three weeks for his chocolates to crawl over the river by boat and through each nation\u2019s customs procedures. Lofty duties and taxes imposed by both governments tack on extra costs \u2014 some 30 percent onto a package of cookies, for instance.The gap between rhetoric and reality in China-Russia relations is significant.President Xi Jinping of China has been a willing partner.With economic growth likely to be the slowest in a quarter-century in 2015, Beijing sees Russia as a potential gold mine of raw materials, infrastructure projects and new customers for its sputtering factories. The two sides have signed major agreements in energy and finance. Trade between them, at $95 billion in 2014, more than quadrupled in only 10 years.Many entrepreneurs and officials in the two border towns believe their futures are inexorably linked.The local government in Heihe is building a pedestrian walkway across the Amur. And next year, construction will commence on a $240 million bridge linking the towns, financed jointly by the two countries.With improved economic ties, \u201cwe will be able to reach our goal of becoming more like a city in Northern Europe,\u201d says Guo Wengui, a former official in the Heihe government.But China has not been the white knight Moscow expected.With oil prices tumbling, China has been dragging its feet on advancing much-heralded agreements to buy natural gas from Russia. Last year, Chinese foreign direct investment into Russia more than doubled, but it still accounted for only 5.6 percent of the total.The Russians \u201ckeep looking to Asia to say to the West \u2018we have other friends,\u2019 but it\u2019s not so easy,\u201d says Edward Chow, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. In these border towns, the disparities are obvious.Heihe is a showcase of China\u2019s new wealth, with manicured streets lined with modern office complexes and hotels overlooking the picturesque river, many topped by faux-European architecture lighted brightly at night. Blagoveshchensk, by contrast, is an older town dominated by Soviet-era buildings that gives the impression that its best days have already passed.Last year, the Chinese shipped four times more goods to Russia through Heihe than they imported in return. As Russia\u2019s economy has sunk into a deep recession, it has also sapped the spending power of Blagoveshchensk\u2019s residents.That has crippled business along the border.The Big Heihe International Trade Town, a cavernous marketplace on an island in the Amur, was once teeming with Russian shoppers looking for bargains on everything from underwear to appliances from Chinese merchants. But these days, its narrow hallways are nearly empty.Zhang Yingying, 40, says her sneaker shop once had 1,000 Russian customers each day. But now she\u2019s lucky to get 100, who often seek out the cheapest merchandise.\u201cI am worried I will have to find another business to do,\u201d she said.The problems are widespread.Five years ago, an entrepreneur, Liu Jingmin, 40, started pouring $4.6 million into a factory in Heihe to manufacture building insulation for Russian construction companies. While business was brisk at first, Mr. Liu hasn\u2019t exported a single crate this year.\u201cWhat we are doing now is waiting for the Russian market to become warmer,\u201d he said. For Ms. Li, the situation is threatening her entire operation.Born near Harbin, a major city in northeastern China, Ms. Li studied Russian at a local school and, looking to start her own business in the late 1990s, saw opportunity in Blagoveshchensk. The Russians in the city love Chinese food, she determined, so she opened her first restaurant there in 2000, and now has six.Later, Ms. Li acquired an 80-year-old Russian company that produces a popular drink called kvass, made from fermented bread, and another Blagoveshchensk factory that fabricates bricks. In 2013, she undertook her biggest endeavor, purchasing a large plot of land in Blagoveshchensk with the plan to build apartments.\u201cIn the past, the Russians\u2019 willingness to forge ties with Chinese was not that strong,\u201d Ms. Li says in her Blagoveshchensk office, decorated with photos of her posing with Russian movie stars. \u201cBut now they actively welcome investment from foreigners.\u201dThat openness has meant little, however, as Ms. Li struggles to complete her apartment buildings.Russian banks, strained by sanctions, are no longer lending her money to continue construction, she says. Now she is searching for new investors to help finance the project \u2014 so far, with no success.In describing the relationship between Russia and China, Ms. Li turns to an old proverb: \u201cThere are no permanent friends,\u201d she says, \u201conly permanent interests.\u201dOwen Guo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cavalli Investment Seems to Show Private Equity Still Interested in Fashion", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe global luxury market might be heading for its weakest year since 2009, but private equity investment, at least within the Italian fashion sector, appears to be back on a growth trend.After lurching from one recession to the next after the 2008 financial crisis, the hundreds of thousands of small- and medium-size businesses that make up Italy\u2019s fragmented economy \u2014 and luxury industry \u2014 are taking stock of their options for long-term growth prospects. With a sluggish market at home, the need to grow outside Italy and tackle untapped export markets has become increasingly important. And, for many, achieving those goals requires a serious strategic shakeup, more succession planning and a considerable injection of outside capital. \u201cThe majority of luxury businesses in Italy \u2014 from the likes of Armani, Versace, Etro and Prada to the smallest stores and factories \u2014 are still run by their creators,\u201d said Armando Branchini, vice chairman of Fondazione Altagamma, the Italian luxury goods industry trade association. \u201cAs they look to handing over to the next generation, private equity investment is an increasingly attractive proposition, especially as that breed of investor now has a much better understanding of the fashion industry, its cycles and unique requirements than they did a decade ago.\u201dHe points to two trends: \u201cMinority ownership that provide reinforcement of a current model before floating it on the stock market, like Carlyle with Moncler \u2014 and possibly Blackstone with Versace, now they have taken a 20 percent stake. Or a complete takeover and subequent overhaul of the company, where they are really committed for the long haul.\u201dSo closely following several big-name initial public offerings on the Milanese stock market by the likes of Brunello Cucinelli and Moncler, the last 18 months have seen a wave of high-profile private equity-funded deals, including the acquisition of a 90 percent stake in Roberto Cavalli by Clessidra for an estimated 390 million euros, or $430 million. Having emerged victorious from a pack of rivals and installed a new senior management team, Clessidra is now embarking on an ambitious turnaround project for the Florence-based brand known for flesh-baring and flamboyant designs. Its hope, of course, is for a billion-dollar exit some years from now, either through a listing or sale to a buyer. \u201cWith Cavalli the opportunity is very clear \u2014 at least in theory,\u201d said Francesco Trapani, now the chairman of the brand and executive vice-chairman of Clessidra, which also has invested in Italian luxury jeweler Buccellati. \u201cIt is a very well-known brand with a strong character so can support a massive scale-up of the business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe task is to build a business that is as big as its name. But the company was very poorly managed for a long period of time. For the next three years we will be fixing a broken machine. Then, with a proper foundation, we can start a real path to growth in order to really extract value.\u201dMr. Trapani is a former head of the LVMH watches and jewelry division, who, as chief executive of his family business Bulgari, masterminded its sale in 2011 to the French luxury group for \u20ac4.3 billion. He noted that many of Italy\u2019s best known fashion houses are still family-owned companies, with far smaller sales than their brand recognition would suggest.\u201cWe are now making steps to improve how the company is run, and all of that starts with our new choice of management,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need all-rounders and team players, especially in the fashion industry where some of the designers are totally crazy.\u201dAlongside Peter Dundas, who showed his first collection as creative director during Milan Fashion Week in September \u2014 to generally critical reviews \u2014 Roberto Cavalli has appointed as chief executive Renato Semerari, former president at the American perfume group Coty and European head of the LVMH-owned beauty chain Sephora.\u201cThis is the job of a lifetime but there is no short term solution here,\u201d Mr. Semerari said in Milan a few days before the show. \u201cThere is a lot of work to be done, starting an end to constant fire-fighting and better forward planning.\u201cWe may be working like crazy today but we are selling past collections,\u201d he continued. \u201cGaining good results will take time and any progress will only really be seen from the last quarter of next year.\u201dThere have been several very public fallouts between fashion brands and private equity organizations in the past, encapsulating the often uneasy relationship between art and commerce. But Mr. Semerari said he believes the partnership between Clessidra and Cavalli would be a fruitful one.He said his latest role appealed to him, in part, because of its \u201cvery Italian characters and human relationships involved.\u201d\u201cMr. Trapani has been a personal and professional friend for decades who has made a career from growing luxury business,\u201d Mr. Semerari added. \u201cHe knows more than anyone what it takes.\u201dMeanwhile Mr. Cavalli, who retained a 10 percent stake in the business he founded, is still both financially engaged and emotionally involved in its restructuring, the kind of continuing relationship that has led to difficulties in other fashion houses. But Mr. Semerari said: \u201cThis is his baby; he knows it better than anybody else and is committed to Cavalli remaining at the heart of the Italian fashion industry.\u201dThe focus in coming months will be on expanding product lines and the brand\u2019s geographical footprint, as well as streamlining operations. \u201cOur major priority is women\u2019s wear because that is where so many of our consumers already are,\u201d Mr. Trapani said. \u201cReady-to-wear is the big opportunity as we are currently very weak in that category and skewed towards cocktail and eveningwear. Then, we need to tackle handbags and shoes, where our performance at the moment is catastrophic.\u201d Mr. Semerari echoed the strategy, adding that men\u2019s wear would also need to be tackled, given its popularity in Asia \u2014 where the brand has no market profile. And although the consultancy Bain & Co. this month projected that global luxury sales will increase this year by just 1 percent, to \u20ac253 billion, in 2015, both men insist that they are bullish about Roberto Cavalli\u2019s prospects of becoming a global fashion powerhouse. \u201cThis is a more challenging environment but is also much for us to gain,\u201d Mr. Semerari continued. \u201cOur business is still so small there that things like currency swings and market contractions won\u2019t impact us as negatively as they would our larger rivals.\u201cAnd, as a result, the interest of private equity players in smaller Italian luxury houses is only likely to continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Nut Country\u2019 and \u2018Right Out of California\u2019", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhenever we\u2019re in danger of forgetting that the modern Republican Party is captive to a movement, one new excitement or another will jolt us back to reality \u2014 whether it is a trio of high-flying presidential candidates who\u2019ve collectively served not a single day in elective office or an uprising by congressional Jacobins giddily dethroning their own leader. Each new insurrection feels spontaneous even as it revives antique crusades to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, \u201cget rid\u201d of the Supreme Court or \u2014 most persistent of all \u2014 rejuvenate the Old South. Half a century before Rick Perry indicated secession might be an option for Texas, John Tower, the state\u2019s first Republican senator since Reconstruction, accepted the warm greeting of his new colleague, Senator Richard Russell, the Georgia segregationist, who reportedly said, \u201cI want to welcome Texas back into the Confederacy.\u201dTower is one of the more statesmanlike figures in \u201cNut Country,\u201d Edward H. Miller\u2019s well-researched and briskly written account of Dallas\u2019s transformation from Democratic stronghold to \u201cperfect test kitchen\u201d of a new politics of Republican protest that combined the libertarian cry for \u201cfreedom\u201d with the states\u2019 rights \u00admodel of constitutional order.A go-getting paradise with an economy enriched by government contracts (aerospace and defense), Dallas might seem a curious place for anti-Beltway insurgency. But dependency bred anxiety, and \u201cwealth and fear\u201d took form together, as the journalist Theodore H. White observed in 1954. The tide of newcomers, many from the Midwest, inhaled the fumes of \u201cTexanism,\u201d according to White \u201ca synthetic faith that lets them oppose all the controls and exactions of the federal government in Washington as an invasion of sacred and immemorial rights, while at the same time providing, with its frontier and vigilante memories, a complete answer to the newer problems of minorities, labor and the complexities of city living.\u201dOne of the new Dallas Republicans was Bruce Alger, a Princeton graduate and disciple of Ayn Rand, elected to the House of Representatives in 1954. Initially an Eisenhower supporter, he declined to sign the notorious \u201cSouthern manifesto,\u201d with its defiant sneer at civil rights, but soon became an \u201cartful champion of Jim Crow.\u201d In November 1960, four days before the presidential election, he led a group of 300 protesters who converged on a downtown Dallas hotel and accosted Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson when they entered the lobby. Television cameras captured the moment \u2014 along with Alger holding aloft a placard that read \u201cL.B.J. Sold Out to Yankee Socialists\u201d \u2014 helping to plant the image of Dallas as a \u201ccity of hate.\u201dAlger was a \u201cmoderate conservative,\u201d in Miller\u2019s taxonomy. His specialty was refining the crude dredged up by \u201cultraconservatives\u201d like the oil baron H.L. Hunt, who was reputedly the world\u2019s richest man in the mid-1950s, but was nevertheless inflamed with millenarian fears of a tax-happy federal government plunging the citizenry into serfdom. He spread the antigovernment gospel in the media operation he financed. It included a radio program, \u201cFacts Forum,\u201d picked up by 222 stations, a \u201cfree circulating collection of 20,000 books\u201d and a magazine, Facts Forum News, with 60,000 subscribers, more than either The New Republic or The \u00adNation.Big ideas were essential to the emerging movement. Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises and Russell Kirk were required reading, stocked in Dallas libraries, and the National Review theorist Willmoore Kendall left Yale for the University of Dallas. Ronald Reagan passed through, thrilling an audience of 10,000 in 1962 when he egged on President Kennedy to go harder after the Soviets. Meanwhile, the hometown crackpot W.A. Criswell (Hunt\u2019s pastor) thundered from his Baptist pulpit against the sins of integration, and Gen. Edwin Walker, relieved of his command in Germany after reports came back that he had been indoctrinating troops in the liturgy of the John Birch Society, returned to Texas in battered glory, like a hick Douglas MacArthur. Walker hoped to become governor, but had to settle for freelance demagogy, exhorting radio listeners to \u201cbring your flags, your tents and skillets\u201d to Oxford, Miss., where James Meredith, an African-American Air Force veteran, was trying to enroll at the University of Mississippi.Miller\u2019s account of ultras and so-called moderates jostling at the same ideological trough prefigures our own Republican moment, with its competition between \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders,\u201d all promising war on the feds, the differences coming down to shadings of stridency and flair. The only thing wrong with \u201cNut Country\u201d is its title, which trivializes a timely, intelligent, penetrating book. Miller, an assistant teaching professor at Northeastern University Global, explains that the epithet was the one Kennedy used to describe Dallas on the morning of Nov. 22, 1963 \u2014 the date when \u201ccity of hate\u201d assumed its darkest meaning. This isn\u2019t really fair. Lee Harvey Oswald, a Communist misfit from New Orleans (by way of the Bronx and Moscow), was anomalous by any measure. Nevertheless, he too drifted into the go-getter\u2019s sunstruck paradise, and his sick ambitions were fed by Texanism. His original target may have been General Walker.Kathryn S. Olmsted\u2019s \u201cRight Out of California\u201d tells a different story, set even earlier, during the Great Depression, when well-organized strikes (involving as many as 50,000 workers in 1933 alone) paralyzed giant agribusinesses in the Central and Imperial valleys and shut down first the docks and then the entire city of San Francisco. California had a long history of labor unrest, and the energized union movement touched deep-seated fears of Bolshevist revolution. The meliorist policies of the New Deal did too. Herbert Hoover, brooding in the exile of his \u201cmodernist mansion\u201d overlooking Stanford University, read 30 newspapers a day, each bearing clues to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s scheme to bankrupt the citizenry of their savings and their character. These suspicions were also staples of the Hearst press and The Los Angeles Times (an anarchist had bombed its news offices in 1910, killing 21 people). And they were made real by the big growers, corporately owned conglomerates whose \u201cfarms\u201d were spread over tens of thousands of acres in as many as 10 states \u2014 \u201cfactories in the fields\u201d tended by an immigrant proletariat, entire families from Mexico, China, Japan, the Philippines, paid as little as 10 or 15 cents an hour at a time when 25 cents was a typical minimum wage in the rest of the country. Worse, the workers had almost no bargaining power, since they were cut out of consideration in the National Industrial Recovery Act \u2014 part of Roosevelt\u2019s Faustian compact with Southern legislators, who demanded protection for planters and the legacy exploitations of a tenant-farm system rooted in the antebellum slave economy.Olmsted\u2019s vivid, accomplished narrative really belongs to the historiography of the left. Its heroes include Wobblies and Communist Party organizers, lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and honorable administrators like George Creel and Gen. Pelham Glassford, who intervened when they could, to varying effect. The strikers did achieve small victories, though they hardly offset the violence committed against them by hired thugs and vigilante mobs, often in collusion with law enforcement officials. In one instance, a lawyer was set upon by a mob on the steps of a county courthouse while a sheriff stood by.Olmsted, the chairwoman of the history department at the University of California, Davis, brightens this bleak picture with pages on the colony of bohemian leftists in Carmel, home to the aging muckraking legend Lincoln Steffens and his much younger wife, the Australian-born journalist Ella Winter. Their gifted prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Steinbeck soaked up the details of the giant cotton strikes in the San Joaquin Valley and recorded them in his popular novel \u201cIn Dubious Battle\u201d \u2014 which he first conceived as an almost documentary record, though he didn\u2019t visit the strike camps (instead relying on interviews). In the end he buffed and prettified the material, making it a fable of salt-of-the-earth whites, forerunners of the Okies in \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d when in fact 75 percent to 95 percent of the work force was Mexican. Olmsted\u2019s correctives are convincing, and she has also dug hard nuggets out of archives and newspaper morgues \u2014 crassly racist editorial commentary on the black poet Langston Hughes and news photos of Communist organizers bandaged and bloodied after a beating by the police.California\u2019s epic labor battles, Olmsted argues, created modern conservatism \u201cin its fullest form,\u201d the \u201canti-labor, anti-statist movement that dominates American politics today,\u201d its tendrils sunk deep in the soil of the field-factories, \u201cwhere racial conflict shaped political attitudes.\u201d But as her strong research shows, race and gender prejudice informed, or deformed, almost the whole of American social and cultural life in the 1930s and was as common on the left as on the right. She is doubtless correct that Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cdecision to erase brown-skinned people and women of all colors from the story\u201d was political, but the politics were those of a New Deal Democrat, as she notes, and the attitudes were shared by Washington administrators and liberal-minded journalists. They were reproduced as well in the fields, where white workers enforced their own rough-hewed segregation, hunkering in separate camps, eating at \u201cwhites only\u201d tables.This last datum was an omen of what was to come when working-class whites, lifted into prosperity \u2014 or at least out of immiseration \u2014 by the New Deal and World War II, anxiously pulled the ladder up behind them. It was the same fear, of someone or something lying in ambush, that haunted H.L. Hunt and the members of the Dallas Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs \u2014 a cry of helplessness against the predations of distant liberals writing laws in Washington. It was emotional protest more than ideological precept that breathed new life into the Republican Party and built the \u00adlongest-lasting majority since the New Deal. The tribunes of that majority came from California (Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan) and Texas (the George Bushes). They also happen to be the only Republicans elected president since 1960.

{"Headline": "End of Crude Oil Export Ban Is Possible", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, formed a quiet, persistent alliance as they sought to convince their colleagues that it was time to end a more than 40-year ban on crude oil exports.They turned the Senate floor into a symposium on the history of Nixon-era oil price controls. They offered up lectures on modern-day energy economics. They stressed the potential for using crude oil exports to increase American soft power \u2014 by limiting the reliance of American allies on oil-producing rivals like Iran and Russia.And they also regularly drew the anger of liberal senators who warned that lifting the ban would harm the environment and potentially raise energy costs in the United States.In the end, it seems, their efforts were an exemplar in soft-power legislating. After months of cajoling, Congress seems to be on the verge of lifting the crude oil export ban as part of a giant year-end spending and tax deal.As high-stakes negotiations on the spending and tax packages continued Thursday between congressional leaders and the Obama administration, the Senate approved an emergency stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown and give negotiators five more days to reach a deal.Meanwhile, an admonition by the White House press secretary suggested that Democrats and Republicans were still deadlocked over some politically charged policy prescriptions.Liberal supporters of the export ban have complained that ending it would harm the environment and hurt American consumers \u2014 an argument that has become more difficult to make at a time of relatively low gasoline prices. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized the push to lift the ban, but his remarks also focused on the need for extending tax credits for renewable energy \u2014 a signal that some sort of deal may be inevitable.Analysts often note that the debate around the crude oil export ban is extremely complicated \u2014 a point emphasized by the fact that while domestic oil production in the United States has risen sharply since 2009, by more than two million barrels per day, projections show that American imports of foreign oil will continue at a rate of six million to eight million barrels per day through 2040. This is largely because of differences in the types of crude oil, with excess amounts of light, sweet crude being produced in the United States while domestic refineries are designed to handle heavier, sour crude from abroad.At the energy committee hearing on Wednesday, several experts on global oil issues testified that lifting the crude oil export ban would be a positive step \u2014 even if the impact was relatively imperceptible at first because of current low prices.The limited immediate impact \u2014 and particularly the reduced chance that lifting the export ban would increase gasoline prices for American motorists \u2014 has made the prospect of ending the ban more politically palatable to the Obama administration and many Democrats and even some Republicans who feared a backlash should constituents see a rise in prices at the pump. In that sense, lifting the ban would deliver a long-sought policy victory for congressional Republicans at a time when many rank-and-file lawmakers are angry that Senate Democrats and the White House often block much of their legislative agenda.The Republican-controlled House has twice voted this fall to approve legislation that would end the crude oil export ban. Legislation proposed by Senators Murkowski and Heitkamp has yet to reach the Senate floor, but would not need to if their proposals are included in the year-end spending and tax deal.In her version of the legislation, Ms. Heitkamp had included provisions that might make a compromise with the White House easier, including a proposal that would give the president the authority to restrict exports for up to one year under certain circumstances and to extend those restrictions on an annual basis. Among the acceptable reasons for doing so would be national security threats, or a national emergency including an oil shortage or a spike in prices.Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, noted recent testimony by the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, who said a decrease in oil production was a drag on the economy. \u201cBoth on an economic and national security, and I might add, environmental basis,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said, \u201cthere\u2019s such a strong case for allowing U.S. export of oil.\u201dAt a policy forum in September, Ms. Heitkamp expressed optimism in the face of long odds. \u201cWhen we started over a year ago, everybody thought we were crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody told me, \u2018You are crazy to think this is going to happen in the short term.\u2019 I kept saying, \u2018I think we can get this done this year if we are willing to respond to some of the concerns, if we are willing to come to the table and actually negotiate.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why December Is Looking Likelier for the Fed to Raise Interest Rates", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementOne of these days, the Federal Reserve tells us, it will decide to raise interest rates. The announcement will be akin to a doctor\u2019s decision that a patient is well enough to be gradually taken off medication. The thinking inside the Fed is that the economy is finally healthy enough that borrowing costs should return to more \u201cnormal\u201d levels to help keep future inflation from accelerating too much. But it is a moment with challenges. It could send markets into a tizzy (if past experience is any guide), lead to a slower economic recovery and make it harder for workers to press for higher wages. For savers, it could signal higher returns, but those borrowing to buy a house or a car may soon have to pay more. The last time the Fed raised interest rates, in June 2006, Facebook was mainly for college students and had one-tenth the users of Myspace. Federal Funds Target Rate By pushing the rate to the floor, the Fed went as far as it could with its main tool for guiding the economy: setting a target range on the federal funds rate, or the amount banks charge each other for overnight loans. The rate is set by the central bank through its buying and selling of short-term Treasuries \u2013 i.o.u.s from the government \u2013 mostly in trades with commercial banks. The Fed used other means to prop up the economy, notably buying mortgage securities and other bonds to help bring down long-term rates further. The strategy, known as quantitative easing, encouraged more borrowing and lending, led to a stock market boom and, the Fed contends, eventually helped bring about a sustained economic expansion. Convinced that it has done as much as it considers prudent, the Fed is no longer expanding the size of its balance sheet, which reached $4.5 trillion. Still, while the economy has rebounded, certain aspects of the recovery \u2013 like the housing sector, work force participation, and hourly wages \u2013 are spotty at best. Since March, Fed officials have said they expect to raise interest rates sometime before the end of the year. The action will most likely be taken on Dec. 16. That\u2019s when the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed policy-making group that sets the target rate, concludes its next two-day meeting. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, is scheduled to hold a news conference that afternoon. (In the unlikely event that policy makers take no action, the next meeting dates are Jan. 26-27 and March 15-16.)Ever since March, when the Federal Open Market Committee dropped the word \u201cpatient\u201d from its stance on raising the benchmark rate, Fed policy makers have used a standard line to describe the conditions that would warrant a rate increase: On Sept. 17, after a two-day meeting, the committee decided not to change rates, citing market worries: Speaking on the same day, Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, who has previously opposed a rate increase this year, said \u201cthe precise timing for the first increase in the federal funds rate is less important to me than the path the funds rate will follow over the entire policy normalization process.\u201d He, like other Fed officials, stressed the need for a very gradual increase in rates. In recent months, there has seemed to be no lack of analysts, experts and would-be Fed chiefs ready to tell the Federal Open Market Committee what it should do. A sampling follows: \u201cCentral bank communications can be a tricky business.\u201d  Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed, was referring to a remark in 2013 by Ben S. Bernanke, who was the Fed chairman at that time.  The announcement had an instantaneous impact on markets that were caught off-guard after having grown accustomed to a Fed with an open wallet. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have learned their lesson from that episode, and have gone out of their way to provide plenty of advance warning about the coming rate increase. When rates eventually rise Ms. Yellen wants to make sure investors saw it coming. She has also made clear that future rate increases will be gradual, about one percentage point per year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Markets Were Flat in 2015. Thank Goodness.", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking StockName a financial asset \u2014 any financial asset. How did it do in 2015?The answer, in all likelihood: Meh.It might have made a little money. It might have lost a little money. But, barring any drastic moves in the final trading days of 2015, the most widely held classes of assets, including stocks and bonds across the globe, were basically flat. In the United States, for example, a whopping 1.98 percent return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s stock index (including reinvested dividends) as of the Dec. 28 closing price was roughly matched by a 1.07 percent return on intermediate-term Treasury bonds.While that may be disappointing news for people who hoped to see big returns from at least some portion of their portfolio, it is excellent news for anyone who wants to see a steady global economic expansion without new bubbles and all the volatility that can bring.Emerging market stocks and high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds were the exception \u2014 they experienced an outright correction \u2014 and are interesting in their own way. But for all the economic and financial developments in 2015 \u2014 the onset of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, a long-awaited interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, an economic slowdown in China and a sharp drop in the stock markets in August \u2014 the most widely held investments are ending the year at peace.One way of thinking of what happened in 2015 goes like this: From the spring of 2009 until 2014, a furious rally in virtually all assets proceeded with only a few interruptions because it was spurred along by interventions by global central banks.Part of the explicit point of the Federal Reserve buying up $3.5 trillion in bonds over that five-year period \u2014 essentially taking the supply of safe assets like Treasury bonds off the market \u2014 was to encourage investors to push money into other, riskier assets.Those actions succeeded in encouraging investors to tolerate less compensation for taking on risk. That is, their actions drove up stock market prices much faster than the underlying earnings of the companies were rising. In the fall of 2011, $1,000 invested in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 bought $78 in annual earnings. Now, the same $1,000 buys $54 in earnings.The efforts by the central banks succeeded at getting investors comfortable with taking risks again. But they haven\u2019t succeeded in getting a full-throated economic expansion going. Growth has remained in the 2.5 percent ballpark in the United States and slower than that in Europe and Japan.Any future gains for stocks will happen because the economy is growing and companies are thereby making more money, not just because investors have been persuaded to accept ever-lower returns for taking on investment risk.What does this mean for 2016? Whether investors in the stock market and other risky investments win or lose depends less than in recent years on what happens at the Federal Reserve in Washington or the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Future returns will depend on whether 2016 is finally the year that all that interventionism starts to translate into higher incomes, more spending and greater profits in the real economy, not just the financial one.Advertisement"}

Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who wrote the script with Mark L. Smith, fills that vessel to near overflowing, specifically by amplifying Glass with a vague, gauzily romantic past life with an unnamed Pawnee wife (Grace Dove) seen in elliptical flashback. By the time the movie opens, the wife is long dead, having been murdered by white troops, and Glass\u2019s son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), has become his close companion. The son\u2019s name evokes James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s Hawk-eye (\u201cThe Last of the Mohicans\u201d), and together Glass and Hawk create an intimate, familial bulwark \u2014 and a multicultural father-and-son dyad \u2014 in a wilderness teeming with assorted savages.I thought of that artfully boiling blood while watching \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d with its butchered animals, muddled ideas, heart-skippingly natural landscapes and moment after moment of visual and narrative sizzle. What makes too many of his moments, ghastly and grand \u2014 an arrow piercing a man\u2019s throat, the beatific face of a beloved, a man scooping the innards out of a fallen horse, the enveloping softness of the dusk light \u2014 isn\u2019t the moment itself, but that little something special that he adds to it, whether it\u2019s a gurgle of blood in a throat or the perfectly lighted sheen of a hunk of offal. Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu isn\u2019t content to merely seduce you with ecstatic beauty and annihilating terror; he wants to blow your mind, to amp up your art-house experience with blockbusterlike awesomeness.From Davy Crockett to Kit Carson, the mountain man has long had a hold on the American imagination and recently made a revisionist appearance in the form of Katniss Everdeen, the heroine of \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d The mountain men in \u201cThe Revenant\u201d are drawn along more traditional and masculine lines, from their bushy beards to the buckskins and bulky furs that at times make them look almost indistinguishable from the animals they kill. Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is entranced by this world, with its glories and miseries, its bison tartare and everyday primitivism, which he scrupulously recreates with detail and sweep. He\u2019s particularly strong whenever Glass, employing that old can-do pragmatism, goes into survivalist mode to cauterize a wound, catch a fish or find shelter.But Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu blows it when he moves from the material to the mystical and tries to elevate an ugly story into a spiritual one, with repeated images of a spiral and even a flash of homespun magical realism. Worse, he makes Glass not just a helpless witness to a murder that\u2019s a stand-in for the genocide of the Indians, but also a proxy victim of that catastrophe. It\u2019s disappointing in a movie that offers much and that actually points to another foundation story that emerges when one of Glass\u2019s companions, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), tries and fails to get paid for his labor. He learns too late that the system that turns people and animals into commodities is rigged against men like him. And while the simple facts of that system may be too brutal to feed the ambitions of a movie like \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d we know that the system nevertheless helped build a nation.\u201cThe Revenant\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult companion).

{"Headline": "To Achieve Paris Climate Goals, U.S. Will Need New Laws", "Date": "2015-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRevaluedThe climate agreement reached in Paris last weekend has been hailed as a landmark in the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it could well turn out to be one.But the accord\u2019s lofty goals won\u2019t be achieved without large corporations making big changes. And while many companies have welcomed the deal and voluntarily pledged to cut emissions, the sweeping reforms required to avert a sharp rise in global temperatures will almost certainly require substantial new government regulations.In the United States, the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2025. To achieve that, the Obama administration is being forced to count mainly on several laws that are already on the books, rather than pursue new regulation.Another pillar of the administration\u2019s plan is the enforcement of increasingly tight fuel efficiency standards. Already enacted by Congress, these rules force automakers to make a gallon of gasoline go further over time. Industrial manufacturers are also required to make appliances progressively use less energy. But falling gasoline prices and the renewed popularity of less efficient S.U.V.s have blunted fuel efficiency gains.But these initiatives affect only a few industries, namely utilities, automakers and, to a lesser extent, industrial companies. Big consumer goods manufacturers, for example, might face higher energy costs in coming years, but are for the most part being spared any new climate regulation for now.\u201cThe United States would need to regulate new sources and sectors of the American economy, particularly U.S. manufacturing, if the president\u2019s target is to be met,\u201d Mr. Banks wrote.One approach that could deliver significant gains, and be introduced on a national scale and across industries, is a carbon tax, or carbon cap-and-trade system, which would establish a price for carbon emissions. California has a cap-and-trade program, as do a growing number of other countries. But national efforts have not gained traction in Congress.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a big-business advocate, dismissed the goals set in Paris. \u201cNone of the commitments made, including those by the U.S., are binding, and many aren\u2019t even complete,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cMoreover, Congress must appropriate any funds that the Obama administration has pledged.\u201dThe administration has set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years, and it may well make some progress with the laws that are on the books. But so long as Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over climate policy, regulations that would prompt reforms throughout American business are likely to remain a pipe dream.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen\u2019s New Hat: Risk Manager", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyJanet Yellen is many things: an economist, a regulator, the chief administrator of a sprawling government agency. Her decision to raise interest rates Wednesday, however, shows her wearing a different hat: risk manager.The quarter-point increase to the Fed\u2019s target for rates may have been as long-awaited, intensively discussed and thoroughly telegraphed a monetary policy action as any in history. So much so that after seven years of having the interest rate target near zero, the quarter-point rise was a little anticlimactic. Ms. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, exuded confidence about the strength of the country\u2019s economic expansion, describing the rate rise as a reflection of the economy\u2019s having come, in her words, \u201ca long way\u201d as it marches steadily toward full health.One major risk is that the announcement will turn out to be a \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d moment for the Fed. Maybe the struggling global economy will hold back the United States more than Ms. Yellen expects, inflation will remain well below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, and it\u2019ll have to reverse course, as have several global counterparts that have raised interest rates prematurely in the last few years.Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.So one argument is that the Fed should have waited until inflation was more clearly rising before taking its foot off the accelerator of the United States economy.As the central bank\u2019s chief risk manager, Ms. Yellen was persuaded by a different sort of danger.If the Fed had waited another several months, to the point where the economy was at real risk of overheating, with inflation rising significantly, it may have needed to increase rates sharply to try to head it off. And when moving quickly, there would surely be bigger disruptions to financial markets and greater risk of miscalibration and raising rates too much, choking off the economy altogether.\u201cSuch an abrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession,\u201d Ms. Yellen said Wednesday afternoon.By tightening the money supply now, the Fed can move more gradually, taking time to see how higher rates affect the expansion and whether inflation really is returning to normal. The baseline scenario, based on communications the Fed published Wednesday, appears to be that the central bank will raise rates another quarter percentage point every other meeting in 2016, getting short-term interest rates to just shy of 1.5 percent a year from now.But the Yellen Fed is explicitly holding out the possibility of slowing that down if inflation doesn\u2019t pick up. \u201cIf incoming data led us to call into question the inflation forecast that we have set out,\u201d she said in a news conference, \u201cthat would certainly give the committee pause.\u201dThat\u2019s the rate-increase rationale that she\u2019s willing to talk about publicly. There are two other dimensions of risk management that lurk in the background.First, she cannot make decisions unilaterally; she is only the first among equals as chairwoman of the Fed\u2019s policy committee. So keeping as many of her colleagues on board with her policies is important in wielding power. Wednesday\u2019s action shows her colleagues who have been itching to raise rates for some time \u2014 some of them out of fear that they are fueling financial bubbles \u2014 that she is responsive. It buys some credibility to keep the path of rate rises a shallow one if she believes it is warranted in 2016 and beyond.Second, while the Fed makes its decisions apart from politics, officials there would rather not make a major policy pivot in the heat of a presidential campaign. By starting a rate increase cycle now, before primary voters start going to the polls, they don\u2019t have to pull the trigger for the first time when their actions are more likely to become a political football.There can be no assurance that the Yellen Fed has made the right move; certainly, smart economists at places like the International Monetary Fund believe that patience would have been rewarded.There are always economic risks out there.

The projection contrasts sharply with emissions growth that averaged 2.4 percent a year over the last decade, and sometimes topped 3 percent.Past emissions declines have usually been linked to economic distress, such as the global financial panic of 2009 and the Russian economic meltdown of the late 1990s.But the experts with the Global Carbon Project said they did not consider that to be likely.Instead, emissions growth may resume as the Chinese economy recovers from a period of slow growth and as India pursues a plan to double its burning of coal in power plants, part of a program to bring 300 million poor villagers onto the power grid.\u201cEmissions in India are at the same level as China in the 1990s,\u201d said Glen P. Peters, an analyst with a climate center in Oslo who spoke at a news conference here. Dr. Peters added that in coming years, India \u201ccould actually dominate the global growth in the way that China has done in the past.\u201dStill, there is some hope that emissions growth in coming years will be slower than in the last decade, Dr. Peters and other experts said, especially as countries start acting on climate pledges they have made this year.China accounts for more than a quarter of the world\u2019s industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, and the new figures reflect broad shifts in the Chinese economy that led to lower emissions growth in 2014, as well as a likelihood of declining emissions in 2015.Chinese growth has slowed markedly, the country is transitioning toward a service economy, and it is pushing hard on renewable power as a way to limit greenhouse gases.But China\u2019s consumption of coal grew by almost threefold from 2000 to 2013, and it now consumes about half the coal used worldwide.The Chinese government cleared away some doubts about the reliability of its energy data when it recently released sharply revised statistics that showed that coal consumption between 2000 and 2013, measured by energy content, was almost 10 percent higher than previously thought.That upward revision has made the recent slowdown in coal demand appear even starker, and reinforced the conviction of some experts that Chinese demand has peaked or soon will.In the first 10 months of this year, China\u2019s coal production fell 3.6 percent compared with the same time last year, a state planning official, Liang Weiliang, said this month.\u201cWe must be fully prepared for the eventuality that clean energy will not only take up the growth in energy consumption, but will also increasingly displace current stocks\u201d of power plants, Mr. Liang said at a meeting of coal traders.The Chinese government has vowed that emissions will stop growing by about 2030, although the recent slowdown has convinced more scientists that a peak by about 2025 is feasible.But others argue that China\u2019s appetite for coal will revive when the economy picks up, even if the days of double-digit growth are over. Despite the Communist Party leaders\u2019 vows to clean up air pollution, local governments have promoted plans to build many more coal-fired power plants. This year, 155 proposed plants have received preliminary or full approval, said a recent report by Greenpeace East Asia.\u201cThere is the shifting structure of the economy and the shifting structure of energy consumption, but it\u2019s also the low point in an economic cycle,\u201d Zou Ji, a deputy director general of China\u2019s National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that we\u2019re near a peak.\u201dEven if China\u2019s coal demand keeps falling, its growing demand for oil and gas are likely to continue driving overall carbon dioxide emissions upward, although more slowly than before, Wang Tao, a researcher on energy and climate change issues at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said in an interview.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising if we\u2019re talking about a reduction in coal consumption, but overall emissions would be another issue,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s likely it will be bumping back. We will probably still maintain a lower growth rate of emissions for maybe years to come.\u201dJustin Gillis reported from Le Bourget, and Chris Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Report Adds to Brazil\u2019s Mounting Woes", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 It keeps getting messier.And then, on Tuesday, Brazil reported its worst economic performance in two decades.The jailing of such powerful figures is creating even more gridlock in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, as congressional leaders engulfed in the scandal stymie President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s attempts to win approval for austerity measures. In turn, the uncertainty over Ms. Rousseff\u2019s own political survival and her government\u2019s leadership of the economy is deepening the crisis of confidence in the nation.Investment plummeted 15 percent in the quarter from the same period a year earlier. If current trends persist into 2016, as many economists forecast, Brazil could face its first consecutive years of economic contraction since 1929-30.Brazil \u201cis now mutating into an outright economic depression,\u201d said Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs, in a report analyzing the gross domestic product figures. Mr. Ramos said he expected Brazil\u2019s economy to shrink at least 2.3 percent in 2016 after shrinking 3.6 percent this year.\u201cWhat I would give for the economy to be where it was a few years ago,\u201d said Maria Souza Santos, 43, a hairdresser who recently lost her job at a salon in the beachfront district of Copacabana here after sales plummeted about 40 percent in the space of a few months. She said she was trying to make ends meet by cutting the hair of clients in their homes. \u201cI\u2019m struggling,\u201d said Ms. Souza Santos, \u201cbut so many people are in the same situation.\u201dWith the unemployment rate rising to 8.9 percent in the third quarter from 6.8 percent in the same period last year, economists are quarreling over whether the austerity policies Ms. Rousseff and her finance minister, Joaquim Levy, have been able to carry out despite Congress are making the downturn even more painful.While low commodities prices are curbing economic growth around Latin America, Brazil ranks among the region\u2019s worst-performing economies. Officials are now trying to gradually unwind policies in which they used a web of giant state banks and public energy companies to promote economic growth.On the bright side, some economists noted that Brazil\u2019s economy remained on relatively stronger footing than in periods preceding a radical restructuring of the economy in the 1990s. Before then, hyperinflation ravaged consumers as the country limped from one stabilization plan to the next. \u201cBrazil is facing a very complicated situation, but we are not expecting a solvency crisis,\u201d said Alessandra Ribeiro, an economist at Tend\u00eancias, a consulting firm in S\u00e3o Paulo.Still, the contemplation of such possibilities offers little solace to Brazilians as the economic crisis takes its toll. The spectacle of the police arresting powerful figures has reinforced the view among many that Brazil\u2019s leaders squandered the nation\u2019s good fortune.\u201cThe government should have seen this crisis coming, and prepared better for it,\u201d she said.Mariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro, and Paula Moura from Po\u00e7o Fundo, Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jet.com\u2019s Strategy: Low Prices, Fast Delivery, Happy Workers", "Date": "2015-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYou can\u2019t accuse Jet.com of timidity.The start-up is making an audacious bet to establish itself as a major force in the $350 billion United States e-commerce market. To succeed, Jet must offer good selection, low prices and fast delivery \u2014 all the things online buyers demand yet few retailers can provide. The graveyard of e-commerce hopefuls is crowded. If Jet stumbles it will end up like the flash-sales site Fab, which burned through $325 million before being sold for less than a tenth of that early this year.Jet has had some bumps and turns since last summer, when it began selling products as varied as cans of chili, exercise bikes and WowWee personal robots. It changed its business model, dropping a membership fee. It is burning through cash as it continues to scale up, now with more than 900 employees. When it went out to raise more money in the fall, it encountered skepticism. A week before Christmas, it told some customers they would not get their orders in time. Jet said only about 500 shipments out of a million were affected, but such admissions never look good.Yet Marc Lore, Jet\u2019s founder and chief executive, says he is not worried. What will separate Jet from Fab and every other failed company, he says, is happiness. In particular, employee happiness.\u201cI\u2019m constantly asking people at Jet if they\u2019re happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for me to know that they love working here and think this is the best place they\u2019ve ever worked.\u201dJet supplies its employees with typical start-up perks like free food (weekly lunches, plus Red Bull in the refrigerator and protein powder in the kitchen cabinet), four months of paid parental leave, unlimited vacation and an ownership stake that could one day be worth a lot. But it also has some decidedly less common policies, like standardized, no-negotiation pay packages and worker-friendly employment agreements. Employees can see, every day, how the business is doing.\u201cTransparency\u201d is a big word with Mr. Lore. So is \u201cfairness.\u201d Make people feel good, he says, and they will do their best. Trust them and they will reward you.Other executives have the same idea, even if they do not quite express it in those terms. As the start-up scene moves from hot to lukewarm, there is a dawning sense that new companies need to think about the long term even as they are still struggling to establish themselves.\u201cMany Silicon Valley companies are built on a culture of momentum, which can mask a lot of troubles,\u201d said Michael Fertik, founder of Reputation.com, a reputation management company that started in 2006. \u201cThen, when the momentum slows, the company is much larger, and the original mission, the original culture, has been diluted. Employees are no longer sure they are working for a place that works for them.\u201dThe solution championed by Mr. Fertik and others is creating \u201ca durable culture.\u201d That task often falls to someone called the chief people officer, usually working directly with the chief executive.The tools of the chief people officer are not necessarily better benefits or even raises. \u201cWe don\u2019t simply want to console people with money,\u201d explained Deena Gianoncelli, Jet\u2019s chief people officer.Money still drives the culture, however. And there has never been more money at stake than now. The number of unicorns \u2014 start-ups that are worth more than a billion dollars, a list that includes Jet \u2014 has more than tripled in the last two years, according to CB Insights, a research company. Converting these hundreds of billions in paper wealth into something of permanent value is a task, some argue, that will demand everything the employees can give, and perhaps more.Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook and now chief executive of a start-up called Asana, says that attitude is counterproductive. He says he would have been a more effective leader at Facebook if he had gotten more rest and taken better care of himself.As the holiday shopping season was beginning in late November, Mr. Lore convened his top executives in Jet\u2019s Hoboken, N.J., headquarters for their regular weekly meeting. Here are some of the things that were not on the agenda: warehouse logistics, customer concerns, fine-tuning prices, potential shipping bottlenecks, supplier issues or any of a dozen other topics that could have bedeviled Jet\u2019s first December.Instead, the executives discussed the mood and well-being of Jet\u2019s employees.The preliminary results of Jet\u2019s first \u201cHappiness Pulse\u201d were in. More than 500 employees responded to the survey, which means basically everyone who had been at Jet for at least a month. Two-thirds of them said they viewed Jet favorably. Only 4 percent had a negative opinion.\u201cSo only 25 people are basically unhappy,\u201d Mr. Lore said.\u201cWe have an opportunity to keep pushing these people into the \u2018favorable\u2019 bucket,\u201d Ms. Gianoncelli said.The executives chewed over the results in individual categories, which were presented by the survey company as scores: Jet got an 87 out of 100 as a company the employees would recommend as a great place to work, a 90 for letting people feel their work was important, and 87 for its managers. The results included not just the engineers and executives in Hoboken, but also packers in Jet\u2019s three warehouses and the customer service people in Salt Lake City.\u201cThese are not numbers you would expect out of an hourly work force,\u201d said Nate Faust, the chief operating officer. Warehouse workers, who start at $13 an hour plus stock options, said things like this: \u201cI can finally wake up & not say in my head \u2018ughhh another work day.\u2019\u201dThe conversation briefly spun off into a discussion about the nature of happiness. Do people compare their happiness to an absolute, or is it relative? Can someone be somewhat dissatisfied and yet appreciate this might be as good as it is going to get?\u201cInsert appropriate joke about marriage here,\u201d said Liza Landsman, the chief customer officer.Beyond the scores, the survey generated about a thousand anonymous comments. They were generally favorable but included qualms and complaints, suggesting that pervasive workplace happiness was an elusive or perhaps impossible ideal.\u201cI feel empowered to make decisions. But my boss and 20 other people are empowered to overrule them,\u201d one worker wrote. Another said, \u201cI would recommend Jet as a great place to work ... only to those who thrive in unstructured environments.\u201dA third worker, however, was enthusiastic: \u201cCompanies over the years have lost the management/employee connection to the point where base-level positions are extremely dispensable. With Jet however that does not seem to be the case.\u201dJet\u2019s worst overall score was for work-life balance. It got a 69, which was only one point above the survey company\u2019s benchmark.\u201cYou always get slammed on that,\u201d Mr. Lore said, referring to the inherent contradiction of trying to do something worthwhile that is all-consuming while holding on to the rest of life. One employee caught some of this tension when he commented in his survey response that working at Jet has been the best 14 months of his career, but not the happiest.Mr. Lore still hopes to achieve happiness for all. It is the right thing to do, he says. But it is also a business strategyBy Jet\u2019s logic, it has a chance to thrive in the long term only if it has the smartest and most motivated employees \u2014 and if it can prevent them from fleeing at the first sign of trouble.One way Jet hopes to encourage employees to stay is to make it very easy for them to leave.Tech companies can be jealous masters. They worry so much about losing employees, particularly the crucial software engineers, that a decade ago Apple made anti-poaching deals with several competitors. The companies agreed not to solicit one another\u2019s workers, which was illegal. The resulting class-action lawsuit by the aggrieved employees was settled for $415 million.Jet employees can quit today and go work for a competitor tomorrow and hire friends from Jet the day after. Jet has no clawback provision, in which signing bonuses or moving expenses must to be repaid if the worker quits before a certain date.\u201cJet\u2019s contract strongly signals that it has put thought into recruitment, retention and employee satisfaction, which in turn triggers motivation and performance,\u201d said Orly Lobel, a professor of employment and labor law at the University of San Diego. \u201cEven the more casual language used in some of the clauses, which is not typical for legal contracts, has the branding strategy of a good workplace that understands its human capital is the key to its success, and there has been thought put into how to convey that.\u201dAnd then there is transparency.In an interview a few weeks after Jet\u2019s official debut in July, Mr. Lore pulled out his phone and opened an app. It showed that Jet sold $667,200 in gross merchandise value in one day, up 89 percent in a month. Jet had 6,100 first-time buyers the previous day, and 7,800 orders. The company had $153 million in cash. The app is bulging with data, and it is available to investors and the salaried \u2014 but not the hourly \u2014 employees.Some information is available even to casual visitors. Dominating one wall in the reception area in Hoboken is a board posting constant updates of the day\u2019s sales by number and dollar volume. For technology companies, this is radical openness.\u201cThe downside of transparency is that it invites people to sensationalize,\u201d Mr. Lore said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get burned once in a while.\u201d Jet\u2019s warning to customers about the delayed holiday shipments might be a case in point. While the company said it was an industrywide problem, the news quickly rocketed around the Internet. (Jet said Wednesday that the majority of the 500 vulnerable shipments had been delivered.)Also radical is a practice to keep salaries the same for jobs grouped together, a process called \u201cleveling.\u201d This is meant to rule out the common ploy \u201cI got a job offer, can you match it?\u201d Extroverts who promote themselves and introverts who keep their heads down are paid the same for jobs of the same value to the company.That kind of transparency in salaries might not appeal to everyone \u2014 especially competitive types who are attracted to the risk and energy of a start-up. It is also unclear how practical it is in the long term. But Mr. Lore says it is crucial to fairness.Mr. Lore is 44, bald, soft-spoken. In 2005, he was a founder of the site Diapers.com, which became an e-commerce success. He sold the company, then called Quidsi, to Amazon in 2010 for $545 million, after a brutal price war. Amazon continues to run it as a separate e-commerce site. Mr. Lore left Quidsi in 2013 and began Jet the next year. More than two dozen Quidsi employees have followed him to Jet.While Mr. Lore is bland in his references to Amazon, the e-commerce kingpin that Jet is trying to compete with, he openly criticizes Wall Street, where he once worked.\u201cI saw that it didn\u2019t matter how you treated people, you just paid them enough so you didn\u2019t care if you burned them out, and then you got new people and burned them out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an environment of very short-term thinking.\u201d\u201cThe social norm at every company is to be available 24 by 7,\u201d says Caralyn Cooley, Jet\u2019s vice president for talent operations. \u201cMy willingness to accept that made me very successful.\u201dMs. Cooley rose through the ranks at Honeywell, PepsiCo and then, as a mother of twins, Amazon, where she managed dozens of human resources specialists.Then came her breaking point, she said. Her husband, a teacher, usually picked up the children from day care. A few times her sister did. And then one day Ms. Cooley fetched them, and the day care employee called out to them, \u201cYour aunt is here!\u201d Ms. Cooley had to correct her, \u201cNo, I\u2019m their mother.\u201d When she got to her car she cried.\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized I was giving too much,\u201d said Ms. Cooley, 36. She rearranged her schedule, picked up her children more often, and then switched to a new job at Amazon. At Jet, she starts early and usually gets home in time for dinner.Maybe, like most start-ups, Jet will fail, and the energy and money spent developing an employee-focused culture will have been pointless. The company has had doubters in the news media, but it says it is doing well, with two million customers and, in mid-December, its first $2.5 million revenue day. \u201cWe think they are going to be a winner in the cost-conscious consumables market,\u201d said Gene Munster, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray.Whatever its fate, Jet is anticipating a different era.A few years ago, a miserable employee had to suffer in silence. Now, thanks to Facebook, the employer-rating site Glassdoor and other social media sites, a company\u2019s culture is increasingly on display.The view is often dismal: Deloitte Consulting said in its annual survey of workplace trends that half of workers would not recommend their employer.All of this, in turn, leads to high turnover that hurts the bottom line. Some analysts now think that might be changing as the recession moves further into the past and hiring becomes more competitive.\u201cEighteen months ago, we started to see a shift, where companies were focusing less on pure productivity and lean operations,\u201d said Stacia Garr, a vice president at Deloitte. \u201cThey know the economy is improving, that employees have more options, and are devising strategies to engage and retain them.\u201dAs Ms. Gianoncelli and Ms. Cooley try to create a durable culture for what may or may not be a durable company, sometimes the more important factor is not whether employees will stay, but whether they should be hired in the first place. Jet is hiring 50 people a week.An analytics applicant came into Jet for an interview. In some ways he was a model candidate, smart and driven. But he did not score high in the \u201cplays well with others\u201d category. Asked to talk about a recent project in which he was a member of a team, he could not think of any. His prospects immediately diminished to zero.\u201cHe could have fit in somewhere else,\u201d Ms. Cooley said. But he was not for Jet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thailand's Fear of Free Speech", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSince it seized power in a military coup in 2014, Thailand\u2019s military junta, led by Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, has become increasingly obsessed with controlling public debate. This reached absurd proportions on Wednesday, when the Thai police announced they were investigating United States Ambassador Glyn Davies for possible violation of the country\u2019s l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws that make royal insult a crime.The investigation focuses on remarks Mr. Davies made last month reiterating the United States\u2019 concern about efforts by the junta to curb free speech, specifically the \u201clengthy and unprecedented prison sentences\u201d given to civilians by Thai military courts for violating the same l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws. The government should know that its decision to investigate Mr. Davies only confirms the truth of what he said.And there is no way his well-founded criticism of the draconian efforts to curb freedom of expression can be construed as insulting to King Bhumibol Adulyadej. In fact, Mr. Davies praised the king in his remarks. But the king is 88 and ailing, and the junta appears intent on maintaining an iron grip at least until after a royal succession.The junta has come down hard on critics. Media outlets have been raided and journalists, along with academics and politicians, have been sent to camps for \u201cattitude adjustment.\u201d Some of those arrested have disappeared. People have been sentenced to decades in prison for Facebook posts, and the military apparently has plans to reduce Internet traffic to a single gateway it can control.Meanwhile, Thailand\u2019s once robust economy is floundering, and crime has risen sharply in Bangkok. Farmers \u2013 half the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas \u2013 are suffering after the worst drought in decades, and a third of the country is living with water rationing.The junta is also embroiled in a corruption scandal involving Rajabhakti Park, a lavish site it built to honor Thailand\u2019s kings. And, on Thursday, the top investigator into Thailand\u2019s human trafficking rings, Maj. Gen. Paween Pongsirin, announced that he had fled to Australia, where he will seek asylum. He said he feared for his safety after exposing collusion between crime syndicates and Thai authorities.The best way for General Prayuth to calm growing public frustration, and address the legitimate concerns of the United States and other allies, is to tackle Thailand\u2019s lagging economy, clean up corruption in the military\u2019s ranks and make progress toward drafting a constitution and holding elections for a transition to civilian rule, as the junta has promised. Open public debate is essential to that process.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Inquiry Into Russian Jet Crash Finds No Proof of Terrorism", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe government\u2019s chief investigator, Ayman al-Muqaddam, said he had not received \u201cany evidence of unlawful interference or terrorist activity\u201d in connection with the crash, which occurred when a jetliner packed with Russian vacationers broke up in midair 23 minutes after takeoff from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board.Although the statement offered ample detail about the investigation, such as the number of hours that investigators spent photographing the wreckage, and the number of helicopter trips they took to the remote site, it offered little explanation about the actual cause of the crash.Russian and Western officials have been far less hesitant, pointing to a bomb as the most likely explanation. The Islamic State, which has an affiliate in Sinai, has claimed responsibility and published a photograph of an improvised explosive device it says was used.Egypt is leading the multinational investigation into the crash, and its publication of the preliminary report on Monday met with a curt response from Russia. Both Russia and Britain have stopped all flights to Sharm el Sheikh until their concerns about security at the resort\u2019s international airport are resolved.A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to comment on the Egyptian report but pointedly reminded reporters that Russia\u2019s security services had \u201ccome to the conclusion that it was a terrorist action.\u201dFrom the start, the Egyptian-led investigation has been mired in a fog of secrecy, misinformation and contradictions.Apparently unwilling to publicly concede that terrorists may have penetrated such a sensitive target, Egyptian officials repeatedly ruled out a bomb as a possible cause. Pro-government news media outlets have consistently painted the assertions of terrorism as part of what they called a nefarious Western plot to weaken the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\u201cAll of these people are misleading us,\u201d said Abdel Rahim Ali, a television host and frequent booster for Mr. Sisi, referring to critics of Monday\u2019s vaguely worded report. \u201cThis is part of a conspiracy to divide the region, like what happened in Syria and Iraq.\u201dA Russian flight crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt on Oct. 31, killing all 224 people on board. Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane.As tourists deserted Egypt after the Russian crash, Western officials identified a number of serious security flaws at the Sharm el Sheikh airport, including faulty scanning equipment and inattentive baggage checkers, all of which could have made it easier for militants to smuggle a bomb onto the plane.On Monday, Egyptian officials stressed their intention to hire foreign officials to improve security at airports across the country.This time, though, the risks for Egypt are different. Egyptian officials seem caught between a desire to deny the possibility that the Islamic State\u2019s Sinai affiliate could have hit such a sensitive target, and the pressing need to assuage the security concerns of foreign allies like Britain and Russia. Their tourist dollars constitute an important part of the faltering Egyptian economy.Egypt is suffering a shortage of foreign currency, and a ban on flights by Britain and Russia into Sharm el Sheikh is costing the country roughly $280 million a month, the tourism minister, Hisham Zaazou, said this month.Large tour operators in Europe that sell winter breaks in Egypt have diverted customers to other destinations such as Cyprus and the Canary Islands. Mr. Zaazou said he expected tourism revenue to drop by 15 percent in 2015, to $6.2 billion, because of the crisis.Russian officials initially denied Islamic State claims that it had felled the plane in retaliation for the Russia air campaign in Syria. But on Nov. 17 the Kremlin security chief blamed terrorism and offered a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators.President Vladimir V. Putin vowed to hunt down those responsible, although he did not blame any specific group.Now, the wreckage from the airplane, an Airbus A321, which had been strewn over a 10-mile radius in the Sinai Desert, has been moved to a secure location in Cairo for further examination by metallurgists and others specialists, Egyptian investigators said Monday. But the report did not explore assertions by Russian officials that they had discovered traces of explosives on portions of the wreckage.Terrorism experts could not confirm the veracity of the photograph, but noted that a midair breakup, caused by a rapid decompression, would be consistent with a bomb. Other causes, such as mechanical failure, were still possible although now appear less likely.Amina Ismail contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

Each of you \u2014 if you\u2019ll forgive me for speaking to you this way in your body \u2014 each of you has an obligation to seize the opportunity that the sacrifices made in the Maidan, the sacrifices of the Heavenly Hundred. Each of you has an obligation to answer the call of history and finally build a united, democratic Ukrainian nation that can stand the test of time.\u201dFor Mr. Biden, who has made it his mission to nurse Ukraine through its transition, it was a classic performance from the lectern in the grand chamber of Parliament, known here as the Rada. At times, he shouted at the lawmakers, gesturing sharply. At other points, he practically whispered. At still other moments, he wagged his finger.Citing John Adams, Thomas Paine, Edmund Burke and Daniel Webster, Mr. Biden talked about the United States\u2019 own struggles to build democracy. He also cited a quotation from an American politician he did not identify: \u201cIn your heart, you know it\u2019s right,\u201d he said. (The phrase is actually a variation of a slogan in an ad made for the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964.)\u201cRussia has violated these ground rules and continues to violate them,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, Russia\u2019s occupying sovereign Ukrainian territory. Let me be crystal clear: The United States does not, has not, never will recognize Russia\u2019s attempt to annex Crimea.\u201dHow Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.But his main message to the Ukrainians was, in effect, to get their house in order. The day before, he had suggested that many in Europe were waiting for Ukraine to fail so that they would have an excuse not to continue confronting Russia.With Ukraine\u2019s rapidly sinking economy, that time often seems close at hand.The gross domestic product per capita, a broad measure of Ukrainians\u2019 well-being, will be just $1,600 per person this year, down from $3,900 in 2013. That was the year before the new government took power partly on the promise of bringing living standards closer to those in Europe.Over all, Ukraine\u2019s gross domestic product is projected to shrink by 15 percent this year after falling 6.8 percent the year before, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s, the ratings agency. Much of the drop is attributable to a collapse in the value of the national currency, the hryvnia, and to uncertainty created by the conflict with Russia.And Ukraine remains one of the world\u2019s most indebted countries, trailing only the Seychelles, according to one estimate.\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle to see who will invest in this economy, who will commit to put in private capital,\u201d Charles Robertson, the London-based chief economist of Renaissance Capital, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Biden called for an overhaul of the office of prosecutor general, change in the energy sector, transparency about official sources of income and other measures.\u201cIf you fail, the experiment fails,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say the hopes of freedom-loving people the world over are with you.\u201dBut analysts said it was doubtful that the Ukrainian government, no matter how well intentioned, could stamp out corruption anytime soon.\u201cUkraine has a fundamental problem,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cYou cannot put good people just on the top, and hope their good policies permeate through the old apparatus that has been there for something like a century. It\u2019s not going to happen in a year. It\u2019s probably going to take a generation.\u201dAndrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Licio Gelli, Italian Financier and Cabal Leader, Dies at 96", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis death was reported by the nation\u2019s news media, and his funeral on Thursday, attended mostly by family and friends, was covered by Italian television.Mr. Gelli never wavered in his convictions. In a 2008 television interview, he declared, \u201cI was born under fascism, I studied with fascism, I fought for fascism, I am a fascist and I will die a fascist.\u201dHis near-mythic ignominy evoked popular fictional conspiracy tales, like Dan Brown\u2019s novel \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d and the movie \u201cThe Godfather Part III,\u201d and he personified what Italians encapsulate as \u201cdietrologia\u201d \u2014 the reflexive, widely held suspicion that behind any official government narrative lurks a more sinister explanation.But if Mr. Gelli was a scoundrel to many Italians, to others he held out the promise of stability in turbulent times, when the Communist Party was advancing at the polls and the economy was declining.He exerted much of his influence as leader of a cabalistic breakaway Masonic lodge, known as Propaganda Due, or P2, which the Freemasons had officially dissolved. The authorities said hundreds of government, business and military leaders had joined the lodge, defying Italy\u2019s ban on secret societies.Investigators linked the group to plots to destabilize the Italian state, to blame leftists for unrest, and to foment a right-wing coup during the \u201cyears of lead,\u201d when Italy was besieged by terrorist attacks.The group was suspected of trying to discredit Communists by thwarting the rescue of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro, who was kidnapped and murdered in 1978 by leftist Red Brigades guerrillas. P2 was believed to have had a hand in the horrific bombing of a Bologna train station in 1980 that left 85 dead and that was generally attributed to another neo-fascist group.And it was investigated in 1982 in the death of Roberto Calvi, a lodge member who was called \u201cGod\u2019s banker\u201d because of his financial ties to the Vatican\u2019s bank. Mr. Calvi\u2019s body was found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London \u2014 a suicide, the authorities ruled.Mr. Gelli was convicted of bank fraud and obstruction of justice. He mysteriously escaped from prison or house arrest twice and served the remainder of his term in his villa, a 30-room redoubt near a 15th-century church in the Tuscan hills.There he was found to have a gold thumb when nearly $2 million in bullion was discovered in 1998 in the terrace garden, hidden in terra cotta flower pots beneath begonias and geraniums.In \u201cGod\u2019s Banker,\u201d his 1983 biography of Mr. Calvi, Rupert Cornwell wrote, \u201cItaly, it must be recorded with honesty, albeit bemusement, has produced few more remarkable individuals this century than Licio Gelli.\u201dMr. Gelli (pronounced jelly) was born on April 21, 1919, in Pistoia, north of Florence, in Tuscany. He married the former Wanda Vannaci. She died in 1993, and their three children, Raffaello, Maria Rosa and Maurizio, survive him, as does his second wife, the former Gabriella Vasile. (Another daughter died in an automobile accident.)After the war, he fled to Argentina, where he became a confidant of the dictator Juan Per\u00f3n. Returning to Italy, he became successful as a financier and self-made industrialist manufacturing mattresses.Mr. Gelli emerged into the public eye in 1981 as Italian investigators were focusing on Mr. Calvi, who had presided over the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Italy\u2019s largest private bank, and on Michele Sindona, another banker who had been accused in the failure of the Franklin National Bank in the United States. (Mr. Sindona was later convicted of murder and was himself murdered, by poisoning, in prison.)Searching for the names of businessmen who had illegally exported cash, the investigators found instead \u2014 in a leather suitcase in Mr. Gelli\u2019s mattress factory \u2014 evidence of what amounted to a right-wing shadow government composed of 962 power brokers led by Mr. Gelli. The group, they said, sought to \u201cexert anonymous and surreptitious control\u201d of the country.The roster included Mr. Calvi and Mr. Sindona, whom the authorities described as puppets of Mr. Gelli, enlisted to help impose what the group called a \u201cPlan for Democratic Rebirth.\u201dWhen so many government ministers and other officials were revealed to be members of the lodge, Prime Minister Arnaldo Forlani\u2019s government fell. His successor declared that Italy was facing a \u201cmoral emergency.\u201dMr. Gelli was arrested in Geneva in 1982 on charges of passport fraud. The authorities said he had gone there to withdraw millions of dollars from his Swiss accounts.A year later, just as he was about to be extradited to Italy to face charges involving the Bologna bombing, the bank failure and financing right-wing terrorism, he escaped from a Swiss prison hospital with a guard\u2019s help and fled to South America. He returned to Switzerland in 1987 and was extradited to Italy under extraordinary security.Mr. Gelli was absolved of any association with the Bologna bombing but sentenced to five years in prison for obstructing the investigation and 18 and a half years for his role in the Banco Ambrosiano fraud. (His Swiss accounts had been linked to more than $1 billion that the bank was missing.) He later received a 17-year sentence on obstruction charges in a political conspiracy case involving 15 other P2 members.Mr. Gelli was a \u201cman of Neronic wealth and ways,\u201d as the writer Nick Tosches described him in \u201cPower on Earth,\u201d his 1986 biography of Mr. Sindona. But Mr. Gelli\u2019s lawyer, Raphael Giorgetti, suggested on Thursday that his client had merely been a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for the government\u2019s own failings.Most of the lodge members escaped punishment. Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, who was president of the Vatican\u2019s bank, was indicted as an accessory in the Banco Ambrosiano collapse. Citing diplomatic immunity, the Vatican refused to comply with an Italian arrest warrant for the archbishop, but it paid more than $200 million to Banco Ambrosiano\u2019s creditors.Mr. Gelli, placed under house arrest because of ill health, slipped away again in 1998. He was arrested four months later in Cannes, France, and because of his physical condition was allowed to resume his confinement at his villa in Arezzo. He survived there for another 17 years, completing his sentence in the meantime.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dave Checketts Reflects on Tenure With Knicks and Spots Similarities", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW CANAAN, Conn. \u2014 The distant view from the northern suburbs stirs memories, emotions and the imagination. It opens a mind\u2019s portal to many a 1990s Midtown Manhattan night when Madison Square Garden was the center of the pro basketball universe. When the Knicks \u2014 Dave Checketts\u2019s Knicks \u2014 last owned New York. Twenty-one years after seeing the Knicks fall one victory short of the franchise\u2019s first N.B.A. championship since 1973, 16 years removed from trying to lure Phil Jackson to coach the team on the eve of an improbable second run to the finals, Checketts watches with fascination \u2014 and as a fan, he said \u2014 as Jackson tackles the daunting challenge he once met, and can admit to missing.Even when he rose from team president to Garden president, Checketts said, \u201cI missed the Knicks, being right in there.\u201dOn an unseasonably warm afternoon recently, he lowered his 6-foot-5 frame into a chair in a small conference room at the temporary offices of Rhone Apparel, a fast-growing 18-month-old men\u2019s premium active wear company founded by his entrepreneurial son Nate. Checketts had just returned from a round of golf with a friend who had lost his job. Over the years, Checketts has moved up or on from his fair share of high-profile positions \u2014 none of them, Checketts said, as provocatively gratifying as the daily operation of a professional sports team. \u201cIt\u2019s much more than running a bank or restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccess or failure is based on the performance of human beings that you selected. Nothing else like it.\u201dSeated nearby, Nate Checketts, who bears a fair resemblance to his father with his light eyes and athletic boyishness, wore the work uniform of the digital generation: casual slacks and shirt, backward baseball cap \u2014 a very different look from his father\u2019s coiffed, corporate image.A favorite of the former N.B.A. commissioner David Stern\u2019s, Checketts had a startling rise as a bright, ambitious Mormon from a Salt Lake City suburb, Bountiful, Utah. At 28, he was the team president of the N.B.A.\u2019s Jazz. At 35, he accepted the same position with the Knicks in 1991. The deposed (as general manager) Al Bianchi \u2014 a native New Yorker and basketball lifer \u2014 said then that Stern and the Garden suits had \u201cput this kid in, Checketts. You think he knows anything about basketball?\u201d Who knew? But Checketts, antithetical to Bianchi, had presence, was attuned to the business of basketball, smooth in the spotlight. He hired Pat Riley as coach and presided over the team\u2019s best run since the 1970s glory days that produced the franchise\u2019s two titles.A few years later, he was running the expanding Garden operation, until 2001, or one year after James L. Dolan, at the head of the ownership table, praised him for increasing profits and restoring to the building \u201ca grandeur now that it had when I used to go to events in the early 1970s.\u201d Checketts smiled wistfully at the mention of the mercurial Dolan. He could probably write a book but settled for summary. \u201cMore than anything else, I felt that Jimmy just wanted to run that show,\u201d he said. The smile turned to a sigh as he added, \u201cJimmy\u2019s a complicated guy.\u201dThe same might be said of Checketts, who evinced charm and poise but combined it with a Darwinian shrewdness that produced the occasional public relations stumble. His wife, Deb, once told him he lacked the urban edge to work in New York, but Checketts fired Ernie Grunfeld \u2014 his Knicks general manager and friend \u2014 over dinner not long before the 1999 run to the finals. It was a coldblooded move, however necessary to pacify Dolan that something was being done to motivate a floundering team.Weeks later, Checketts denied the pursuit of Jackson to a reporter from The New York Times. He soon after called a news conference to admit the story was true. Checketts created another firestorm in 2009 when Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host, tried to partner with his company that owned the N.H.L.\u2019s St. Louis Blues and Major League Soccer\u2019s Real Salt Lake in an unsuccessful bid to buy the N.F.L.\u2019s St. Louis Rams.That was also when Checketts\u2019s direct involvement in competitive pro sports began to unravel, along with the American economy. \u201cThe world fell apart,\u201d he said. \u201cI was the owner of two teams, and my largest shareholder was Lehman Brothers, 55 percent, and that made for a miserable four years, working our way out of that financial mess.\u201d Traversing Around BendsRetaining a youthful countenance, Checketts remains hopeful of another opportunity before he is ready for a rocker.He turned 60 in September, when his four sons \u2014 Spencer, 37; Nate, 32; Andrew, 30; and Ben, 28 \u2014 gave him the trip he took each of them on for their 16th birthdays: walking the Grand Canyon, rim to rim.\u201cThe best birthday gift I ever received for two reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, we spent a lot of great time together. Two, I actually crawled out the other side.\u201dHe said this with the relief of a man who must occasionally wonder if his peak career years have passed while sounding at times like a patriarch ready to cede the stage to his sons, who have all endeavored or aspired to work in something sports related.\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in him is a shift \u2014 not necessarily back, maybe to the side,\u201d Ben Checketts said. The Checketts children grew up at the Garden when it could better justify the self-proclamation as the world\u2019s most famous arena. In 1994, the Rangers won their only Stanley Cup since 1940. Checketts at the time was affiliated only with the Knicks, who lost Game 7 of the finals in Houston that year but throughout the decade electrified New York in epic battles against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls and Reggie Miller\u2019s Indiana Pacers.\u201cI used to go to school living and dying on the Knicks,\u201d Nate Checketts said. \u201cThose playoff games, if there was a loss, even the teachers would say, \u2018Why couldn\u2019t they pull it off?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cOr \u2018Why didn\u2019t they pull Starks?\u2019\u00a0\u201d his father cut in, conjuring up John Starks\u2019s 2-for-18 shooting nightmare in Game 7 in Houston.Checketts got into a car after that game at the old Summit arena to face his disconsolate children. \u201cWhat a great run that was,\u201d he told them, the family frontman knowing this was no time to reveal his own anguish.There were other agonizing memories, Checketts said, including the 1993 Eastern Conference finals loss to Jordan and the Bulls after Jordan was set off by an article in The Times about his between-games gambling escapades in Atlantic City; and a 1997 brawl in Miami against the Heat \u2014 coached at that point by Riley \u2014 that cost the Knicks multiple suspensions and the series.Dolan, Checketts said, showed up at the team\u2019s training base in Charleston, S.C., the next fall, eager to assert himself, requesting a lunch with Coach Jeff Van Gundy and his staff. \u201cHe told them that the brawl in Miami had cost us a championship,\u201d Checketts said. \u201cIf it happened again, he was holding them personally responsible.\u201dSure enough, in the 1998 playoffs, the brawling between two hard-hat teams continued. When the Knicks\u2019 Larry Johnson fought Miami\u2019s Alonzo Mourning at the end of Game 4 at the Garden, Van Gundy rushed into the middle of it and wound up photographed, clutching onto Mourning\u2019s leg, seemingly floating horizontally above the court.\u201cI\u2019m sitting there thinking, well, he did listen,\u201d Checketts said.He paused and added, \u201cI can drive myself crazy about all of that during those years.\u201dThe Knicks were so close and the family was emotionally tethered in a visceral way that sports cannot replicate without a professional connection, Nate Checketts said. The athletes were the stars. Their father ran the show.\u201cI\u2019m 28 now,\u201d Ben Checketts said. \u201cAt 28, he was taking over an N.B.A. franchise. That was probably unheard-of until you had someone like Theo Epstein with the Red Sox. So we had two options growing up: trying to use that as a measuring stick, or just revering it for how unique it was. I just saved myself a lot of grief.\u201dOnly Andrew, finishing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has ambitions to become a team sports executive. His father will not discourage or encourage him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Andrew will end up getting to it, because owning an N.B.A. club requires a billion or two,\u201d Checketts said. \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to outright own a club, our family.\u201dOne way back for Checketts would be as a franchise fixer, the role Jerry Colangelo, 76, recently assumed in Philadelphia \u2014 though Checketts said he would prefer to own some part of any team he runs. The more conventional path would be to organize a group as he did for the Blues and Real Salt Lake. \u201cThe problem is to find sellers \u2014 there just aren\u2019t that many, and Steve Ballmer\u2019s purchase of the Clippers made everybody think their franchise is worth $2 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are. But people have high expectations. The good news is that I can afford to be patient, find the right situation.\u201dVindicating a VisionaryAmong other business interests, Checketts sits on the board of JetBlue, which he has been involved with since leaving the Garden. He had a nearly three-year run starting in 2012 as the chairman and chief executive officer of Legends Hospitality Management L.L.C., a concessions, merchandising and management-services company owned by the Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.Checketts left after overseeing the construction of One World Observatory, the tourist attraction run by Legends at the top of the Freedom Tower in New York. He said his decade at the Garden changed him in one permanently meaningful way. The man from Bountiful became a stalwart New Yorker, one who frequented downtown Manhattan as a volunteer, post 9/11.\u201cThe views from the observatory are the same views we thought we\u2019d never see again,\u201d he said. His last visit to the World Trade Center was for a party to celebrate the retirement of Wayne Gretzky from hockey and the Rangers. It was the spring of 1999, the revelation of the Jackson recruitment soon to dull Checketts\u2019s corporate shine after Van Gundy\u2019s Knicks slipped into the playoffs and stunned Miami, the conference No. 1 seed, on Allan Houston\u2019s series-clinching runner.Yes, Checketts had interviewed Jackson and right in his New Canaan home.Being caught in the falsehood was enough to send him to the family dinner table to explain to his children why he was being roasted in the papers, on the airwaves. And why he deserved it. \u201cThat, for me, was a very uncomfortable time,\u201d he said, explaining that he had wanted to spare Van Gundy the scrutiny in season, and wound up martyring him instead.The more the Knicks won, the more the Garden crowds rhythmically chanted Van Gundy\u2019s name, Checketts playing the antihero in the developing drama, even if the pursuit of Jackson \u2014 before the Knicks made the playoffs \u2014 had made much sense, under the circumstances.\u201cThe first thing I did when I was appointed Knicks president was to have a four-hour sit-down with Red Holzman at his house in Cedarhurst,\u201d Checketts said, referring to the coach of the championship Knicks teams. \u201cHe understood more than anyone what made the Knicks go, what made them relevant to the city. That\u2019s why I went after Phil. He had been a Knick in the championship days. He had the same understanding of the variables.\u201dChecketts soon came to suspect that Jackson was using the Knicks to leverage and land in Los Angeles with the Lakers, which was why, he believed, the surreptitious talks were leaked.\u201cBut that\u2019s way in the past,\u201d he said.What goes around has come around, Jackson\u2019s return in the spring of 2014 providing Checketts the incentive to feel obliquely vindicated, even visionary, and again follow the Knicks after years of receding interest during years of mismanagement.The drafting of Kristaps Porzingis aside, there are no guarantees, he knows, but, he said, \u201cPhil understands what it takes \u2014 the values in New York, the nature of the ups and downs, the media and fans.\u201cChecketts went on: \u201cI think he knows that if you\u2019re a rock about it all, you can build a team that can really be admired in a way like nowhere else. I think he\u2019s on the right path. I\u2019m rooting for him.\u201dUnless, or until, he can score another team of his own.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Talks Over Seized U.S. Property, Havana Counters With Own Claim", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDiplomatic MemoPeople started dusting off yellowing deeds. Lawyers were called.But what if Cuba approaches these historic talks with a rather different unsettled claim in mind?In 1999, a Cuban court found the United States government liable for deaths and damages caused by America\u2019s \u201caggressive policies\u201d against the island \u2014 namely, the Bay of Pigs invasion and the trade embargo prohibiting American citizens and companies from doing business in Cuba.Arguing that the United States had strangled Cuba\u2019s economy and caused irreparable harm, the court ordered the United States to pay $181 billion in damages.So while legal representatives from the State Department flew to Havana last week to make the case for American claims against Cuba, the Cubans made a presentation of their own.\u201cWe know that they believe that they have billions of dollars of claims relating to human damage and economic damage resulting from the embargo,\u201d said a State Department official who briefed reporters on the condition that she not be named. \u201cAnd I think we can expect that we will hear more about that as we proceed with these discussions.\u201dThe official would not say whether the Cubans demanded an exact figure in reparations. It is unclear how the Cuban government arrived at any of the many damage estimates bandied about.At the United Nations this year, Cuba said it was owed about $121 billion. The Cuban government-run news media says the amount owed is $833.75 billion.\u201cThis is an extremely complicated subject,\u201d Josefina Vidal, head of United States affairs in the Cuban Foreign Ministry, told The Associated Press after the first meeting of the bilateral commission this fall. \u201cI imagine that when the two countries begin to meet, one of the first things we will have to do is to clarify all the accounts.\u201d(She noted that the Cuban court verdict was 15 years old, suggesting there were fresh numbers to crunch.)The State Department official said last week\u2019s meeting was both preliminary and professional, but she emphasized that the issue of compensation for the confiscated properties was crucial. More meetings are expected in the coming months.\u201cThis meeting is the first step in a complex process that may take some time, but the United States views the resolution of outstanding claims as a top priority for normalization,\u201d the American official said.The State Department also laid out the 10 state and federal court judgments American courts have levied against the Cuban government, totaling another $2 billion or so, as well as \u201csome claims of the U.S. government against Cuba,\u201d the official said.Experts said that American claimants should not be too worried about Cuba\u2019s daunting counter-demands.Cuba needs the United States to lift the trade embargo, and the best way to get that done is by settling the property claims, he said. The embargo was put in place in 1962 after a dispute that began precisely because Fidel Castro expropriated American oil companies that had refused to process Russian crude.With an end to Venezuela\u2019s financial aid a greater possibility, Cuba needs a new revenue stream. Soon.\u201cThe fuse has been lit,\u201d Mr. Feinberg said. \u201cTime is running out.\u201dMauricio J. Tamargo, a Washington lawyer who chaired the Foreign Settlement Claims Commission for eight years, said the two sides must come up with a bargain that is fair, or Congress would not vote to lift the embargo.The claims have also been a stumbling block to re-establishing direct air travel between the two countries, because Cuba fears its planes could be seized to satisfy court judgments, Mr. Feinberg said.Should the talks advance, there are plenty of models negotiators could look at.In Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, confiscated properties were sometimes returned to their original owners.Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania offered compensation, \u201cusually inadequate, and often symbolic and not necessarily monetary,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s J. Guti\u00e9rrez, a consultant in Miami who has worked on the issue for decades after his family lost a $35 million empire in Cuba.The Cuban case is trickier: Not only does the government have its own counterclaim, but the people who did the confiscating are still in power.In that sense, Cuba\u2019s situation is more parallel with Vietnam and China.In 1979, China agreed to pay $80 million to a China Claims Fund, which allowed American claimants 39 percent of the value of their lost properties, according to the Brookings study. Vietnam, to normalize relations with the United States, agreed in 1995 to apply its assets frozen by the United States government to pay claimants 100 percent of the principal and 80 percent of the interest they were owed.Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez believes the claims should have been settled before the embassies were opened. He now fears that the two lists of demands are so lopsided that the American claimants will walk away with nothing.The State Department negotiates on behalf of American claimants and does not have to seek their approval before reaching an accord.\u201cYou can almost imagine Obama negotiators saying: \u2018Look, we got them to drop the fantasy $120 billion!\u2019\u201d Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cWe drop the $8 billion, and no one gets anything.\u201dMr. Kelly said the Cuban counterclaim for reparations should not be taken seriously.\u201cThose claims are not supported by international law,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe property claims are.\u201dMore are sure to surface. Already, a Tampa resident, Gary Rapoport, has publicly inquired about compensation for the Riviera, a 352-room waterfront hotel in Havana that was inaugurated in 1957 by Ginger Rogers. It was owned by Mr. Rapoport\u2019s grandfather Meyer Lansky, the organized-crime figure. .Because of an editing error, the Diplomatic Memo article on Monday, about claims and counterclaims as the United States and Cuba discuss American properties confiscated by Cuba decades ago, misidentified the newspaper that interviewed a grandson of Meyer Lansky, who said Cuba owed his family compensation for a confiscated hotel. The newspaper is The Tampa Tribune, not The South Florida Sun-Sentinel.Advertisement"}

The devaluation and a slashing of export taxes favored influential farmers on Argentina\u2019s Pampas lowlands who had speculated about such moves by hoarding their grain harvests. They struck an agreement with Mr. Macri\u2019s government to immediately sell billions of dollars of grain stocks, like soy, to ease the shortage of funds at the Central Bank.But while these agricultural exports are now more profitable for the farmers, for people like Mr. Raspa, the devaluation is eroding their salaries and fueling price increases as imports become more expensive.In his first days in office, Mr. Macri has made quick-fire, market-oriented changes meant to reinvigorate the economy after sluggish business investment and growth in recent years.In contrast, his predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who had bruising clashes with the farmers, preferred driving demand through policies like energy subsidies for consumers.Many Argentines welcome the changes. Daniel \u00c1lvarez, 57, who works at a hardware store in La Matanza, said that under the Kirchner administration, precarious Central Bank foreign reserves were being hemorrhaged to shore up the peso. \u201cThey didn\u2019t leave a buck,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez said. \u201cBoth Macri and Scioli were going to devalue. There was no other option to get dollars in. Yes, it directly favors the farmers, but the idea is that indirectly it favors us.\u201dBut in the short term, there is the danger of fueling inflation, which is already about 25 percent, according to unofficial estimates frequently used because the national statistics institute\u2019s figures have not been trustworthy. In turn, if real wages do not keep up, battles could break out between the government and powerful trade union leaders. Political and social organizations are already panicked about Mr. Macri\u2019s moves.Eduardo Levy Yeyati, an economics professor at Torcuato di Tella University here and a visiting professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said Mr. Macri, who had tiptoed around his plans during the campaign, now faced the hard political task of following through with adjustments even though the economy, boosted by the government\u2019s pre-election spending, improved this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnection between perceptions and the economic reality,\u201d said Professor Levy Yeyati, emphasizing the unsustainability of a large budget deficit and an overvalued currency. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to explain these things to the public when they feel like they\u2019re doing O.K.\u201dMr. Macri must also tread carefully, analysts said, because of his small margin of victory in the election. A decision to temporarily appoint Supreme Court judges by decree, bypassing Congress during its summer recess, was criticized as an overreach of executive power. This, together with moves viewed as steps toward the dismantling of a media law that is strongly endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters, has left him less room for unpopular measures.Mr. Macri has already moved to cool the simmering economic tensions, keeping Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s price control programs in place for now and offering a small one-time payment to around eight million recipients of state pensions or child benefits.Still, repercussions are already being felt. \u201cIt\u2019s the workers who always pay for these crises,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Lemos, 54, who manages a downtown paint store, as he clicked through an online price list showing that the price of some products had risen by 25 percent overnight. \u201cSales are going to drop.\u201d Similarly, Sergio Camerucci, 52, who manufactures trophies and sells them to sports leagues, said the price of the plastic he needed to make the trophy bases rose by 20 percent after the devaluation.Most economists expect the devaluation \u2014 and the accompanying raising of interest rates to anchor the peso \u2014 to result in anemic growth or a recession in 2016 before a rebound in 2017, with perhaps growth of 3.5 percent, according to Sebasti\u00e1n Vargas and Pilar Tavella, Barclays economists in New York. This year, growth will be 0.4 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund; other economists predict it will be higher.Supporters of Mr. Macri seem to understand this progression. \u201cThe last 12 years were terrible,\u201d Mr. Camerucci said of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political movement, pointing to his falling sales over the last three years and the import restrictions, which made it difficult to buy the machinery he needed. \u201cWe have to be patient, but we are on a good path.\u201dDaniel Scatilazzi, 44, who was selling homemade pies and sandwiches from a stall, said he would suffer as prices jumped but understood Mr. Macri\u2019s motives. \u201cI\u2019ll put up with it,\u201d said Mr. Scatilazzi, a former supporter of Mrs. Kirchner who voted for Mr. Macri because he wanted change. \u201cWe have to give him time to work.

{"Headline": "The Dimming of Diesel Fuel\u2019s Future in Cars", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Energy for TomorrowDiesel automobiles, which are more fuel-efficient than their gasoline-powered counterparts, were always supposed to shield their owners from some of the impact of oil-price spikes.All told, roughly 20 percent of new cars sold around the world are diesel-powered. Diesel accounts for about half of new passenger vehicles sold in Europe and India, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. It reaches double-digit penetration rates in a small number of other major markets, such as Australia and South Korea, but barely more than 1 or 2 percent in the United States, China and Japan.But in fact emissions were always the real issue with diesel. Progress has been made in reducing the sulfur content of diesel fuel, the chief culprit in soot emissions. But the higher compression of diesel engines and the less refined nature of the fuel, compared to gasoline, ensure that diesel cars produce more of several pollutants, including nitrogen compounds, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and dioxide.The emissions issue was brought to the fore when Volkswagen, Europe\u2019s largest carmaker and No.2 in the world (after Toyota), acknowledged in September that it had fiddled with 11 million of its diesel-powered cars to make them appear to meet emissions standards.Subsequent press reports indicated that diesel cars produced by other companies violated European emissions targets, but this was generally attributed to the way tests are conducted \u2014 the cars generate fewer emissions in the lab than on the road \u2014 and not to wrongdoing.To compensate for the pollution levels, diesel emission-control systems are more complex and costly. It is thought that Volkswagen manipulated the software in its cars to show false readings because a pollution-control system able to meet American emissions requirements, which are stricter than Europe\u2019s, would have been prohibitively expensive.Apart from the dishonesty, the scandal suggests that diesel technology is less clean and less cost-effective than advocates assert. Even before the story broke, diesel had several factors going against it, including declining crude-oil prices, improvements in gasoline engines and technologies that produce cleaner cars.\u201cDiesel probably doesn\u2019t make sense for light-duty vehicles,\u201d said Daniel Sperling, a professor of civil engineering and environmental science and policy at the University of California\u2019s Davis campus and director of the Institute of Transportation Studies there. Other types of cars \u201care more efficient,\u201d he said. \u201cEmission standards are getting tighter and tighter, and as the shift takes place to electric, diesel does not have a promising long-term future\u201d in passenger cars.David Keith, assistant professor of system dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a similar prognosis. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong headwind for diesel in the passenger-vehicle market,\u201d he said. \u201cEmission regulations support alternatives.\u201dAll things considered, the costs of diesel and gasoline cars are comparable. Because they have to run hotter, diesel engines must be built sturdier. Between the engines and emission-control systems, the cars are pricier, but they tend to stay on the road longer.Diesel cars have been popular in Europe because diesel fuel is subsidized there and because emission standards are lower than for gas-powered cars. Regulators in the United States require both types to meet the same standards, which raises costs for diesel cars made for the American market, said Mr. Sperling, who also serves on the California Air Resources Board.But Europe is introducing tougher emissions standards, which could require more expensive control systems in diesel cars. And after the Volkswagen affair, testing is likely to get tougher, too, said Colin Langan, who follows the auto industry for the Swiss bank UBS. At the same time, improvements to gas engines could make them more appealing. \u201cIn Europe, a lot of people have assumed that diesel was going to lose momentum,\u201d Mr. Langan said. \u201cGas engines are getting a lot better; they\u2019re getting turbochargers, which diesel engines already have. People are going to start migrating more to gas from diesel.\u201dHe added, however, that Europe has also set tougher fuel-economy targets for carmakers. Diesel still has an edge there, which may slow the shift to gas.Gasoline-powered cars are not the only ones that makers of diesel cars have to worry about. Coming up in the fast lane, even if there\u2019s little traffic there now, are hybrid and electric vehicles.Mr. Langan sees little threat from the cleaner alternatives just yet, however, because they are more expensive than gas or diesel models. Electric works at the upscale, high-performance end of the market, where manufacturers like Tesla live, but not in the mainstream. Alan Baum, principal of Baum and Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Michigan, is more hopeful.\u201cCosts are coming down and the technology is improving\u201d amid \u201can all-hands-on-deck strategy among regulators and automakers,\u201d Mr. Baum said. Internal-combustion vehicles are less expensive than electric and hybrid equivalents today, but he wonders what the cost might be \u201cwhen you have to have a car that gets 30 miles per gallon or, in 10 years, 40?\u201dAs a result of the various threats to its position in the marketplace \u2014 both external and self-inflicted \u2014 diesel\u2019s proportion of the world\u2019s fleet of passenger cars is likely to shrink into the teens in the next decade, Mr. Baum forecast.Mr. Keith at M.I.T. similarly highlighted \u201cthe great scope for innovation to introduce electric-drive technology that promises to be cleaner.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think diesel\u2019s going to go away completely,\u201d he added. \u201cI think there\u2019s a role for all these technologies, but definitely in the U.S. and increasingly in Europe, we can see challenges in getting diesel to perform at a level we like.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foreign Investors Tiptoe Through Minefield of Greek Banking System", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Over the last six months, Greece has provided both highs and lows for foreign investors.A few brave hedge funds have cashed in because of the stellar returns they have earned from Greek government bonds, which since Greece signed its bailout deal in August have been among the world\u2019s best performing investments.But those who bet heavily on Greek banks \u2014 like John Paulson, David Einhorn and Wilbur Ross \u2014 have had their investments evaporate after the recent recapitalization of the Greek financial sector.In recent years, investing in Greece has always been a bit of an all-or-nothing affair as the lure of sky-high returns has always been tempered by the very real prospect that you might lose your shirt.And so it was last week when a group of prominent investors came here to gauge whether, in the wake of Greece\u2019s close brush with leaving the euro last summer, it was safe to invest in Greek assets again.But at an investor conference here, the main concern was less about what technical reform the government was passing or what was going on with Greece\u2019s debt, but whether Greece, and Europe for that matter, could regain the trust of global financial community.\u201cWe have become too obsessed with structural reforms and debt in Greece,\u201d said Chetan Gulati, who oversees European investments out of London for Perry Capital.An $8 billion hedge fund based in New York, Perry, along with funds like Japonica Partners, Greylock Capital and the French funds H20 and Carmignac, have made a mint from their Greek bond investments as yields have fallen to 8 percent from 14 percent since August. (Bond yields move in the opposite direction from their prices.)While many of these investors may be happy with such a payoff, they know how fleeting such gains can be if another political crisis engulfs Greece.\u201cWhat investors are looking for today is a return of the stability, confidence and trust that has been destroyed over the past six months,\u201d Mr. Gulati said, his voice rising as he addressed the conference participants.That means the government has to make clear that the last six months have been a mistake, he said; the Greek opposition must support the government if it does the right thing; and finally, he, concluded, Europe has to let it be known that Greece is part of the club \u2014 because right now it is not.Mr. Gulati\u2019s cri de coeur struck a chord, prompting robust applause from an audience that, for most of this two-day investor conference, had been unresponsive. And it summed up the conflicted feelings of foreign investors in terms of how they should approach Greece these days.Enticing prospects of high-yielding government bonds and hugely discounted Greek bank stocks have lured a procession of investors to Athens in recent months. At the same time, however, the looming risks of jittery politics and a mountain of nonperforming loans have kept most investors on the sidelines.Perhaps the most powerful sign that investors may be willing to give Greece the benefit of the doubt, at least for a while longer, is that just about all the funds that took big losses in Greek bank stocks have not washed their hands of Greece, as one might expect.Instead, Greek bankers here say that these investors chose to participate in the latest fund offering, enticed no doubt by discounts of as much as 70 percent of the company\u2019s total value. (The previous recapitalization in 2012 offered investors a 30 percent discount.)European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Such giveaway prices, however, were not enough to attract more conservative long-term investors. Of the foreigners that did participate, most were hedge funds with a high tolerance for risk, bankers said.Greece\u2019s two largest banks, for example, Piraeus and National Bank of Greece, were not able to attract enough interest from overseas, and as a result they had to scramble at the last minute to tap domestic sources. They also were forced to accept cash from Greece\u2019s semiofficial bank oversight fund, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund.At the forefront of investor worries is the willingness of the nation\u2019s left-leaning prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to deliver on the painful reforms he promised creditors in the summer. And while the government has pushed through a slate of tough measures, the most politically explosive of them all, cutting pensions, remains unresolved.\u201cWe are a bit behind schedule \u2014 there have been delays in the decision-making process,\u201d said Declan Costello, the representative at the European Commission overseeing Greece. \u201cWe would also like to see a more positive business and investment agenda.\u201dAs for the banks, which are sitting on nonperforming loans of 107 billion euros, it could be said they are cheap for very good reason.Mr. Karagiannis says that the only way Greek banks can start making loans again is to allow outside investors to buy some of the nonperforming loans that the banks are holding \u2014 which in cases like Piraeus Bank is close to half the existing book of loans.But experts say that antiquated bankruptcy laws and fears of vulture investors pushing Greeks out of their homes and taking over companies pose a hurdle for outside investors looking to replicate their successes in more open markets like Ireland and Spain.Bank executives also say that they would be reluctant to sell their bank loans at bargain basement prices that distressed investors are demanding.\u201cAt some point we may do this, but why should we sell at these prices?\u201d said Spyridon Papaspyrou, a senior executive at Piraeus Bank, the largest lender in Greece.Mr. Papaspyrou says that Piraeus has set up a small \u201cbad bank\u201d with 2,600 people combing through 31 billion euros in bad loans in an effort to see which borrowers can pay but are choosing not to \u2014 and thus can be taken to court \u2014 and those who are just unable to make their payments.But he and all Greek bankers agree that their biggest challenge is regaining the trust and confidence of the millions of Greek savers who withdrew about 40 billion euros from the Greek banking system this year. The vast majority of these funds, economists here say, is stuffed in bureau drawers, under mattresses or locked away in personal safes.If this vast trove of liquidity returns to the banking system, the banks will then be able to wean themselves off expensive short-term loans from the European Central Bank and return to their core business of making loans.It will not be easy. With two scares in three years over leaving the euro, Greek depositors are understandably gun shy about keeping their hard-earned savings in their banks. And with capital controls limiting the amount of cash they can withdraw, there is little incentive for nervous savers to return to the Greek banking system.For the moment then, for everyday Greeks as well as foreign investors, more needs to be done before they can put their full faith in Greek institutions.\u201cFor all this money to return from under the mattresses there needs to be a new climate of trust,\u201d said Aristides Xenofos, the chief executive of the fund overseeing the Greek banking sector. \u201cThis is what is critical.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "There\u2019s a Formula for Deciding When to Extract Fossil Fuels ", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate ChangeWhat if we continued to lease the rights to access fossil fuels on federal land but required the leases and royalty payments to reflect the full climate damages from these fuels? Doing so would put the market to work by unlocking fossil fuels that have the highest value in relation to their impact on the climate. The bonus: It provides money to pay for some of the damage of climate change.We\u2019ve seen the benefits of using our domestic resources over the last decade as the amount of our energy coming from domestic oil and gas resources increased 54 percent. Chiefly, we have lower fuel prices. We now pay 74 percent less for natural gas and 25 percent less for petroleum, compared with 2005. Further, net imports will account for just 23 percent of American liquid fuel supplies this year \u2014 down from 60 percent in 2005 \u2014 with important energy security benefits. Our carbon emissions are also below 2005 levels, with cheap natural gas having taken significant market share from coal, which is more carbon intensive.At the same time, the combustion of fossil fuels causes climate change that is projected to impose myriad costs around the world. But in this regard, not all fossil fuels are created equal. The value per unit of energy, measured by the market price, is greater for some (like petroleum) than others (like coal). Further, some contain more carbon or result in the release of more emissions because of other factors like the extraction and transportation process, and inflict greater climate damages. Knowing the monetary value of climate damages associated with a ton of carbon emissions is therefore the key to this whole problem.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.If the S.C.C. were applied as a part of leasing and royalty rates on federal lands, we would unlock resources with the greatest net benefits. To illustrate the consequences of such a shift, I did some calculations based on the spot prices for coal, petroleum and natural gas and their respective energy and carbon contents. The addition of a charge based on the S.C.C. is unlikely to have a substantial effect on domestic production of petroleum: The spot price per million British thermal units (B.T.U.s) this year has been $8.81, and the associated climate damages are $2.98. If the federal government collected a charge of $2.98 for each million B.T.U.s of petroleum extracted on federal lands, the revenue could be refunded directly to taxpayers or used to help the nation adapt to climate damages. The story is similar for natural gas; its value today exceeds the expected climate damages.Such a change in policy would have challenges. There would inevitably be some shifting of fossil fuel production to private lands in the United States, as well as to other countries; but it would also reduce the long-run global supply of fossil fuels. Further, there would be a strong case for harmonizing S.C.C. charges with existing domestic climate regulations to ensure that the carbon policies operate as efficiently as possible. There is also a strong case for providing support to communities that experience meaningful declines in economic activity because of an extraction fee linked to the S.C.C.An efficient climate policy would price carbon throughout the global economy so that users of all fossil fuels recognized their climate costs. It does not appear likely that the current Paris climate negotiations will produce such a system. In the absence of such a policy, the solution doesn\u2019t need to be to use all fossil fuels, or to ban their usage. Common sense suggests that we use the ones that provide more value than harm and that we leave the others in the ground.Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman professor of economics at the University of Chicago, runs the Energy Policy Institute there. He was the chief economist of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers from 2009 to 2010.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Kitchens, by Choice", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 For many, the American dream kitchen has long been a grand showplace, filled with granite islands that stretch like aircraft carriers through a sea of shining appliances.The microkitchen, stocked with expensive blenders, elaborate coffee makers and professional-quality knives, suits digital workers who eat free at work or take their meals in homey but globally influenced restaurants in their apartment buildings. Dinner may come from one of a dozen app-based delivery services, either as a fully prepared chef\u2019s special or a meal kit that requires cooking but not much chopping.That doesn\u2019t mean no one is cooking. Food has become a cultural touchstone, and what and how one eats are as important to some people in their 20s and early 30s as certain genres of music or film were to previous generations.\u201cPeople are willing to shrink the square footage of their kitchen for more versatility and more open space to entertain guests,\u201d Ms. Nebert said. \u201cIt\u2019s about packing more into less space.\u201dTo be sure, apartment dwellers in big cities like New York, Paris and Tokyo have coped for ages with tiny kitchens as a matter of necessity, not choice. But these microkitchens are now being embraced by a group of early adopters who could easily afford much larger ones, and whose culinary preferences could shape kitchen design for years to come.The transformation is playing out most vividly in the technology corridors of several American cities, where developers and real estate agents say condominiums and apartments designed with well-equipped minikitchens are being sought by young people whose food expenditures are surpassed only by their rent.In Chicago, Sam Jenkins, a real estate consultant, is selling condominiums in Logan Square for $300,000 to $600,000 with kitchens that have been squeezed down to make more space for entertaining and for the bigger bedrooms that many millennials prefer.\u201cWhere is my dining table going to go is a nonissue because no one wants one anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s less of a focus on \u2018Look at my triple-wide Sub-Zero.\u2019\u201dAppliance makers like General Electric, Miele and Bosch report rising demand for stoves that have been shaved by six inches, dishwashers a mere 18 inches wide and refrigerators that are set inside drawers. Sales of Miele\u2019s 24-inch speed ovens, designed to cook food more quickly than standard ovens, have risen 37 percent since 2012. Sales of smaller convection ovens jumped 65 percent in that time, said Kathrin Pfeifer, the product manager for the company\u2019s cooking appliances.Although older buyers accounted for about three-quarters of the $6.2 billion spent last year on steamers, espresso makers and other small appliances, millennials were the only demographic group who bought more of them than they did a year earlier, according to the NPD Group, which studies consumer spending.\u201cIf you look at the purchases among millennials, you see a picture of people trying to get more freshness out of these small kitchens quicker,\u201d said Darren Cypher, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD.Among America\u2019s millennial generation, classified generally as the 60 million people ages 18 to 34, cooking is not viewed as a daily chore but as one of several ways to eat on any given day, said Laurie Demeritt, the chief executive of the Hartman Group, which studies trends for the food industry.They like their meals to be healthful and authentic, but they cook only when the mood strikes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t underestimate how engaged this generation is in food and cooking,\u201d Ms. Demeritt said. \u201cThey are approaching cooking as a choice, which makes it more fun and whimsical and desirable.\u201dGranted, the tiny-kitchen movement is getting an assist from baby boomers who are selling the large suburban homes where their children were raised and buying places in cities, but they are a different kind of customer.\u201cA lot of the empty nesters still want the kitchen and an island,\u201d said Alan Mark, who helps develop and sell condominiums in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Seattle. For certain well-paid younger buyers, he and others said, it\u2019s all about quality with a small footprint. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a glorified dorm room,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they have amenities.\u201dLou Lenzi, the design director for GE\u2019s appliance business, agreed. \u201cHigher-density living is coming on pretty strongly among knowledge workers,\u201d he said.

They eat at a coffee table in the living room.There\u2019s a large pot of homemade soup in the refrigerator and pork chops in the freezer, but they make daily trips to the juice and coffee bar on the ground floor of their building, which also has a Japanese restaurant and a small grocery store called Home Remedy. It sells ecologically friendly laundry soap, Asian condiments, eight styles of salt and frozen lamb potpies alongside fresh pizza and a salad bar. Mr. Rodichok calls it \u201can overpriced hipster 7-Eleven.\u201dThis was their first Thanksgiving together at home, and they wanted to cook for friends, so they hauled their food and some cooking equipment to the building\u2019s large communal kitchen, designed by Tom Douglas, a chef who also runs the restaurants on the ground floor. It comes equipped with gas burners powerful enough to accommodate woks, and Internet-ready cameras so the whole meal can be recorded and shared.\u201cThe kitchen table at my grandmother\u2019s house was the center of the universe,\u201d Mr. Rodichok said. \u201cTo be honest, I really miss that. But when I get in the elevator and go down to the first floor, I have that \u2018going into the family kitchen\u2019 kind of feeling in a very urban, Seattle way.\u201dThe building was designed for a Zipcar generation that embraces a sharing economy, said Matt Griffin, the Seattle developer who came up with the concept for Via6. \u201cLife becomes having access to it but not necessarily owning it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your kitchen is efficient, it doesn\u2019t need to be that big. Bigger just wears you out.\u201dJimmy Douglas, 30, who manages digital marketing for Smarsh, a financial services company in San Francisco, hopes to move into his new $600,000 condominium in the Hayes Valley neighborhood in March. It has a tiny kitchen, which will suit him and his girlfriend perfectly. \u201cEating is our favorite activity, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re the couple going to Costco and stocking up on weeks\u2019 worth of food,\u201d he said.Instead, they buy fresh ingredients in small quantities several times a week.

Known for her colorful gems and playful, conceptual approach, the London jeweler celebrated the occasion with the Everything collection, which she describes \u201cas a little bit more of everything I\u2019ve ever done.\u201dFrom spinning diamond cogs and fantastical creatures to rings that tell a story in precious stones and colored enamel, Ms. Azagury-Partridge\u2019s jewelry is not mere decoration but wearable art that provokes thought, and frequently a smile.The former Boucheron creative director is a veteran among a growing group of independent female designers who have turned their passion for jewelry into successful businesses, creating the heirlooms of tomorrow.Unlike their male counterparts who until recently dominated the independent market, these female jewelers have the advantage of understanding from personal experience what women want to wear.Lisa Hubbard, chairman of North and South America for Sotheby\u2019s international jewelry division, says that their progress coincides with more female jewelry buyers than ever before. \u201cGiven that more and more women today have independent means and are vying for jewelry for themselves, it makes sense that women would successfully design jewels that other women want to wear,\u201d she said.Ms. Azagury-Partridge, after being burnt in the past by investment partnerships gone awry, is determined to develop her business on her own terms. \u201cI want to get as small as I can, and I want to work in my own way. With independence comes freedom,\u201d she said.Aside from her exuberantly decorated Mayfair flagship store, which the designer and friend Tom Dixon describes as \u201ca magic kingdom,\u201d she has just two other stores now, one in New York and one in Paris. She has closed several other stores and is looking for alternative ways to expand, without the expense of new stores.In October, she released her second collaboration with Amazon\u2019s British website. The e-commerce giant is offering an exclusive sterling silver and lacquered version of her signature Hotlips ring design for 69 pounds, or about $104. The original gold and enamel version, first designed in 2005, and which sells for more than $2,300, is one of the jeweler\u2019s best sellers.The designer said the Amazon version, available in six colors, is selling well and may soon appear on Amazon\u2019s American site. The seasonal changes demanded by online jewelry sales are at odds with the long lead time needed for her precious jewelry collection, so the ring\u2019s sales are \u201ca way for me to do wholesaling and to make my jewelry available to a much wider audience,\u201d she said.Carolina Bucci is another jewelry designer experimenting with ways to expand her business. Fifteen years after starting her self-named 18-karat gold collection, the jeweler, who was raised in Italy and is based in London, is planning to introduce Caro, a silver jewelry brand, in the latter half of 2016.Catering to a younger, fashion-focused customer, it will have seasonal collections and is expected to sell for prices between $150 and $2,500. (Her fine jewelry ranges from $950 to $100,000).Caro, which uses Ms. Bucci\u2019s nickname, will have the same spirit as her original brand but will be built on a different business model. \u201cI don\u2019t want more than four or five Carolina Bucci stores, as I want to retain that sense of exclusivity, but Caro is a brand I envisage having lots of different stores and retailers,\u201d she said.Wearability will remain the key issue, though. Born into a family of Florentine jewelers, Ms. Bucci says she was never allowed to wear costume jewelry growing up, and found that the fine jewelry she could wear was too traditional for her tastes. \u201cI wanted to make fine jewelry that was true to my family heritage, yet also fun and relevant to my own life,\u201d she said.For her, designing jewelry is a personal endeavor. Unlike the elaborate jewels she remembers her mother wearing when she was a child, her concept is to create easy but luxury pieces that can be worn all day, whether dealing with work, children or an evening out. \u201cOur lives are so different these days,\u201d she said.A turning point for the designer came when she opened her own store in the Belgravia area of London in 2007. \u201cUntil that point I\u2019d never actually met my clients really,\u201d she said. \u201cThe business definitely grew after opening the store.\u201dThe store allowed her to display her entire range, and she became inspired by the women who came in and became loyal customers who \u201care now evolving with me,\u201d she said.Irene Neuwirth agrees that opening her own store on Melrose Place in Los Angeles last year has been pivotal to her company\u2019s development. \u201cOur business has increased everywhere because of the store. It\u2019s an incredible branding tool,\u201d she said.Having been among Barney New York\u2019s top-selling jewelry designers since introducing her colorful, feminine collection in 2003, Ms. Neuwirth says it is her relationships with the store owners who sell her jewels, and with the female customers who collect them, that has fueled her success.\u201cI\u2019ve built my business by building amazing friendships,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that\u2019s a very specific way women have of doing business, which, in the personal world of jewelry, gives them an advantage.\u201dMs. Neuwirth\u2019s clients frequently buy a piece after seeing the designer wearing it. Acting as a billboard for one\u2019s own jewelry is not something so easily achieved by a male designer, and Suzanne Syz believes that female designers also have the advantage of understanding what feels good.\u201cWe know what fits. I wear my designs to see if they\u2019re comfortable. We\u2019ve all had jewelry in the past that was too heavy,\u201d the Swiss designer said.Ms. Syz\u2019s colorful, one-of-a-kind haute jewelry is frequently inspired by art and marries fine craftsmanship with whimsy. Her tiny atelier in Geneva only produces around 25 pieces a year, and in New York last month, she announced her first watch.Called Her Ben, this limited-edition, bejeweled mystery watch was inspired by Big Ben in London, and took two years to complete. The watch has two faces, both realized in diamonds and a choice of rose or white gold or black titanium. Time literally stands still on the outside cover face, while the one inside is the real watch. The inscription opposite reminds the wearer: \u201cYou may delay, but time will not.\u201dMs. Syz says her select clients, primarily in Europe and the United States, many of whom are art collectors like herself, find traditional jewelry too staid and appreciate her mix of haute jewelry and tongue-in-cheek style.Cindy Chao also approaches jewelry as art, and the wonders of nature are her chief inspiration. She carves her miniature sculptures in wax, then has them realized in gold, titanium and precious stones at her workshops in Geneva, Paris and Lyon, France. She produces only 12 to 20 pieces a year.Her Black Label Masterpiece No. II Fish brooch took three years to complete. It is a large, glowing emerald representing the cheek of a puffer fish, and the surface is covered with more than 5,000 diamonds and sapphires. (Some pieces from the collection sell for $10 million.)The Taiwanese designer says her business now is roughly 65 percent in Asia, 20 percent in the Middle East and 15 percent in the United States and Europe. She opened a luxurious Hong Kong showroom this past spring, and is transferring her headquarters there from Taipei in an effort to establish herself in an international finance center with a more promising customer base.Despite the continued downturn in the Chinese economy, which has led many international luxury brands to close stores in the city, she believes serious jewelry collectors passing through Hong Kong are always looking for something unique. \u201cThere is still great demand from the real collectors if they see investment value,\u201d she said.For Ms. Chao, the first Taiwanese jeweler to have her work become part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History, growing her business is important but should not come at the expense of creating the perfect jewel: \u201cProduct is key. Scale doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cI sometimes ask myself: Is this a business? Is this art? Is it for myself?\u201d Ms. Chao said. \u201cI need to focus on making the best jewelry I can, on surprising people and making them see how jewelry can be art.\u201dTHE DESIGNERSSOLANGE AZAGURY-PARTRIDGELondonSolange Azagury-Partridge was working at a 20th century antique dealer in London when, disappointed by the engagement ring choices available, she designed her own. The resulting ring was so admired by friends and acquaintances that she introduced her own brand in 1990. In 2002 she was selected by Tom Ford to become creative director at Boucheron in Paris, an experience she describes as \u201clike attending the Oxbridge of jewelry design.\u201d Known for her jewelry\u2019s combination of color, sensuality and wit, she is in discussions with a London museum to curate a 2017 exhibition that will raise jewelry\u2019s profile as a serious art form.CAROLINA BUCCILondonIn 1885, Carolina Bucci\u2019s great-grandfather opened a store repairing pocket watches in Florence. The family business evolved to become a manufacturer of fine gold jewelry, and now its workshops produce all of Ms. Bucci\u2019s collections. Mixing traditional techniques with modern designs such as her signature woven-gold and silk thread friendship bracelets, the designer spends her time in London, Italy and New York, where her mother was born and where she started her business. With celebrity clients such as Victoria Beckham and Gwyneth Paltrow, she has developed an international following for luxurious jewels that are distinctive yet easy to layer with other pieces.CINDY CHAOHong KongCindy Chao grew up in Taiwan surrounded by creativity, the daughter of a sculptor and granddaughter of a famous architect. She launched Cindy Chao The Art Jewel in 2004 and has always approached her jewelry as miniature 3-D sculptures with minuscule detailing and a sense of light and balance. With a less-is-more philosophy of production, she only creates one of her signature butterflies every year and they have quickly become collectors\u2019 items. The Ballerina Butterfly brooch, designed with Sarah Jessica Parker, was sold at Sotheby\u2019s in October 2014 for $1.2 million, with $300,000 of the proceeds benefiting the New York City Ballet.IRENE NEUWIRTHLos AngelesIrene Neuwirth\u2019s bold, luxurious statement pieces in a rainbow of gems including opal, turquoise and tourmaline are a red carpet favorite, worn by the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Naomi Watts and Lena Dunham. Known for the interior design of her home in the Venice section and her store at Melrose Place in Los Angeles, she has been approached to become a lifestyle brand but is determined to focus on jewelry. \u201cI want to be a household name, and to have my jewelry passed down from generation to generation,\u201d said Ms. Neuwirth, who won the 2014 CFDA Swarovski Award for Accessory Design. As her boyfriend, the \u201cLego Movie\u201d director Phil Lord, decamping to London in 2016 for his next project, Ms. Neuwirth said she is looking forward to an opportunity to grow her international profile.SUZANNE SYZGenevaSuzanne Syz started creating her own pieces after finding traditional haute jewelry too outdated for her tastes. An avid modern art collector, her work was influenced by her friends Andy Warhol and Jean Michel Basquiat, whom she met while living in New York in the 1980s. Now based in Geneva, her perfectionist approach to her creations meant it took five years to complete her first collection and she continues to produce a very limited number of pieces. Her latest creation and first watch, Her Ben, took two years to complete and, unusually for a jewelry watch (they are normally quartz-powered), it has a mechanical movement from by Vaucher, one of haute horlogerie\u2019s finest manufacturers.Advertisement"}

Under the ordinance, it has committed to completing its transition and cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2035.The mayor, Kevin L. Faulconer, said San Diego\u2019s ocean, sunshine and other environmental attributes were \u201cin our fabric, our DNA, who we are.\u201dThe City Council is controlled by Democrats, but Mr. Faulconer is a Republican. He sold the plan to a conservative business base in part by saying that transforming the electric grid would drive the economy and create jobs.\u201cIt\u2019s not a partisan issue at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting a marker down. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dMany details have yet to be determined, including how the new power sources will be delivered and managed. But the mayor said the key first step was to commit to a goal \u2014 to \u201cmake sure we set it and hold to it.\u201dThe San Diego ordinance has been years in the making. But Nicole Capretz, an author of an earlier draft and now an environmental advocate, characterized it as a concrete step in the direction set by world leaders in Paris.\u201cWe\u2019re responding to that call,\u201d Ms. Capretz said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to cities to blaze new trails. We\u2019re just laying out the pathway for how to get these massive reductions worldwide.\u201dUnder the Paris accord, nations offered general, nonbinding plans to reduce their carbon emissions.Officials in the United States envision reaching the nation\u2019s goals mainly through higher fuel-economy standards for cars and a move to cleaner sources of electrical power, something states could help oversee.This is where the actions of a city like San Diego fit in. As the city moves to renewable energy, the State of California can begin to build its bank of carbon reductions and contribute to global goals.Evan Gillespie, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s clean energy campaign in California, estimated that San Diego\u2019s plan would lead to an annual reduction of seven million metric tons of greenhouse gases, a contribution to California\u2019s broader effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050.Ms. Capretz, who wrote a version of the plan for Mr. Faulconer\u2019s predecessor, said that much of the earlier version remained in the measure adopted Tuesday.Echoing the mayor, she said she expected that much of the renewable energy would come from solar power. \u201cWe\u2019re sunny in San Diego, so we\u2019re counting on a lot of homegrown solar on rooftops and parking lots,\u201d she said.Mr. Gillespie said San Diego had laid down a challenge to other cities. \u201cWe need others to see this and say, \u2018Game on,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he added. \u201cWe need places like Los Angeles, like San Francisco and New York, to step up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The detentions come amid rising labor unrest in southern China, one of the world\u2019s most important manufacturing centers, and are prompting concern that the Communist Party is extending its latest crackdown on civil society to a new arena.Mr. Zeng, a lawyer, is one of the most prominent labor organizers in China, and his nongovernmental organization helps workers win management concessions on pay and benefits. Although China, like many Communist countries, restricts the formation of independent labor unions, thousands of workers have nevertheless organized, and often gone on strike.But now, with many factories moving to regions where lower wages prevail \u2014 or to other countries, like Vietnam \u2014 labor unrest is rising, said Geoffrey Crothall, a spokesman for the China Labor Bulletin, which promotes independent labor unions in China and tracks strikes and other labor protests nationwide. Local governments in Guangdong are often the focus of workers\u2019 demands after factory bosses leave town, sometimes with wages and pension benefits in arrears, he said.\u201cClearly the rise in the number of protests and increase in labor activism has got the authorities worried,\u201d Mr. Crothall said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to respond. And the only solution they can come up with is by cracking down on the people who are actually trying to help.\u201dOne Chinese researcher on labor issues, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely about the arrests, said that at least 16 activists had been detained or questioned and released in the crackdown on the Panyu Workers\u2019 Center, or had disappeared with no information about their whereabouts. He said the detention of Mr. Zeng might have been a signal to workers not to get involved in labor movements outside the Communist Party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions.\u201cThey want to make an example of them for worker rights\u2019 defense in the future \u2014 don\u2019t get involved with these labor organizations,\u201d the researcher said. \u201cThey realize that the economic slowdown and decline of industry is creating widespread bankruptcies and unemployment, and labor incidents will increase.\u201d\u201cThere have been arrests and crackdowns before on grass-roots labor organizations here,\u201d one activist, He Shan, said in a telephone interview from Shenzhen, a mainland city that abuts Hong Kong. \u201cBut this is the most concentrated, the most serious. For us, this is unprecedented.\u201dWhat is also notable is that Guangdong\u2019s top official, Hu Chunhua, the provincial party secretary, is a member of the party Politburo and a rising star who has been mentioned as a possible top leader.\u201cWe are quite worried because if her detention lasts too long it is a big challenge for her family and her kid,\u201d Ms. Zeng said in a telephone interview.A call to the Public Security Bureau in Foshan went unanswered on Saturday.

{"Headline": "Bret Easton Ellis on Living in the Cult of Likability", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsOn a recent episode of the television series \u201cSouth Park,\u201d the character Cartman and other townspeople who are enthralled with Yelp, the app that lets customers rate and review restaurants, remind ma\u00eetre d\u2019s and waiters that they will be posting reviews of their meals. These \u201cYelpers\u201d threaten to give the eateries only one star out of five if they don\u2019t please them and do exactly as they say. The restaurants feel that they have no choice but to comply with the Yelpers, who take advantage of their power by asking for free dishes and making suggestions on improving the lighting. The restaurant employees tolerate all this with increasing frustration and anger \u2014 at one point Yelp reviewers are even compared to the Islamic State group \u2014 before both parties finally arrive at a truce. Yet unknown to the Yelpers, the restaurants decide to get their revenge by contaminating the Yelpers\u2019 plates with every bodily fluid imaginable.The point of the episode is that today everyone thinks that they\u2019re a professional critic (\u201cEveryone relies on my Yelp reviews!\u201d), even if they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. But it\u2019s also a bleak commentary on what has become known as the \u201creputation economy.\u201d In depicting the restaurants\u2019 getting their revenge on the Yelpers, the episode touches on the fact that services today are also rating us, which raises a question: How will we deal with the way we present ourselves online and in social media, and how do individuals brand themselves in what is a widening corporate culture?The idea that everybody thinks they\u2019re specialists with voices that deserve to be heard has actually made everyone\u2019s voice less meaningful. All we\u2019re doing is setting ourselves up to be sold to \u2014 to be branded, targeted and data-mined. But this is the logical endgame of the democratization of culture and the dreaded cult of inclusivity, which insists that all of us must exist under the same umbrella of corporate regulation \u2014 a mandate that dictates how we should express ourselves and behave.Most people of a certain age probably noticed this when they joined their first corporation, Facebook, which has its own rules regarding expressions of opinion and sexuality. Facebook encouraged users to \u201clike\u201d things, and because it was a platform where many people branded themselves on the social Web for the first time, the impulse was to follow the Facebook dictum and present an idealized portrait of their lives \u2014 a nicer, friendlier, duller self. And it was this burgeoning of the likability cult and the dreaded notion of \u201crelatability\u201d that ultimately reduced everyone to a kind of neutered clockwork orange, enslaved to the corporate status quo. To be accepted we have to follow an upbeat morality code where everything must be liked and everybody\u2019s voice respected, and any person who has a negative opinion \u2014 a dislike \u2014 will be shut out of the conversation. Anyone who resists such groupthink is ruthlessly shamed. Absurd doses of invective are hurled at the supposed troll to the point that the original \u201coffense\u201d often seems negligible by comparison.The news that will definitely happen in 2016.I\u2019ve been rated and reviewed since I became a published author at the age of 21, so this environment only seems natural to me. A reputation emerged based on how many reviewers liked or didn\u2019t like my book. That\u2019s the way it goes \u2014 cool, I guess. I was liked as often as I was disliked, and that was OK because I didn\u2019t get emotionally involved. Being reviewed negatively never changed the way I wrote or the topics I wanted to explore, no matter how offended some readers were by my descriptions of violence and sexuality. As a member of Generation X, rejecting, or more likely ignoring, the status quo came easily to me. One of my generation\u2019s loudest anthems was Joan Jett\u2019s \u201cBad Reputation,\u201d whose chorus rang out: \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about my reputation/ I\u2019ve never been afraid of any deviation.\u201d I was a target of corporate-think myself when the company that owned my publishing house decided it didn\u2019t like the contents of a particular novel I had been contracted to write and refused to publish it on the grounds of \u201ctaste.\u201d (I could have sued but another publisher who liked the book published it instead.) It was a scary moment for the arts \u2014 a conglomerate was deciding what should and should not be published and there were loud arguments and protests on both sides of the divide. But this was what the culture was about: People could have differing opinions and discuss them rationally. You could disagree and this was considered not only the norm but interesting as well. It was a debate. This was a time when you could be opinionated \u2014 and, yes, a questioning, reasonable critic \u2014 and not be considered a troll.Now all of us are used to rating movies, restaurants, books, even doctors, and we give out mostly positive reviews because, really, who wants to look like a hater? But increasingly, services are also rating us. Companies in the sharing economy, like Uber and Airbnb, rate their customers and shun those who don\u2019t make the grade. Opinions and criticisms flow in both directions, causing many people to worry about how they\u2019re measuring up. Will the reputation economy put an end to the culture of shaming or will the bland corporate culture of protecting yourself by \u201cliking\u201d everything \u2014 of being falsely polite just to be accepted by the herd \u2014 grow stronger than ever? Giving more positive reviews to get one back? Instead of embracing the true contradictory nature of human beings, with all of their biases and imperfections, we continue to transform ourselves into virtuous robots. This in turn has led to the awful idea \u2014 and booming business \u2014 of reputation management, where a firm is hired to help shape a more likable, relatable You. Reputation management is about gaming the system. It\u2019s a form of deception, an attempt to erase subjectivity and evaluation through intuition, for a price.Ultimately, the reputation economy is about making money. It urges us to conform to the blandness of corporate culture and makes us react defensively by varnishing our imperfect self so we can sell and be sold things. Who wants to share a ride or a house or a doctor with someone who doesn\u2019t have a good online reputation? The reputation economy depends on everyone maintaining a reverentially conservative, imminently practical attitude: Keep your mouth shut and your skirt long, be modest and don\u2019t have an opinion. The reputation economy is yet another example of the blanding of culture, and yet the enforcing of groupthink has only increased anxiety and paranoia, because the people who embrace the reputation economy are, of course, the most scared. What happens if they lose what has become their most valuable asset? The embrace of the reputation economy is an ominous reminder of how economically desperate people are and that the only tools they have to raise themselves up the economic ladder are their sparklingly upbeat reputations \u2014 which only adds to their ceaseless worry over their need to be liked.Empowerment doesn\u2019t come from liking this or that thing, but from being true to our messy contradictory selves. There are limits to showcasing our most flattering assets because no matter how genuine and authentic we think we are, we\u2019re still just manufacturing a construct, no matter how accurate it may be. What is being erased in the reputation economy are the contradictions inherent in all of us. Those of us who reveal flaws and inconsistencies become terrifying to others, the ones to avoid. An \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\u201d-like world of conformity and censorship emerges, erasing the opinionated and the contrarian, corralling people into an ideal. Forget the negative or the difficult. Who wants solely that? But what if the negative and the difficult were attached to the genuinely interesting, the compelling, the unusual? That\u2019s the real crime being perpetrated by the reputation culture: stamping out passion; stamping out the individual.Bret Easton Ellis is the author of six novels, including \u201cLess Than Zero,\u201d \u201cThe Rules of Attraction,\u201d \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d \u201cGlamorama,\u201d \u201cLunar Park\u201d and \u201cImperial Bedrooms\u201d and a collection of stories, \u201cThe Informers.\u201d He is also the host of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Negative Interest Rates Are Becoming the New Normal", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyCentral bankers have long talked about the problem of the \u201czero lower bound.\u201d That\u2019s the idea that interest rates can\u2019t be set below zero. It is an important concept because it would mean there is a limit on how much an economy can be stimulated using monetary policy.The last few years have exposed a problem with this idea. It now looks as if the zero lower bound isn\u2019t a bound. And it isn\u2019t at zero.This isn\u2019t supposed to happen. In theory, if banks charge a negative interest rate \u2014 that is, people with money deposited pay the bank, rather than the bank paying them \u2014 people should just withdraw funds from the banks entirely. Why pay for the privilege of parking money at a bank if you could instead withdraw cash, put it under your mattress and avoid the charge entirely?Economists have argued in the past that the only way to make significantly negative interest rates possible would be to eliminate cash money entirely, or else anytime rates fall below zero there could be mass withdrawals from the banking system (and mass purchases of safes, lockboxes and very secure mattresses).The Federal Reserve in the United States and Bank of England have kept their target rates above zero all along, partly out of fear that cutting lower would disrupt money markets in a way such that the costs wouldn\u2019t be worth the marginal impact on economic stimulus.The question all along has been this: Is there some tipping point at which negative rates would create mass withdrawals from the banking system?Well, maybe. But we aren\u2019t there yet.One way to think of what is happening right now is as a grand experiment of \u201chow low can they go.\u201d Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, pointedly avoided answering questions at his news conference Thursday about whether the central bank had now arrived at its true lower bound, insisting only that the new negative 0.3 percent rate was appropriate right now. In other words, further cutting hasn\u2019t been ruled out.The flaw in the old concept of the \u201czero lower bound\u201d seems to have been this: There are a lot of benefits to keeping money in a bank besides the interest you earn. If you keep $10,000 in savings in a bank, and the bank gets robbed, you\u2019re unaffected; the bank is on the hook for the losses. If you keep it in your freezer, theft is your problem. The peace of mind of having your $10,000 in a federally insured bank account and the ability to write a check to make a purchase or wire money to a family member are valuable. More valuable, it seems likely, than the $30 in annual costs that would apply if the Fed put in place the E.C.B.\u2019s new negative 0.3 percent rate.The experience in Europe over the last year \u2014 really the absence of some catastrophe with negative rates \u2014 helps explain why one Fed official argued at the central bank\u2019s September meeting that American interest rates should also be slightly negative. (The official is unnamed in official projections, but Fed watchers believe it is Narayana Kocherlakota, the Minneapolis Fed president.)What we\u2019re learning from Europe about negative rates and the nonexistence of the zero lower bound is an exemplar for a lot of monetary experimentation over the last six years. Tools that existed as academic thought experiments a decade ago are now becoming standard-issue parts of the central banks\u2019 policy tool kit. Strategies tried briefly by small countries like Denmark are embraced by the giants of the world economy.In other words, we know a lot more now than we did a decade ago about what works in extreme monetary situations. It\u2019s just too bad we had to learn these lessons the hard way \u2014 through years upon years of trial and error, with lots of economic suffering along the way.Advertisement"}

Even more challenging, they also take on thorny issues that executives elsewhere tend to avoid, like economic disparities and racial discrimination.Think of it as The Establishment 2.0: more diverse than the nearly all-white and male establishment of old, to be sure, but every bit as powerful, and just as invisible when need be.\u201cItasca operates behind the scenes,\u201d said Tim Welsh, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, which hosts the weekly breakfasts at its offices in the IDS Center here. \u201cWe all know each other but we are clearly not recognized as the people of Itasca.\u201dItasca\u2019s impact is very real, however. And its consensus-oriented approach offers an alternative path at a time when politics nationally \u2014 and in many state capitols \u2014 seems hopelessly divided along partisan lines.While Itasca would just as soon stay out of the limelight, the levers of power in the Twin Cities are within easy reach. The guest list for the weekly breakfasts downtown includes the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, as well as local legislators, school superintendents and university officials.So when a proposal to raise the gasoline tax in 2008 to help rebuild roads and transit systems was vetoed by the Republican governor at the time, Tim Pawlenty, phone calls from Itasca\u2019s business leaders helped persuade enough Republican legislators to cross the aisle and override the veto.More recently, pressure from Itasca helped secure increased funding for the state\u2019s college and university system. Itasca also spearheaded the creation of a new regional agency to attract companies looking to move or expand, as well as an effort to encourage procurement chiefs at local giants like Target and Xcel Energy to buy more goods and services locally.Itasca\u2019s work is among the reasons that the Twin Cities region has emerged as an economic powerhouse. At 2.9 percent, the metropolitan area\u2019s unemployment rate is well below the national level of 5 percent.At the same time, Minnesota has excelled in creating the kinds of higher-paid, knowledge- and skills-based jobs that provide entree into the middle class today. With that in mind, Itasca has drawn interest from leaders in American cities and abroad who would like to emulate its success.That will not be easy. Part of what makes Itasca work is also what has helped Minnesota prosper: a long history of progressive and engaged business leaders, a largely homogeneous population with a low poverty rate and a consensus-driven Midwestern culture where egos are checked at the door, or at least not displayed too openly.\u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t serve anybody to take credit,\u201d said Jennifer Ford Reedy, president of the Bush Foundation, a major philanthropy here, and a former McKinsey consultant who advised the Itasca group. \u201cThe people who need to know what Itasca is doing are the participants. That\u2019s it.\u201dIn fact, Itasca has no building, budget or full-time staff, other than two McKinsey consultants who coordinate research and logistics for Itasca members.Business establishments, of course, are hardly unique to Minnesota. Most big cities \u2014 and many smaller towns \u2014 have chambers of commerce, not to mention economic development offices and the like.What makes Itasca unique, participants say, is a commitment to hard data and McKinsey-style analysis, as well as a willingness to depart from the script that drives many private sector lobbies.\u201cWe\u2019re not just asking for lower taxes and less regulation,\u201d said David Mortenson, the current chairman of the Itasca Project. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking on education or income disparity as a group of business leaders, we want to be able to break some eggs.\u201dThat\u2019s different from what happens in most other cities, said Mr. Mortenson, who earlier this year took over M. A. Mortenson, a nationwide construction firm founded by his grandfather.In Seattle, where Mr. Mortenson lived for nine years before moving back to Minneapolis in 2012, \u201cmost of the big tech companies viewed the city as a convenient location to house some of its workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t engage unless it affected their business.\u201d\u201cTech leaders are very philanthropic,\u201d he added, \u201cbut they disconnect it from their business.\u201dThat has never been a problem here: The Pillsbury family and other members of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce helped pay for the construction of the railroad to move grain and flour in the 1800s. And the current governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, is a scion of the family that founded the Dayton Dry Goods Company, which grew into a retail giant and more recently morphed into Target Corporation.But by the beginning of the 21st century, that paternalistic, locally minded model of capitalism was fading, said James R. Campbell, a local banker who served in top positions at Norwest Banks and Wells Fargo before retiring in 2002.In 2001, Target rebranded the iconic Dayton\u2019s store downtown as Marshall Field\u2019s, the Chicago chain it had acquired in 1990. (Marshall Field\u2019s was later sold to Macy\u2019s.)Also in 2001, 3M, a pillar of the old business establishment based in St. Paul, brought in an outsider as chief executive for the first time in its 100-year history: W. James McNerney Jr. of General Electric. \u201cWe were concerned that this flyover land was not organized,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who oversaw the creation of Itasca in 2003 with other local business chiefs along with the leaders of major philanthropies. They took the name from Itasca State Park in northern Minnesota, where business leaders had met annually in the 1950s and 1960s to discuss issues facing the state.Existing groups like the Chamber of Commerce and the Minnesota Business Partnership were focused \u201con lower taxes and less regulation,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were not addressing other issues like income disparities,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who served as chairman of Itasca from 2003 to 2008, and helped initiate the Working Team breakfasts on Friday mornings in conjunction with the McKnight Foundation and Mr. Welsh of McKinsey. \u201cThe chamber didn\u2019t want to touch that.\u201dNor was the business community focused on areas that were crucial to long-term economic development, like transportation and infrastructure. \u201cWhat were we going to do about job growth?\u201d Mr. Campbell said he wondered at the time. \u201cWhat about marketing ourselves?\u201dThe question of self-promotion helped inspire the creation of Greater MSP, an economic development agency that has put the region on the radar of corporate site selectors while overcoming Minnesotans\u2019 traditional reluctance to brag about themselves.A bigger test of Itasca\u2019s reach \u2014 and of the willingness of the local establishment to go outside their comfort zone \u2014 came in 2008, when Governor Pawlenty vetoed a proposed increase in gas and sales taxes to fund $6.6 billion in transportation improvements.A rush-hour bridge collapse over the Mississippi River in downtown Minneapolis the year before had killed 13 people and galvanized worries about aging infrastructure nationwide. But there was fierce opposition to what would be the first gas tax increase in 20 years.At the same time, Governor Pawlenty was eyeing a White House run and had made a no-new-taxes pledge. None of the governor\u2019s previous vetoes had been overridden, but Itasca\u2019s members helped move the debate beyond the usual left-right dynamic.Mr. Campbell donned a hard hat and a fluorescent vest and stood with union leaders on the capitol steps to rally support. He and other business executives privately made the case to Republican legislators that traffic jams and long commutes were not good for employees or employers.In the end, six Republican legislators defied the governor, and the veto was overridden by a two-vote margin.\u201cI can\u2019t overstate the importance of the Itasca Project leadership on the transportation issue,\u201d said Chris Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul. \u201cThere\u2019s no question it changed the trajectory of the debate.\u201dWhile the case for better infrastructure is straightforward, other Itasca initiatives will take much longer to show concrete results. One major focus of the group is income inequality, as well as the high dropout and unemployment rates among minorities.The gap between the refined atmosphere at the McKinsey aerie and the problems in local neighborhoods can be awkward even for people with the best of intentions. In fact, while Itasca leaders talk up the importance of diversity, minorities are conspicuously absent from the Working Team. (They are much better represented within the larger Itasca membership.)Social issues may be less amenable to business-sector solutions than crumbling roads and bridges, but that has not stopped Itasca from pushing for McKinsey-style benchmarks to measure the performance of local public schools.The group is also spearheading a new effort to better equip the state\u2019s two- and four-year college systems to produce graduates with the skills that today\u2019s employers need.\u201cThe research they\u2019ve done on education and hiring has really influenced my agenda,\u201d said Betsy Hodges, the mayor of Minneapolis. \u201cIt puts wind in our sails to know that the business community thinks these issues are important.\u201dAs might be expected from boosters whose job it is to promote economic growth and talk up the Twin Cities\u2019 appeal, many Itasca participants express confidence that their project could be replicated elsewhere. Mr. Campbell, though, is less sure.\u201cMy answer is maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a unique willingness to trust each other here. It\u2019s kind of in our blood.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Near Deal on Billions in Tax Cuts", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican and Democratic negotiators closed in Friday on a major package of tax cuts for businesses and individuals that could exceed $700 billion in forgone revenues over a decade, and planned to work through the weekend in hopes that Congress can approve it before quitting for the year.The package would extend or make permanent around 50 temporary tax breaks that have expired or will soon lapse. By combining business breaks that are priorities of Republicans with tax credits for lower-income workers and families that are critical to Democrats, negotiators are seeking a balanced package that could transcend the partisanship that often paralyzes Congress.Among its most significant parts, the proposed deal on the so-called tax extenders would make permanent a tax credit for corporations\u2019 research and development expenses that dates to 1981. That credit has been extended more than a dozen times, but for no more than a year or two \u2014 largely to minimize the official price tag of its extension. A popular write-off for small businesses\u2019 major purchases also would be made permanent.\u201cI sense a real appetite for a balanced deal that incorporates priorities the Democrats have, priorities that Republicans have, that will provide a measure of certainty and predictability to the economy, and provide growth and the ability for working families to get ahead,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview on Friday.\u201cAll sides agree that this has to be a multiyear bill,\u201d Mr. Wyden added, to give more predictability to businesses and individual taxpayers.But a multiyear measure making a number of tax breaks permanent would also raise the cost of the legislation. The research and development credit, the single costliest business item, would reduce revenues by about $110 billion over the first decade.The centrist group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has put the total package\u2019s expense at about $700 billion \u2014 a sum that people familiar with the negotiations did not dispute \u2014 or about $840 billion counting interest on the additional federal debt. The group has called the emerging package \u201ca fiscally irresponsible bipartisan deal.\u201dFor decades, Republicans as well as many Democrats, including Mr. Obama, have called for making some of the tax extenders permanent, including the research credit. But they could not agree on offsetting savings, mainly because Republicans refused to increase other taxes.Now, with both parties colluding to waive the pay-as-you-go principle that legislation should not increase annual deficits, the negotiators from the House and Senate tax committees \u2014 in consultation with congressional leaders and the Obama administration \u2014 have bid up the size of the package over days of talks.Among other provisions under consideration is one opposed by the White House \u2014 yet favored by many Democrats and unions \u2014 that would delay for two years, until 2020, a tax on generous \u201cCadillac\u201d health insurance plans provided by employers. The tax was included in Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act to help pay for the insurance program and to reduce health care spending over all by encouraging consumers to be more cost-conscious.Negotiators also are considering whether to suspend for two years another tax in the health insurance law, a levy on medical device manufacturers.By week\u2019s end, people in both parties suggested the tax package was becoming a Christmas tree that could fall of its own weight. Supporters argue that many of the tax breaks have been on the books for years, but that short-term extensions have masked their long-term cost. Making them permanent and conceding the revenue loss upfront would amount to more honest budgeting, supporters say.To critics among budget watchdogs and some Democrats, the deal, if it comes together, could set a troubling double standard, with only new spending \u2014 but not tax breaks \u2014 requiring offsetting budget cuts to avoid adding to deficits. Republicans, who now control both houses of Congress, have long argued that tax cuts do not need to be paid for with budget cuts. Now Democrats are going along in return for Republicans\u2019 dropping their opposition to tax breaks for the working poor.In contrast, Congress and the White House agreed to a bipartisan deal for new spending in October, and a highway measure this week, only after hard-fought compromises on budget cuts to pay for the spending increases.Some Democrats in the House and Senate have registered protests, although a meeting of Senate Democrats on Thursday showed greater support for the emerging package than many expected. Among the opponents is Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the Finance Committee, who recalled the hard fights to win a bit more spending for education, infrastructure, medical research.\u201cYet people now are talking about spending $800 billion in lost revenue \u2014 that\u2019s spending,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cFor those of us who think there are key areas where government needs to invest more \u2014 you know, education, infrastructure, research \u2014 if we spend the money on tax relief, on a so-called tax extender package, then it\u2019s hard to make the case that we can spend money on other key priorities.\u201dSenator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, sent a letter to Mr. Wyden signed by her and four other senators calling for the tax bill to be paid for by curbing tax breaks for hedge-fund managers and corporate executives\u2019 compensation.The Republican Study Committee in the House, which includes most Republicans there, circulated its demands to end tax breaks for renewable energy, including wind and solar projects, and to require proof of legal status before workers can claim tax breaks. Democrats are protecting the renewable energy provisions, but discussing ways to address Republicans\u2019 concerns about undocumented workers getting tax breaks.The tax package would phase out over five years a bonus depreciation tax break for corporations, which was intended as a short-term stimulus measure, and two provisions that benefit foreign corporations and American multinational corporations. Republicans wanted to make the corporate breaks permanent, but Democrats and the administration objected, especially given the recent controversy involving Pfizer and other corporations that have acquired foreign companies to relocate in countries with lower corporate taxes.A tentative trade-off would have Republicans agreeing to the five-year phaseout of the corporate tax breaks they favor in return for Democrats dropping their insistence on indexing the child tax credit so it increases in value with inflation. But House Democrats, led by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, have been insisting on indexing the child credit.Advertisement"}

In the last month alone, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has blamed public relations for his problems with homelessness (\u201cI have not communicated sufficiently\u201d) and the backlash to his affordable housing plan (\u201cWe\u2019re not explaining it well enough\u201d).Facing the lowest approval ratings of his tenure, as well as questions about his re-election chances, Mr. de Blasio has said the problem is packaging, not substance. He has stood fast on his liberal policies, saying he is convinced that he is changing New Yorkers\u2019 lives for the better.But in interviews, numerous supporters of Mr. de Blasio say they remain concerned about the mayor\u2019s messaging instincts, saying he falls prey to distractions and has failed to capitalize on his accomplishments.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to do the work,\u201d said Sid Davidoff, a lobbyist and one of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s close friends in government. \u201cYou also have to tell the story.\u201dSeveral supporters said they were dismayed on Tuesday when Mr. de Blasio, just a day after pledging to better explain himself to New Yorkers, unveiled a major new workers\u2019 rights policy and did little to promote it personally.\u201cIt was odd,\u201d said State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, saying aloud what allies of the mayor repeated, in more colorful terms, during private conversations about the episode.\u201cHe has a very different style about these things than other people in politics,\u201d said Ms. Krueger, who supports many of the mayor\u2019s initiatives. \u201cSome people do press conferences because the sun came out. And some people, apparently, not so much.\u201d\u201cIt is a learning curve that the mayor has been on now for his two years in office,\u201d Ms. Krueger added.Good coverage can be distinct from good governing, but in New York City especially, with its vibrant news market, the two are often intertwined. Mr. Davidoff and Ms. Krueger both said they had nudged the mayor to promote his achievements more aggressively.Phil Walzak, a senior adviser to the mayor who oversees communication strategy, said Mr. de Blasio planned to devote more time next year talking about his policies at events like town-hall-style meetings.\u201cThis administration talks to many audiences, many times, and through many different communications channels,\u201d Mr. Walzak said. A large rally with the mayor and supporters, he said, is in the works for January.Still, Mr. de Blasio, a former political operative, is not a natural showman.He dislikes being photographed, telling aides that he is uncomfortable with the artificial nature of posing for a portrait. He has lamented his loss of privacy in a high-profile job. \u201cI miss all the things that went with my previous life,\u201d he said last week.At City Hall, the mayor has a public-relations team devoted to advancing his agenda. But he is known to second-guess their advice, and he is often seen at news conferences rearranging lecterns and tinkering with stagecraft.His reputation as a micromanager has made it difficult to recruit. This year, the role of press secretary \u2014 once considered among the most prestigious in city government \u2014 went unfilled for three months. At least three candidates approached about the $170,000-a-year role declined to pursue it.\u201cDe Blasio likes to be his own chief of staff,\u201d said a mayoral adviser who, like other allies interviewed for this article, insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about a mayor who values loyalty. \u201cMy guess is he likes to be his own communications director, too.\u201dIn recent months, the mayor has gradually shed some bad habits. He now mostly arrives on time to news conferences and refrains from chastising the news media. He has appeared on local radio stations after months of declining to take listeners\u2019 questions. His aides pledged to avoid distractions in the new year.Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group that has forged some alliances with City Hall, said she believed Mr. de Blasio was taking steps \u201cto reach beyond the liberal people that he\u2019s been very comfortable communicating with throughout his career.\u201dBut Ms. Wylde said challenges remained. \u201cHe is very principled,\u201d she said of the mayor, \u201cand he does not want to adjust his message to constituencies that he basically doesn\u2019t agree with.\u201d\u201cThe critique against him during the election was that he was a savvy political operator but would be a crummy manager,\u201d Mr. Zeff wrote last week. \u201cIt\u2019s turned out the opposite is true.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draghi Says No Limits on European Stimulus Measures", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a speech to Wall Street investors, the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, reinforced his promise to do all in his power to push Europe\u2019s stagnating economy toward a full recovery.The address, with its bold language and clearly stated goals, seemed to be an attempt by Mr. Draghi \u2014 who, perhaps more than any central banker alive, relies on the power of his words to move markets \u2014 to respond to the disappointing market reaction after the latest stimulus measures he announced on Thursday.He emphasized, as well, the stimulative effect of the decision to extend the bank\u2019s program of purchasing about 60 billion euros\u2019 worth of bonds a month to March 2017 (or beyond) and to reinvest the principal from these securities.That would mean that 680 billion euros in extra cash \u2014 about 6.5 percent of overall output in the eurozone \u2014 would be pumped into European capital markets by 2019, he reminded investors.Those words gave people the confidence to plunge back into the market and buy European government bonds in bulk, and they underscored the extent to which Mr. Draghi was willing to take his message directly to investors when he sensed that his monthly news conferences were not doing the trick.This time, however, the situation is different. Unlike in 2012, there is no existential threat to the euro. But after more than a year of stimulus from Mr. Draghi and just the faintest glimmer of an economic recovery, the markets were expecting another powerful jolt from \u201cSuper Mario,\u201d as he is known on trading desks throughout the world.On a panel that followed his talk, the former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, cited those famous words when he asked Mr. Draghi why the markets had not responded to his latest suite of policy actions.Mr. Draghi is the coolest of customers when he is on the public stage, rarely showing emotion in terms of how the markets respond to what he says and does.\u201cLike central banks everywhere, we have those that dissent,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cBut the bottom line is that Q.E. is here to stay.\u201dThen, in case there was any room for doubt, Mr. Draghi said that the European Central Bank had \u201cthe power to act and the determination to act and the commitment to act.\u201dOn the panel, Mr. Draghi also took the opportunity to respond to critics \u2014 primarily in Germany \u2014 who contend that his extra-easy policies, and the sharp drop in government borrowing rates they have precipitated, have caused European governments to backtrack on their reform commitments.\u201cLow interest rates have no correlation to governments not willing to make reforms,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. Does a government, he asked, decide to not go forward with a plan to overhaul its pension or health sector just because rates are low?\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he opined.He pointed out, too, that countries like Spain and Italy have pushed forward politically difficult labor market reforms at the same time that interest rates remained low.Mr. Draghi did his best to make clear that governments needed to do more in terms of improving their tax policies and regulatory climates for business if a true recovery was to take shape in Europe.\u201cMonetary policies cannot achieve everything,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

They also belong to a persecuted social group: Afghans who believe they have the right to choose their own spouses, in defiance of their parents.But there is a further clause in the Geneva Convention\u2019s Article 1 that adds the condition that the persecuted party has to be \u201coutside the country of nationality.\u201d And, as diplomats and relief officials told the couple, they could make their case for asylum only by taking their chances as refugees.Mr. Betts conceded that a legal, safer alternative for asylum seekers might well encourage even larger numbers to apply. (As one American Embassy official in Kabul commented about Zakia and Mohammad Ali, \u201cIf we let them apply here, half the country would be lined up at the door.\u201d) Europeans have been reluctant to do anything that would be seen as an inducement, especially after seeing the large increase in migrants after Germany said it would consider all comers. Nonetheless, \u201cIs the cost of a slight additional pull factor worthwhile if it saves lives, reduces costs, undercuts smugglers\u2019 markets and helps states meet their international obligations?\u201d Mr. Betts asked.ANOTHER potential advantage of screening refugees closer to their countries of origin is that it would help prevent costly deportations for those whose requests are rejected. Countries on the receiving end might also be better equipped to manage the flow of migrants, as well as the support and assistance available for them. And screening asylum seekers before they arrived would help alleviate fears in Europe of terrorist infiltration \u2014 especially after evidence that at least one of the Paris attackers arrived through the Greek migrant trail.Kilian Kleinschmidt, a former refugee worker who runs the Innovation and Planning Agency, which promotes alternative solutions for the world\u2019s poor, said the international community had thus far been unwilling to invest in solutions. \u201cWe need a big, big stabilization program combined with legal means for people to move through the world and have prospects,\u201d he said. The entire global humanitarian budget, including refugee costs, is only about $24.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the $300 billion in debt relief that Europe has spent on propping up the Greek economy, Mr. Kleinschmidt noted.Ms. Sarwari, too, would like to leave Afghanistan, but has not received a visa despite her pleas to officials at the American and German Embassies in Kabul. Instead, she has received the unofficial advice to flee like everyone else, and then apply. She certainly has an excellent case to make \u2014 if she survives to present it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Marriages of Power Couples Reinforce Income Inequality", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe notion of \u201cmaking a good match,\u201d a staple of the writings of Jane Austen and Henry James, continues in contemporary romance novels. At the same time, income inequality commands increasing attention from economists. Lately we\u2019ve been learning just how much these two topics are tied together.These days, an investment banker may marry another investment banker rather than a high school sweetheart, or a lawyer will marry another lawyer, or a prestigious client, rather than a secretary. Whether measured in terms of income or education, there are more so-called power couples today than in the past, one manifestation of a phenomenon known as assortative mating, or more generally the pairing of like with like.These matches are great for those individuals who can build prosperous and happy family alliances, but they also propagate inequality across the generations. Of all the causes behind growing income inequality, in the longer run this development may prove one of the most significant and also one of the hardest to counter.Money and talent become clustered in high-powered, two-earner families determined to do everything possible to advance the interests of their children. There is some long-term benefit for society, since many innovators and business creators will receive their initial boosts early in their lives, including the very best training in childhood, and that may enhance their eventual productivity.But there are also serious economic costs. As it becomes harder for many people to \u201cmarry up\u201d as a path for income mobility for themselves or their children, families that are not well connected may feel disengaged, and the significant, family-based advantages for some children may discourage others from even trying.The G.I. Bill may have helped lower assortative mating, because it gave opportunities for upward mobility to economic classes that had not enjoyed it. In general, the greater the number of men entering the middle class, the more socioeconomic mixing will occur.In 1950 it was also the case that marriage ages were especially young, meaning that couples often paired off from high school and may have had less of a sense how to match to each other by expected income or education. And most women had fewer chances to earn very much, so few if any men were searching hard to find future law partners or doctors.Universal preschool, further experiments with charter schools, and higher subsidies or tax credits for children are among the policy innovations that might lift opportunities for children of lower earners. Even if those are good ideas, it is not clear how much they can overturn the advantage that comes from being a child of highly educated, highly motivated parents with lots of will and also money to spend on lessons, outings, travel and other investments in the future of their children.Today, we rightfully reject the idea of eugenics as repugnant, yet we are conducting our own experiments in mating, without much careful thought as to where they will lead. Match.com and Tinder help us find \u201cjust the right mate,\u201d according to our prior desires and specifications, with aid from computer algorithms. The real question may be not whether we can reverse some of the less desired effects of assortative mating, but rather just how far the practice will go.An article last Sunday about the economic effect of choosing mates of like income and education misstated, using statistics from a study that was later corrected, the effect on a standard measure of income equality of importing marriage patterns of 1960 into 2005. The mating patterns, combined with labor supply, marriage and divorce decisions, would account for a 33.3 percent rise in income inequality, not a drop in income inequality to 0.34 from 0.43 on a scale of zero to one.Advertisement"}

The role of Mr. Hatz, one of the first employees suspended by the company when the crisis broke, is considered a pivotal one in myriad investigations into Volkswagen\u2019s decision-making by prosecutors in the United States, Germany and elsewhere.Mr. Hatz, 56, was one of a coterie of executives from VW\u2019s Audi brand brought over to run the parent company in 2007 by Martin Winterkorn, who was Audi\u2019s chief until he took over as VW\u2019s chief executive that year. One of Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s first moves was to name Mr. Hatz, the head of engines and transmission development at Audi, to do the same job for the entire company.Mr. Hatz\u2019s elevation came during a bitter internal clash about what kind of emissions technology Volkswagen should use to ensure that the company\u2019s diesels would comply with tougher American emissions standards \u2014 a clash that ultimately led the company to cheat on emissions tests. While Mr. Hatz was an advocate for diesels, he has also spoken out in the past about the struggle to meet regulations in the American market, according to a review of his statements and public records.Mr. Hatz declined to comment through a spokesman at Porsche, where he has served on the management board as chief of research and development.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about transport; our business, it\u2019s also about pleasure,\u201d he said.While Mr. Hatz was referring to carbon dioxide regulations, and Volkswagen\u2019s cheating scandal is centered on smog-forming pollutants, managing both kinds of emissions presents an interlocking puzzle for automakers.At times, Mr. Hatz could sound defeatist. \u201cPerhaps we have just small Korean and Japanese cars in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be realistic.\u201dAnd he was dismissive of the prospects for the big Detroit automakers. \u201cI cannot see a way with their program that they can fulfill these regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.At the time, California regulators, along with regulators in Washington, already had rules in place for emissions of nitrogen oxides and other smog-forming pollutants that were the toughest in the world, and California was also proposing to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars.While diesels have better fuel economy and, by extension, lower emissions of global warming gases, they have higher emissions of nitrogen oxides and other smog-forming pollutants that require special treatment systems. The company was plunged into an internal struggle about how to proceed.Behind the scenes, Mr. Hatz was part of a faction at the company that supported using a less expensive system that did not require urea, according to two Volkswagen managers who were in a position to witness the clashes. The managers requested anonymity because they did not want to jeopardize their relationships with Volkswagen. Mr. Hatz\u2019s viewpoint won out and the technology-sharing arrangement was soon scrapped.Though he was the executive ultimately responsible for engine development, it remains unclear if Mr. Hatz or executives above him were aware of or directed the cheating that took place. The central role of Mr. Hatz in the scandal raises questions about what Volkswagen\u2019s former chief executive, Mr. Winterkorn, and its current chief, Matthias M\u00fcller, themselves knew or should have known. But both are detail-oriented engineers who worked closely with Mr. Hatz for years, first at Audi and then at its parent company, Volkswagen. Mr. Winterkorn was deeply involved in engine development, leading a steering committee aimed at charting how the company would meet future limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Mr. Hatz was a member of the committee.Mr. M\u00fcller was another top lieutenant of Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s who was brought in from Audi; he became product planning chief of Volkswagen. After Mr. M\u00fcller was named to lead the Porsche division in 2010, he brought over Mr. Hatz to lead research and development.Both Mr. Winterkorn and Mr. M\u00fcller have denied knowing about the cheating that took place.\u201cThere was a tolerance for breaking the rules,\u201d Hans-Dieter P\u00f6tsch, Volkswagen\u2019s chairman, said at a news conference. \u201cIt proves not to have been a one-time error,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather a chain of errors that were allowed to happen.\u201dDanny Hakim reported from London, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consider (Cooking) the Clam", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEat\u2018\u2018To catch a clam,\u2019\u2019 begins a book I find profound on many subjects, \u2018\u2018you must first find it.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Curtis Badger, the author, is aware that with his pleonasm, he risks sounding obvious. But he has his reasons. To him, finding a clam entails thinking like one. Clams are so different from humans that good interspecies relations demand sometimes considering just what a clam is after: a shallow, sandy substrate of the ocean floor, in a salt marsh, amid Spartina grasses, surrounded by other clams and a steady tidal flow.In addition to helping you catch one, this inventory of the clam\u2019s needs also supplies a crucial reminder: The domestic clam, found in saltwater columns along all of our coasts, is today, as ever, one of the very best beings for humans to find, catch and cook. (\u2018\u2018Clams: How to Find, Catch and Cook Them\u2019\u2019 is the 2002 book\u2019s comprehensive title.) There seems to be a certain group of happy eaters who are scared to cook clams, sufferers of a clamophobia that keeps the many advantages of clam cooking out of reach. Revisiting Mr. Badger recently convinced me that it is a fear \u2014 like that of heights or open water \u2014 worth mastering.The clam population is strong. Clams are harvested at low tide, generally raked by hand or at worst shallow-dredged. Though they can make for cold digging in the winter, clams are available and fine to eat year-round. Most at seafood stores are farmed, but culinarily speaking, the farmed clam, bred and schooled alongside its wild kin, tastes as rich, sweet and saline as its savage sibling. And the farmed clam represents the rare aquaculture specimen that is beneficial to the ecosystem in which it is raised. Clams, like oysters, are filter feeders. Their insides chug along, unconsciously benevolent sieves, improving the quality of water that moves through them.Clams are also ancient human food. Shell middens prove that humans on seashores on every continent have been thinking like clams and finding and catching them since we shed our scales and emerged from their midst. Moreover, clams are Good for You \u2014 full of zinc, iron and B vitamins. Folklore even considers them on the near side of moral health, even as their kissing cousin, the oyster, is suspected of inspiring all sorts of hungers, namely for human flesh and for more oysters. I do not know how the clam ended up the virgin and the oyster the harlot, other than to admit that in my personal experience, she who is moved to order a dozen cherrystones over a dozen Belons eats to live, rather than the reverse.For those wondering about the clam\u2019s perspective on all this, it is worth noting that a clam has no brain. (To \u2018\u2018think like a clam\u2019\u2019 is rhetorical.) A clam comprises two graceful curved shells, symmetrical and ringed, connected by a muscle. It is probably true that, as Mr. Badger attests, the phrase \u2018\u2018happy as a clam\u2019\u2019 was invented because the simple bivalve \u2018\u2018has only two goals in life: to eat and to have sex.\u2019\u2019Whence the clamophobia? Perhaps it\u2019s because whenever you start to read about cooking clams, you come immediately upon the sorts of tips that telegraph the existence of serious, implicit problems. There are strategies \u2018\u2018to get rid of grit.\u2019\u2019 We are warned \u2018\u2018to keep from overcooking.\u2019\u2019 And to make sure a clam is alive, not dead, because eating a clam that has died in its shell is known to make you very sick. But most clams aren\u2019t grittier than a hard wash under cold tap water will resolve; truly gritty clams just need to be washed repeatedly, even after cooking, until they surrender the last of their sand. Clams, unlike oysters, do not go from delicious to terrible in a mistaken extra minute of cooking. (Still, I find a good rule in my correspondence with a South Carolinian gastronome on the subject of edible mollusks: \u2018\u2018What\u2019s the old joke?\u2019\u2019 he asked. \u2018\u2018Best way to cook fish is to have a waiter put it on a tray and walk it very slowly through a hot kitchen.\u2019\u2019) As for the fear you will mistakenly eat or serve a bad one: As with oysters, a dead clam can be smelled from a mile away.By some fallacy of reasoning, the clam has also ended up in a category with labor-intensive foods. You can buy a boneless chicken breast or a fillet of fish, but clams are still sold, even by the quickest mart, in their shells. The closest clams get to the boneless-chicken-breast category is in a can. We all draw the line somewhere. Many draw it at the can. I have had very good canned clams, especially from Spain, where delicate cockles are sealed, in pure natural brine and seawater, in beautiful flat tins. But there remains some redundancy in canning them: To a degree, clams self-can, which is why, the instant they burst open in response to a cook\u2019s salvo, they are afloat in broth. We have not improved on the technology, because that is a fool\u2019s errand. I don\u2019t know what the false reasoning that makes the clam seem inconvenient is called, but I should find out. I think it is the blockade between us and our clams.There is also the obstacle of opening clams. I\u2019m a coward about clam-opening \u2014 in a way I am not when faced with a closed oyster, which I will wrench open happily and fairly safely, whether with an oyster knife or a screwdriver. A clam\u2019s hinge is tighter, its shell harder, the whole ordeal risker. Badger provides three knife-and-hinge-focused techniques but voices the same reservations I have: \u2018\u2018The only drawback to these three methods is that there is something inherently dangerous about combining knives and clamshells.\u2019\u2019 He freezes his clams. I steam mine open, sharing the cookbook writer James Peterson\u2019s opinion, in his definitive \u2018\u2018Fish and Shellfish,\u2019\u2019 that as long as a clam\u2019s final destination is in a hot dish \u2014 like a soup, or a stew, or a boil, broil or bake \u2014 as long as you are attentive and agile and scoop it up the instant it gasps open, the preparation won\u2019t suffer, and you will be spared bloodshed.For reasons that relate to the high moral stature of the clam \u2014 that the Yankee who values clams in his diet values economy too \u2014 a clam baking on anything other than a natural bed of smoking sea grass is generally robbed of its nature. Usually it gets combined with a heavy onion and bread-crumb or cracker-crumb mixture (which does tasteless foods the charity of providing flavor but flavorful foods the disservice of homogenizing). It is a testament to the clam that, even so corrupted, it will still taste good. But it won\u2019t touch the perfection of a clambaked clam.It is a gulf I\u2019ve been curious to bridge \u2014 and one of the only things in the world of clams that Badger\u2019s book doesn\u2019t teach me to do. In the accompanying recipe, I try my best without him: steaming clams open with added clam juice to underline their clamness, cooking the resulting broth down to a thick gloss. I add a few strong bits of greenery, to return to the clams something of the deep green sea. These taste to me as if they are in their element, though only the mute clams and perhaps Mr. Curtis Badger could truly say.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kerry in Familiar Spot: Trying to Coax Deal in Meeting\u2019s Closing Days", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 For the second time this year, Secretary of State John Kerry has settled into a grand capital of Europe for talks that could shape the globe, not to mention his own reputation, for decades to come.A completed deal would be Mr. Kerry\u2019s final shot at influencing the planet\u2019s future trajectory of dangerous atmospheric warming. But if a deal falls apart, or is viewed as weak and toothless \u2014 a significant possibility in the next few days \u2014 then that failure will be part of Mr. Kerry\u2019s legacy as he prepares to leave public office after years of work on the issue.Mr. Kerry will remain through the week to the bitter end.\u201cIf I weren\u2019t here I would fault myself for not trying to talk to someone who could make the difference,\u201d he said in an interview on Tuesday in the red-velvet bar of his hotel in the elegant Place Vend\u00f4me neighborhood of Paris.Asked why he planned to spend the coming days locked in climate negotiations when he was also worrying about Syria, the Islamic State and other international pressures, Mr. Kerry made a comparison to the Iran talks. \u201cIt\u2019s similar in the sense that you have to stay at it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not present, bad things can happen. If you\u2019re not there, there can be a sudden shift in the negotiations and you can lose everything if you\u2019re not ready to head it off at the pass.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of Sisyphus pushing the rock up the mountain,\u201d Mr. Kerry acknowledged.Behind the scenes at the State Department, Mr. Kerry has led a systematic, top-down push to create an agencywide focus on global warming and has made fighting climate change a critical part of his agenda. Test some of what you\u2019ve learned about climate change after days of talks in Paris.Last year, he played a crucial role in brokering a breakthrough deal between Mr. Obama and President Xi Jinping of China in which the leaders of the world\u2019s two largest polluting economies pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.That deal was seen as paving the way for the proposed agreement now on the table here in Paris, where 185 countries representing more than 90 percent of the global economy\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution have put forth similar pledges.But in the homestretch of negotiating it is unclear how tough the deal will be. A draft that emerged Wednesday lacked any clear provisions requiring governments to monitor and verify their emissions cuts. India and China in particular have been opposed to such provisions, but absent them the deal could be little more than a gesture of good will.But Mr. Kerry says he is undaunted, and that he wants to broker a deal in Paris and to leave behind a State Department that is focused on the issue.\u201cMy hope is by the end of next year we\u2019ll have this institutionalized in the State Department,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will inevitably be a foreign policy issue and a national security issue.\u201dMr. Kerry, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, added: \u201cThere\u2019s no way, I\u2019m convinced, that anybody can be elected president of the U.S. unless they have an understanding of and commitment to this issue. I don\u2019t think the American people are going to elect somebody who isn\u2019t prepared to embrace reality.\u201dMr. Kerry\u2019s supporters applaud him. \u201cJohn has redefined the role of secretary of state \u2014 he has put climate change front and center,\u201d said Tim Wirth, president of the United Nations Foundation and a former Democratic senator from Colorado.Not everyone agrees, particularly some Republicans.\u201cSecretary Kerry is merely reflecting his boss\u2019 own distorted view that climate change is a greater threat to Americans than ISIS or homegrown terror,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a leading critic of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda. \u201cIt is disturbing that, just days after the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11, the president dispatches key members of his cabinet to a global climate conference. Secretary Kerry should be working with the president to develop a global strategy to destroy ISIS and protect the homeland, not entering into climate agreements that weaken our economy.\u201dEven during the Iran talks, Mr. Kerry had his mind on a global warming agenda. His counterpart in those negotiations, Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, recalled that \u201cin the interstices of the Iran negotiations, we would talk about climate change, and how we would approach it.\u201dMr. Kerry has attended nearly every climate summit meeting dating to the first one in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and since then has forged dozens of relationships with international climate change negotiators. Before arriving in Paris, he had phone calls with many of them.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Minister Xie \u2014 we\u2019ve had many airport lunches,\u201d he said of China\u2019s climate change minister, Xie Zhenhua.In India, Mr. Kerry has worked with Piyush Goyal, the Indian minister of power, coal and new and renewable energy, as well as Sushma Swaraj, the Indian external affairs secretary.On Tuesday, Mr. Kerry spoke by phone with Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, of Saudi Arabia, a country that is seen as a possible spoiler of a climate deal. Though the foundation of the Saudi economy could be threatened by an accord intended to turn the world away from fossil fuels like oil, Saudi Arabia is a desert nation that could also experience more devastating heat as a result of global warming.\u201cI think the Saudis want an agreement,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.Zou Ji, a Chinese climate negotiator, recalled meeting with Mr. Kerry in 2010 in a restaurant in Beijing. \u201cHe reached out to me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was very serious, and he has spent a lot of time working on this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When Mother Earth Gets Angry", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe momentous climate accord reached last weekend in Paris recognizes three powerful and unyielding economic and ecological trends. These were prompted by the collision of the resource-abundant development approach of the 20th century with the increasingly dire environmental conditions of the 21st.By far, the most important has been that Mother Earth is fuming. Hurricanes have drowned two American cities in recent years. Mammoth wildfires have raced across the American West. Toxic algae contaminate drinking water drawn from warmer and more polluted rivers and lakes all over the world. In June 2013, a flood that scientists linked to climate change killed thousands of people in Uttarakhand, India, and wrecked that Himalayan state\u2019s hydropower sector.The second trend has been the growth of influential civic campaigns to push for climate action, and against big infrastructure projects, especially energy and mining undertakings.In the United States, President Obama in November rejected the Keystone XL oil pipeline, the target of a broad and organized citizen protest movement. In India in 2010, farmers and activists, afraid of flooding and loss of farmland, blockaded access roads and brought construction of the 2,000-megawatt Lower Subansiri Dam to a halt. And in Peru, villagers in the Andes highlands near Cajamarca halted development of Newmont Mining\u2019s planned $5 billion Conga gold and copper mine because of local concerns about water pollution. The proposed mine remains stalled.The third and latest piece of this narrative is the growing apprehension in global financial markets about approving big, carbon-based energy projects and, to a lesser extent, the construction of hydropower dams.Three reports in recent years underscore the anxiety.In 2009 researchers at the Potsdam Institute, a German research group, determined that keeping the rise in global temperatures at or below 2 degrees Celsius, the goal set by the United Nations, meant that no more than 565 additional gigatons of carbon dioxide could be emitted into the atmosphere. At current levels of global carbon emissions \u2014 about 36 gigatons annually \u2014 those additional gigatons would be released into the atmosphere by the early 2030s.Then, in 2011, the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a British research group, reported that 2,795 gigatons of carbon was held in the coal, oil and natural gas reserves of fossil fuel companies and carbon-rich countries. If burned, the emissions would vastly exceed the ceiling set by the Potsdam Institute.Big banks and other financial institutions have been coming to terms with the market risks of leaving untouched \u2014 that is, stranded \u2014 fossil fuel assets valued at more than $20 trillion. A disinvestment campaign led by Mr. McKibben\u2019s organization, 350.org, has recruited more than 500 institutions, with assets valued at over $3.4 trillion, that have pledged to remove fossil fuel companies and projects from their investments.For the time being, the global coal sector is most imperiled. Natural gas and renewable energy sources are replacing coal-fired plants in the United States and Europe. American coal production and exports are declining, along with international prices for coal. Europe\u2019s largest insurer, Allianz, recently joined California\u2019s pension funds and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, in selling its coal investments.In August, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, that nation\u2019s largest bank, said it would not fund the proposed Carmichael mine in Queensland, the biggest coal mine ever proposed in Australia. The mine\u2019s role in adding to carbon emissions, potential damage to the Great Barrier Reef from coal transport ships, and a vigorous opposition campaign led by Greenpeace were factors in the bank\u2019s decision.In November, the Financial Stability Board, which promotes global financial stability for the Group of 20 nations, announced that it was establishing a task force, headed by the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, to encourage businesses to voluntarily disclose how much risk they face from adjusting practices because of climate change.Also last month, the attorney general of New York, Eric T. Schneiderman, won an agreement with Peabody Coal, the largest publicly traded coal company in the world, in which the company agreed to disclose to investors the risks the company faces from new climate regulations and turbulence in the coal market. Peabody\u2019s stock value, which four years ago reached nearly $1,100 a share, is now trading at under $10 a share.Still, there\u2019s one vital place that remains unconvinced of the dangers posed by warming temperatures: the United States Congress. Republican dogma about climate change and climate science seems bound to rupture. The California drought, the Uttarakhand flood, the S\u00e3o Paulo drought, Syria\u2019s civil war, and so many other recent ecological and economic disasters linked to climate change are fraying the party\u2019s thinning tissue of denial.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vote at Atomic Agency Officially Ends Inquiry Into Iran\u2019s Nuclear Past", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis closes the board\u2019s consideration of this item,\u201d said the resolution, which was drafted by the United States and its five partners in the negotiations with Iran \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.In a report issued nearly two weeks ago, the agency concluded that until 2003 Iran had conducted what Yukiya Amano, the agency\u2019s director general, called on Tuesday \u201ca coordinated effort\u201d on \u201ca range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.\u201d Iran continued with some activities through 2009, Mr. Amano said, but after that there have been \u201cno credible indications\u201d of continued weapons development.Iranian officials immediately hailed the vote and said it would allow implementation of the July accord, including the release, perhaps as early as January, of about $100 billion in frozen funds and an end to oil and financial sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.The report left almost no one satisfied. Senate Republicans who voted against the nuclear accord \u2014 and all of them did \u2014 along with some Democrats who voted for it said the Obama administration had erred when it decided to close the books on the past in the interest of focusing the atomic agency on inspections that will ensure the new agreement is fully carried out.The Obama administration has been relatively quiet about the resolution, but officials have said in background conversations that Secretary of State John Kerry did not want to give hard-liners in Iran an excuse to walk away from the nuclear deal.He argued that the resolution would \u201cin no way preclude the I.A.E.A. from investigation if there is a reason to believe Iran is pursuing any covert nuclear activities in the future, as it had in the past.\u201dBehind the scenes, there was significant debate inside the administration over whether to try to force Iran to conduct a serious excavation of its past.Some officials feared that if Iran was given a pass, it would send a signal to other nations \u2014 including North Korea \u2014 that their obligations to respond to international investigators could be negotiated away in a political deal. President Obama eventually concluded that the larger goal of halting Iran\u2019s ability to produce a nuclear weapon for the next decade-and-a-half was more valuable than setting a precedent about the integrity of inspections.Michael Singh, a critic of the nuclear deal who served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, argued that allowing Iran to leave doubts about the history of its nuclear effort was a fundamental mistake.The decision not to pursue more details on Iran\u2019s alleged bomb-design work came as another United Nations group reported that Iran\u2019s launching of a ballistic missile in October was a clear violation of United Nations sanctions. Iran apparently conducted a similar test in November, though the United States has declined to discuss its evidence in detail, perhaps to protect the sources of its intelligence.The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, has accused Iran of violating the weapons and travel bans \u201cwith impunity\u201d and has said the United States would press the Security Council to take action.The report by a group of experts who monitor violations of the United Nations sanctions was vague about the nature of some of the violations. The Spanish ambassador, Rom\u00e1n Oyarzun Marchesi, who is chairman of the Iran sanctions committee, told the Council on Tuesday afternoon that in addition to the missile launch, there was an attempt by Iran to procure bars of plutonium this year. But the report was inconclusive, he said, on the question of whether the attempt was a \u201cwillful violation.\u201dThe council took no action on Tuesday. But Ms. Power\u2019s comments seemed to suggest that the Obama administration\u2019s strategy was to focus on current and future violations. Some members of Congress say that effort was not public enough. Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who voted for the Iran agreement, told the Senate that the atomic agency\u2019s report this month \u201cdetails just how determined Iran has been to develop a nuclear weapons capability.\u201d\u201cI fear the Iranians are taking action after action in this area and others to demonstrate that they are willing to flout international rules, regulations and restrictions,\u201d said Mr. Coons, who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cIn the absence of our decisive action, these misdeeds by the Iranians will simply continue and escalate.\u201d Somini Sengupta contributed reporting from the United Nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China Can Learn From Greece", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsAs a political economist, I make my living studying the impact of politics on economics. My friends and co-authors who are political scientists focus on how economics affects politics. Which is more relevant in real life? Do countries with bad politics suffer from poor economic outcomes because bad economic policies are driven by bad politics? Or because persistent economic difficulties make reasonable politics hard to sustain?Every year offers examples of both kinds. The year 2015 was no exception, producing two very important stories: Greece and China. Both are dramatic and multifaceted.In Greece, the cradle of Western democracy, voters became disappointed with mainstream parties and elected the small leftist Syriza party, which promised deliverance from economic pain. Critics from nondemocratic regimes (or from \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d) interpreted Syriza\u2019s victory as a failure of the democratic system. They argued that it was proof that ordinary voters could not be trusted with important decisions because they prefer simple but incorrect populist solutions. However, the events following Syriza\u2019s victory showed that Greek voters were not shortsighted or irrational.Yes, as soon became clear, Syriza\u2019s promises were not realistic. As the former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers once said, \u201cYou can\u2019t repeal the laws of economics. Even if they are inconvenient.\u201d However popular Syriza was, it could not conjure up billions of euros out of thin air.The choice was to continue with painful reforms or to default. Reform would mean an immediate decline in living standards; default would make things even worse. Default always brings turbulence and uncertainty, and the government would automatically switch to austerity policies anyway \u2014 not because it wanted to, but because it would have no cash to do anything else. There would simply be no access to financial markets.I am old enough to remember how the 1998 default in Russia brought to power the only openly leftist government in the country\u2019s post-Soviet history. It initially spouted Communist rhetoric but was forced by lack of cash to implement one of the most austere budgets that Russia has ever had.Greek voters apparently understood the cost of default and, in a referendum, strongly supported staying in the eurozone. This vote eventually pushed the Syriza government into reaching a deal with the country\u2019s creditors. The deal will not bring prosperity to the Greek voters, but it is certainly the least costly option.The other, even bigger, economic story of the year was China\u2019s stock market crash and slowdown in economic growth. The striking success of China\u2019s economy since 1978, as the government has implemented economic reforms, has puzzled many economists and political scientists. Dictatorships usually suffer from two imminent problems. One, in nondemocracies it is hard to create a genuine rule-of-law, which is crucial for property rights and contract enforcement; these in turn are necessary for investment and growth. Usually dictatorial governments cannot commit to abstain from expropriating investors. Two, without political competition and media freedom it is hard to get proper feedback, which is needed for running a large country.The Chinese Communist Party addressed these problems to a certain extent by adopting several essential elements of modern democratic politics: meritocracy, checks and balances, and regular elite rotation. The jury is still out on how and why this system emerged. It may well be that the period 1949 to 1978 was just a blip, after which China returned to its Confucian meritocratic institutions, or it may be that the survivors of the Mao era wanted to build safeguards against its return.This hybrid political system created incentives for pro-growth reforms: liberalization in agriculture and then in other sectors; relaxation of barriers to internal migration; privatization of small firms and then of larger ones; and integration into the global economy. These reforms brought a growth trajectory similar to those in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea 15 to 30 years earlier.However, those countries already had more open political systems when they reached the income levels that China enjoys today. This openness in turn allowed them to continue with reforms that brought further growth. That is not a coincidence: Economic theory holds that there is a qualitative difference between growth from a poor into a middle-income country and further growth from middle-income to rich. The former involves catching up with advanced countries and adopting their \u201cbest practices\u201d; this process may be carried out in a top-down fashion. So a \u201cbenevolent\u201d centralized government can do the job.As for the above-middle-income growth, the economic system needs to encourage innovation, which requires a decentralized, competitive political system. Many countries have not managed to build such pro-innovation institutions and then got stuck in the \u201cmiddle-income-trap\u201d of growth slowdown. Japan, Taiwan and Korea overcame this trap and became knowledge-based, rich economies.The turbulence of 2015 indicated that China may be facing this challenge. Multiple economic studies have shown that China still has huge potential for growth that can be unlocked by further reforms in the state-owned enterprises and the financial system, promoting the rule of law and competition policies. But such reforms could undermine the current government\u2019s hold on power because those enterprises and banks are its main economic levers.In 2012, China\u2019s incoming leaders outlined a reform agenda in an impressive \u201cChina 2030\u201d blueprint co-authored by China\u2019s State Council and the World Bank. In the past three years, however, very little of that road map has been implemented. Instead, China\u2019s leaders have opted for greater centralization of political power.The debate over whether democracy delivers prosperity dates back at least to Aristotle \u2014 social scientists have always asked whether democracy promotes economic growth, or high incomes are a prerequisite for a stable democracy. In recent years, economists have used advanced statistical tools to show that the first view is correct: Countries undergoing democratizations on average improve their growth performance by 1 or 2 percent per year for 10 years.The year 2015 suggests they are probably right. Greek voters chose the lesser evil, however painful. And China\u2019s troubles suggested that the Chinese political system may be somewhat outdated for what its economy needs and deserves. This does not imply that Greece\u2019s economic growth will outperform China\u2019s. It won\u2019t \u2014 as there are many things that Greece can learn from China. But this year has also shown that China can also learn from Greece: Voters are not always wrong and top-down rulers are not always benevolent, omniscient and omnipotent.Sergei Guriev is professor of economics at the Instituts d\u2019\u00e9tudes politiques (SciencesPo) in Paris.

{"Headline": "Despite Climate Concerns, OPEC Plans to Keep Pumping Oil While It Can", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday that it would keep producing oil at current levels, which are estimated to exceed 31 million barrels a day.In fact, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 delegation to the climate conference has pledged to increase their use of clean energy sources \u2014 a mere 0.2 percent of the mix last year \u2014 to 24 percent by 2021.The United Arab Emirates, whose seven members include Abu Dhabi, plan to use their oil wealth to lay the groundwork for the post-petroleum era \u2014 whenever it comes.The United Arab Emirates, Mr. Belhoul said, need to have \u201ca well-diversified economy that can work and deliver for them the economic activity and the jobs they require regardless of the future of oil.\u201dBut, meanwhile, the pumping continues unabated. The United Arab Emirates say they are producing close to three million barrels a day, up about 180,000 barrels a day from last year\u2019s levels.The dozen OPEC countries, and other big oil producers like Mexico and Russia, find themselves in a double bind \u2014 pressed by the new low-carbon ethos represented by the climate conference and squeezed by a global oil glut that has caused prices to plunge by more than 50 percent since early last year. New supplies, led by shale oil from the United States, have caused the dollar-value oil revenue of OPEC, Mexico and Russia to fall by half since 2014. Their response is to keep producing and selling, with an almost fire-sale desperation.\u201cIndividual countries are trying to get every bit of revenue they can in this tough situation,\u201d said Spencer Welch, an analyst at IHS, a research firm.As OPEC\u2019s market clout has diminished, the organization has become increasingly fragmented. Members including Venezuela and Algeria are urging production limits in hopes of propping up prices. \u201cWhat distinguishes OPEC members from other producers, now that the group sets neither prices nor output quotas?\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS. \u201cNothing, really.\u201dOPEC said on Friday that the group had decided to wait to make any changes in production quotas until it could see how much oil Iran would be exporting once Western sanctions are lifted. The group also wants to see what effect continued low prices might have on production levels from non-OPEC producers.\u201cWe need to wait and watch,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, who presided over the OPEC meeting, told journalists on Friday.Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup, in Vienna for the OPEC meeting, said that on the climate issue, the biggest OPEC exporter, the Saudis, were \u201cdamned if they do and damned if they don\u2019t.\u201dNew curbs on fossil-fuel consumption would put the Saudi economy at risk, he said. But the Saudis risk global scorn if they are seen as climate obstructionists, and Saudi Arabia knows its own environmental future hangs in the balance. Unless something is done soon about global warming, the sun-baked, arid Arabian Peninsula could become almost uninhabitable.But Saudi Arabia, which is participating in the climate talks, has not yet been willing to make many concessions.The Saudi document describing the plan says that even this pledge is conditional on the economy\u2019s continuing to grow with \u201ca robust contribution from oil export revenues\u201d and on international climate-change policies not imposing a \u201cdisproportionate or abnormal burden on the kingdom\u2019s economy.\u201dBut like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia acknowledges that climate concerns are a reason to make its economy more diversified and energy-efficient. Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old son of Saudi Arabia\u2019s king, is said to be leading the effort.Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, who now heads his own consulting firm, said, \u201cThere is a big move to reduce energy consumption in the kingdom.\u201dBut analysts caution not to expect any quick shifts by Saudi Arabia, which still depends on oil for nearly half of its economic output and 90 percent of its export revenue. Though the country is a monarchy, analysts say, the leadership prefers to act on the consensus of the country\u2019s technical experts and will be wary of upsetting constituents by raising fuel prices \u2014 particularly at a time when so much of the region is in political chaos.In the United Arab Emirates, a much smaller economy where the rulers take a more top-down approach, diversification has come much faster. Three-quarters of the economy now involves non-oil activities. Progress away from petroleum has been quicker, with 75 percent of gross domestic product coming from non-oil activities.Mr. Belhoul, the chief of Masdar, which is leading the United Arab Emirates\u2019 energy-diversification efforts, recently showed a visiting reporter one of his company\u2019s showcase experiments: a desalination project on the Persian Gulf. Engineers are trying to harness the sun\u2019s clean energy to transform seawater into drinking water \u2014 an energy-intensive process on which Gulf countries now expend large volumes of fossil fuels.Although less than 1 percent of his country\u2019s energy now comes from clean sources, Mr. Belhoul said he was optimistic that climate concerns, along with ever-improving alternative technologies, would enable the United Arab Emirates to meet their goal of 24 percent by 2021.\u201cRenewable energy is no longer an expensive alternative \u2014 it is becoming a technology of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is no longer an academic debate. It\u2019s a reality.\u201dStanley Reed reported from Vienna, and Sara Hamdan from Ghantoot, Abu Dhabi. Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rolls-Royce to Restructure Management in Cost-Cutting Drive", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRolls-Royce, the British engineering group, announced a major management restructuring on Wednesday that the company said was aimed at simplifying a byzantine hierarchy and lowering operating costs after a string of profit warnings.The group presented the changes as part of a broader plan to eliminate as much as 200 million pounds, or over $300 million, in annual operating costs. However, the restructuring also comes amid recent news media speculation in Britain about a possible government intervention to avoid a potential foreign takeover of Rolls-Royce, one of the few British world-leading technology companies.\u201cThe changes we are announcing today are the first important steps in driving operational excellence and returning Rolls-Royce to its long-term trend of profitable growth,\u201d Mr. East said.As a result of the shake-up, the group said that the chief of its aerospace engine business, Tony Wood, would be leaving Rolls-Royce in 2016 after 15 years at the group. Lawrie Haynes, who has led its land and sea division since 2013, would also step down, Mr. East said.Rolls-Royce has lowered its earnings forecasts five times over the past two years, citing high operating costs, particularly in its marine division, where demand has been weak, and declining profit margins in its aircraft-engine maintenance business. Its share price has fallen by more than 40 percent this year.Rolls-Royce\u2019s financial troubles have raised the hackles of some of its larger shareholders, including a California-based investor fund, ValueAct Capital, which recently raised its stake to 10 percent and has expressed interest in a seat on the Rolls-Royce board.While the British government owns a so-called golden share in Rolls-Royce that allows it to block any sale to a foreign company and limits foreign ownership to 15 percent, the depth of the company\u2019s financial troubles has reportedly prompted London to consider contingency plans.Rolls-Royce produces reactors for Britain\u2019s fleet of nuclear submarines and currently holds a \u00a331 billion contract to develop a new generation of Trident submarines to be equipped with nuclear missiles. But government officials have sought to play down speculation that they are considering a government rescue of Rolls-Royce to safeguard the submarine program.Asked in Parliament on Tuesday about the reports of a government rescue plan for Rolls-Royce, Anna Soubry, Britain\u2019s minister for business, said only that the government recognized the group\u2019s importance to the British economy and was \u201cmonitoring the situation carefully.\u201d But she appeared to dismiss the notion of an outright nationalization, saying: \u201cThis is 2015.

{"Headline": "Ukraine Halts Repayments on $3.5 Billion It Owes Russia", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIf we were to repay this bond in full, it would mean we failed to meet the terms of the I.M.F. and the obligations we made under our restructuring,\u201d Natalie A. Jaresko, Ukraine\u2019s finance minister, said in a telephone interview on Friday.The dispute centers on a contentious $3 billion loan that Russia granted to Ukraine in 2013 after the former Ukranian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, rejected a trade deal with the European Union and agreed instead to join a Russian-led bloc, the Customs Union. That decision set off the street protests known as the Maidan movement that led to Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s overthrow, and subsequently war with Russia.Russia\u2019s Finance Ministry had, for unclear reasons, structured the $3 billion loan as a Eurobond, a financial instrument typically used in commercial transactions rather than bilateral loans.Ukraine has asserted that Russia should accept the same deal as the commercial creditors but Russia\u2019s Finance Ministry refused, saying that the loan was bilateral and therefore had to be paid in full.Thrust into the uncomfortable role of arbiter, the International Monetary Fund initially backed the Russian position and held that the Eurobond was, in fact, a bilateral loan.But the fund, which has Ukraine\u2019s ailing economy on life support, altered its lending rules to allow the bailout for Ukraine to go forward despite Ukraine\u2019s likely default on the Russian bond. That provided Ukraine the backing it needed to declare the moratorium on Friday.\u201cThis is in fact a declaration of default by Ukraine,\u201d said Konstantin Kosachev, a Russian senator.Russian officials have said they will sue Ukraine in a British court, as stipulated in the terms of their Eurobond issue.The moratorium on payments to Russia covers the $3 billion bond and two sovereign loan guarantees to Russian banks.Ukraine\u2019s cabinet decided on Wednesday to halt most trade with Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014, starting in mid-January, inevitably raising the cost for Russia. Mr. Putin then signed a decree excluding Ukraine from a free-trade bloc of former Soviet states starting Jan. 1. On that date, Ukraine is scheduled to join a trade alliance with the European Union.The International Monetary Fund, while eventually backing Ukraine on the debt dispute with Russia, has its own problems with Kiev.The fund cautioned Friday that support could be suspended if a draft budget under consideration in Parliament is passed with a deficit greater than 3.7 percent of gross domestic product, the maximum allowed under the bailout terms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Turkey Lost Its Luster for Luxury Brands?", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStellar growth in once white-hot emerging markets appears to have gone out of fashion for much of the luxury sector. Sales in China have slowed in line with its cooling economy, while stagnating demand in Russia and Brazil continues to take its toll.Now in Turkey \u2014 a country that physically and culturally straddles East and West with one of the industry\u2019s fastest-growing markets and a young and booming middle class \u2014 luxury heavyweights who invested there recently may be taking stock.In the last four years, Prada, Herm\u00e8s, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Tod\u2019s, Ralph Lauren and Armani all have opened at least two glittering mono-brand stores in Istanbul, while Ermenegildo Zegna and Burberry now have three stores each there. Tory Burch, the American accessible-luxury queen, opened her second store late last year.Many of the big names are found in the two Western-style shopping centers that have opened: Akasya Mall and Zorlu Center. And in April, Soho House, the London-based private members club for creative people, opened a five-floor outpost in the former American Consulate, a 19th-century palazzo that has been restored to include baths, a Cowshed-brand spa and a rooftop pool with breathtaking views over the Golden Horn.But amid an economic slowdown after years of steady growth \u2014 along with concerns about the chaos in neighboring Syria and the civil unrest before the national election last month \u2014 the race by powerhouse brands to expand in Turkey has stalled. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris and two suicide bombs that killed 99 people in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital city, in October, the country appears to be volatile juncture.\u201cMany brands that had previously been rushing to build up their footprints are now cutting back a bit,\u201d said Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a partner at Bain & Company and leader of its luxury goods unit. \u201cThe political and economic instability both in and around Turkey have triggered a bit of a decline both in terms of touristic flows and local consumption.\u201dShe added that, in a year of volatile foreign exchange rates, the Turkish lira has proved to be one of the world\u2019s weakest currencies.Major brands, she continued, \u201cknow the market fundamentals are good and that generally the future is bright, but for the time being many appear to be adopting more of a wait-and-see approach.\u201dBain has forecast that the global market for personal luxury goods is heading for its weakest year since 2009, with sales this year expected to rise to $280 billion, as little as 1 percent growth from 2014 levels. But despite some investor concerns and its recent political and economic uncertainties, Turkey continues to be a core strategic market, with many producers bullish about its prospects.Although the country accounts for just 1 percent of global luxury spending annually, luxury sales in Turkey jumped 37 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to the research group Euromonitor. And in 2013, they surged 12 percent from the previous year, to an estimated $3 billion.By 2018, Euromonitor said, the market is expected to nearly double, reaching $5.4 billion. The primary financial firepower driving this growth is Turkey\u2019s flourishing middle class.McKinsey, a consulting firm, estimates that between 2013 and 2017, Turkey\u2019s total personal disposable income will rise to $906 billion from $652 billion, as a generation of millennials hit their spending stride. In particular, McKinsey pointed to more higher-paid female professionals in the work force triggering a rapid uptick in household purchasing power.\u201cIstanbul is a trend-setting city, full of young, educated, technologically savvy spenders, but it has also become a destination for international travelers,\u201d said Demet Sabanci of the Demsa Group, which has brought labels including Tom Ford, Alexander McQueen, Salvatore Ferragamo, Lanvin, Michael Kors and Harvey Nichols to Turkey.\u201cMost of the luxury brands here have strong local partnerships,\u201d she continued, \u201cand we observe that high demand for Turkey is still strong within international investors.\u201dWestern brands arriving on the Turkish retail scene have often enlisted in the services of powerful local partners or joint-venture operators like the Demsa Group to help navigate the real estate market and to shape stores to local tastes. However, as taxes can push the cost of luxury goods in Turkey to as much as 20 percent higher than levels in Milan or Paris, many of Turkey\u2019s high net worth individuals \u2014 those earning more than $1 million a year \u2014 increasingly do much of their shopping abroad.But, as a crop of recently unveiled four- and five-star hotels in Istanbul indicates, foreign brands\u2019 foray into Turkey has wealthy tourists as well as local buyers in mind. And the city of 14 million has become a popular destination, logging 10 million visitors in 2014, particularly from Europe and the United States.Boutiques in coastal resorts, once popular stomping grounds for Russian bourgeoisie, have been hit hard by the conspicuous absence of those patrons since 2014, when the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine. But many Istanbul retailers say that foot traffic from Central Asia and the Persian Gulf has never been stronger. Heavily influenced by Turkish soap operas and radio stations, those visitors from nearby regions now drive as much as 20 percent of the total retail spending in the city, according to the online luxury business platform CPP Luxury.Domestic luxury brands as well as outsiders are eager to capitalize on the flood of visitors and a more affluent Turkish population. Many that once looked to the West for creative inspiration are finding that there is growing appetite for products showcasing Turkish national identity and design heritage. And local designers say craftsmanship incorporating traditional materials, colors and styles has produced an explosion of demand both from foreign shoppers and those closer to home.\u201cTurkish fashion has also evolved immensely over the last 20 years from when there were very few internationally known fashion houses,\u201d said the Turkish fashion designer Ayse Ege, who works in Istanbul and Paris. \u201cThe perception of domestic fashion labels was completely different to how it is today.\u201dMs. Ege, along with her sister Ece, directs the Turkish couture house Dice Kayek. They ran a global ready-to-wear line with that name for more than 20 years. A one-off collection they created \u2014 marrying contemporary design with an homage to Istanbul architecture \u2014 received extensive critical acclaim and won a prize of 25,000 pounds, or $39,000 at today\u2019s exchange rate, in 2013 from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.The designer says she remains positive about the future of luxury brands in her country: \u201cThe Turkish upper-middle class are keen on knowing about and wearing the luxury brands that are now accessible to them. They are inquisitive, do their research and will keep following trends and styles from all around the globe.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when SoHo House opened in Istanbul. It was April, not August. The article also misidentified the waterway that can be seen from the rooftop pool at SoHo House. It is the Golden Horn, not the Bosporous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Linking Brazil to French Guiana, a Bridge for No One", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySt.-Georges-de-l\u2019Oyapock Journal\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe 30,\u201d he said, referring to kilometers per hour, equivalent to less than 20 miles per hour. \u201cWhen they open the bridge, they will put up the signs.\u201dBut the speed limit today is effectively zero, as the bridge over the Oyapock River, just outside St.-Georges, a rundown town of about 4,000, never opened to pedestrians or vehicles, even though it was completed more than four years ago at a cost of about $33 million at the time.The bridge, intended as a symbol of international cooperation \u2014 signs on both sides of it are in both French and Portuguese \u2014 has instead become a symbol of the two countries\u2019 inability to work together.\u201cThe bridge is just the visible part of the iceberg,\u201d said Thierry Girardot, 45, a worker in the Guiana Amazonian Park, as he sat on the terrace of a restaurant called Chez Modestine, which looks out on St.-Georges\u2019s cracked demitasse of a public square, abandoned to the sizzling heat. \u201cIt\u2019s concrete, it\u2019s there, it\u2019s real, but the bridge is not the only thing necessary to cross the border.\u201dThe decision to build the bridge was announced in 1997 by President Jacques Chirac of France and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil. It was meant to bring economic development to the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1, which borders French Guiana, and to create opportunities for French and Brazilian companies. And it was to better connect French Guiana, long oriented toward Europe, to the Latin-dominated continent it inhabits and largely ignores.It was also to establish a connection between Brazil and Europe. French Guiana, a former colony that was mostly used to house criminals in infamously brutal prisons, became an overseas department of France in 1946, obtaining the same status as any other French territory.France and Brazil agreed to split the cost of building the bridge, and the structure was completed in 2011.On its side of the bridge, France built a border police post, to manage customs and immigration services, that already appears weather-beaten and worn. On the bridge, which is more than four football fields long, the double white line at the center of the pavement is peeling away.But on the Brazilian side, things lagged. Brazil had pledged to pave the 360-mile dirt road to Macap\u00e1, the capital of Amap\u00e1 State, from Oiapoque (pronounced oh-ya-POHK), the town on the Brazilian side of the bridge. But much of the highway has yet to be paved. Brazil also delayed customs and immigration facilities, completing the structures only recently. They have yet to be furnished and supplied with computers and other necessities.\u201cWe could open the bridge tomorrow if they would send personnel and if they finished the work,\u201d said \u00c9ric Spitz, the prefect of French Guiana, during an interview in his large, wood-lined office in Cayenne, the capital, a three-hour drive from St.-Georges.In Oiapoque, no sign marks the road that leads to the bridge. The newly completed buildings, with bright white walls and blue roofs, stand in the middle of a red dirt field. Cows and goats graze nearby. A flimsy barrier of barbed wire blocks the way, and a yellow sign in Portuguese reads: \u201cStop. Identify yourself.\u201d Two dingy white dogs, stained ocher from rolling in the red dirt, sleep on the road.\u201cIt\u2019s not permitted to enter,\u201d a genial security guard said. His tiny guard shack had no electricity or running water. A sign on it read, \u201cSmile, you\u2019re being filmed.\u201d But the guard, who would not give his name, said there were no cameras. \u201cIt\u2019s just for show,\u201d he said.An impasse over vehicle insurance has contributed to the delay. France requires drivers and trucking companies to have much higher levels of coverage than Brazil demands. The two sides have not been able to resolve the issue.During a meeting with his Brazilian counterparts in October, Mr. Spitz said, he challenged them to open the bridge before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro start in August. He said they had agreed.Many other topics that came up during bilateral talks about the bridge had nothing to do with the structure itself. They include France\u2019s desire to export more dairy products to Brazil, and Brazil\u2019s insistence that French Guiana do more to stop the spread of a fruit fly that threatens a Brazilian crop.And then there is the visa issue. French citizens do not need a visa to travel to Brazil, and Brazilians do not need a visa to travel to any other part of France. But, even though French Guiana is next door, Brazilians must get a visa to go to there. (The exception is for travel to St.-Georges, which can be done with a special permit.)This rankles many Brazilians. Filip Van Den Bossche, a businessman based in Cayenne, said that a Brazilian friend had planned to visit on a vacation but had found the visa requirement too onerous. The friend bought a plane ticket to Europe instead.Mr. Spitz, the prefect, said the visa requirement was intended to deter the illegal immigration of Brazilians into French Guiana.By some estimates, thousands of Brazilians are involved in illegal gold mining in French Guiana. Brazilian ships have also been accused of fishing in French Guianese waters. That colors the way many people here view their neighbors, and many in French Guiana are not eager to see a greater influx of Brazilians.People here have always crossed the Oyapock River by boat, and they continue to do so. Long, narrow boats with outboard motors, known as pirogues, zip back and forth, carrying passengers. They pass directly under the bridge.But local business owners say they need more than boat crossings.Fabiano Arouche, 28, who owns a restaurant, the Recanto Grill in Oiapoque, said that, with the Brazilian economy struggling, the area could benefit from the arrival of truck drivers and tourists that the bridge could bring.But there is also deep skepticism about the government\u2019s ability to deliver on its promises, an attitude every bit as Brazilian as Commander Rudeaux\u2019s existentialist moue was quintessentially French.\u201cIt\u2019s never going to open,\u201d said Sandra Rufino, 45, standing outside the local market on the Brazilian side and waving dismissively at the structure. \u201cIt\u2019s only there so they could say they built a bridge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just there for decoration,\u201d her friend Marcileide Lozeira, 38, said.Back in Cayenne, Mr. Spitz predicted that the bridge would be like the Eiffel Tower, which was considered an eyesore when it was being built but came to be embraced as a beloved national symbol. \u201cOnce the bridge opens, all the difficult years will be forgotten,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Junk Bond Fund Will Liquidate, and Reimburse Investors Slowly", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move, announced Thursday by Third Avenue Management funds, was a troubling sign of the recent deterioration in junk bonds, a category that has been hurt in particular by the debt of energy companies struggling with the slump in oil and gas prices. Energy debt accounts for roughly a sixth of the market. More important, the action by Third Avenue highlights a longstanding fear among regulators and economists that too many investors have piled into risky areas of the bond market, like leveraged loans and emerging-market debt, as well as junk bonds.As funds in these areas have grown in size, the ability of portfolio managers to buy and sell these securities in a reasonable amount of time has been curtailed as investment banks have stopped making a market in these areas because of regulatory constraints.This is what apparently happened to Third Avenue\u2019s Focused Credit Fund, which not long ago was about $2.5 billion in size and had recently shrunk to $788 million as investors rushed to redeem their shares because of weakness in the junk bond market.High-yield bonds have had some of the worst returns among bonds this year. A benchmark Merrill Lynch index is down 3.7 percent for the year and a basket of higher-risk junk bonds has lost 13 percent.Trouble in the junk bond market can be a harbinger of tougher times to come in terms of the broader economy.With no sign that selling pressures were abating, Third Avenue, which manages a total of $8 billion in customer assets, has decided to stop fulfilling investor sell orders and liquidate the fund.The remaining assets in the fund will be put into a liquidating trust and sold off gradually, the company said, the idea being to not drive down prices too sharply. This process could last more than a year, which means current investors in the fund may have to wait at least that long to get their money back.In a statement explaining the decision, Third Avenue\u2019s chief executive, David M. Barse, said that investor requests for redemptions, along with a \u201cgeneral reduction of liquidity in the fixed-income markets\u201d made it impracticable for the fund to \u201ccreate sufficient cash to pay anticipated redemptions without resorting to sales at prices that would unfairly disadvantage the remaining shareholders.\u201dThe interest rates on junk bonds, riskier bonds that companies with higher debt loads are able to sell to yield-hungry investors, have spiked over the past month in the face of concerns that a slowing economy would push many of these companies into default.\u201cThis confirms many of the fears we have had about high levels of corporate debt and the lack of liquidity in the marketplace,\u201d said Hung Tran, a senior executive at the Institute of International Finance, which has been warning about this issue. \u201cIt should also be seen as a powerful motivation for mutual funds to review their liquidity management strategies.\u201dWhat is surprising about the fund\u2019s failure, analysts say, is that it had not taken more precautions to have cash on hand in case this type of situation arose. Of late, many funds investing in these less-than-liquid niches of the market have increased cash levels and even taken out credit lines from banks in order to be prepared for a selling wave.Third Avenue, founded in 1986 by Martin J. Whitman, a vocal proponent of investing in value stocks, seems to have been caught short in this regard.In addition to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade like securities on an exchange and track a wide array of bond, equity and commodity baskets, have drawn many billions of dollars into their junk bond funds.To date though, these funds \u2014 which promise instant liquidity to investors \u2014 have not experienced major problems despite a tremendous pickup in buying and selling activity.By definition, a high-yield fund will invest in companies that are more at risk of going bust than a fund that buys the bonds of blue-chip companies like General Electric or JPMorgan Chase. But the Third Avenue fund seemed to have a particularly large share of companies that were either bankrupt or on the verge.Among its top holdings were Clear Channel Communications, the highly indebted radio broadcaster; Energy Future Holdings, a Texas electricity provider now in bankruptcy; and Liberty Tire Recycling, which is in talks to restructure its debts.But while the yields on these securities may have been appealing, their liquidity was not.Even in good times, these types of securities are hard to buy and sell, meaning a seller has to search out a buyer before he can dispose of his position.Before the financial crisis, large investment banks were the primary market-makers of these kinds of securities. Since 2009, however, they have slashed their inventories of corporate debt to $1.5 trillion from $9 trillion.At the same time, there has been an explosion of bonds issued by companies, with the result being more bonds than ever in issuance and an increasingly limited number of firms to trade them.Explaining why the investor panic in this area was appealing, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than people running out of a building with their hair on fire.\u201dAdvertisement"}

South African boys of their class seem raised to believe that they can get away with egregious acts of violent misogyny. Until recently, Mr. Pistorius appeared, like them, to have escaped censure.Because he is such a singular figure \u2014 the double amputee who became an athletic phenomenon, competing for his post-apartheid country against able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Olympics \u2014 it has been easy to see Mr. Pistorius as an exceptional figure. But viewed in context, his violence toward his partner makes him seem not unique but entirely a product of his South African-ness.Despite this, South Africa does not have a coherent national strategy aimed at preventing the epidemic of violence. Over the last 20 years, the government has passed a slew of laws aimed at punishing perpetrators of rape and intimate-partner abuse, but it has failed to root out the culture that permits violence against women. In another society, the conviction of Mr. Pistorius might serve as a turning point \u2014 a moment when public desire to end violence lines up with the government\u2019s desire to fix the underlying issues that cause violence. But not here.Mr. Pistorius may have failed, finally, to get away with murder. But as long as there are boys growing up who, like the Hilton College students, think rape is a joke, activists have no choice but to continue their campaign \u2014 with or without government backing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018What the Eye Hears\u2019 and \u2018America Dancing\u2019", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo an extent that seems counterintuitive from the quaint, straw-hat soft shoe typically associated with it, tap-\u00addancing \u2014 like so much of American popular culture \u2014 owes its very essence to black people. Like the jazz it evolved alongside, tap blends the European and the African to a near-indissoluble degree, with origins only dimly reconstructable. Brian \u00adSei\u00adbert\u2019s authoritative \u201cWhat the Eye Hears\u201d illuminates those beginnings \u2014 along with what happened afterward \u2014 as well as anyone ever will.His research is as thorough about the 1820s as about last week: Seibert, who writes about dance for The New York Times, has smoked out every clip, sat through every silly old movie, read everything and sorted it all out for the rest of us. Irish laborers brought clog-dancing and hornpipes across the ocean to America, here often accompanied by black fiddlers providing a rhythm observers described as weirdly \u201cprecise\u201d and rapturously infectious. This \u201cprecision\u201d was whites\u2019 first exposure to what we know as jamming.Black people not only accompanied but participated in the dancing, their movements often artfully constrained by balancing a glass of water on their heads, a prelude to the economy of tap gesture. This was called \u201cjigging,\u201d described in execution by an ex-slave as: \u201cHe could put de glass of water on his head and make his feet go like triphammers and sound like de snaredrum. He could whirl round and sich, all de movement from his hips down.\u201d\u201cIf this isn\u2019t tap, it sure sounds like an ancestor,\u201d Seibert notes, and this \u201cjigging\u201d became what we now know as tap through minstrel shows. White men imitated the black dancing style, and after the Civil War black minstrels mimicked their imitators, as \u201cpeople doing imitations of themselves.\u201d Whatever this was, it evolved from rustic stomping into something more elegant, blacks leading the way, whites reaping the glory. By the 1870s, the white minstrel George \u00adPrimrose was famed for his \u201csoft shoe,\u201d his feet \u201ctickling the floor with tiny motions\u201d while \u201cthe arms might float along.\u201d Primrose credited black dancers for his style, and by the turn of the century the infectious syncopated rhythm of ragtime \u2014 another black-\u00adcreated \u00adhybrid \u2014 jumped the rails into tap: Soon even white dancers had a hard time tapping without \u201cswinging.\u201d The closest we can get to what tap looked like at this point is a \u00adsilent 1897 film clip of a black boy hoofing as white men clap. A 1985 television special on black dance set this clip to a contemporary R&B beat, upon which it was bracingly clear that this kid was, as it were, busting a move.This white-to-black-to-white trajectory was by now an old story, as Megan Pugh gets down in \u201cAmerica Dancing: From the Cakewalk to the Moonwalk.\u201d Alongside early tap was the strutting cakewalk, which began with slaves imitating whites\u2019 prancy European steps and became the Gilded Age\u2019s hottest crossover dance fad, such that \u201camateur white European cakewalkers were imitating professional black American cakewalkers, who were imitating white minstrel cakewalkers imitating black slaves imitating their masters, who were unable to recognize that they were being mocked.\u201dThe cakewalk eventually flamed out but tap kept going, and it was assumed that blacks were the best at it, as well as dancing in general. H.L. Mencken opined in 1927 that \u201cno dance invented by white men has been danced at any genuinely high-toned shindig in America since the far-off days of the Wilson administration; the debutantes and their mothers now revolve their hips\u201d to black steps and black steps only. However, to be a truly famous tap-dancer largely meant being a white one. Bill (Bojangles) Robinson was the main exception: Though the era largely limited his major film roles to avuncular figures who danced with Shirley Temple, all of America knew who he was and his stage career glittered long and brightly. The Nicholas Brothers also worked steadily on stage and screen, and there was a reason: Over 70 years later their routine in \u201cStormy Weather\u201d still leaves you applauding even if you\u2019re alone and seeing it for the 25th time.But over all, the history of tap is one of what we now title appropriation. Seibert catalogs the extent to which black tap artists were behind what looked like a self-driven evolution in white stage dancing. Buddy Bradley, black, taught tap routines to soloists and choruses up and down Broadway in the 1920s for no credit. Eleanor Powell, Ann Miller and many other star white hoofers were regularly coached by black tap artists working in obscurity. Cholly Atkins (black) and a crew dubbed tap sound for Hollywood musicals, explaining why in many of these films what looks like (in Seibert\u2019s words) \u201ca chorus line of raggedly tapping white men\u201d sounds so sharp.In his admirable commitment to under\u00adlining the centrality of blackness to good tap, Seibert is perhaps a little hard on Powell, depicting her as a kind of one-trick pony whose career never really quite rang the bell, and also on Gene Kelly, who comes off as faintly sloppy. Would Seibert see them with such a gimlet eye if they had been black performers with exactly the same moves? Yet in the grand scheme of things, most certainly black tappers were robbed.Today\u2019s tap culture senses possible extinction ever around the corner, but that feeling dates as far back as the 1940s. Broadway shows began featuring ballet over tap. \u201cOklahoma!\u201d was transitional \u2014 Act 1 closed with a game-changing dream ballet that became a staple of musicals for the next 20 years (Pugh notes that there were 21 dream ballets in shows in just the three and a half years afterward). A World War II-era tax on dance clubs eventually shuttered most of them. Rock was especially hard on tap: The rhythm was too primitive, and it was difficult to amplify the sound of taps amid the new noise.Atkins, who with Honi Coles had thought of their showstopping tap number in the musical \u201cGentlemen Prefer Blondes\u201d (1949) as the start of bigger things, wound up coaching Motown singers in stage movement after finding that their \u201cBlondes\u201d gig had taken place at the end of the party. A 2012 City Center revival of that show revealed the tap number, though brilliantly executed by Phillip Attmore and Jared Grimes and bringing down the house, as an odd intrusion into the plot \u2014 i.e., a musical of 1949 had one, and was expected to stick to it, without extraneous breaks for hoofing.By the \u201970s, when tap experienced its first revival, few young black dancers were interested anymore. The people most committed to resuscitating the form were white women coming to it from outside. However, Gregory Hines\u2019s Broadway stardom put a young black face on tap for the first time in decades, and in his wake Savion Glover grew up on Broadway as a tap star \u2014 a career trajectory unheard of since the \u201940s \u2014 in a series of shows such as \u201cJelly\u2019s Last Jam\u201d and \u201cBring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk.\u201dGlover became the dean of a new movement cherishing tap as a form of black street expression, once again tilting male. This has involved some modern conceptions of cultural ownership, what we might call reappropriation. \u201cNaw, it\u2019s raw. It\u2019s rhythms. It\u2019s us. It\u2019s ours,\u201d \u00adGlover said in \u201cBring In da Noise,\u201d a show set to hip-hop beats, promulgating a myth that Africans invented tap-dancing when their drums were taken away in \u00adAmerica, and dissing sunny Bill Robinson as a cynically shuffling \u201cUncle Huck-a-Buck,\u201d caught short when Shirley Temple asks why she makes more money than he does. To be sure, tap must embrace the music of today\u2019s young people rather than old standards, but Robert Bru\u00adstein was correct in critiquing the show\u2019s denial of tap\u2019s fundamentally hybrid origins, as were the white women who had helped keep tap alive in their worry that confining tap to black street culture threatened to marginalize it once again.Of course, one might cast this reappropriation as a self-\u00adliberation from real life\u2019s prejudices and dismissals. In fact, Pugh (a poet and critic who has taught at the University of California, Berkeley) ventures this as a summation of American show business dance in general, through five case studies of cakewalking: Bill Robinson, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Agnes de Mille, Paul Taylor and Michael Jackson. The idea works easily for the mocking origins of the cakewalk, and is applicable to a cop accusing Robinson of loitering for simply standing on the street gazing at a neon ad for the show he was shining in nightly. Beyond this, however, the theme is forced, requiring the notion that \u201cirrepressible freedom\u201d was the defining essence of Fred and Ginger, that Taylor\u2019s works are significant in taking \u201cAmerica and, often, its dancing to task for their failings,\u201d and so on. This is a reductive take on these careers and a rather fragile characterization of what makes dance American in general, imposed on what are essentially self-standing essays.Seibert\u2019s book is more organic, but has a different structural flaw: In his quest to redress thwarted careers, he at times drifts from the analytic into the archival. Indeed, as the book clocks in at over 600 pages, including coverage of tap overseas, some will guiltily wonder whether tap bears quite so very much a volume of attention. Whether tap is art or craft comes up often in the book: Is tap something over which one furrows the brow, musing over where it is \u201cgoing,\u201d or just a nifty, virtuosic way of dancing?As early as the 1930s, many were deciding on the latter. Robert Benchley noted in 1931 that hoofers \u201care all good, and are getting better each year, so there is no excitement in seeing a good one anymore.\u201d Ten years later the dance critic Walter Terry sniffed that tap was musically limited to pop ditties, that \u201cabout the only human quality it can project is good spirits,\u201d and that \u201cthere is a limited number of things that can be said with the feet.\u201dIn themselves, these were underinformed, or at least premature, judgments. Tap hardly requires \u201crazzle-dazzle.\u201d \u00adSei\u00adbert notes that when Honi Coles late in his life performed in the Gersh\u00adwin pastiche musical \u201cMy One and Only\u201d with Tommy Tune, Coles\u2019s role as tap guru was to impart cool over hot: holding that cup of water on the head, so to speak. Moreover, \u201cgood spirits\u201d were of a decidedly low priority in the broad palette of emotions tap conveyed in \u201cBring In da Noise.\u201dYet it bears asking whether there could be a \u201cHamilton\u201d of tap. Few would grant \u201cBring In da Noise\u201d that status, as vibrant as it was, and Seibert notes the limited artistic success of attempts in a similar vein \u2014 even a more purely terpsichorean \u201cSwan Lake\u201d of tap has proved elusive. \u201cIts glory flows from its meager means,\u201d Seibert judges of tap, and those means may exert certain limits. Currently, tap seems caught \u00adbetween attempts to evolve artistically, only to be judged solipsistically \u201ctedious\u201d and \u201cmindlessly dull\u201d (Alastair Macaulay in The Times on a late-stage exploratory presentation by Glover), or to be enshrined in the aspic of festivals longer on camaraderie and routine than creativity.Tap \u201cremains peripheral to contemporary popular culture, and its place in more specialized zones is far from secure,\u201d Seibert intones. Yet we do not wonder why Dixieland jazz, despite the energy and expertise that produces it, is an antiquarian taste. Notably, Dixieland only truly lives via the modern jazz that it morphed into, but the physical nature of tap most likely prevents it from evolving in a similar way while remaining recognizable as tap dance. Seibert, though, does a sterling job of telling the story of where tap has been, and why it matters.WHAT THE EYE HEARS A History of Tap DancingBy Brian SeibertIllustrated. 612 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $35.AMERICA DANCING From the Cakewalk to the MoonwalkBy Megan PughIllustrated. 398 pp. Yale University Press. $32.50.

{"Headline": "Venezuela May Have Indirectly Aided U.S. Inquiry of Official", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor five long years, American investigators have suspected that N\u00e9stor Reverol, the former head of Venezuela\u2019s antidrug unit, was working as a kind of double agent.Even as he publicly trumpeted his exploits against crime groups, Colombian drug runners were telling investigators a different story: that Mr. Reverol had been taking bribes from the trafficking groups he was supposed to demolish.Now, American prosecutors are preparing to announce their charges against Mr. Reverol, the sort of explosive accusations that make the authorities in Venezuela fire back that the United States is lying to undermine their leftist government.Yet in an unexpected twist, key information in the case may have come from the Venezuelan government itself.Amid the feuds between Washington and Caracas, a number of Colombian drug traffickers have been captured in Venezuela and extradited to Colombia. But rather than being tried there, some were then extradited again \u2014 this time to the United States, where they have become informers against their Venezuelan associates.The double extraditions played a role in gathering information in the indictment of Mr. Reverol, a top general now leading the country\u2019s National Guard, who American prosecutors say was on the payroll of the drug cartels, according to a person familiar with the case.Mr. Reverol\u2019s name is the latest tied to drug and corruption charges that have made the difficult relationship between the United States and Venezuela even worse.A former intelligence chief of Venezuela is also wanted in the United States, accused of being on the payroll of Colombian drug traffickers, as are several former police officers. Diosdado Cabello, the departing head of the National Assembly in Venezuela, is under investigation in a money laundering case.And in November, federal prosecutors charged two nephews of Cilia Flores, the wife of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, with conspiring to transport 800 kilograms of cocaine, or more than 1,700 pounds, to the United States.In recent years, American investigators say, Venezuela has turned into a global hub for drugs, principally cocaine, destined for the United States. Colombian trafficking groups have long taken advantage of the porous border between the two countries and weak law enforcement.But many of the cartels arrive from Colombia lacking the local contacts they had on their side of the border. That\u2019s where, according to the person familiar with Mr. Reverol\u2019s case, the head of the antidrug unit fit in.\u201cThe way for them to succeed in Venezuela was to start bribing Venezuelan officials,\u201d said the person, who asked not to be named because the charges against Mr. Reverol were not yet public.In exchange for bribes, Mr. Reverol repeatedly called off investigations, hindered inquiries of traffickers and warned them where officers were operating, according to the person.Venezuelan officials did not directly address reports that Mr. Reverol was under indictment, but they did carry out a campaign defending the general, mostly through a series of Twitter posts, including ones highlighting his actions to arrest or disrupt drug traffickers.On Tuesday during his weekly television program, Mr. Maduro repeated accusations he has made before: that the American embassy has tried to recruit soldiers and military officers to take part in a destabilization campaign.\u201cThey attack our military chiefs, military leaders, because the gringo embassy has not been able to recruit a single military chief, a single military leader, even though they try, launching campaigns here and there,\u201d Mr. Maduro said, using an epithet for Americans as he urged the military to keep up its morale.Arrests of several major Colombian drug trafficking suspects operating in Venezuela occurred while Mr. Reverol was head of the National Antidrug Office, the Venezuelan counterpart to the Drug Enforcement Administration. In some cases, Venezuela and the United States worked together.Then in 2012, Diego P\u00e9rez Henao, a leader of the Rastrojos drug gang, was arrested in Venezuela and extradited to Colombia. From there, he was sent on to the United States. Also in 2012, Luis Enrique Calle Serna, known as Comba, another important member of the Rastrojos, negotiated his surrender directly to American authorities in Panama.\u201cComba, who with his Rastrojos was working very deeply in Venezuela, turned himself in and made an agreement with the U.S. justice system,\u201d said Jeremy McDermott, co-director of InSight Crime, a research organization.Mr. McDermott said that a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of Colombian traffickers operating in Venezuela had been captured and extradited to the United States, where they appeared to have spilled their secrets to investigators.Even when they cooperated, however, relations between Venezuela and the United States were strained. They soured after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a leftist, was elected president in 1998, and in particular after a short-lived 2002 coup against him that had the tacit support of the Bush administration.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said he was suspending cooperation with the D.E.A. in 2005, accusing it of spying and even acting as a drug trafficker.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez kicked out the American ambassador to Venezuela in 2008, accusing the United States of backing a group of coup plotters. The United States responded by expelling the Venezuelan ambassador in Washington.The tensions have continued under Mr. Maduro, who has kicked out American embassy officials, accusing them of plotting against his government. He has frequently accused Washington of conspiring against him and supporting plots to kill him.Efforts to repair relations have repeatedly fizzled. The most recent occurred this year when Secretary of State John Kerry dispatched a top adviser, Thomas A. Shannon Jr., to meet with Venezuelan officials, including Mr. Maduro.While those talks did not lead to significant changes, the situation appears to have cooled. Mr. Maduro remained silent after his wife\u2019s nephews were arrested in Haiti in November and sent to New York to face charges of conspiring to ship cocaine to the United States.Mr. Maduro has also had a complicated relationship with Colombia. This year, he deported hundreds of Colombians living in Venezuela, shut the border and accused the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of taking part in plots against him. He said that paramilitary drug gangs on the border were seeking to kill him and destabilize the economy.But Mr. Santos has largely sought smoother relations with Venezuela, tapping its government to help efforts to negotiate a peace deal with Colombia\u2019s largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.The FARC operates extensively along the border and received support from the Ch\u00e1vez government. The United States has accused several top Venezuelan officials of aiding the FARC\u2019s drug trafficking operations.Mr. McDermott, of InSight Crime, said that American prosecutors may be focusing more intensely on Venezuela because drug trafficking there has changed.For many years, investigators believed that Venezuelan military and police officers were on Colombian traffickers\u2019 payrolls, providing them information about investigations and protection for drug shipments.\u201cThere has been a change in the nature of the role of the Venezuelans,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have moved from facilitators to drug traffickers in their own right.\u201d He added, \u201cNowadays we believe the Venezuelans are buying and selling their own shipments.\u201dHe also said that a boom over the last year in Colombia in the planting of coca, the plant used to make cocaine, would likely lead to a surge in the amount of the drug moving through Venezuela.Patricia Torres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To avoid this catastrophe, Congress needs to help the island, which is home to 3.5 million American citizens, by giving it the ability to restructure its debts in an orderly way.The investors want the government to sell assets, raise taxes and cut spending. But these austerity policies have not worked in troubled countries like Greece, and they won\u2019t work in Puerto Rico. In fact, they would create a downward spiral. People, especially working-age adults, would increasingly move to states where public services are better and jobs are easier to find; about 300,000 people have left in the past 10 years. A much larger exodus would erode the tax base, making it even harder for the government to provide services or repay its debt.Mr. Ryan has said the House will come up with legislation by the end of March, but there is no reason Congress cannot act faster. Lawmakers have had numerous hearings on Puerto Rico, and some were working on a proposal with Obama administration officials during negotiations for the omnibus spending bill that was just signed.Without an orderly process to restructure its debts, Puerto Rico and its creditors could be locked in years of litigation that would benefit no one and inflict intolerable hardships on millions of Americans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed\u2019s Next Move", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialBut it is hard to see how the increase will benefit the economy as a whole. The unemployment rate has held steady recently, at 5 percent, but the underemployment rate \u2014 which includes the unemployed, part-timers who need full-time work and jobless workers who have apparently given up looking \u2014 is still at nearly 10 percent.One result of those slack conditions is that pay raises for most workers are still few and far between. With no evidence of inflation in wages or in consumer prices, there was simply no need at this time for the Fed to risk slowing the economy by raising rates.Banks tend to favor higher rates out of fear that an outbreak of inflation will erode the value of loans. For most of the past several decades, Fed policy makers tended to indulge these fears by giving priority to fighting inflation, even when doing so stifled jobs and wages.But from the end of 2008 until this week, the Fed kept interest rates near zero, even though its low rate policy and other stimulus measures did not benefit the banks directly. This week\u2019s interest rate increase, though small, is significant, because it is a sign that the Fed has again let fighting inflation take precedence over pursuing full employment.For example, the Fed\u2019s inflation target of 2 percent is not a ceiling that inflation cannot surpass. The Fed should be clear that the target is a desired average inflation rate over time. Specifically, wages can rise faster than the inflation target without pulling up prices as long as labor productivity keeps growing apace.In fact, the risk that wages will continue to stagnate \u2014 as they have for decades for most people \u2014 should be a far more worrisome issue for policy makers than a distant and theoretical risk of inflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strike Tests Kohler, Wis., and the Company Sharing Its Name", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKOHLER, Wis. \u2014 Highland Drive unfurls like a ribbon through this photogenic village near Lake Michigan. One side of the street is a tableau of leisure: a Tudor-style luxury resort, a spa, shops and a four-star, jackets-required restaurant that serves venison loin and foie gras. For the last month, the other side has been far less placid. There, dozens of striking blue-collar workers from the nearby Kohler Company factory, some wearing barn jackets and Green Bay Packers knit caps, have been protesting the terms of a contract offered by Kohler that pays newer hires far less than more established workers. In response to the walkout, the local factory\u2019s first in more than 30 years, the company threatened to move jobs out of town and upend the local economy.\u201cWe worked very hard to reach an agreement that addresses all of the key areas crucial to the future of our members,\u201d said Tim Tayloe, the local union president. He said the agreement would \u201csignificantly\u201d close the wage gap between newer and older hires, \u201cwhile also providing substantial wage increases in each year of the contract.\u201dThe announcement brought a tentative peace to the village of Kohler, a tiny pocket of affluence an hour\u2019s drive north of Milwaukee, where weekend visitors browse in the Kohler Company\u2019s gleaming design showroom and take morning tours of the factory. The company also maintains its corporate headquarters here.Residents who had become accustomed to the sight of striking workers said they often felt torn over which side to support. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there are any winners or losers in this,\u201d Craig Harms, an owner of Restoration Gardens, a greenhouse and garden center in Kohler, said Wednesday.As workers prepared to vote on the proposed settlement, and for the possibility of a return to the factory, they said in interviews that they were steeling themselves for tension.On Facebook, some union members urged others to give the silent treatment to workers who had crossed the picket lines in the weeks before, people whose names were circulated on a \u201cscab list\u201d by the union.Nancy Robison, a 27-year veteran of Kohler, said she was eager to return to work. But during the weeks on strike, away from the factory, she had encountered a member of management who greeted her coolly. \u201cHe was definitely a lot more short in conversation than usual,\u201d she said. \u201cI could feel the cold.\u201dOn Wednesday evening, union members overwhelmingly voted to ratify the contract, clearing the way for a return to work on Thursday morning.The strike, an increasingly rare event in the United States, took on special meaning in Wisconsin, a stronghold of both the manufacturing industry and the labor movement. Under the Republican governor, Scott Walker, unions have been weakened in the state, and many workers here saw the Kohler strike as a battle to hold onto some of organized labor\u2019s waning powers.Whether the union succeeded in winning major concessions was not clear. A news release issued by the company suggested that the two-tier wage structure that the union had lobbied so vociferously against would remain in place, though union officials said the gap between tiers would shrink.The union first agreed to the two-tier system in 2010, believing it would help save jobs and lift Kohler out of the Great Recession. But this year, with their contract expired, they argued that the local economy had rebounded, the Kohler Company was thriving and it was time to share the success with blue-collar workers, particularly the entry-level employees who were making less than $13 an hour.\u201cBack then, we were trying to help the company out,\u201d said Tom Huston, 54, a forklift driver who has worked for Kohler for almost 25 years, as he stood on a picket line outside the factory last week. \u201cWe took a wage freeze and the tiered system. But now the economy is back.\u201dOlder workers on the picket lines said they were expressing their solidarity for the younger generation. Of the 2,000 striking employees, about 400 of them are considered Tier B, the lower-wage tier. Tier A workers earned about $21 to $22 an hour on average, according to the union; the company says it is $23.45. Kohler says that Tier B employees make an average of $14.69 an hour; the union says it is closer to $12.50.\u201cThey\u2019re doing the same work I\u2019m doing, but for less,\u201d said Kim Nagel, 48, a faucet operator and Tier A employee who has worked for Kohler for 27 years, earning about $60,000 a year with overtime. \u201cNot in my eyes, but they\u2019re second-class citizens. They\u2019re living with their parents, driving beater cars, living payday to payday.\u201dJeff Roth, 22, a material handler, said he made $12.53 an hour, a wage that does not allow him enough financial freedom to buy or rent his own home, so he lives with his parents. \u201cYou can\u2019t do too many things on our salary,\u201d he said, adding that he could not imagine sustaining a career at Kohler on his current pay.Kohler executives have said that erasing the two-tiered system would force them to move jobs from Wisconsin to factories in lower-cost cities in the American South or overseas.

{"Headline": "Leases and Lengthier Loans Can Reduce Car Payments", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserCAR shoppers are increasingly favoring financial arrangements like leases and longer-term loans that allow them to buy costlier vehicles but with more manageable monthly payments.With a lease, a shopper pays for the car for a set period of time, typically three years. At the end of the lease, that person has the option of returning the car to the dealer or buying it. Monthly lease payments are generally lower than payments on a standard loan because they are based on the car\u2019s depreciation over the lease period, rather than the full purchase price.Consumers save an average of $84 a month on payments by leasing a new car rather than taking out a loan, Experian said. The average monthly lease payment was about the same as a year ago, at just under $400 a month.Shoppers who buy cars with loans are also looking to keep their monthly payments down, and one way to do that is to extend the loan term. In the third quarter, the proportion of consumers who took out car loans of 61 to 72 months \u2014 five to six years \u2014 reached record highs for both new (44 percent) and used (41 percent) cars.Even longer loans are gaining popularity as well. New-car loans of 73 months to 84 months \u2014 six to seven years \u2014 increased to nearly 28 percent, and long-term loans for used cars reached a record high of 16 percent.Melinda Zabritski, Experian\u2019s senior director of automotive finance, said rising prices for both new and used cars were pushing up the size of car loans, and consumers were seeking to make payments more affordable.Jeff Bartlett, deputy auto editor with Consumer Reports, said the recent data continued trends that had been evident throughout the year. Consumers are more confident about the economy, he said, so they are more comfortable buying more expensive cars, while lower gas prices make buying larger vehicles, like sport utility vehicles, more feasible.But the lower monthly payments available with leases and longer-term loans come with some trade-offs.Longer loan terms mean buyers will pay more in interest for the car over all, and increase the risk that some sort of economic shift \u2014 an increase in gas prices, say \u2014 may make the car less affordable during the life of the loan, Mr. Bartlett said.Leasing, meanwhile, can lock consumers into a stubborn pattern of monthly payments.\u201cWhen you enter a lease for the first time, it seems wonderful,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said, since the lessee gets a new car with low monthly payments, and down payments that are usually quite low as well. It is easy to overlook that at the end of the lease, there will not be a car to trade in to help finance the purchase of another one. That makes another lease more likely, so the consumer never has the benefit of a payment-free period, as when a shorter-term loan is paid off.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to break the cycle,\u201d he said.People who drive long distances, or who often transport children or pets, may not be good candidates for leasing, he said. Leases typically include a fixed mileage amount \u2014 often 12,000 miles a year \u2014 and charge drivers hefty fees for exceeding it. Leases also usually include fees for \u201cexcessive\u201d wear and tear. That means that dents or scratches, or stains on the upholstery, may cost hundreds of dollars at the end of the lease.\u201cIf you have messy children or a hairy, slobbering dog, think twice,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said.Lease agreements can also be confusing and contain jargon, as well as hidden fees, that make it difficult for shoppers to understand clearly the overall cost. \u201cIt pays to go slow and look at all the numbers,\u201d he advised.Mr. Reed of Edmunds said the cheapest option was usually to buy a used car, perhaps with a small loan. But some people enjoy driving new cars and, if they understand the trade-offs, he said, leasing can make sense. The consumer has a car with the most up-to-date safety features and will be driving it during its most reliable period, so there is less worry about budgeting for repairs. \u201cIt\u2019s quite likely you won\u2019t even have to buy tires,\u201d he said.Here are some questions and answers about leasing a car:Yes, Mr. Bartlett said. Mileage fees can add up. If you drive 1,000 miles over the limit, and the overage fee is 25 cents a mile, that\u2019s an extra $250. So if you suspect you will go over the allotment, you can seek to negotiate upfront for extra miles, at a lower rate, and be reimbursed for the miles not used.Leases are most common with new cars, but they are available for some used cars, Mr. Reed said \u2014 typically, certified upscale cars offered by dealerships.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.com Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governing Party in Spain Loses Majority in Parliamentary Election", "Date": "2015-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 The conservative governing party won the most votes on Sunday, but lost its majority in parliamentary elections that underlined the fragmentation of Spanish politics and left the country\u2019s future leadership unclear. He added: \u201cAt best, Spain will end up with a weak government. At worst, Spaniards might have to head to the polls again soon. Neither scenario is ideal for a country that is still looking to consolidate a much-awaited economic recovery.\u201d Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party won 123 of the 350 parliamentary seats, down from 186 seats in the last elections, in 2011, according to the results with nearly all of the votes counted. The Socialists won 90 seats, compared with 110 four years ago, when they were ousted from office after an economic crisis hit Spain. The emerging parties Podemos and Citizens will enter Parliament for the first time after winning 69 and 40 seats. Before Sunday\u2019s vote, the leaders of Spain\u2019s main parties had hinted at possible coalition partnerships, without firmly committing to any.Mr. Rajoy celebrated the results on Sunday, but gave a cautious message to his supporters, saying, \u201cI will try to form a government, and I believe Spain needs a stable government.\u201d Podemos and Citizens wanted the elections to mark the end of Spain\u2019s bipartisan system, and they came close to achieving that goal, despite a Spanish system of proportional representation that did not favor them. Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservatives and the main opposition Socialists together won 50.7 percent of the votes, their lowest combined total and down from 73.4 percent in 2011. The elections showed an erosion of support for Mr. Rajoy and his party, but also for the Socialists. Even with their worst election results, they maintained their status as the largest left-leaning party in Parliament thanks to votes in their longstanding regional stronghold of Andalusia in the south. Podemos was formed early last year as a far-left, anti-austerity party, modeled in part on the success of Syriza, the governing party in Greece. Citizens transformed itself last year from a regional Catalan party, fiercely opposed to the Catalan secessionist movement, into a national party with a liberal economic agenda. Mr. Rajoy presented himself as the custodian of Spanish unity and continuity, in the face of challenges not only from secessionist politicians in Catalonia but also the two emerging parties.But the elections were also generational. Mr. Rajoy, 60, who was already a government minister in the 1990s, trumpeted his experience in contrast to untested challengers. Among his opponents, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the Socialist leader, is 43; the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, 37; and Albert Rivera, the leader of Citizens, 36.Mr. Rajoy also warned that any change of tack, after a 2012 banking bailout and years of fiscal belt-tightening under his conservative administration, could once more derail Spain\u2019s economy, which is expected to grow 3 percent this year, outpacing most other European economies.In Madrid on Sunday, Nabil Edriss S\u00e1nchez, a broker, cast his ballot for Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party, \u201cbut while holding my nose,\u201d he said, because of what he called \u201ca horrendous level of corruption.\u201d Still, he argued that the Popular Party was best placed to guarantee political stability, which is \u201cwhat the financial markets want,\u201d and avoid the risk of a left-wing coalition led by the Socialists. The Socialists failed to shake off the legacy of their previous time in office, when they led Spain into recession and soaring joblessness. The party has also been entangled in corruption allegations, including a court investigation into the embezzlement of public funds earmarked for the unemployed.One of the main challenges facing Spain\u2019s next government is Catalonia, where separatist parties are struggling to form their own regional coalition government. According to Sunday\u2019s results, Podemos made the clearest gains in Catalonia, apparently benefiting from a promise by Mr. Iglesias to hold a referendum on Catalan independence if he became Spain\u2019s prime minister. Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, with the support of Spanish courts, has repeatedly blocked any Catalan attempt to hold such a referendum. \u201cSpain has voted for a change of system,\u201d Mr. Iglesias told supporters on Sunday night. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that the two-party system has ended.\u201d Mr. Rivera, the leader of Citizens, told his supporters, \u201cSpain is starting a new political era and is doing so because millions have decided that Spain will change.\u201dAn article on Dec. 21 about the governing party\u2019s loss of its parliamentary majority in national elections in Spain misspelled, in some editions, the given name of an analyst at Open Europe, a political think tank, who said the results left Spain in \u201ctotal uncertainty.\u201d He is Vincenzo Scarpetta, not Vicenzo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Higher Interest Rates Lower Expectations in Emerging Economies", "Date": "2015-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosPANGKALAN KERINCI, Indonesia \u2014 In this company town where acacia and palm oil trees stretch for miles, the Indonesian conglomerate Royal Golden Eagle is bracing for impact.Already, prices of palm oil, one of its main products, have fallen. And the value of the Indonesian rupiah has plummeted, hurting the buying power of the 100,000 people in this dusty town, many of whom rely on the sprawling mill and plantation for jobs, as well as electricity and water. And foreign investors have been broadly rethinking the country\u2019s prospects, creating economic uncertainty.\u201cWe wanted to be positioned nicely for this downturn,\u201d said Anderson Tanoto, the son of the company\u2019s founder and chairman, Sukanto Tanoto. \u201cIt was just a matter of time. We all knew rates couldn\u2019t stay low.\u201dOfficials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.Their efforts were supported by soaring commodity prices, when Chinese demand for coal, palm oil and other natural resources seemed inexhaustible. The boom transformed economies from Southeast Asia to Latin America, fueling the growth of the middle class in many countries.But developing countries are now being squeezed by the interest rate increase and the slump in global commodity prices. The dollar has strengthened in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s move, but the Indonesian rupiah has been falling, nearly to a level last seen during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.Consumer demand in this relatively youthful country of 250 million people is also starting to look shaky. Car sales are down nearly 20 percent this year from 2014, and smartphone sales recently contracted for the first time on record. An array of local companies \u2014 from coal mine operators in the jungles of Borneo to the ubiquitous mobile phone retailers in Jakarta\u2019s flashy new shopping malls \u2014 are struggling to cover their debts.\u201cA Fed hike is not going to knock out emerging markets like Indonesia,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. \u201cBut things are bound to get a little tougher from here.\u201dParallels between the current downturn and the financial crisis in the late 1990s are difficult to escape. Then, turmoil erupted when currencies around the region began to plunge, setting off a chain reaction of defaults among companies that had borrowed heavily from foreign investors.At that time, some two-thirds of the Tanotos\u2019 sprawling mill and plantation complex on the island of Sumatra was still under construction, with projects totaling roughly $2 billion. The project\u2019s three sources of funding \u2014 local banks, foreign banks and export credit agencies \u2014 dried up almost overnight.\u201cEverything wrong happened at the same time,\u201d the elder Mr. Tanoto said.After that crisis, a bank controlled by Mr. Tanoto collapsed and, later, he lost control of Adaro Energy, a huge coal mining business on Borneo. His palm oil operation had to pay a record fine of about 2.5 trillion rupiah, or about $180 million at today\u2019s exchange rates, for tax evasion. The company disputes the allegations of unpaid taxes and continues to challenge the matter in the courts.In the current environment, the operation is focused on keeping down costs by increasing efficiency. At an on-site laboratory, scientists cross different types of palm oil trees, trying to develop a variety that yields more oil and better resists disease. The trees are also bred to be shorter, so it is easier to harvest their fruit.The company is also trying to reduce its reliance on lower-value bulk commodities. The roughly 400,000 tons of freshly cut acacia trees stacked in towering piles surrounding the mill are waiting to be turned into pulp that the company dries into sheets for export. With the mill expansion, it will be able to make more of its own Paper One brand here, which it can sell for a higher price.Prices of pulp and paper have proved to be more resilient than those of palm oil. So far, none of the major paper companies are showing the stress that appeared in the late 1990s, when the conglomerate\u2019s larger competitor, Asia Pulp & Paper, defaulted on nearly $14 billion in foreign debt.While Indonesia does not appear to be headed for a repeat of the earlier crisis, the problems today are similar, if on a smaller scale. As they did then, some companies have taken advantage of years of easy credit to take on more debt than they can handle.Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.Mr. Hutapea\u2019s most recent big case involved defending one of Indonesia\u2019s largest shipping companies, PT Arpeni Pratama Ocean Line \u2014 with total debt of nearly $500 million \u2014 from legal actions by creditors. One of the company\u2019s insurers filed an action this summer seeking to declare the shipper bankrupt over unpaid bills.\u201cThe problems started in mining, because they shipped a lot of coal to China,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not an economist, but if a shipping company runs out of business, it means all its customers are also seeing a drop.\u201d\u201cLuckily, I won the case in the commercial court and the Supreme Court, mostly on the basis of some technicalities,\u201d Mr. Hutapea added.The slump that started in commodities and industrial firms is spreading to other parts of the economy. For years, sales of mobile phones rose fast, a tangible sign of the newfound buying power of Indonesia\u2019s rapidly growing middle class.Now consumers are pulling back. In November, PT Trikomsel Oke, one of the country\u2019s biggest mobile phone retailers, which is owned in part by the SoftBank Group of Japan, defaulted when it missed a payment on about $150 million in bonds sold in Singapore. The company said it had about $460 million in debt due in the next two years that it would be unable to pay.Trikomsel, the mobile phone retailer, has blamed the shrinking budgets of Indonesian consumers, who are favoring cheaper products. The weakened rupiah is also a factor, since most phones are imported. Smartphone sales volumes fell by 7 percent in the third quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2014, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research.On a recent visit to one of Trikomsel\u2019s retailing outlets at the upscale Taman Anggrek mall in Jakarta, the store was empty apart from a lone cashier, Ibham, 26, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. \u201cThe end of the year is usually a busy season,\u201d he said, \u201cbut maybe less so this year because the currency is weaker.\u201dThe broader telecom sector, a major focus of foreign investors in recent years, has been scrambling to limit its pain.Indosat Ooredoo, Indonesia\u2019s second-biggest mobile service provider, which is majority owned by the government of Qatar, continues to add new subscribers. But Alexander Rusli, the company\u2019s chief executive, says the slumping currency has hurt its ability to expand and upgrade its coverage network because it has made imported equipment more expensive.As it hunkers down, Indosat is reducing its dollar-denominated debt in favor of debt in the local currency. It is also exploring pricing contracts with suppliers like Huawei of China in that country\u2019s currency, to further diversify its currency exposure.While Royal Golden Eagle is similarly preparing for the new reality, Sukanto Tanoto remains optimistic. Rising rates and slower growth in China may complicate his business plans, but they do not spell disaster.\u201cDoing the commodity business with China is like drinking coffee,\u201d Mr. Tanoto said. \u201cWe enjoyed three spoons of sugar per cup for a long time. Suddenly, when that\u2019s cut to one and a half spoons, we feel bitter \u2014 because it used to be so sweet.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted a response from the palm oil subsidiary of Royal Golden Eagle. The company is still challenging tax evasion charges in the courts.Muhammad Rusmadi contributed reporting from Jakarta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Venezuelan Court Blocks 4 Lawmakers ", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked four newly elected lawmakers from taking office, three from the opposition and one from the governing Socialist party.The move, in response to a challenge from a Socialist candidate, came days before the Jan. 5 swearing in of the new National Assembly and stoked fears in the opposition that the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was seeking to chip away at the two-thirds majority that would enable it to remove cabinet ministers and take other extraordinary steps to challenge his policies.\u201cWe will defend the majority,\u201d Freddy Guevara, who leads an opposition party, wrote in a post on Twitter. He called for a demonstration on Jan. 5 to support the incoming legislators, adding, \u201cThe best response we can give this moribund regime is to show in the streets how many of us there are.\u201dEarlier on Wednesday, opposition leaders warned that the government was seeking to use the court to cut into its majority in the legislature. Jes\u00fas Torrealba, the head of the opposition\u2019s Democratic Unity coalition, made public a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, appealing for his support and warning that Mr. Maduro\u2019s government was seeking to stage a \u201cjudicial coup against the decision of the Venezuelan people expressed at the voting booth.\u201d He also wrote to other world leaders.The court action on Wednesday granted an injunction that would bar the four lawmakers from being sworn in while a court challenge to their election proceeds. All four lawmakers were from the sparsely populated Amazonas State. The case was brought by a Socialist candidate who is also a former cabinet minister.Challenges to at least four other opposition victories were also filed this week with the court. In those cases, the court did not issue injunctions but ruled that the legal challenges to the victories could go forward.Information available on the court\u2019s website did not explain the legal arguments behind the election challenges.The opposition won 112 seats in the 167-member assembly, giving it exactly a two-thirds majority. The United Socialist Party won 55 seats.On election night, Mr. Maduro acknowledged the opposition victory. Yet he has since accused the opposition of \u201cplaying dirty\u201d in the election. Some government officials have accused the opposition of buying votes, especially in Amazonas, yet during the campaign Mr. Maduro and other officials presided over numerous giveaways in which supporters received cars, apartments and other valuable items \u2014 all typical of the country\u2019s electioneering.In the past, Mr. Maduro and other government officials have scoffed at opposition claims of voting irregularities, frequently boasting that the country\u2019s electronic voting system is fraud-proof. The legislative election hinged on discontent over a failing economy and rising crime.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Building Greener Ships, to Keep the Sea From Rising", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by6 PhotosSAN DIEGO \u2014 With its cavernous cargo holds and gleaming white superstructure, the 730-foot Perla del Caribe, which is nearing completion at a shipyard here, looks like any midsize container ship.But at the stern, visible through cutouts in the superstructure, are two huge steel tanks that show this is no typical vessel. The bulbous tanks, 90 feet long and painted an eye-catching lime green, together will carry half a million gallons of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. The gas will be the primary fuel used to power the ship when it begins moving cargo on a weekly schedule from Jacksonville, Fla., to San Juan, P.R., early next year.While L.N.G. has been used for some ferries and other vessels, the ship and a second, identical one that began plying the Jacksonville-San Juan route last month, are the first container ships to use the fuel. Cleaner-burning L.N.G., which consists almost entirely of methane, can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 15 percent to 20 percent compared with the heavy tarlike fuels used on most ships.Environmentalists and others say that too little has been done to rein in ship emissions. As a percentage of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, the contribution from shipping is relatively small \u2014 about 2.6 percent of the global total in 2012, the most recent year for which firm data available. But that figure is poised to grow enormously.Because most of its work occurs at sea, shipping is something of a hidden industry. And out of sight can be out of mind for emissions.As evidence of this lack of scrutiny, environmentalists say, language about emissions from shipping, and from commercial aviation, was eliminated from a draft of the Paris climate treaty during earlier negotiations. Although the language was eventually reinstated, there is no certainty it will make the final cut.And while the previous climate treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, did mention shipping, \u201cunfortunately, nothing meaningful happened,\u201d Mr. Raptis said.Pound for pound and mile for mile, shipping is already the most environmentally efficient way to move cargo, and standards to improve efficiency in new ships went into effect earlier this year. Those standards are subject to regular review and could be tightened \u201cif the technology supports that,\u201d a spokeswoman for the United Nations agency said.Many liner shippers have adopted efficiency improvements, which can include relatively straightforward steps like polishing the propeller or coating the hull with paint that inhibits the growth of algae and other organisms, to more extensive and expensive work to improve engine performance, reshape the bow or add fins or ducts to the propeller.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Silverstream\u2019s technology, which includes pumps and other equipment and modifications to the hull, has been tested by Shell; in sea trials on a 575-foot-long tanker, it improved efficiency by about 5 percent. A Norwegian Cruise Line ship under construction in Germany will have the technology when it is launched in 2017.But critics point out that there is no guarantee slow steaming will continue. In a stronger worldwide economy, there will be greater pressure on shippers to get more goods to market sooner. Even if slow steaming continues and per-unit emissions remain low, as more cargo is shipped, total emissions will increase.Liner shippers move only about 60 percent of ocean-going cargo. With other types of shipping \u2014 including bulk carriers of oil, grains and other commodities \u2014 the shipowner passes the fuel cost on to the company that is chartering the vessel, so there is little incentive for the owner to make improvements.The United Nations agency\u2019s efficiency standards apply only to new ships, not the approximately 70,000 existing commercial vessels. And because of the unique structure of the shipping industry \u2014 vessels are usually registered in countries like Panama and Liberia, partly to avoid stricter regulations elsewhere \u2014 it can be difficult to get information about environmental performance for the industry as a whole and for individual ships.But environmentalists say that efficiency standards, even if more broadly applied, can go only so far. The only way to truly rein in shipping emissions, they argue, is by adopting specific reduction targets, as many countries and other industries have.Even if the International Maritime Organization tightens its efficiency standards, \u201cthis won\u2019t be enough to reduce emissions,\u201d said Mr. Raptis of Transport and Environment. \u201cWe need reduction targets.\u201dBut the shipping industry is concerned that targets could eventually disrupt world trade by restricting ships, and the United Nations agency has for now rejected that approach \u2014 most recently in May, when it put off discussion of a proposal that would only have set up a process to work toward reduction targets.Depending on the scope of any reduction targets, experts say, the entire industry might eventually have to cut emissions sharply. Mr. Smith of University College London said ships could realistically be expected to cut fuel use and emissions by about 50 percent through various efficiency improvements, including slow steaming. \u201cBut to continue to improve beyond that is a real challenge,\u201d he said.What may be needed are development of alternative fuels like hydrogen, and use of wind or other renewable energy. One of the more promising technologies involves a device called a Flettner rotor, which was invented nearly a century ago. So far, only a few ships have these rotors, which are tall columns that rotate in a windstream and produce a propulsive force in the same way that a spinning baseball follows a curved path.For now, efforts like Tote\u2019s are among the first steps toward propelling ships with fuels that produce less carbon dioxide.Much of the impetus for building the two ships, however, grew out of concerns about other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, as well as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, or soot, which can cause health problems. Burning liquefied natural gas has a far greater effect on reducing those emissions than it does on reducing carbon dioxide.Those pollutants are now regulated for shipping within coastal zones of North America and Europe, and may eventually be more tightly controlled. Shipping companies may shift to lower-sulfur fuel oils or install scrubbers to remove the pollutants from exhaust. Some, like Tote, may opt for L.N.G.From a carbon emissions standpoint, liquefied natural gas is not an ideal solution. It is still a fossil fuel, although a cleaner one. And in large marine engines like the barn-size one that sits below decks in the Perla del Caribe, L.N.G. cannot ignite on its own. So with each stroke the engine must burn a small amount of diesel oil, referred to as a pilot fuel, reducing the environmental benefits.There are also extra costs. The tanks, with a thick layer of insulation between double walls of thick steel, are far more expensive than fuel oil tanks, and the equipment to handle and vaporize the supercold liquid is elaborate and costly as well. And infrastructure must be developed to ensure a steady supply of the fuel, something that Tote is in the process of doing at Jacksonville.\u201cThe whole cryogenic liquid thing adds another aspect to it,\u201d said Mike Green, one of the chief engineers of the Perla del Caribe.Still, despite the costs and limited carbon-emissions benefits, Mr. Keller of Tote said the company was expanding its use of L.N.G, converting ships that it uses for its other large cargo business, between Washington state and Alaska.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the Caribbean or Alaska, everyone is concerned about the environmental aspects,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Many years ago, the economist William Baumol noted that for many services \u2014 haircuts as well as string quartet performances \u2014 productivity barely advances over time. Yet as overall productivity rises in the economy, wages increase, so the cost of producing these services increases as well.Education is a case in point. How we teach and learn has benefited from some technological advances, such as PowerPoint presentations, online courses and the innovations of outfits like Khan Academy. But after 30 years as an educator, I am convinced that the ideal experience for a student is a small class that fosters personal interaction with a dedicated instructor. In other words, best practice remains the approach that Socrates used to teach Plato 2,500 years ago. But because society over all is now richer, today\u2019s Socrates expects a reasonably high standard of living, and that implies hefty tuition.The second force increasing the cost of education is the rise in inequality. Educational institutions hire a lot of skilled workers: It takes educated people to produce the next generation of educated people. Thus, rising inequality has increased not only the benefit of education but also the cost of it.The third force at work is what economists call price discrimination. Businesses of all sorts have an incentive to charge different prices to different consumers based on their willingness and ability to pay. Movie theaters, for example, charge children less than adults for a ticket.Colleges have increasingly followed this practice by raising published prices and offering more financial aid based on a family\u2019s resources. I often joke that Harvard should complete the process by setting tuition at $1 billion a year. But that sticker price applies only to the children of Bill Gates. Everyone else gets a special price, just for you.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.The impact of increasing price discrimination is clear in the data. That 70 percent figure for the 20-year increase in published tuition and fees shrinks to 32 percent for the average net price. The expansion of financial aid explains the difference. Yes, the 32 percent increase in cost is still sizable, but for those who qualify for aid, it is a lot smaller than is sometimes suggested.So what should we do about the cost of education?Apart from favoring government-run over private colleges, the main problem with this idea is that there is no way to really make education free. The Sanders plan just shifts the cost from the student to the taxpayer. In light of the looming unfunded liabilities already on the government\u2019s books from existing entitlement programs, mainly for older adults, creating a new one for the young seems problematic.Whether private money would show up for this is an open question. Investors may worry about adverse selection. Future poets might be willing to pledge a fraction of their incomes, while future bankers might pass on the opportunity.Unfortunately, there are no easy answers here. We can hope that future technologies will significantly reduce the cost of college. If they do not, as is likely, we will need to find better ways than we have now to pay for a system that is increasingly valuable but also increasingly expensive.N.

{"Headline": "New Fed Rule Limits Emergency Lending Power", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve had the ability to make huge emergency loans to almost any entity it chose, a power it used to help save Wall Street firms from possible collapse.Now, seven years later, the Fed, under the direction of Congress, has adopted a new rule that would place restrictions on its extraordinary financial powers. The restrictions, which stem from the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, aim to ensure that the Fed\u2019s emergency loans are not used to shore up insolvent firms.The five members of the Fed\u2019s board on Monday voted to approve the rule, which takes effect on Jan. 1.The Fed\u2019s emergency loans point to a quandary at the heart of the financial system. Many specialists say central banks, so-called lenders of last resort, need to have a free hand to lend liberally in a crisis to keep panics from taking down healthy firms. But others say the availability of emergency loans encourages banks to pursue habits \u2014 like making excessive use of short-term borrowing to finance their activities \u2014 that make the system unstable in the first place.Dodd-Frank\u2019s architects tried to maintain much of the Fed\u2019s latitude while preventing banks from taking advantage of the Fed\u2019s largess.In recent months, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have called on the Fed to take specific steps to make sure that its final rule on emergency lending fulfills Dodd-Frank\u2019s intent.Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, said on Monday that the Fed had taken such recommendations into account. \u201cIn response to these comments, we have made significant changes to the proposed rule to ensure that our rule will be applied in a manner that aligns with the intent of the Congress and the Dodd-Frank Act,\u201d she said in a statement.In the crisis, the Fed played a huge role in determining which firms lived and which died. Its loans helped save the American International Group, but it declined to provide similar aid to Lehman Brothers, whose collapse transmitted stress through the financial system into the wider economy.Dodd-Frank prevented the Fed from setting up a loan facility for just one firm. In theory, this now makes an A.I.G.-type rescue illegal \u2014 although Congress could always vote in a crisis to lift that ban.Dodd-Frank does allow the Fed to set up emergency loan facilities that many firms can tap in a crisis. And the legislation required that the Fed devise measures that would prevent the loans from going to insolvent firms.Members of Congress suggested some of the measures that the Fed included in its final rule. To make sure the loans are broadly available, the rule says that at least five firms have to be eligible to borrow from an emergency loan program, preventing the loans from being tailored to suit just one. That number of eligible firms was contained in a bill introduced into the Senate in May by Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana.The Fed\u2019s rule also contains specific measures to make sure insolvent firms are disqualified from the emergency loans. The Fed\u2019s rule says an entity cannot borrow for the purpose of lending to another entity that is insolvent. Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called for such a measure in a letter that he sent to the Fed last year.Consumer advocates said they were pleased with some of the measures that the Fed included. \u201cThis rule contains a lot of commitments to be tougher,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a group that has lobbied for tougher financial regulation.But they said the Fed had taken steps to protect its latitude to act. \u201cThe rule still has very extensive Federal Reserve discretion in it,\u201d Mr. Stanley said.And consumer advocates say the rule could yet allow seriously stressed firms to borrow from the Fed. While the Fed may offer a loan to many firms, one or two banks that are in desperate need may benefit the most from the Fed\u2019s assistance, effectively obtaining a bailout on the sly. In 2008, for instance, a handful of potentially insolvent banks might have collapsed had they not borrowed many billions of dollars from the Fed\u2019s emergency facilities.One challenge for the rule is that solvency can be a hard-to-determine concept, particularly in a crisis.The new rule seeks to add some definition in this area. It says the Fed must obtain evidence that borrowing firms are not insolvent. One way in which a firm would be considered insolvent is if it were \u201cgenerally not paying its undisputed debts\u201d for 90 days. But there may still be gaps even here. In the lead-up to its rescue, A.I.G. was actively disputing the demands for payment coming from its trading partners. As a result, under this definition of insolvency, it might be able to argue that it was solvent.In theory, other parts of Dodd-Frank have reduced the likelihood that the Fed will have to extend emergency loans. Banks have bolstered their balance sheets in several ways that make them more resilient to shocks. They are, for instance, less reliant on types of financing that the Fed\u2019s loans temporarily replaced in 2008. Dodd-Frank also set up a procedure for killing off a dying bank in a way that seeks to minimize the panic that can occur when a large firm fails.Still, the Fed may not have heard the last from members of Congress on its emergency lending powers. Senator Warren said in an emailed statement that she was glad that the Fed incorporated some aspects of her bill in the final rule. \u201cBut there are still loopholes that the Fed could exploit to provide another backdoor bailout to giant financial institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Congress to close those loopholes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Brazil, 99Taxis Start-Up Jockeys to Stay Ahead of Uber", "Date": "2015-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 How does an aspiring entrepreneur navigate the economic and political crises dogging Brazil? Build a growing taxi-app start-up, naturally. The financing will come.That\u2019s the approach being taken by 99Taxis, based in S\u00e3o Paulo and one of Uber\u2019s main competitors in Brazil. It has begun a new financing round, seeking about $100 million, according to two people familiar with the company\u2019s plans. That would be one of the largest fund-raising efforts for a Brazilian Internet start-up in the last decade, including the boom years.The details, including which investment firm will lead the round, have not yet been completed, the individuals said, because the company is still deciding whether to bring on new investors or stay with its current ones.However, the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, which led two prior rounds for 99Taxis this year, is expected to put in more money, one of the individuals said.Even though Tiger led Uber\u2019s latest financing round, it is expected to invest in this round. It also backed its main competitors in other large emerging markets: Didi Kuaidi in China, GrabTaxi in Indonesia, and Ola in India.So far Uber has not been able to win any of those markets and faces long odds in doing so. That is most likely true in Brazil as well.In the next few weeks, 99Taxis expects to complete the new round\u2019s structure, with the formal close expected to take place during the first quarter of next year, according to one of the individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan.The new financing would allow 99Taxis, which was founded in 2012 and whose current largest outside shareholder is Tiger Global, to continue to stay ahead of Uber here.Brazil has two main taxi-app incumbents, 99Taxis and Easy Taxi, which is backed by Rocket Internet. Since February, Easy Taxi\u2019s market share has steadily declined, based on the percentage of mobile users who have installed the app, according to data provided by the research firm 7Park Data. Easy Taxi\u2019s share peaked at 18.9 percent in February but fell to 14.8 percent by mid-November. And 99Taxis \u201chas been on a steady ascent,\u201d the firm said, growing to 15.6 percent from 9 percent this year; it has been the market leader since October. Uber was No. 3 at 6.5 percent.Uber, the Silicon Valley company, started operating in Brazil only last year during the World Cup and ran into many problems as it sought to expand in this country, Latin America\u2019s largest economy.It has drawn the ire of hundreds of politicians and been banned in the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It has angered taxi drivers and labor leaders here. Uber has sought to portray those critics as old-school, anti-innovation protectionists.Yet many of those taxi drivers use 99Taxis, whose earlier investors include Qualcomm Ventures and the S\u00e3o Paulo-based Monashees Capital, whose limited partners include Cisco Systems and Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s fund of funds group SVB Capital, hardly opponents of innovation or free-market economics.Uber caught a break here recently. After the company filed a complaint with Brazil\u2019s antitrust watchdog, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, or CADE, the agency said it would investigate taxi unions for what it argued was their \u201canti-competitive behavior\u201d against Uber. Yet that investigation is expected to take months and does not target the taxi-app start-ups.The economic research unit of CADE published a study this month concluding that for now, Uber was not taking business away from taxi drivers or 99Taxis and Easy Taxi.On the contrary, the report said of Uber that, \u201crather than absorbing a significant portion of rides made by taxis, in truth, in a majority of cases, it obtained new clients who do not use taxis.\u201d It contended that the company was \u201cgenerating a new demand.\u201d Still, it acknowledged that that could change once Uber became more aggressive as it had in other markets.The taxi start-up\u2019s new capital, if the deal closes, would pair with good news from the S\u00e3o Paulo city government. This month, in a new program, it awarded 5,000 new licenses to taxi drivers who want to operate a so-called black-car service. In order to participate, they are required to use a mobile app.The initiative has since been temporarily suspended by S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Court of Accounts, which said it did not receive required documents from the mayor\u2019s office in sufficient time, but most expect this to be resolved soon and that the program will move forward early next year.This new initiative is likely to benefit local companies like 99Taxis, which since its founding only works with licensed drivers. That allows it to go head-to-head with Uber in the premium ride service category, which it had not been able to do previously. It is calling its new service 99Top.Drivers will have to buy the black cars themselves, but will receive discounted financing from the public bank Banco do Brasil, said Rodrigo Piraj\u00e1, executive director of SP Negocios, which is running the program for the city.Yet Uber\u2019s fate here is hardly sealed. One result of CADE\u2019s current investigation is that S\u00e3o Paulo is looking again for a way to incorporate Uber. Mr. Piraj\u00e1 said he and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s mayor\u2019s office were examining alternative ways to normalize Uber. \u201cIt is under analysis,\u201d he said. A decision is expected next month.Uber through a spokeswoman declined to make anyone available for comment. A Tiger Global Management spokeswoman declined to comment. An email to 99Taxis\u2019 press official requesting information on fund-raising was not answered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Junk Bond Fund Freezes Out Investors, and the Chills Spread ", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo months ago, Thomas Lapointe, lead portfolio manager of the Third Avenue Management junk bond fund, delivered a bullish presentation at a conference at the Waldorf Astoria hotel. Yes, fund assets were down, he assured worried investors, but there was value out there. The right approach was to stay the course, he said, according to an investor in attendance.But in a conference call on Friday, a day after Third Avenue said it would bar investors from getting their money back, the usually upbeat Mr. Lapointe struck a starkly different tone.\u201cThe dislocation in the market has been tremendous,\u201d he said, according to a person who listened to the call. \u201cAnd the magnitude and scope of managing this fund over the past year has been a humbling experience.\u201dThe rare step taken by Third Avenue executives to keep investors from selling their shares rattled markets that were already bracing for the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s probable interest rate increase next week.Mutual funds typically allow investors to withdraw funds on a daily basis. The step by Third Avenue to put the Focused Credit Fund into a liquidating trust and sell its assets over the course of a year or so was a rude surprise to its investors.Financial advisers who were in close contact with Third Avenue said that in recent weeks they received little indication that the fund was on the verge of such a drastic step.The fund\u2019s value had shrunk to about $790 million from about $2.5 billion, but other high-yield bond funds had lost more assets. Behind the scenes, though, the Focused Credit Fund\u2019s large position in so-called Level 3 assets \u2014 securities that trade so infrequently that prices for them can only be estimated \u2014 was causing serious problems.As Mr. Lapointe and his team moved to unload bonds that they could actually sell, the Level 3 assets increased from around 15 percent of assets in Third Avenue portfolios to around 25 percent \u2014 a level regulators generally deem unacceptable. Executives even took the extreme step of tapping an emergency credit line from a bank in order to bolster their cash position, said a person who had been briefed on the move by a Third Avenue executive.Making the job of Third Avenue executives more difficult was that other debt investors were smelling blood in the water.\u201cIn the last few days, we were unable to sell our investments at reasonable prices because market participants were aware we were forced sellers,\u201d said David Barse, Third Avenue\u2019s chief, on the conference call, according to a person who listened in.The market in junk bonds continued to sell off on Friday. Some see the turmoil as a warning signal of a broader slowdown in the economy as companies, many of which have borrowed heavily in recent years, struggle to pay down their loans.\u201cThere is a real risk that this could keep echoing in the months ahead,\u201d said Jeffrey Gundlach, the manager of the DoubleLine Total Return Fund who has been warning others about the junk bond market for some time. \u201cIt is a really bad thing when a mutual fund does something like this, and it makes me worry that you are going to see similar problems with leveraged hedge funds.\u201dAs an indicator of how bad things have become in the high-yield market, Mr. Gundlach noted that the $10 billion high-yield exchange-traded fund managed by State Street, largely seen as a barometer for the junk bond market, was trading lower today than it did right after the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008.\u201cWhen the market is pricing assets that low, you should worry,\u201d he said.Mutual fund analysts say that the Third Avenue fund is perhaps the riskiest of the many high-yield funds that investors have been piling into in recent years.\u201cThis was not your typical high-yield fund,\u201d said Sumit Desai, a junk bond expert at the fund-rating shop Morningstar. \u201cThey were in the murkiest areas of the market, and they owned stuff that your traditional junk bond manager would never touch.\u201dIn that regard, Mr. Desai noted, the Third Avenue implosion should not necessarily mean that all high-yield funds are now at risk. Still, he pointed out that rock-bottom interest rates pushed a number of funds into the riskiest niches of the junk bond market.Among the high-yield bond funds that have experienced more investor outflows than Third Avenue this year are two that have the largest exposure to risky bonds that carry the lowest credit ratings because of their high risk.One is the Ivy High Income Fund \u2014 a $6 billion fund that has lost $1.8 billion this year and has 48 percent of its assets in securities \u2014 which carries a CCC credit designation, the lowest credit rating a fund can receive. According to Morningstar, this fund\u2019s most recent cash level was reported to be 1.5 percent \u2014 quite a low cushion given the composition of its portfolio.A spokesman for Ivy Investment Management did not respond to a request for comment.On a larger scale, American Funds\u2019 $16.8 billion high-yield fund has 30 percent of its portfolio in these types of bonds and this year has seen $1.3 billion in investor redemptions.On the conference call with investors, the Third Avenue executives insisted that they had ultimately acted in favor of investors by putting up gates, or keeping investors from accessing funds, which hedge funds often do but is rarely, if ever, seen in a mutual fund. But the executives did little to disguise how shocked they were at the speed of their fund\u2019s demise.Responding to an email query from a fund shareholder, Mr. Lapointe said that a \u201csignificant part of my net worth\u201d was invested in the fund.But beyond saying that investors would be getting a series of distributions over the next year, specific details were scant about why the fund did not have more cash on hand or when investors could expect to be made whole.\u201cThis has been very painful for us,\u201d Mr. Barse said, according to the investor who listened to the call. \u201cOur sales representatives will be in touch.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Greece, Brewer\u2019s Woes Reflect Struggle of Business Owners", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Demetri Politopoulos, the founder of a midsize beer producer in northern Greece, says he nearly fainted when he heard the news late one night in October.The Greek Parliament was planning to pass a law that would increase the tax he paid for each hectoliter of beer he sold by 50 percent.Just like that, the microbrewery he started 17 years ago would go under, as his new tax bill of 1.6 million euros would wipe out his expected 1.45 million euros in profit for the year.So he hopped on a plane to Athens and to the surprise of many was able to persuade the government to shelve the law within a day \u2014 an extraordinary turnaround given how slow the Greek state usually moves.It was a triumph for Mr. Politopoulos and his Vergina beer brand.But the tale is also important on a larger scale as it shows how many of the revenue-raising measures that Greece is rushing to put into effect at the behest of its creditors are threatening to put small Greek businesses \u2014 the beating heart of the country\u2019s downtrodden economy \u2014 out of business.European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.It was midday here, and Mr. Politopoulos was sitting in a cafe, chain-smoking cigarettes and nursing beers.He had stayed up most of the previous night celebrating the victory with friends and family and the low growl of his voice and untouched plate of food before him signaled that the evening\u2019s effect was still with him.\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really partied. I don\u2019t know how my brother got on a 7 a.m. flight today.\u201dThe celebration was a long time coming. Educated in the United States, Mr. Politopoulos returned to his native land 19 years ago with a dream to become an independent brewer. At the time, there were no Greek beer companies: The Dutch-based behemoth Heineken had locked up the market.He started his business in 1998, but even as demand for his Vergina beer grew, his share of the market stayed in the low single-digits as the market leader did all in its power to prevent shops and restaurants from selling his product.Even now, after 15 years and a 7 percent market share, it is almost impossible to find a Vergina beer in Athens.In 2005, Mr. Politopoulos took his case to the Hellenic Republic Competition Commission, citing numerous examples of what he said were unfair business practices by Heineken, from persuading retailers to not stock Vergina to more serious examples of bullying and intimidation.But as is often the case in Greece, his petition went nowhere.With Greece under unremitting pressure to find new revenue sources, the idea to close the gap between the way small and large brewers are taxed may have seemed a good idea.That is, until Mr. Politopoulos took the floor in Parliament on Nov. 2.\u201cWe are proud to pay taxes in Greece, but this is going to put us out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when we do pay our taxes, we expect services \u2014 like justice. Without justice in a society, there is nothing.\u201dIndeed, concerns are growing here that in a rush to raise much-needed revenue, Greece and its creditors are placing an unfair burden on an already decimated private sector.In the teeth of a five-year depression, Mr. Politopoulos says business is holding up fairly well. Via his company, which also sells tea drinks, and the farmers who grow barley and tea, he estimates that Vergina supports more than 1,000 families in the area of Komotini, which is just a short drive from the Turkish border.How, he asked, could a tax increase and the closure of his beer factory be seen as good for Greece?In a statement, Heineken said the decision was \u201cunfair and ungrounded\u201d and that it would appeal the ruling.It has been an emotional time for Mr. Politopoulos. He is not married and has no children \u2014 as he likes to say, making beer in Greece (and frequently drinking it) is his life.\u201cI am really proud that we can make a difference,\u201d he said, searching a bit to find the right words. \u201cThis shows there are Davids and Goliaths \u2014 and that sometimes the Davids win.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Revolving Door Helps Big Banks\u2019 Quiet Campaign to Muscle Out Fannie and Freddie", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeven years after their dubious lending practices helped push the United States economy to the brink of disaster, the nation\u2019s largest banks are closing in on a long-sought goal: to unseat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants, and capture their share of the profits in the country\u2019s $5.7 trillion home loan market.Taking place largely behind the scenes, the movement to take over the mortgage market has been propelled in part by a revolving door between Washington and Wall Street, an investigation by The New York Times has found.While the big banks\u2019 effort to enshrine their vision into law has failed so far, plans to replace Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which have long supported the housing market by playing a unique role as so-called government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.s \u2014 are still very much alive. The Obama administration has largely embraced the idea, and government regulators are being pushed to put crucial elements into effect.A review of lobbying records, legal filings, and internal emails and memorandums, as well as housing officials\u2019 calendars and White House and Treasury visitor logs, illuminates the banks\u2019 effort. Assisting in this work, the documents show, is a group of high-level housing finance specialists who have moved back and forth between public service and private practice in recent years.Many in Congress believe Fannie and Freddie contributed to the collapse of the housing bubble, and they still rest on a shaky financial foundation, largely because of actions taken by the Treasury and the companies\u2019 regulator.While they continue to pose a risk to taxpayers, Fannie and Freddie so far have not been replaced by Wall Street behemoths, partly because local banks popular with many lawmakers are resistant. Moreover, some members of Congress are concerned that low-income borrowers would not be well served by private lenders.Moving back and forth between private practice and public service, several people had central roles inside the Obama administration in developing a new housing finance policy that would phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.For all the problems associated with Fannie and Freddie, some housing experts say, allowing the nation\u2019s largest banks to assume greater control of the mortgage market would most likely increase costs for borrowers. It would also reduce participation and competition from smaller lenders, and could imperil taxpayers because of the potential for even greater bailouts for financial institutions that Washington considers too important to be allowed to fail.\u201cFannie and Freddie have their flaws, but that doesn\u2019t mean the answer is to hand over their business to the banks,\u201d Ms. Bean said. \u201cTheir role in the mortgage market is too important to put under the thumb of banks with a history of toxic mortgages, structured finance abuse and consumer maltreatment.\u201dIf credit was scarce, the thinking went, banks would be more inclined to lend knowing they could sell a loan to Fannie or to Freddie, a competitor company created in 1970. A bank could then turn around and make another loan, earning fees while keeping the housing finance wheels spinning.In addition to benefiting borrowers, this system enabled small community lenders to sell their loans to Fannie and Freddie as easily as even the biggest guns in banking. This gave borrowers a choice of lenders, encouraging competition and keeping costs down.Although government creations, Fannie and Freddie also had public shareholders. Fannie sold shares for the first time in 1968 and Freddie followed suit two decades later. As the nation\u2019s economy grew and homeownership expanded, Fannie and Freddie became increasingly powerful and profitable institutions.The unusual hybrid of shareholder-owned companies carrying the government\u2019s imprimatur worked well for a long time. But the combination turned sour in the 1990s when Fannie executives began using the company\u2019s lush profits to finance lobbying efforts that enhanced their stature and independence in Washington.Throughout these years, Fannie and Freddie\u2019s mounting profits, generated in part by their special ties to the government, which put them at a financial advantage, also drew resentment from the nation\u2019s largest banks.Fannie\u2019s success wound up being a double-edged sword. Its enfeebled overseer, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, allowed its enormous operations to rest on the tiniest sliver of capital, increasing profits during the fat years. But when the financial crisis hit, expected loan losses at both Fannie and Freddie overwhelmed the small amount of capital the companies had on hand.In an interview on CNBC on Sept. 8, 2008, Henry M. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, talked about the government\u2019s rescue of Fannie and Freddie as a steppingstone to a new housing finance system. \u201cHeaven help us and our nation if we don\u2019t figure out what the right structure is going forward,\u201d he said.The ink was barely dry on the Fannie and Freddie bailout when the Mortgage Bankers Association got busy. Mr. Berman, then vice chairman of the lobbying group and founder of CWCapital, a commercial real estate lender and management firm specializing in multifamily housing projects, was tapped to organize a campaign to privatize the nation\u2019s broken home mortgage system.With the housing market in collapse and Fannie and Freddie weakened and reviled, it was the perfect time to push the mortgage bankers\u2019 plan to take over the companies\u2019 business and divide their prized assets.But with banks\u2019 popularity plummeting after the financial crisis, their proposal had to be carefully framed as a way to protect taxpayers from future bailouts.When President Obama entered office in 2009, taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac off government life support was far down his administration\u2019s to-do list. But when officials began turning their attention to the matter in 2010, the industry-sponsored coalition was ready.The council, overseen by Mr. Berman, was made up of mostly large banks and mortgage insurers. It also recommended that assets belonging to Fannie and Freddie \u201cbe used as a foundation\u201d by the new entities.Chief among these assets were the mortgage underwriting systems the government-sponsored enterprises had built to bundle loans into securities to be sold to investors.\u201cThe M.B.A.\u2019s position literally was: Get rid of Fannie and Freddie and create these new entities,\u201d Mr. Berman said in a recent interview. \u201cBut there were extraordinary amounts of value in the enterprises to be reused in different ways in the new system.\u201dAt first, the industry\u2019s views gained little traction. The economy was in tatters, and lawmakers were not yet ready to tackle the nation\u2019s enormous and complex housing finance system.Besides, Fannie and Freddie were providing virtually the only access American borrowers had to mortgages during this period. Yes, they were still drawing money from taxpayers, but at least the companies were financing loans as they always had, while big banks were withdrawing from the market.Throughout 2009 and 2010, Mr. Berman and his colleagues pitched the mortgage bankers\u2019 ideas, saying that their plan would prevent the need for future bailouts and keep the home loan spigot open.As Mr. Berman made the rounds, administration officials at Treasury and HUD began working on their own plans regarding Fannie and Freddie. A primary participant in these discussions was Mr. Stevens, then commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration, a part of HUD.Mr. Stevens had joined the housing administration in mid-2009 from the private sector, where he had been president of Long & Foster, the largest privately owned real estate company in the nation. Previously, he had been an executive at Freddie Mac and Wells Fargo.Working on the future of Fannie and Freddie at HUD, Mr. Stevens attended large meetings of \u201cG.S.E. principals,\u201d according to his calendars, which were obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act.At the same time Mr. Stevens was working on the administration\u2019s policy, he often interacted with high-level executives in the mortgage industry, his calendars show.There is, of course, nothing unusual about government officials meeting with various interest groups affected by potential policy changes. And during this time, Mr. Stevens was tasked with other matters involving big banks.But Mr. Stevens\u2019s calendars show far fewer meetings with other groups in the mortgage arena, such as advocates of low-income housing or those representing middle-class borrowers.Mr. Stevens said he recalled meeting with every type of stakeholder during this time. \u201cMy own view is you meet with everybody to get as much input as you can,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since HUD was an effective advocate for homeowners, much less low- or moderate-income homeowners,\u201d Mr. Gnaizda said.Mr. Stevens was certainly not the only official meeting with the big banks and their advocates to discuss issues related to Fannie and Freddie. Executives were fanning out across Washington to educate and influence members of the government charged with devising the administration\u2019s new housing policy.Four meetings on the topic took place at the Treasury Department in late 2010, records show. One hosted by Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, included Brian Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, and two founders of giant private equity firms: Stephen A. Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, and Leon Black of Apollo Management Group.After all the meetings and discussions, the administration laid out three options for housing finance reform. But the message was clear: Fannie and Freddie\u2019s days were numbered. Working with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the administration would reduce their role in the mortgage market and wind them down.The policy to eliminate Fannie and Freddie was a page out of the mortgage bankers\u2019 playbook. And like the authors of that plan, the administration emphasized that taxpayers would be protected and that a new, level playing field would benefit all participants in the housing market.In private, however, officials cited another group of beneficiaries under the plan: big banks.An internal Treasury memo written on Jan. 4, 2011, to Mr. Geithner by one of his top deputies characterized the administration\u2019s first option to wind down Fannie and Freddie as \u201ca bank-centric model\u201d that \u201cbenefits larger institutions\u201d with the capacity to hold mortgages on their books.But this raw assessment didn\u2019t make it into the final report. While the report acknowledged that \u201csmaller lenders and community banks could have a difficult time competing for business,\u201d the \u201cbank-centric\u201d nature of the plan was for internal consumption only.Roughly a month after the administration published its long-awaited recommendations, Mr. Stevens agreed to become chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association. He had been hired away by Mr. Berman, who was promoted to chairman in 2010.It wasn\u2019t until March 15 that Mortgage Bankers announced the appointment. Mr. Stevens continued as commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration through March 31, 2011, his termination documents show. On March 14, for example, he met with Edward J. DeMarco, acting director of F.H.F.A., the conservator of Fannie and Freddie.At the lobbying organization, Mr. Stevens continued to argue for a smaller role in housing finance for Fannie and Freddie and a bigger role for companies backed by private capital. Although the mortgage bankers group represents both large and small lenders, under Mr. Stevens it has been an advocate more for big institutions, smaller members say.In an interview, Mr. Stevens said he joined the government from the industry \u201cto try to help at a time where I thought I had some value.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re picking people for technical roles in the government,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey have to have some experience.\u201dThe movement between government and business has gone both ways. Mr. Berman eventually found his own lofty perch in the Obama administration at HUD, the same agency from which he had recruited Mr. Stevens. In November 2012, Mr. Berman signed on as a senior adviser to Mr. Donovan, the HUD secretary.\u201cMy company gets sold and Shaun Donovan asked me to join him as senior adviser,\u201d Mr. Berman recalled in the interview. \u201cHe said to me in our first conversation that my major focus would be on G.S.E. reform, to work with him and be his liaison to the White House and Treasury and the National Economic Council as well as Congress on that issue.\u201dIn February 2014, Mr. Berman returned to the private sector, where he now advises real estate lenders. He said he has also informally consulted for the F.H.F.A.Another former HUD official who worked on housing finance policy also consults for organizations that stand to profit from eviscerating the mortgage giants.After leaving the White House, Mr. Parrott set up Falling Creek Advisors, a consulting firm whose clients have included Bank of America and a mortgage insurer.Mr. Parrott said that when he left Washington, he planned to set up an institute of politics at the University of North Carolina. But financial institutions began asking for his help on housing. \u201cI advise five or six companies; each of them are in different parts of the housing finance ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Parrott said. \u201cThese folks are by and large thoroughly confused about what policy makers are trying to do.\u201d\u201cThis is a classic example of the revolving door at its worst,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are large financial institutions that already have an edge when it comes to getting their voices heard on Capitol Hill and at their regulatory agencies. When you hear they are hiring the key policy makers to represent them, it raises serious questions that these decisions are being made not on the merits but on those personal connections.\u201dAfter leaving their government posts, Mr. Berman, Mr. Parrott and Mr. Stevens all continued to work on housing finance. Meeting logs and calendars received under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the three men have met with government officials in charge of matters involving Fannie and Freddie.Mr. Stevens met or talked with housing policy officials most frequently: 19 times between February 2012 and April 2015. Since leaving the government, Mr. Parrott has had six meetings with housing officials at the White House; Mr. Berman has had two since starting his own firm, including one this past June.Meeting logs show that Mr. Stevens met 13 times with officials at the White House working on Fannie and Freddie policy. He also met five times during the period with Mr. DeMarco, the former acting director of F.H.F.A., and had one phone call with him, Mr. DeMarco\u2019s calendars show.Mr. Stevens said that his work at the Mortgage Bankers Association is being an advocate not on behalf of individuals or specific companies but \u201cfor an industry on a broad set of policy issues.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Berman said he kept working on the project with administration officials not as an advocate but because of his \u201ccontacts and granular knowledge of what was going on.\u201dMr. Parrott also said his meetings did not involve advocacy on behalf of his clients. \u201cI give them a sense of how people are thinking and how things are likely going to develop in their world,\u201d he said.\u201cWith respect to Stevens, Parrott and probably Berman, it appears that these officials participated personally and substantially in the administration\u2019s decisions about resolving the financial difficulties of Fannie and Freddie,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cThis means that they each have a lifetime ban on representing back to the United States government on either of these two particular party matters involving Fannie and Freddie.\u201dMr. Stevens and his lawyer, Scott Fredericksen of Foley & Lardner, disagree. They contend that his work in the government involved developing public policy, not a \u201cparticular matter,\u201d as specified in the law. \u201cThe law is clear that Mr. Stevens\u2019s activities involving development of public policy and even proposed legislation are not encompassed within the prohibited activities outlined\u201d in the statute, Mr. Fredericksen said.Mr. Berman also said that housing finance reform is a general matter that does not fit in the law\u2019s definition of a \u201cparticular matter.\u201d In any case, he said, \u201cSince leaving HUD, I have not attempted to influence any employee of HUD or any department or agency on policies regarding housing finance reform and specifically G.S.E. reform.\u201dMr. Parrott said that before he left the White House, he had careful consultations with the counsel\u2019s office about what he could and could not do in the private sector. They were very clear that the statute \u201cdoes not prohibit me from talking to government officials about general policy issues like housing finance reform,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t advocate for anyone, so I\u2019m also not communicating or appearing \u2018on behalf of another,\u2019 as is also required to be in breach of the statute.\u201dMr. Painter said that in his view, anyone who participated personally and substantially in decisions having to do with the government\u2019s financial relationship with Fannie and Freddie was working on a matter involving particular parties and governed by the law.Mr. Painter said it was hard to know what was said at the meetings. But if Mr. Stevens, Mr. Berman and Mr. Parrott, \u201cmade statements at these meetings that were intended to influence government decisions in these two particular party matters involving Fannie and Freddie,\u201d he said, \u201cthey violated the statute.\u201dDespite generating huge profits since 2012, Fannie and Freddie have been kept financially weak, hobbled by their government minders during their years in conservatorship.The argument against Fannie and Freddie rests on a powerful point: Radically reducing the government\u2019s footprint in the mortgage market could help protect taxpayers. Right now, with Fannie and Freddie backing 80 percent of the nation\u2019s mortgages, those risks sit squarely on the government\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThe ideal version of housing finance reform is one in which we are clear about what\u2019s worked in the current system and what needs to be overhauled,\u201d Mr. Parrott said. What you want to avoid, he continued, \u201cis a market duopoly that\u2019s got an implied government guarantee. It creates such a toxic mix of incentives where profit-seeking shareholders maximize risk and profit at the expense of taxpayers sitting there waiting to hold the bag if the thing goes south.\u201dBut bringing private capital into the mortgage securities market poses perils of its own, other housing experts say: Allowing too-big-to-fail banks to dominate the nation\u2019s mortgage market would crowd out smaller lenders and expand the federal safety net, putting taxpayers at greater risk of funding bailouts in a downturn. Relying on mortgage insurers to provide that capital also seems dubious given how badly these companies performed in the 2008 crisis.Moreover, private capital would probably flee the mortgage market at the first sign of trouble, as it did during the recent credit debacle. This raises questions about the availability of home lending when such a system goes through a rough patch.Lost in the debate over the future of Fannie and Freddie is the role Congress had in mind for the F.H.F.A. when it passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Under the law, a conservator is supposed to put the regulated entities in a \u201csound and solvent condition\u201d and \u201cpreserve and conserve\u201d their assets and property.Proponents of eliminating Fannie and Freddie say that allowing them to survive would also mean letting them go back to their abusive ways. The companies were a huge source of capital for reckless loan products, in Mr. Stevens\u2019s view. \u201cWe risk going back to that system,\u201d he said, because the public cannot count on regulators \u201cto protect us going forward and constrain these guys.\u201dBut those who favor recapitalizing the companies \u2014 a group that includes hedge funds and other speculators that stand to gain, as well as supporters of low-income housing \u2014 say that the past need not be prologue. They contend that the companies could be restructured in a way that would prohibit dubious activities, and that allowing Fannie and Freddie to rebuild capital would reduce taxpayer risk.The banks are continuing their push for access to Fannie and Freddie\u2019s assets and profits. But they are not putting all their eggs in the legislative basket. In recent months, they have urged Melvin L. Watt, director of the F.H.F.A., to put at least some of their recommendations in place administratively.They are making inroads. The design of the new mortgage securitization system being built by Fannie and Freddie at significant expense \u2014 $146 million so far \u2014 allows for future access to outside institutions like the big banks. And Fannie and Freddie are being increasingly pressed to sell off portions of their securities to private entities. Big banks will benefit most from both arrangements.Mr. Berman is encouraged by these moves.\u201cOver the last couple or three years under acting director DeMarco and following through with Mel Watt, from a regulatory standpoint the progress has been quite positive,\u201d he said.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thousands March in South Africa to Call for Jacob Zuma\u2019s Resignation", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProtesters in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and elsewhere have called on the governing African National Congress to recall Mr. Zuma, whose tenure as president has been marred by a series of scandals and accusations of pervasive corruption, but the party has stood by him so far.Last week, Mr. Zuma surprised even members of his own cabinet by abruptly firing Nhlanhla Nene, his well-respected finance minister, who had clashed with the chairwoman of the state-owned South African Airways, Dudu Myeni, who is a close ally of Mr. Zuma\u2019s.Mr. Zuma named David van Rooyen, a low-profile lawmaker with no experience in government finance, as Mr. Nene\u2019s successor. But only days later he was forced to replace Mr. van Rooyen with Pravin Gordhan, a former finance minister, after investors expressed grave concern about the independence of South Africa\u2019s treasury and the country\u2019s currency, the rand, dropped sharply.Zwelinzima Vavi, the former leader of Cosatu, the powerful trade union federation, and a former ally of Mr. Zuma\u2019s, called on the president to step down.\u201cWe are refusing to be reconciled with the eating away of the moral fiber of our society by a small elite that has managed to intimidate so many South Africans with their corruption,\u201d Mr. Vavi said.On Wednesday, Moody\u2019s became the latest credit ratings agency to lower its outlook on South Africa\u2019s debt, to negative from stable.Moody\u2019s cited slow growth in the country, which has been hurt by falling prices of its main commodities, and pressure to increase public spending before elections in metropolitan areas next year, with \u201cthe potential for losses of several important cities.\u201dPolitical analysts say that officials in the A.N.C., which has governed since the end of apartheid in 1994 and controls eight of the country\u2019s nine provinces, could reconsider their support of Mr. Zuma if the party incurs major losses in the metropolitan elections.Poor blacks make up a majority of the population of South Africa and constitute the bedrock of the A.N.C.\u2019s support, but they appeared underrepresented in the marches on Wednesday. White South Africans represented a large majority of marchers in Cape Town, and their presence in other demonstrations was significant enough to elicit running commentary on social media.\u201cWe\u2019re not happy with Zuma\u2019s leadership \u2014 corruption, no accountability,\u201d said Lumkile Sizila, 41, a black man who was marching in Cape Town and who said he used to support the A.N.C. \u201cWe want a stable president who consults widely.\u201dAsked about the low turnout of black marchers, Mr. Sizila added, \u201cI support this event, but we need black people, who vote for the A.N.C., at the forefront.\u201dKimon de Greef contributed reporting from Cape Town.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Simple, Radical Tax Plan", "Date": "2015-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoad to 2016He has good reason not to.Mr. Cruz talks a lot about his proposal for a 10 percent flat tax on personal income, which would be far smaller than the current income tax. It would collect about $8 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation.He is less effusive about his 16 percent \u201cbusiness flat tax,\u201d which would collect $25 trillion over a decade, again per the Tax Foundation. That\u2019s more than enough to offset the revenue lost from repealing both the payroll tax and the corporate income tax, which Mr. Cruz proposes to do.So how does this big tax work? A VAT is a tax on \u201cvalue added\u201d in the economy. Businesses collect it on their total revenues, minus the cost to buy the stuff they resold. A retailer pays the tax on sales to consumers, minus what he paid wholesalers for product. A wholesaler pays on his sales to retailers, minus what he paid to manufacturers. A manufacturer pays on his sales after the cost of parts, and so on.When you add it all up, it\u2019s equivalent to a very broad sales tax on all the goods and services in the economy. Most other advanced countries have a tax like this, with exceptions for favored sectors like education and health care. Mr. Cruz says he would tax everything, which is how he could raise so much money with a rate of 16 percent.But some people misunderstand the horrors of VATs. In particular, they assume a new, large VAT will cause a sharp rise in prices, as businesses simply add the tax onto the price of goods and services. But that would only happen if the Federal Reserve let inflation rise.New taxes may increase the cost of doing business, but overall price levels can only rise if central banks adopt monetary policy that allows them to. You may have noticed that, over the last decade, the United States and other advanced countries had sharply fluctuating fiscal policy, including significant changes in tax rates, but low and stable inflation. That\u2019s because the link between taxes and prices is not automatic.Another way to understand this is to think about the political fights over the sales tax. Retailers often oppose proposals to raise sales taxes. If all of a sales tax were simply passed on to the consumer, why would retailers care about the rate? The answer is that a sales tax is also economically similar to a tax on profits plus payrolls, and the retailers don\u2019t want to face more taxes on profits.That leaves a big question: Would a VAT like Mr. Cruz wants ultimately be paid by consumers, or by workers and business owners, or by some combination?The answer is important, but not quite as important as it would first seem, because all options ultimately describe the same set of people. We are all consumers \u2014 even the owners of businesses \u2014 who have bothered to accumulate wealth because it will make it possible to consume things later. A VAT could be passed entirely onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This would cause consumers\u2019 real incomes to decline by 16 percent. Or, prices could stay the same, and businesses could adjust to the new tax by cutting employees\u2019 wages and taking home less in after-tax profits, also causing their real incomes to decline by 16 percent.While the two options would have similar effects across the whole economy, their effects on individuals would vary, mostly because people already have some wealth they earned before the tax was imposed. If the VAT were to cause a rise in prices, its effects would be that of any other bout of inflation: The value of wealth would decline for owners of debt, whether banks that hold mortgages or retirees with savings in Treasury bonds.On the other hand, the decline in businesses\u2019 after-tax profits as a result of the need to pay VAT would show up as a decline in stock prices. Anyone owning stocks would be hurt. It wouldn\u2019t be quite so bad for them if we also had a bout of inflation, because that would reduce the real amount of corporate debts (companies would have to pay the same number of dollars to settle their existing bonds, but a dollar wouldn\u2019t be worth as much anymore) and that savings would accrue to shareholders.Taxes that are imposed on workers\u2019 wages after they are paid, such as the income tax, need not lead to inflation. These can be allowed to fall on workers, who will simply see their after-tax incomes fall, without disrupting the overall labor market. But higher indirect taxes on workers \u2014 like the employer-paid part of payroll tax or Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposed VAT \u2014 may require an inflation offset. That\u2019s because these taxes reduce the wages that businesses are willing to pay.Employers find it\u2019s hard to cut the nominal wage a worker is paid, because workers tend to get very upset. Of course, that wage \u201cstickiness\u201d is good for the worker who doesn\u2019t face a wage cut, but it also means companies will tend to hire fewer workers. A significant new VAT that did not come with a bout of central bank-driven inflation would cause unemployment to soar.In Mr. Viard\u2019s view, a VAT like the one Mr. Cruz is proposing would probably need to come with a significant, one-time burst of inflation \u2014 but not a full 16 percent. More likely it would require about half that, because Mr. Cruz would repeal the employer-paid part of the payroll tax, partly offsetting those employers\u2019 new VAT bill.So the Cruz plan would indeed probably lead to a significant, one-time rise in the price level of less than 16 percent. The tax would fall partly on consumers, and partly on workers and business owners, who of course are more or less the same people.That assumes the Federal Reserve actually responds to the tax with a labor market stabilizing policy, which is one of its key policy aims. But its other key policy aim is price stability, and as you may have noticed in recent years, the Fed has been perhaps overly obsessed with this latter aim, failing to hit even its own modest targets for inflation despite labor market weakness.Given that track record, the Fed will not be eager to allow a one-time, high-single-digit rise in prices, even if a change in tax policy made such a rise really useful. If the Fed held prices down despite firms\u2019 desire to cut wages, adopting the VAT could cause a sharp bout of unemployment and a recession.All that disruption is a crucial reason it would be very challenging to shift the United States to a VAT-based tax system.Advertisement"}

On Tuesday, he will face state examiners in the last required step before he can receive a New York barber\u2019s license.The license is something he has been thinking about for a long time, a career goal that lay beyond what often seemed like insurmountable obstacles.He was soon due for release. After that, he owed New Jersey, his home state, another stretch for a probation violation. Then he would be free. \u201cBeing locked up, you can feel like this is all you are, that\u2019s all your life is worth,\u201d he said in a recent visit to the school. His plan was to start again and learn barbering.The plan took a detour on the evening of Aug. 9, 2011, when a group of corrections officers savagely beat him after mistakenly believing that Mr. Williams had hurled curse words at them earlier on the cellblock. Mr. Williams sustained two broken legs, a broken collarbone and a fractured eye socket in the assault. At a hospital in Buffalo, doctors inserted several screws into one badly mangled leg.In March of this year, three guards pleaded guilty to official misconduct in the episode and agreed to give up their prison jobs in exchange for an agreement that they would serve no time behind bars.Hundreds of miles away from New York, Donald Huber read the article. A 27-year-old United States Army specialist, Mr. Huber was stationed at Fort Riley, Kan., after spending nine months in Kandahar Province in Afghanistan with the First Infantry Division.Mr. Huber, who grew up in Attica, was moved. He had attended high school with one of the officers charged in the assault. Several of his relatives had worked at the vast prison that dominates the economy of the rural village. On Facebook, friends were already posting the article.\u201cMost of them were saying how disappointed they were that something like that could happen in our backyard,\u201d said Mr. Huber, who now attends college in Batavia, N.Y., just northeast of Attica.\u201cI wanted to show that the Attica community stood for more than what happened in that story,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only to help George but to show there are many of us who care and wish nothing but the best for people who are unfortunate enough to end up in prison and want to change their lives.\u201dMr. Huber, who had never met Mr. Williams, started an online fund-raising campaign for him. By the end of the summer, the campaign had raised $5,800 through more than 70 donations in amounts ranging from $5 to $500. Many gave anonymously.The money was sent to Mr. Williams\u2019s lawyer, who is representing him in a lawsuit against the three former guards and one current corrections officer who was dropped from the criminal case. The suit is delayed as the lawyers for the ex-guards appeal a decision by the state attorney general not to immunize them from damages that Mr. Williams might be awarded.Mr. Williams said he was astonished to learn of the donations. \u201cIt was almost unimaginable,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI never thought people would care.\u201dIn a short phone conversation a few weeks ago, he told Mr. Huber how grateful he was. \u201cThis man really stepped up,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThis guy is a brave individual. I wish I could thank every individual who gave.\u201dA spokesman for the New York Department of State, which oversees the licensing, declined to discuss the status of Mr. Williams\u2019s application, saying decisions are made case by case. In an email, however, he noted that \u201cthere is no absolute bar to licensure as a barber because of a felony conviction.\u201dMr. Williams is optimistic. His next goal is to open his own shop. \u201cI\u2019m looking in Harlem and Brooklyn for a place,\u201d he said.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll hire some of these guys,\u201d he continued as he gestured at students leaning over towel-draped customers at the Tribeca Barber School. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll hire some other guys who come out of prison.\u201d\u00a0This article is by Tom Robbins of The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues.

Mr. Gabriel, 58, used the occasion to rename his office La Bruixa d\u2019Or, the Golden Witch, which has since become a national emblem of luck and a formidable merchandising brand that he uses to sell trinkets, children\u2019s books and even a line of shoes.\u201cThe best marketing is the most simple one, and that begins with just finding the right name for your business,\u201d he said. \u201cI made the witch famous across Spain overnight.\u201dThis year the Golden Witch office has sold about 50 million euros\u2019 worth of tickets for two lottery draws \u2014 one on Tuesday and a smaller one on Jan. 6, the Feast of the Epiphany \u2014 that most Spaniards consider an integral part of their end-of-year festivities. Spain\u2019s national lottery company said 3.2 billion euros worth of tickets had been sold for Tuesday\u2019s draw, of which \u20ac2.2 billion will be paid in prize money. The top individual prize is expected to be around \u20ac4 million.While a full ticket costs 200 euros, it is subdivided so that people generally go for the more affordable option of buying a 10th of a ticket.Mr. Gabriel said 87 percent of his tickets were sold online, but about 300,000 people made the pilgrimage up the windy road to Sort to buy them in person, many coming in organized weekend bus trips. Since he started his business, Mr. Gabriel said, the Golden Witch has issued 36 winning tickets for the two holiday draws.\u201cI come every year to buy this lottery for my family and closest friends,\u201d said Arsemari Maguregui, a housewife who drove on Thursday over five hours with her husband from Abadi\u00f1o, in the Basque Country, to spend 160 euros at the Golden Witch. \u201cWe\u2019ve never won, but I keep hope that it will happen one day.\u201dA serial entrepreneur who started work at 16 as a banking clerk, Mr. Gabriel eventually acquired the license to run an office of the state-owned lottery in his village in 1986.For El Gordo, the Christmas lottery, the proportion is more than 60 percent, as friends, families and co-workers buy tickets together. It is \u201ca way to cement social relationships and to dream together about winning and becoming rich,\u201d Dr. Guill\u00e9n said.In some companies, tickets are given by managers as a symbolic Christmas bonus; the Spanish stock exchange hands each of about 600 employees a portion, worth \u20ac20, of a ticket. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot of money, but it represents a lot of shared hope,\u201d said Antonio Zoido, the chairman of the exchange.Like other owners of state lottery offices, Mr. Gabriel receives a commission of 4 percent on each ticket sold. The state uses the rest of the ticket revenues to pay the prize money and to fill its tax coffers.But the presence of a somewhat eccentric tycoon in a mountain farming village has also irritated some people here. Mr. Gabriel said that several of his projects had been vetoed by the local authorities, including plans to build a castle and a project to start upriver rafting in an American-designed hovercraft.He also lobbied, unsuccessfully, to rename Sort\u2019s main street \u201cFame Avenue,\u201d which he claims would have helped persuade owners of Ferraris and other luxury cars to come and drive down the avenue as an act of homage to their good fortune.\u201cI\u2019m happy to have doubled the earnings of every hotel and restaurant around here, even if some people then speak badly of me,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cSuccess creates envy in a small village.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Gabriel draws a lukewarm response among town hall officials. Raimon Monterde Alberich, the mayor, said Sort needed to spend more on sports facilities and other urban infrastructure. \u201cWhat he could do is renovate our existing castle, which stands in ruins, rather than talk about building a new one,\u201d he said.While acknowledging that Mr. Gabriel helped put Sort on the map, Baldo Farr\u00e9, another town hall official, said no study had been done to measure his precise impact on the local economy. \u201cThere are many buses that come here, filled with people who just buy their tickets and then move on,\u201d he said.Even the etymology of Sort is questioned. Mr. Gabriel suggested the Romans probably named the village after discovering gypsum here. But the town hall officials said the name probably came from an ancient Basque word for \u201cbridge.\u201d\u201cI asked the witch to help change my life and village \u2014 and she did,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said. \u201cI promised to go and visit her in space, and that\u2019s what I will do, as soon as it is possible.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Dec. 20 about Xavier Gabriel, a Spaniard whose lottery business has become a national emblem of luck and a formidable merchandising brand, misstated, in some editions, the timing of the crash of the Virgin Galactic space plane, on which Mr. Gabriel has booked a $200,000 seat. The crash was last year, not in July.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Global Accord on Climate Change", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:The climate negotiators in Paris gave us a deal that falls far short of staving off the worst effects of climate change. They gave us nonbinding promises to reduce carbon emissions without a mechanism for verification, leaving room for inaccurate reporting and cheating. They gave us a road map to a goal, not a commitment, of at least $100 billion per year from developed countries to fund mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries.But these representatives from 195 nations have also given us something we sorely needed: hope. Maybe humanity will be able to save itself after all.PAUL REALENew YorkTo the Editor:The ink was hardly dry on the Paris accord when critics pointed out that it\u2019s not a binding treaty. Implementation, they say, is the key. Without enforcement, without \u201cteeth,\u201d real progress is doubtful. There are three problems with this interpretation.One, changes in international relations occur not when treaties are enforced, as when laws are enforced domestically, but when a consensus, or near consensus, is achieved. Paris represents a couple of decades of concerted effort to shift the normative structure of modern economies.Two, shifts in well-entrenched social norms \u2014 domestic and international \u2014 start slowly, seem to drag on forever and then pick up momentum. Paris is one push on a flywheel that is, oh so slowly, gathering momentum.Three, it is an open question as to whether the financing needed to implement the agreement can be obtained while simultaneously reducing fossil fuel extraction.What the Paris agreement represents culturally and politically is a dawning realization that fossil fuels themselves, not just emissions, not just impacts, are \u201cthe problem.\u201dTo avert catastrophic outcomes humanity must start stopping fossil fuel use. Paris is such a start.THOMAS PRINCENAnn Arbor, Mich.The writer is co-editor of \u201cEnding the Fossil Fuel Era\u201d and a professor of natural resource policy at the University of Michigan.To the Editor:One thing that the climate conference vividly demonstrated is the stark disconnect between the climate negotiators and the reality of today\u2019s global energy markets. Just as the environmental costs of additional carbon emissions have dramatically increased, the price of burning more fossil fuels has plunged.The blunt actions of OPEC and traditional oil producers to crush their competitors have made the world market awash with crude oil. The declining price signals the world to burn more fossil fuels, not less. Any global policy for carbon dioxide emissions controls that fails to address this economic dilemma lacks credibility.The climate conference also highlights the shift in the balance of power in global climate change politics. While the United States and industrialized countries set today\u2019s global warming in motion, the last and most devastating degrees of warming will be decided by the developing countries. In particular, unlike past eras, the fate of our climate will be at the mercy of two countries over whom we have little control: China and India.MICHAEL BANKSBoulder, Colo.To the Editor:If a terrorist organization somehow figured out how to raise global temperatures, thereby flooding coastal cities, destroying crops, threatening drinking water supplies, and causing devastating heat waves and storms, we would do whatever it took, and spend every last dollar we had, to stop it.But when the world\u2019s leading scientists tell us that such changes have already started to occur and that we are causing them, and when they warn us that unless we drastically reduce our burning of fossil fuels, we face an unimaginable catastrophe, our response has always been that it is much too difficult, and much too expensive, to do so.On Saturday in Paris nearly 200 countries demonstrated for the first time that they took the scientists\u2019 warnings seriously. Will we now do whatever it takes, and spend whatever amount we must, to prevent the consequences of climate change from becoming catastrophic? Or will we simply be helpless witnesses as the growing terror unfolds, slowly and inexorably, before our eyes?ERIC CHIVIANBostonThe writer, a physician, is the founder and former director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School.To the Editor:Historians will likely look back on Dec. 12, 2015, as a watershed moment in the history of civilization. This is the day that negotiators from 195 countries came together to acknowledge the calamitous risk that our carbon emissions pose to the climate, and hence to ourselves and future generations.While we remain distracted by the hot story du jour fueled by social media and the 24-hour news cycle, the threat to our food supplies, coastal cities and ultimately our domestic tranquillity continues to grow relentlessly and ever more quickly. On Saturday, humanity collectively stepped away from the brink.And yet \u2014 amazingly \u2014 the day passed quietly, with few celebrations in the streets or toasts in the cafes. While this is not surprising, it indicates that the grave challenge before us remains largely unrecognized. Let\u2019s hope that we have the collective wisdom to remember the importance of the Paris accord and follow through on the commitments that were made.WILLIAM L. BAINBellevue, Wash.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart\u2019s Imports From China Displaced 400,000 Jobs, a Study Says", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe jobs, mostly in manufacturing, represent about 13 percent of the 3.2 million jobs displaced over those same years that the study attributes to the United States\u2019 goods trade deficit with China. Walmart\u2019s Chinese imports amounted to at least $49 billion in 2013, according to the study, which was based on trade and labor data. Over all, the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China hit $324 billion that year.\u201cWalmart is one of the major forces pulling imports into the United States,\u201d said Robert E. Scott, an economist at the institute and the study\u2019s author. \u201cAnd the jobs we\u2019re losing are good-paying manufacturing jobs, which pay higher wages and provide better benefits.\u201dWalmart disputed the conclusions of the study, which is an update of estimates that the institute released in 2007. For one, many of the numbers used in the study rely on guesswork, because retailers do not generally release a breakdown of their imports.Some economists also point out that studies like these do not properly account for the jobs that imports can create in industries like transportation, wholesale and retail.\u201cWe are very proud of our U.S. manufacturing initiative, and the results speak for themselves. By investing in products that support American jobs, we are able to bring new products to our shelves while bringing new jobs to local communities in Ohio, Tennessee, California and many others,\u201d Lorenzo Lopez, a Walmart spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, this is an old report with flawed economic analysis that assumes that imports equal job losses and does not take into consideration that countless jobs are added through the global supply chain, distribution and logistics, among other areas of the business,\u201d Mr. Lopez added.Walmart has long been the subject of criticism from groups like the Economic Policy Institute over its role in flooding the United States with cheap imports. Under pressure, Walmart in 2013 announced that it would increase its sourcing of American-made products by $50 billion over the next 10 years.The retailer said at the time that it would buy more goods already produced in the United States, like games and paper, and help vendors in areas like furniture and textiles return production that had moved overseas. But critics quickly rebuffed the initiative as a public-relations stunt, pointing out that the $50 billion made up just a fraction of the sales growth Walmart \u2014 which has annual sales of almost $500 billion \u2014 was likely to log over the next decade.Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner and managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, said that America\u2019s trade deficit with China had indeed led to net job losses. But as labor costs soared in China, that situation was reversing \u2014 and Walmart\u2019s move was significant.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is that more things are coming back to the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Sirkin said. The cost to retailers of sourcing furniture and appliances in the United States, for example, was becoming comparable to the costs of importing those products from China, he said.\u201cWalmart\u2019s buying American not just for the sake of America,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re buying American because of economics.\u201dThe institute\u2019s study estimated the direct and indirect labor requirements of production in 195 industries, of which 77 were in manufacturing.

{"Headline": "For Speech, Obama Selects a Setting He Usually Shuns: The Oval Office", "Date": "2015-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe choice of the Oval Office as the location for the address to the nation was partly the result of holiday happenstance: The rest of the White House is decorated for the many parties that Mr. Obama will be hosting this week for his staff, members of Congress, journalists and others.But the decision also reflects the gravity of a subject that has come to define Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, especially in his second term: how to reassure Americans of their safety even as the United States faces an increasingly aggressive terrorist foe.And it suggests the importance that the president and his advisers place on responding to criticism of his strategy for defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. That criticism has grown more fierce in recent months, as the terrorist network has initiated or inspired attacks beyond those borders \u2014 in Paris; in Beirut, Lebanon; in the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt; and, perhaps, last week in the United States.Mr. Obama has delivered formal remarks to the nation from the Oval Office twice before \u2014 in the summer of 2010, as oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico from a broken well, and a few months later, as he announced the end of combat operations in Iraq, declaring that he had made good on a central promise from his campaign.He had not done it since.Most of the dramatic moments of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential oratory have happened outside the Oval Office. He announced the killing of Osama bin Laden in a speech from the East Room, a location that allows him to stride up to the lectern through the Cross Hall of the White House as the cameras are rolling.He used the same location to hail the passage of his signature health care initiative, the Affordable Care Act.And throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama and his aides have sought backdrops outside Washington. A speech directed toward Muslims worldwide was delivered at Cairo University in Egypt. He talked about the economy at Georgetown University. He celebrated civil rights at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. And he discussed the war in Afghanistan at the United States Military Academy at West Point.Aides have said the Oval Office is suited more for a short address than the longer speeches Mr. Obama sometimes favors. And in today\u2019s media age, it can sometimes be difficult to persuade networks to carry a short Oval Office address live in the middle of a lucrative prime-time television lineup.Some of Mr. Obama\u2019s media advisers have long believed that sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office, as presidents like Ronald Reagan usually did, is no longer an effective image in a fast-paced, YouTube world. The desk, sitting between the viewer and the president, becomes an obstacle for those watching, a distraction from the president\u2019s message, they said.Those aides \u2014 some of whom have left the White House \u2014 also believed in the power of the image of Mr. Obama walking up to a lectern in the East Room.But there is also history to think about, and there is no doubt that the Oval Office backdrop conveys the historic nature of a moment. In addressing the terrorist threat on Sunday, Mr. Obama clearly hoped to achieve that goal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Election Marks Another Rejection of Austerity", "Date": "2015-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMADRID \u2014 European leaders and economists are still locked in a heated debate about whether austerity policies have done more to help or hurt people in the region, particularly in Europe\u2019s heavily indebted south.\u201cThe sense of political crisis in Spain and some other European countries is clearly the fruit of the economic crisis,\u201d said Jaime Pastor, a professor of politics at the Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia in Madrid.The financial crisis, he argued, first put into question the viability of the region\u2019s economic model and welfare state, but eventually turned into \u201ca debate over whether the cost of the crisis was shared fairly, to which many voters answered negatively and are therefore demanding the removal of the crony capitalism of the big parties.\u201dStill, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain is hoping to stay in office, at the helm of a minority or coalition administration, after his conservative Popular Party won the most votes on Sunday but lost its parliamentary majority.Even if Mr. Rajoy succeeds, some analysts say the shake-up of Spanish politics is irreversible after two emerging parties, Podemos and Citizens, made enough gains on Sunday to lower the combined share of the two traditional parties, the Popular and the Socialist parties, to just over 50 percent of the vote.The returns also underlined a generational shift in regional politics. Mr. Rajoy, 60, tried to contrast his three decades in politics with the untested leadership of his three far younger rivals, all of whom are in their 30s or 40s. It did him little good.On Monday, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece congratulated Podemos and its leader, Pablo Iglesias, 37, on becoming the third-largest party in Spain, as well as the country\u2019s main anti-establishment force. \u201cAusterity has now been politically defeated in Spain, as well,\u201d said Mr. Tsipras, 41, a role model for the rest of the European anti-establishment left.In southern Europe, perhaps Italy alone has been spared the instability of a breakdown of its main party system. But even there, it is not clear that the storm has passed, and analysts note that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s popularity has declined since he took office last year, as the public pressure for changes has not relented.But even if more voters have rejected austerity, where this will take the region is uncertain. As the result in Greece showed, even anti-austerity parties have to answer to financial markets and balance national budgets, and the numbers are still deeply stacked against the policies of the old left and their heavy spending on welfare states.Faced with such budgetary constraints, the new political leaders of southern Europe may make more headway in introducing political reform, according to analysts, particularly in a country like Spain, where a majority of voters voiced their frustration on Sunday not only with austerity but also with stagnant, closed and often corrupt establishment parties and the institutions they support.Mr. Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, said at a news conference on Monday that his party would \u201cextend a hand\u201d to those willing to push through major reforms, but without committing support to any specific government leader.\u201cAll of us must do some thinking in the coming weeks, but particularly the old parties,\u201d Mr. Iglesias said. The election, he added, needed to result in \u201ca new political system\u201d for Spain.For now, however, Mr. Rajoy faces an uphill struggle to form a government and avoid a period of prolonged political uncertainty, even a new election, that could undermine Spain\u2019s fragile economic recovery. The main Spanish stock market index fell 3.6 percent on Monday.Mr. Rajoy said at a news briefing on Monday that \u201cthe fragmentation of political forces cannot be an element of paralysis, blockage and inaction,\u201d which could also endanger Spain\u2019s economy.Among various scenarios for a possible coalition government, the only one that would ensure a parliamentary majority would be an alliance of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s Popular Party and the opposition Socialists, led by Pedro S\u00e1nchez.Such a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d would be unprecedented for Spain, and would require resolving a very difficult relationship, given the bitterness between the embattled leaders of the two parties during the campaign.\u201cWhat came out of the ballot boxes is a monumental mess,\u201d Bieito Rubido, editor in chief of the conservative newspaper ABC, told Spanish national television on Monday. \u201cAlmost everybody has lost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

How far he stretches across my life!\u201d Twain counted Stanley as one of his oldest friends, claiming, \u201cI knew him when his work was all before him.\u201dFriendship is the main subject of \u201cTwain and Stanley Enter Paradise,\u201d the final novel by Oscar Hijuelos, who died of a heart attack in 2013 at age 62. In comments about his intentions, included in the book as an author\u2019s note, Hijuelos explains that he began writing about Mark Twain and Henry Stanley because they \u201cseemed a perfect pairing.\u201d The result is a lengthy, though incomplete, homage to the bond that joined two of the most famous men of the 19th century. \u201cOurs has been a friendship that\u2019s lasted,\u201d Twain reminisces in the novel. \u201cWhatever the mysterious cause, our friendship blossomed and eventually led to a quite interesting run of years.\u201dFrom their first meeting on a Mississippi riverboat piloted by Twain, the two hit it off. In Henry Stanley, Twain sees the incarnation of his beloved brother, also named Henry, who had been fatally injured in a steamboat accident. Stanley, a lonely young immigrant from Wales, respects Twain for his self-taught erudition. The men spend their first hours talking about the origins of chess, the mechanics of pocket watches, the mysteries of the universe. They share a passion for books and an ambition to be authors. \u201cSurely if we are not brothers by relation, we can be brothers of the written word,\u201d Twain announces. Stanley, in turn, promises to be Twain\u2019s \u201clifelong friend.\u201dThe imaginative freedom that makes fiction possible gives writers the license to enhance history, distort it or even reinvent the past entirely. For Hijuelos, the well-known facts of Twain\u2019s and Stanley\u2019s separate lives serve as the template for a more fanciful exploration of their relationship. Hijuelos fills the biographical gaps with a composite of fictional letters, memoirs and found manuscripts. He gives his characters opportunities to share their impressions of each other. On occasion, he invents opportunities for them to travel together. After Stanley\u2019s adoptive father disappears on a trip to Cuba, Twain and Stanley go in search of him, a journey that brings out vivid descriptions by Stanley of the Cuban countryside: \u201cNatural gardens were flourishing all around \u2014 ceiba, tamarind and mango trees, mainly. Beyond were the cane field, the processing mill, barns and a corral for oxen.\u201dIt\u2019s not just scenery Stanley notices; he also sees teams of slaves harvesting sugar, \u201ctheir ebony backs glistening with moisture.\u201d Slavery is introduced as a constant, visible reality early in the novel. As Stanley and Twain travel through Cuba and the American South, they observe, evaluate and even attempt to justify slavery. \u201cI believed it was part of a greater design,\u201d Stanley says in hindsight, \u201cand surely, supernatural reasoning aside, it was of indeterminable practical value to the economy of the South.\u201d Stanley goes on to object, albeit mildly, to \u201cthe unfair treatment of such slaves and the cruelties I had heard were rendered to them.\u201d With similar mildness in later sections, the novel attempts to distance Stanley from the cruelties with which he has come to be associated during his explorations in Africa. He calls the infamous King Leopold\u202fII of Belgium \u201ca well-intentioned man in a difficult situation.\u201d About Stanley\u2019s role in \u201calleged colonial atrocities\u201d in Congo, we\u2019re told by the narrator that \u201cthe very idea that he, after all his efforts in Africa, might be associated with such allegations or that his explorations had in any way led to such things depressed him greatly.\u201d Stanley himself makes equivocal reference to the hundreds of deaths he caused and admits to Twain that he feels \u201ca vague sense of remorse.\u201dThe novel has to strain to keep its characters on the virtuous side of history. The portrait of Twain is convincing. Hijuelos\u2019s scattered attempts to redeem Stanley, however, create some perplexing inconsistencies. With all the research Hijuelos clearly did, he must have known that the real Stanley boasted of looking upon \u201cevery cordial-faced aborigine .\u2008.\u2008. with much of the same regard that an agriculturist views his strong-limbed child; he is a future recruit to the ranks of soldier-\u00adlaborers.\u201d By largely disregarding Stanley\u2019s potential for brutality, Hijuelos leaves us wondering why his fictional Stanley has so many critics.The real Henry Morton Stanley made himself prominent in his time by chronicling his search for David Livingstone and for his efforts to map the rivers of Central Africa. His panache as a writer gives his accounts a fictional tinge. In Hijuelos\u2019s version, Twain says of Stanley\u2019s book \u201cIn Darkest Africa\u201d that it \u201creads like a novel,\u201d and he admires \u201cthe sheer audacity of the thing.\u201d There is audacity to Hijuelos\u2019s effort to enliven the documented history with his own panache. While more deserves to be said about Stanley\u2019s exploits as a henchman in Africa for King \u00adLeopold, it is important to remember that Hijuelos was not able to revise his manuscript and bring the book to completion.Oscar Hijuelos, best known for his portrayals of the Cuban immigrant experience, distinguished himself as a writer who infused his fiction with strong emotions and vivid minutiae. In a signature passage in his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \u201cThe Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,\u201d a character lingers over a half-dead fly on a bathroom mirror, the intricacies of a dime and the design of a constellation before his impressions crystallize in a concise expression of longing: \u201cHe had dreamed about undoing things.\u201d Such keen observations and bold poignancy likewise fill Hijuelos\u2019s final novel, if in a more piecemeal fashion.\u201cTwain and Stanley Enter Paradise\u201d absorbed Hijuelos for the last 12 years of his life. He reportedly wrote thousands of pages, and had not submitted the book to the publisher at the time of his death. In an afterword, his widow, Lori Marie \u00adCarlson-Hijuelos, recounts how she found the one extant copy of the manuscript in her husband\u2019s study. Assuring readers that a Hijuelos novel about Mark Twain and Henry Stanley is not as anomalous as it might seem, she reports that her husband was a dedicated reader of world history and \u201cwas curious about all aspects of the world and human endeavor.\u201dPosthumous publications of work by major authors can give us a special kind of insight into the writing process. They are important additions to a literary legacy, and independent sections of them can be appreciated, but without the author\u2019s input during the editing process, they should not be understood as fully formed novels. \u201cTwain and Stanley Enter Paradise\u201d is not the equal of Hijuelos\u2019s finest work. It is best understood as a project that will always be in progress, energized by its potential, its sections captured in the midst of being revised and arranged by a writer who knew how to keep his readers enthralled.TWAIN AND STANLEY ENTER PARADISEBy Oscar Hijuelos465 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $28.Joanna Scott\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cDe Potter\u2019s Grand Tour.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Calm Acceptance as Fed Enacts Its First Interest Increase in Seven Years", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s much-anticipated \u201cliftoff,\u201d its first interest rate increase since the financial crisis, unfolded as quietly and smoothly as Fed officials could possibly have wished.For the Fed, however, the hard work now lies ahead.The Fed persuaded participants in the financial markets that a quarter-point increase in its benchmark interest rate didn\u2019t matter much. But the big questions about the American economy haven\u2019t changed.It\u2019s not clear whether steady-but-lackluster growth is now as good as it gets, or whether the economy is just starting to heat up. It\u2019s not clear why inflation is so sluggish, or how many people without jobs would like to return to work.In short, it\u2019s not clear how quickly the Fed should raise rates.\u201cNothing is really resolved about the normalization process except that we\u2019ve moved through this first tiny step,\u201d said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon who follows the central bank closely.The Fed is raising short-term rates in a new way, by paying banks and other financial firms not to offer loans at rates below the bottom of its benchmark range. Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.To set the new base line, the Fed said it would borrow up to $2 trillion at a rate of 0.25 percent. On Thursday, however, firms offered only $105 billion to the Fed \u2014 less than the $114 billion average daily sum offered to the Fed during testing over the last two years. Jon Faust, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University and former adviser to Ms. Yellen, said Fed officials were basically trying to discern which of two possible versions of the economic reality was correct.In the first version, low interest rates have helped the economy build up some significant momentum, and the Fed needs to raise rates more rapidly to keep a lid on inflation and financial excess.Alternatively, low rates are necessary to preserve the modest pace of economic growth, and increasing them too abruptly could push the economy into recession.\u201cI think one of the trickiest and most important parts will be trying to figure out what\u2019s going on with inflation,\u201d Mr. Faust said.Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.Prices climbed slowly in recent years, suggesting that the economy remained weak. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2014 an index of personal consumption that excludes volatile food and oil prices \u2014 rose just 1.3 percent in the 12 months ending in October. But Ms. Yellen and other officials have argued that temporary pressures like the fall of oil prices and the strength of the dollar are suppressing inflation, and that the strength of the labor market is a more important indicator.Andrew T. Levin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth, said that change was important because the Fed\u2019s forecasts had been \u201cpersistently mistaken\u201d in recent years. \u201cIt will be helpful for policy makers to explain what sorts of inflation readings over coming months would make them comfortable,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who has argued that the Fed should be careful not to raise rates too quickly.Policy makers would be grateful for a clear-cut answer, but they probably won\u2019t get it. Their choices would become more difficult if inflation remained sluggish even as other economic indicators continued to gain strength. A deepening divergence between the Fed\u2019s models and reality would make it harder for Ms. Yellen to maintain unanimity about the central bank\u2019s path.The Fed has other reasons to press ahead with raising rates. One longstanding concern is that low rates will distort investment decisions, encouraging excessive speculation and even asset bubbles.The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has begun the process of raising interest rates, a move that her predecessors have taken in recent decades as they put their own distinctive stamp on the economy.Banks, too, are taking larger risks, according to a semiannual report published on Wednesday by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The report said banks struggling to hit profit targets were loosening underwriting standards, particularly in high-growth areas like auto and construction lending.Ms. Yellen and other officials have emphasized that they would prefer to address such risks through tighter regulation. But they won\u2019t mind the incremental benefits of raising the bar for new lending. Jeremy Stein, a former Fed governor who has returned to teaching at Harvard, has observed that higher rates have the virtue of addressing even unknown problems. Higher rates also reduce the incentives for risk-taking by banks and other lenders by fattening their profit margins. Banks were quick to take advantage of the Fed\u2019s announcement on Wednesday to raise the rates they charge on many loans but not the rates that they pay to depositors.William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has emphasized that the Fed needs to make sure that changes in its benchmark rate are indeed influencing broader financial conditions.But Ms. Yellen, asked about that on Wednesday, suggested she did not see great reason for concern. \u201cWe have a far more resilient financial system now,\u201d she said, \u201cthan we had prior to the financial crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Push for Cleaner Cars, Sheer Numbers Could Work Against Climate Benefits", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 As United Nations climate conferees meet near here, Eric Feunteun wishes everyone could agree: If the world is going to curb climate change, there is no choice but to stop driving cars that burn fossil fuels.\u201cIf we want affordable, practical and fully green technology,\u201d Mr. Feunteun said in an interview in an office building on the edge of Paris, \u201cthe electric vehicle is the answer at this stage.\u201dMr. Feunteun is hardly an unbiased source. He heads the electric car program at the French automaker Renault, which sells more electric vehicles in Europe than any other company \u2014 and with its Japanese alliance partner, Nissan, accounts for half the all-electric vehicles now on the world\u2019s roads.That is because much of the expansion will be propelled by the rise of the consumer class in industrializing parts of the globe, especially in China and India, as hundreds of millions of new drivers discover the glory of the open road. Those populous and geographically sprawling countries might be hard pressed any time soon to assemble the ubiquitous electricity grid required for recharging electric vehicles; and much of the electricity China and India will produce in coming decades will come from coal-fired power plants that are some of the planet\u2019s biggest emitters of carbon dioxide.Given the limitations of electric cars so far \u2014 including their limited range between charges \u2014 many experts predict that most of the billion additional cars predicted to be on the road in 2030 will have internal combustion engines that spew greenhouse gases.The United Nations conference will not deal directly with cars or with what countries should do about them or other major sources of carbon emissions, like factories and power plants. Rather, the conference is meant to get countries to commit to reducing their carbon footprints, leaving the details about how to achieve their goals to each individual nation.Few disagree that the best solutions include the adoption of electric vehicles and, especially in cities, making it easier for people to forgo cars by using public transportation or riding bicycles.But optimists argue that even in the case of cars with internal-combustion engines, carbon dioxide emissions can be cut significantly by measures like increasing fuel economy and introducing smart-driving technologies to make cars move about with greater efficiency.Lewis M. Fulton, a researcher at the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, cites \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d \u2014 the amount of carbon dioxide produced for each mile traveled \u2014 as an area where advances can be made. By 2030, he said, it should be possible to cut the carbon intensity of new cars powered by fossil fuel by 50 percent from 2005 levels. Already, he said, there has been about a 20 percent improvement.\u201cI believe that this is doable,\u201d Mr. Fulton said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be serious enough about climate change that we\u2019re going to see the policy changes we need to make this happen.\u201dStill, the math is daunting. If the number of cars doubles, and the average mileage improves by only 50 percent, all of the fuel-economy gains would be offset by the emissions from the new vehicles.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Reducing tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions \u201cis absolutely possible,\u201d said Daniel F. Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, an environmental group based in Washington.\u201cBut the automakers are attacking these standards as we speak, both in Congress and through a review of the program they demanded from the Obama administration,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cSimilar attacks are underway in the E.U.\u201dCongress, in an effort to make the United States more energy independent, passed a law in 2007 mandating a 35 m.p.g. auto-fleet standard by 2020. But before that, there had been no official change to American fuel-economy standards in more than 30 years.\u201cThe U.S. auto industry was successful between 1975 and 2007 in preventing any improvement for mileage standards for CO2 emissions,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cThey exploit every loophole in the standards, making more SUVs, pickups and other light duty trucks than cars because trucks have weaker standards than cars, and more large vehicles because large vehicles have weaker standards than smaller vehicles.\u201dWade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a carmakers\u2019 lobbying group in Washington, said he could speak only for the American market. But he defended the industry, noting that in the United States there are more than about 500 makes and models of vehicles that get 30 miles per gallon or more.\u201cThat\u2019s a 600 percent increase since just 2006,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here in the U.S., it\u2019s important to remember that CAFE measures what consumers buy, not what we make. So consumer acceptance in the U.S. is key.\u201d CAFE, pronounced like sidewalk cafe, is the acronym for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations in the United States.Automakers have made big strides in reducing carbon emissions, to meet fleet standards. In fact, those targets have been a big motivation in the development of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles and all-electric cars.\u201cThe green aspect of electric cars is clearly the most important thing,\u201d said Mr. Feunteun at Renault. But, he conceded, \u201cyou need to have all the benefits.\u201d That would include an ability to drive farther between charges.\u201cWe expect to double electric vehicle range by 2020,\u201d he said. If that happens, the Renault Zoe, which currently has an effective range of about 150 kilometers, or 93 miles, would be at 300 kilometers \u2014 enough to meet most drivers\u2019 day-to-day needs.Mr. Feunteun\u2019s boss, Carlos Ghosn, the chairman and chief executive of Renault and Nissan, said at a Brussels news conference on Friday that the auto industry had the technological skills to make cars more environmentally friendly. Electric cars and other cleaner-running vehicles \u201chave to be acceptable to the consumer,\u201d Mr. Ghosn said. \u201cWe know that one of the limitations in the development of electric cars in Europe is the lack of charging infrastructure.\u201dMr. Feunteun, for his part, acknowledged that the current generation of electric cars tends to need government incentives to compete economically with vehicles using internal combustion engines. That can include the tax credits many countries now offer, or public support for building a charging network to let drivers refresh their car batteries away from home. \u201cOne stakeholder can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ecosystem.\u201dChina and India, with their notoriously polluted air, have strong incentives to embrace greener vehicles. In fact, China is already the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for electric cars.But Mr. Becker, at the Safe Climate Campaign, points out that electric vehicles are only as environmentally friendly as the electricity that recharges them. China, though it is rapidly adopting nuclear power plants, is still heavily reliant on coal-fired electrical plants.Erik Jonnaert, secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, argued that automakers had done more than any other industry to reduce emissions. Policy makers, he said, should focus on new-car efficiency and on getting older, higher-polluting vehicles off the road through so-called cash for clunker-type programs. That alone could cut CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 from today\u2019s level, he said, as efficiency-enhancing technologies are introduced in new cars.But Mr. Jonnaert said that economic trade-offs had to be considered, too, as regulators seek to curb the release of carbon dioxide.\u201cAt the end of the day, when you talk about transport emissions for transport in general, including for freight transport, they increase when the economy is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what are we going to say, we\u2019re going to stop the economy to stop emissions?\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to comments by Mr. Newton about the automobile industry. His comments applied to the United States auto market, including non-American companies selling vehicles there. He was not discussing only the American carmakers.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Although existing-home sales unexpectedly dropped in November, according to another report released last week, most economists think that was a temporary dip that was related to new government regulations.Financial markets on Thursday will end a volatile year of trading in the United States that was dominated by concerns about the Chinese economy and the future policy decisions of the Federal Reserve.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is on track to close the year at about the same place that it began, despite many significant moves at the end of the summer. This has been the worst year for American stocks since 2011, when the major indexes ended the year largely unchanged. Bond investors also struggled this year, as they prepared for the Fed\u2019s decision, which came this month, to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.European stocks were set to end a disappointing 2015 not far from where they started the year, after a spring rally fizzled on anxieties about the direction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate policy and concerns about global growth.Financially challenged Puerto Rico faces another deadline, on Jan. 1, for payments on some of its $72 billion of debt. This time the payments amount to about $902 million, according to the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research institute in San Juan. About a third of that is for general obligation bonds, which are constitutionally guaranteed in Puerto Rico, a United States commonwealth.The slowdown in China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector is expected to have continued throughout December.

{"Headline": "In a Global Market for Hacking Talent, Argentines Stand Out", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Want to learn how to break into the computerized heart of a medical device or an electronic voting machine? Maybe a smartphone or even a car? Thanks to the legacy of military rule and a culture of breaking rules of all sorts, Argentina has become one of the best places on earth to find people who could show you how.As Silicon Valley\u2019s talent war has gone global, particularly for those skilled at breaking into things, this Latin American nation has become a rich recruiting ground for corporations and foreign governments. Companies need hackers to help defend against online criminals and state-sponsored spies. And as the world\u2019s critical infrastructure moves online and the threat of war moves into cyberspace, governments are desperate to acquire hackers\u2019 tools.\u201cUnless you are rich, you grow up without a computer or reading books. To access new software, you have to hack it, and you have to teach yourself everything from the ground up,\u201d he said.Technology companies like Apple, Facebook and Google have encrypted their products and services so that in many cases the only way to monitor a target\u2019s communications is to hack directly into its device. As a result, there is a new urgency among governments in acquiring zero-day exploits.It is impossible to say how many hackers live in Argentina, since breaking into computers is not generally a skill that Argentines like to advertise. But EkoParty, which drew 1,600 people this year, is widely known as the best place to find them.Long before foreign companies came calling, hacking things was a life skill in Argentina, a way to get by through decades of repressive military rule and a volatile economy.Argentines have a saying, \u201catado con alambre,\u201d which translates roughly as \u201cheld together with wire,\u201d to describe the inventive nature of so many here who learned to do much with little.\u201cThose of us who came of age under a military junta \u2014 who were told which books to read, which movies to watch, which God to worship \u2014 had to learn to move around the laws,\u201d Norma Morandini, a senator from C\u00f3rdoba province, told a crowd at the conference. \u201cFor us, hacking became a way of life.\u201dThe country still has one foot in the tech industry\u2019s past because of stringent import rules. Amazon will not ship to your door here. BlackBerry has more market share here than Apple. A new iPhone costs $2,000 or more on MercadoLibre, an online auction site, but many iPhone owners said they had been able to persuade a friend traveling from abroad to sneak one through customs.To get their hands on the latest, greatest devices, Argentines often have to think like a hacker \u2014 or even become one.\u201cYou make do without resources, without high-end technology, with poor Wi-Fi connections,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst. \u201cWe improvise creative solutions, for lack of other options, and many have applied these same procedures to the technical industry.\u201dAmong EkoParty\u2019s panelists were hackers like Alfredo Ortega, a sweet-natured man from rural Patagonia and professed \u201ccybergaucho\u201d and was able to break into a new e-voting system in 20 minutes. Later, over tea and cookies, he demonstrated how to hide malicious code in computer chips.Mr. Ortega, who now works for Avast Software, is best known for breaking into a computer operating system thought to be invulnerable. His latest work in progress is an X-ray-emitting device that can break into systems that are not even online.\u201cAlmost anything you give him, he will break,\u201d said Federico Kirschbaum, who started the EkoParty conference with a fellow Argentine, Francisco Amato. They are also the co-founders of the security company Infobyte.Other presenters included Juliano Rizzo, an Argentine security researcher who demonstrated a zero-day flaw onstage that some here estimated would have sold for six figures on the black market.In 1996, Core started working with companies and government agencies to find security holes in their networks. Later, they created one of the first automated attack tools designed to penetrate clients\u2019 systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities.\u201cIt was a bold proposition, especially coming from \u2018some guys in Argentina,\u2019\u201d said Ivan Arce, one of Core\u2019s founders. Analysts initially said the tool was unethical, but one of Core\u2019s first customers, NASA, helped change minds.As Core grew, its founders trained the next generation of exploit coders. But those hackers now have far more lucrative options than their predecessors did back in 1996.Exploits that 20 years ago were discovered out of curiosity, or to defend against criminals, are valuable to an increasing number of governments \u2014 40 at last count \u2014 that are developing offensive digital weapon programs.Governments have already started repurposing Argentine exploit tools as spy tools. Last December, two researchers discovered that an Iranian hacking group was using Core\u2019s penetration testing tool against Iranian dissidents.\u201cThis started out as hobbyists sharing exploits as a game,\u201d Mr. Arce said. \u201cNow exploits are hoarded for profit.\u201dThose dollars go a long way in Buenos Aires, where a high-end apartment in Palermo Soho \u2014 a hip neighborhood with a concentration of tech start-ups \u2014 rents for $1,000 a month.But Argentina\u2019s days as the outsourcing capital for hackers may be numbered, Mr. Eren of Avast warns, particularly as the world goes mobile and governments start zeroing in on ways to break into smartphones.\u201cArgentina may be hitting a peak,\u201d Mr. Eren said. \u201cThere\u2019s new competition.\u201d And when it comes to breaking into phone software, he said, \u201cChina is the country now making a mark.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Schumer-Portman framework before Congress would be more attractive if companies were required to invest the repatriated funds in ways that would create jobs while enhancing American competitiveness.These criteria could be met, for example, by investing in social impact bonds to support programs to improve the early childhoods of the almost one million Americans born into poverty annually. ARNOLD PACKERLa Jolla, Calif.The writer is a former researcher at Johns Hopkins University and former assistant secretary of labor.To the Editor:As an international tax attorney, I must contest the presumptions on which Carl Icahn bases his Op-Ed essay (and similar presumptions behind many efforts at international tax reform).Mr. Icahn states, \u201cNot only is this the largest inversion in history, but it will also open the floodgates for other companies to leave the United States, further eroding our tax base, damaging our economy and costing many thousands of jobs.\u201dOther than the obvious result of paying less in American corporate income taxes, there is no reason to believe that the inversion will either damage the American economy or cost thousands of jobs. Let me argue by an analogy. Apple is famous for an international tax structure in which substantial profits are trapped in Ireland and not subject to American or even foreign income taxes. While this now common trick certainly employs a number of Irish and other lawyers and accountants, there is little argument that this tax trick reduces American employment or economic strength.Inversions are a threat to the United States\u2019 corporate income tax base, nothing more, and nothing less.STUART WEICHSELNew YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Students Occupy Their Schools to Save Them", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil \u2014 Brazil\u2019s economy, a huge corruption scandal at a state-owned oil company and, more recently, impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff have dominated the news about this country recently. But it\u2019s another crisis in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo that has the potential to shape democracy in the country for years to come. That\u2019s because this crisis \u2014 a huge protest in response to the state\u2019s plan to close 94 public schools \u2014 involves some of the country\u2019s youngest citizens: elementary, middle and high school students.In October, without discussing the decision with teachers, parents or students, the S\u00e3o Paulo state government announced during a television interview that dozens of schools would be closed next year. The plan is part of a consolidation intended to streamline the use of resources by grouping students into specific schools for each educational level. More than 300,000 students will be affected; many will be sent to overcrowded schools far from their homes.The response to the announcement was immediate. First, the teachers\u2019 union organized protests, but they were ignored. Then, students protested in their neighborhoods, hoping to raise awareness among community members. They were ignored. Finally, on Nov. 9, a handful of students decided to occupy a school in the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo. Within a week, nearly 100 schools had been occupied, and, a week later, 200.Although they enjoy broad support from parents, neighbors, teachers and the wider community, the students have faced tough resistance from the state government. Initially, the state tried to have the police remove the students by force, but that effort was quashed by the judiciary, which suggested that the government sit down with the protesters to negotiate a solution. So far that has not happened. Instead, in an audio recording of a meeting with school administrators that was leaked to the press, the government can be heard devising a \u201cwar\u201d strategy to discredit the students.Unfortunately, this arrogant approach to the demands of civil society is characteristic of a new generation of Brazilian public officials. Earlier politicians \u2014 those who came into power when Brazil was in transition from a military dictatorship \u2014 emerged from workers\u2019 unions, social movements and pro-democracy coalitions. Their formative years had included salary negotiations, grass-roots assemblies, and alliance building, all of which require compromise and an ability to reconcile divergent views.Today\u2019s political leaders emerged not from social movements but from established places of power, including professional government posts and professorships at elite universities. They are well educated but out of touch, preferring to rely on technical solutions to problems without regard for how people affected by their decisions think. Twenty-three centuries ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle addressed the tension between technical knowledge and the spirit of democracy with the maxim, the guest will be a better judge of a feast than the cook.In the terms of that analogy, Brazilians are starving. The students\u2019 protest is the latest in a series of social movements that have spiraled out of control because the government has been unresponsive. In 2013, protesters demanding reductions in public transportation fares were met with silence from public officials. In advance of the 2014 World Cup, protests against evictions intended to clear the way for stadium construction, and demonstrations against police brutality in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s slums, fell upon deaf ears.Thousands of students are now living in their occupied schools in S\u00e3o Paulo. In the face of the government\u2019s declaration of war, they are organizing classes, workshops and musical performances, cooking for one another with food donated by parents and neighbors, and handling routine maintenance on the buildings they have taken over. Rather than losing strength, they are expanding their demands. They are no longer fighting just to keep their schools open. Now, their protest has become a way to express their dissatisfaction with the school system in general.Their efforts are bearing fruit. Last week, officials of the state government said they would postpone the school closings for one year. The education secretary has resigned. Still, the government continues to take aggressive action \u2014 last week large public demonstrations were met with riot police. Although the protesters now occupy only 100 schools, they show no signs of backing down. In fact, their movement appears to be contagious. Students in another state, Goias, have so far taken over nine buildings to protest a decision turning over management of their schools to private nonprofits.Recent history gives them all reason for hope. The government\u2019s concessions in S\u00e3o Paulo are reminiscent of another retreat in the face of a public uprising.After weeks of rigid intransigence from municipal and state governments, the 2013 protests against public transportation fare increases had grown so large that 9 percent of the adult population of Brazil had taken to the streets. Eventually, 70 percent of the country\u2019s urban population saw their fares reduced.One begins to wonder whether it will always take a major national crisis initiated by street protest for the Brazilian people\u2019s voices to be heard.This article has been updated to reflect the news.Advertisement"}

You are sewer rats!\u201d shrilled another. And they began to chant the name of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Handed its biggest setback at the ballot box in 17 years \u2014 with the opposition winning control of the National Assembly for the first time, and by a wide margin \u2014 Chavismo, the movement founded by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, has turned inward to attack its own.\u201cThis type of defeat creates a lot of internal tensions,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a historian. \u201cChavismo does not have much capacity to process this type of conflict. It\u2019s not used to that. It doesn\u2019t have a real democratic character or disposition for debate or tolerating dissidents.\u201d In his last televised speech to the nation in December 2012, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez called on his followers to preserve the movement\u2019s unity above all else. Yet since his death the following March, after a long battle with cancer, the top levels of government have increasingly been split among rival factions \u2014 a splintering that the election debacle seems likely to widen. \u201cCh\u00e1vez was in charge,\u201d said Jorge Giordani, the late president\u2019s longtime planning minister and economic guru, who spoke at the news conference with Mr. Navarro. \u201cNow everyone is in charge. Because there is a crisis of power.\u201dHe said that each faction inside the government was looking to defend its own interests \u201cwith their knives between their teeth.\u201d He warned that things would get worse after the election. \u201cThere are even more groups!\u201d he shouted. \u201cBecause no one can stand it anymore!\u201d After the Maduro supporters burst in, Mr. Giordani walked down a back staircase, through a kitchen and into a restaurant of the hotel where the news conference took place. One man called for a broom to bar the restaurant\u2019s doors to protect Mr. Giordani. Then he was shepherded out a back door and into the street where he met up with Mr. Navarro. Both men, leftist icons in their time, were fired from the government after Mr. Maduro was elected to replace Mr. Ch\u00e1vez. They are among a small number of former officials who have openly criticized Mr. Maduro\u2019s leadership \u2014 and been ostracized for doing so. Mr. Navarro was kicked out of the top ranks of the United Socialist Party for defending Mr. Giordani after he had released a letter critical of the government. On Tuesday, neither of them mentioned Mr. Maduro by name, although they repeatedly appeared to allude to him in their criticism.They accused the government of widespread corruption and nepotism, and Mr. Navarro said that he and Mr. Giordani had repeatedly warned that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s movement was headed in the wrong direction. But to hear Mr. Maduro talk, Chavismo\u2019s historic losses were not his fault. The president was praised for going on television immediately after the initial results were announced early Monday to accept his party\u2019s defeat \u2014 the opposition won a commanding two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly. But since then he has done virtually nothing to suggest that he accepts responsibility for the loss or intends to work with the opposition-controlled Assembly, which is to be sworn in Jan. 5.His tone has turned ominous. In a speech outside the presidential palace on Wednesday, Mr. Maduro cast the opposition victory as a victory for \u201cthe fascist right wing,\u201d with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leftist revolution on the other side. \u201cEither we get out of this quagmire through the route of revolution or Venezuela will enter into a great conflict that will affect all of Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d he said.The night before, on his weekly television program, he outlined a series of steps he would take to block the incoming legislature from pursuing its agenda. He vowed to sign a decree barring the firing of public employees for the next three years and said he would block the incoming lawmakers from freeing political prisoners like Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a political party leader who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in antigovernment protests last year. The election hinged on the nation\u2019s disastrous economy, with triple-digit inflation, a deep recession, shortages and long lines to buy food and other basics. But rather than acknowledge errors in government policy, Mr. Maduro has blamed the defeat on what he has called an economic war waged against the government by shadowy capitalist enemies. That is a continuation of the party\u2019s main message during the campaign, which failed to persuade voters.And he has continued the scare tactics used during the campaign, accusing the opposition of planning to revoke a law protecting workers\u2019 rights and to eliminate social programs \u2014 which the incoming lawmakers have denied they intend to do. Rather than propose changes to economic policy, Mr. Maduro suggested on Tuesday that the problem was that the party had not gotten its message across, and he said he would print and distribute up to three million posters of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to cheer up his followers. But there were more menacing signs as well. \u201cI ask anyone who is thinking of holding a press conference, think of the morale of the people,\u201d Mr. Maduro said during his Tuesday program, apparently a reference to the news conference called for the next day by Mr. Giordani and Mr. Navarro. Then he stared and pointed into the camera and said: \u201cThat\u2019s for you. He knows who I\u2019m taking about. Don\u2019t go dividing the people.\u201d He said he had doubts about whether to continue a housing program because some of the people who had received government-built apartments were \u201ccelebrating and dancing over the opposition victory.\u201d There were other moments that seemed to reflect pure pique. Appearing on Mr. Maduro\u2019s television program, Diosdado Cabello, the current head of the National Assembly, said he would transfer the ownership of a television station and a radio station operated by the Assembly to the employees who work there. The move was meant to prevent the incoming lawmakers from taking over the stations, which currently operate as blatant propaganda arms for the socialist party and the Maduro government.Mr. Maduro also announced that he had signed a decree to transfer to a foundation ownership of the Caracas fort where Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s tomb is on display and which has been converted into a shrine to the leader \u2014 to keep the new Assembly from trying to close it.At one point during the program, Mr. Maduro, his vice president, the defense minister and a group of uniformed military officers all stood around Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s tomb with their hands resting palms down on its stone surface, in an unsettling image that evoked a s\u00e9ance.

{"Headline": "Video Review: The New Audi TT Still a Fun Dash Down the Road", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenWHEN Audi unleashed the production model TT in 2000, it was a Bauhaus sight to behold. Gloriously exposed hex screw heads and aluminum accents were crafted into an instrument that celebrated the raw beauty of machinery. Its design attitude was in stark contrast to Audi\u2019s modern minimalist approach.It was a sporty car, not a sports car.Generation 3 arrives in coupe or roadster form looking more refined, or sterile, depending on your eye. Hints of the original TT design remain, but the gravity of Audi\u2019s family look has pulled on TT. As the Borg in \u201cStar Trek\u201d say: \u201cResistance is futile.\u201dCertainly, the TT\u2019s big brother, the R8, is a big influence, and not just in the sheet metal (actually, most of the body is aluminum). The latest TT is more athletic. It doesn\u2019t enjoy the performance of the R8, but starting at around $44,000, it doesn\u2019t torpedo your bank account either.Riding on the MQB platform of its Volkswagen parent, a 2-liter turbo 4-cylinder with 220 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque spins all four wheels. Full engine torque can be sent to the front or rear axles. Front drive is not an option in the United States; neither is a manual transmission. American owners will get a 6-speed dual clutch automatic with paddle shifters. Performance dynamics can be customized down to a rear-wheel-drive bias and throatier engine note.There\u2019s a bit of turbo lag at launch; Audi claims the dash from 0 to 60 miles per hour takes 5.3 seconds. Combined with assured handling, TT is a temptress. The government rates its fuel economy at 23 miles per gallon in the city and 30 highway on preferred premium. The result of way too much fun, my 22-m.p.g. average comes as no shock.I don\u2019t recall the last generation TT being so much fun to drive. The new model clings to curves without drama, with electric power steering that transmits road feel, which is no small trick. Not as rowdy as a Miata, the Audi goes about its corner-carving in a more genteel and composed manner. With optional 19-inch wheels, the reasonable comfort gives way to a flinty ride on broken pavement.Stomp on the excellent brakes repeatedly and you\u2019ll smell the binders. Move up to the TT S for larger brakes and adaptive suspension.Inside, the expected Audi level of materials won\u2019t disappoint. It may appear a tad Spartan, in part because of the seeming elimination of climate controls and a center interface screen. Climate controls have been integrated into the vents (same with the heated seat buttons). Brilliant. Center stack screen information is relocated into a reconfigurable LCD screen filling the entire gauge hood. This is good \u2014 and bad. Keeping everything in view of the driver makes it tough for passengers to choose radio stations or set navigation. And the steering wheel spokes can block the rearview camera display. (The camera requires a $3,200 package. Boo, hiss.)There\u2019s a back seat. Kind of. Even small children, forced to sit bolt upright, will see it as a punishment for not eating their vegetables. With the back seating usable (a term used optimistically), two decent-size suitcases will wedge into the trunk. Drop the rear seats to create the cargo space of some midsize sport utility vehicles.Want to see the sky? Buy the roadster, because there\u2019s no sunroof option. As tested, the TT just crosses the $50,000 threshold. That buys a sports car, yes, a sports car that\u2019s full of fun and innovation. The visual charm of the first generation is gone, though. That\u2019s progress for you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Singapore", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate14 PhotosA THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH SEA VIEWS IN SENTOSA COVE$5.5 MILLIONThis three-bedroom four-bath condominium is on the seventh floor of the Seascape complex in Sentosa Cove, a 10-year-old master-planned development built around a 400-berth marina. The project is part of Sentosa Island, a 1,236-acre leisure development with resorts, golf courses, beaches and a Universal Studios theme park, about a 15-minute drive from the center of Singapore. Seascape, which was completed in 2012, has 151 apartments in two eight-story buildings, with an underground parking garage and a landscaped \u201cforest pool.\u201d The complex has unobstructed panoramic sea views, said Vienn Leow, senior manager with Knight Frank Singapore, the real estate agency listing the property.This 2,164-square-foot apartment has a private elevator. The entranceway leads to a living area with marble floors and floor-to-ceiling windows. Sliding doors open to a broad half-circle balcony with views of the cove and nearby islands. A dining area off the living room features a cooking area, separate from the kitchen, with an oven, a wine cooler, a sink and a counter for serving. The kitchen has a refrigerator, a dishwasher and a laundry area. A separate staff room with its own bathroom is off the kitchen. The master bedroom is across the hallway from the dining room and kitchen. This bedroom has hardwood floors, its own balcony and a private bathroom with a separate bathtub and shower.The hallway leads to two more bedrooms and two bathrooms. One of the bedrooms has private access to a bathroom. Both bedrooms open onto a balcony with views of the surrounding neighborhood.The furniture is not included in the sales price, although fixtures such as lights, curtains and appliances are, Ms. Leow said. Building amenities include a workout room, manicured gardens and an ocean terrace for residents. A paved trail runs along the waterfront.MARKET OVERVIEWSingapore was one of the hottest \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 international markets from 2008 to 2013, when prices increased almost 80 percent, according to government data. But prices have slid in the last two years, after the government imposed restrictions on mortgages and placed additional taxes on purchases by foreigners to cool the market.Prices fell 4 percent in 2014 and are expected to end 2015 down another 4 percent, according to analysts. The number of sales of private residential units fell to 3,496 in the first six months of 2015, a 21 percent drop from the same period a year earlier, according to JLL Singapore, a property consultancy.Sales have been increasing in recent months, but the number of transactions in November was still down 76 percent from the peak in 2010, said Samuel Eyo, managing director of Singapore Christie\u2019s International Real Estate.There is still a large supply of empty new homes, completed during the building boom, which is depressing prices, according to agents. The vacancy rate for new homes was almost 8 percent at the end of the third quarter, according to data tracked by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, a government agency.Sentosa Cove, which targets international buyers, is one of the neighborhoods where prices have declined \u201csignificantly,\u201d Mr. Eyo said. In some projects, prices are down more than 35 percent from the peak, he said.But Sentosa remains one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Singapore. Apartments in the Seascape complex, where this apartment is, typically sell for $5 million to $5.3 million, Ms. Leow said. She was not able to say how many have been sold there. Transactions are down in Sentosa Cove in the last year, but the steep discounts are starting to attract more interest from potential buyers, agents said. There is also speculation that the government may ease some of the cooling measures in the future, which would spur sales.WHO BUYS IN SINGAPOREAt the peak of the market, the majority of international buyers in Singapore were investors looking to quickly resell for a profit, agents say. Chinese were the most active international buyers, followed by buyers from Malaysia and Indonesia.But today local residents are the dominant buyers. The taxes added by the government have discouraged international investors, said Donald Han, managing director of the Singapore office of Chestertons, a real estate company. \u201cThese investors can look elsewhere, and a lot have gone into London, Tokyo, Sydney and Melbourne,\u201d Mr. Han said.But the high taxes are not discouraging some wealthy buyers, who are attracted by Singapore\u2019s stable economy and international business. Singapore Christie\u2019s participated in the sale of a townhouse in central Singapore in the third quarter of 2015 to a Hong Kong resident for 21 million Singapore dollars, or about $14.9 million, Mr. Eyo said. BUYING BASICSSingapore is a transparent market, with most laws following the British legal system, Mr. Han said.Property is split into two categories: landed properties, which are typically single-family homes; and non-landed homes, such as condominiums and apartments. Non-Singapore residents cannot buy landed property in Singapore without special approval, except in Sentosa Cove, the one area where foreigners are allowed to buy both landed and non-landed homes.Mortgages are typically available for up to 80 percent of the sales price of a buyer\u2019s first purchase of a property; the loan-to-value drops subsequently. For instance, it is capped at 50 percent for a second purchase. WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESEnglish, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil; Singapore dollar (1 Singapore dollar = $0.71)TAXES AND FEESFor non-Singapore residents, various fees and taxes can add as much as 18 percent to the price of a home in Singapore. For sellers, there is no capital gains tax on the profit, but there is an added stamp duty ranging from 4 percent to 16 percent if a property is resold within four years of the purchase.An annual property tax is assessed based on the annual value of the property, calculated by the potential rental revenue, and whether it is owner-occupied or offered as a rental. The annual tax on this apartment is likely about $5,000 a year if it is owner-occupied, Ms. Leow estimated. There is a monthly building maintenance fee of about $695 (980 Singapore dollars). Nonresidents are charged a 20 percent tax on net rental income.CONTACTAdvertisement"}

He wore jeans to work and was able to do his job largely free of the red tape that could entangle those who worked in other parts of the financial sector. As a hedge fund guy, he had the sexiest job on Wall Street.\u201cYou were part of the coolest fraternity on campus,\u201d said Mr. Duff, who no longer works in finance.Consider the post-graduation jobs of Harvard Business School students. The number who said they would like to work for a hedge fund is 5 percent, a figure that has stayed flat for half a decade, said Timothy Butler, the school\u2019s senior adviser to career and professional development. The number of graduates accepting positions in the technology sector has risen to 20 percent, a level not seen since the late-\u201990s tech bubble.\u201cThe media is full of stories about start-ups and the big companies that are changing the world,\u201d Dr. Butler said. \u201cIt seems tremendously exciting.\u201dAnthony Scaramucci, who runs SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm, has noticed the trend. \u201cWhat is more fashionable now is to work at an Internet or social media company, more so than a hedge fund,\u201d he said.Played by Steve Carell and Christian Bale, they rake in billions before the credits roll, but their victory is bittersweet. Their success depends on the American economy\u2019s failure, and the film\u2019s director, Adam McKay, offsets their triumph with images of laid-off workers, empty McMansions and a working-class family drummed out of its home.The socially awkward men played by Mr. Carell and Mr. Bale lack the charisma of Gordon Gekko, the slick-haired protagonist played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film \u201cWall Street.\u201d Gekko may have been intended as a villain, but he seemed to be having more fun than those who played by the rules, and he served as a role model to the young people of that era who had dollar signs in their eyes.It\u2019s telling that the coolest character in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d the one with the sharp one-liners and sharper suits (played by the hunky Ryan Gosling) is not a hedge funder but an investment banker.Although the numbers-crunching hedgies may see themselves as the finance world\u2019s avant-garde, the public, and Hollywood, has always had a sneaking fondness for Wall Street wolves.Figures of that kind were like a blinking neon sign for would-be titans like Mr. Duff, who had his fun before washing out after two rehab stints.

{"Headline": "U.S. Tightens Visa-Waiver Program in Bid to Deter Militants", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The White House announced changes Monday to the government\u2019s visa-waiver program to try to stop those who have visited conflict zones from easily boarding American-bound commercial flights, a move intended to prevent an attack in the United States similar to the ones that struck Paris.But the new measures \u2014 which include potentially higher fines for airlines that fail to verify their passengers\u2019 identities and increased information-sharing between countries \u2014 are limited, and White House officials acknowledged that they would need Congress to pass legislation to further tighten controls.Congressional Republican leaders announced Monday that they would pursue more potent legislation to toughen the waiver program.The visa-waiver program also dwarfs the refugee plan, allowing 20 million foreigners a year to travel to the United States without being interviewed at American consulates and embassies. It covers 38 countries, mainly European but also allies such as Japan, Australia, Chile and New Zealand.Unlike the screening of refugees, which requires several in-person interviews and an extensive background check that can take more than a year, the visa waivers rely on computerized programs to quickly clear travelers on flights bound for the United States. According to a 2012 government audit, about 2 percent of travelers \u2014 or about 364,000 people in 2010 \u2014 had gotten into the country without the required verification.After the Paris attacks, lawmakers and Republican presidential candidates have focused on the program to allow 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States, saying it could easily be exploited by Islamic State terrorists. At least one of the militants who died in the attacks may have posed as a refugee to get into Europe from Syria.While cracks in the visa-waiver program are worrisome to national security officials, business leaders see the program as a boon to tourism and the economy. Foreign tourists who come to the United States under the program are estimated to spend as much as $100 billion a year, and advocates argue that tightening the program would deter tourism, a concern the White House shares. American tourists get similar waivers to travel to Europe and other friendly countries.\u201cIt is something that facilitates important international travel,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Monday. \u201cIt does facilitate the kind of travel that has a positive impact on our economy.\u201dBut both parties see reason to tighten restrictions. The Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, Mr. Rhodes said, demonstrated that the Islamic State was increasingly focused on targets outside Syria, so the United States must be more careful about screening travelers.The administration will now require countries to ask travelers to the United States whether they have traveled to conflict zones.\u201cWhat they envision with this proposal are countries like Iraq and Syria,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. A trip to either country would bar passengers from automatic entry to the United States, officials said.The enhanced measures also include American assistance to other countries to ease the sharing of information about passengers. And the Department of Homeland Security will deploy teams of agents abroad who specialize in tracking foreign fighters.The secretary of homeland security, Jeh Johnson, will ask Congress for the authority to increase fines against airlines to $50,000, from $5,000, for failing to verify a traveler\u2019s passport, the administration said. The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security have been asked to study the waiver program and report to the president in two months.The House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, said Monday that Republicans would push their own changes, which would include requiring that all visa-waiver countries issue electronic passports with built-in computer chips, that they report all lost and stolen passports to Interpol, and that passenger lists be screened against the Interpol database of missing passports.The measures announced by the White House strike the right balance between economics and national security, said James Carafano, a scholar at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation who has studied the waiver program. He said the measures represent a modest tightening of restrictions without threatening tourism.\u201cYou want to do this in ways that don\u2019t confuse or upset travelers,\u201d Mr. Carafano said. And the chances of a terrorist using the program to make it into the country remain minuscule, he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m a terrorist, I\u2019ll walk across the Canadian border \u2014 my odds are better.\u201dVulnerabilities in the waiver program have been a longstanding concern at the F.B.I., the director, James B. Comey, told reporters after the Paris attacks.Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. was particularly concerned about Europeans who go to Syria to fight with the Islamic State, then return to Europe and are just \u201ca visa-waiver trip away\u201d from getting into the United States.\u201cThat remains, obviously, a focus of our work,\u201d he said.Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said homeland security officials continually looked for ways to improve safeguards in the waiver program and \u201cto maintain control over it.\u201dOfficials said the Department of Homeland Security was working with other countries to add more personal information about passengers to their screening programs. And the government has formed \u201cforeign fighter surge teams\u201d to work with countries to prevent militants from traveling to the United States, although officials did not explain what such teams do.Mr. Earnest expressed frustration that Congress had failed to pass legislation that would bolster the safety of the visa-waiver program, including by passing a law that would bar anyone on the government\u2019s no-fly list from buying weapons in the United States and by increasing funding for the screening program already in place.Gardiner Harris reported from Paris, and Michael S.

Witnesses have testified that the bribes were used to finance her presidential campaign, a claim she denies. And voters across the nation are indignant, with many contending that she deliberately misled them about the depth of the nation\u2019s economic problems during her 2014 re-election bid.With no testimony surfacing to indicate that Ms. Rousseff took any bribes herself, Mr. Cunha, the conservative house speaker, opted to move ahead with the case involving the use of funds from state banks.But Mr. Cunha has earned plenty of ire as well. Critics say he is pushing impeachment to exact revenge against the president after legislators in her leftist Workers Party moved this week to seek his ouster as speaker.The battle over the impeachment proceedings could last months, consuming the authorities at a time when Brazil\u2019s economic crisis is growing more severe. But the political infighting had already taken a toll on the nation\u2019s ability to confront the tumbling economy, with congressional leaders repeatedly blocking approval of the president\u2019s proposed austerity measures this year.\u201cThe start of the impeachment on the basis of Cunha\u2019s personal vengeance crowns a year marked by the irresponsibility of the principal political players,\u201d said Bernardo Mello Franco, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.Others go further, calling into question the Federal Court of Accounts, the auditing body tied to Brazil\u2019s Congress that ruled against Ms. Rousseff over her handling of funds from large state banks.In fact, it is hard to find a political institution in Brazil whose standing has not been damaged by corruption battles, regardless of where its leaders stand in the ideological spectrum.As the impeachment battle gets underway, some Brazilians say that the proceedings are less about corruption than the competition for political power. Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, a political risk consultant in Bras\u00edlia, said that the fight around impeachment could drag on for as long as seven months.\u201cEvery political party that we have is despicable,\u201d said Moura Ferreira, 53, a security guard in a shopping center here in Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Ferreira said that he doubted that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment would improve prospects for ordinary Brazilians.\u201cThe economy is terrible, and political instability contributes to that,\u201d said Mr. Ferreira, noting that he disapproved of Ms. Rousseff but also doubted the motives of her opponents. \u201cIf Dilma is forced to leave,\u201d he added, referring to the president by her first name, \u201cthe instability will continue.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They were targeting civic pluralism and street life: a kind of urban compact they loathed and feared, but whose fissures, however subterranean, they could exploit.With its bobo bars toward one end and Muslim enclave at the other, Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud is Paris in a nutshell. People live together on the street, but separately. Vee Gomes, a Dutch-born hairstylist, tells a story about setting up her business on Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud a couple of years ago. \u201cI opened my shop between two other hairdressers,\u201d she recalled one recent afternoon, sitting at an inlaid wood table, piled with books, near the front of Vee Hair. \u201cI thought they would be furious.\u201dBut, Ms. Gomes said, \u201cthat\u2019s not how it turned out.\u201dThe shops, though steps from one another, turned out to occupy separate worlds and serve separate clients whose paths hardly crossed. \u201cWe have different clients, different prices, different styles,\u201d she said.So it is with life on the street at large, which Jean-Louis Cohen, a French architectural historian, described as \u201ca lively place where Parisians and many people have lived forever.\u201d Mr. Cohen remembers, as a young man, prowling the Marxist book sales at the former metalworkers union headquarters on the street. Now, gentrification is the big threat. \u201cIt\u2019s still a mixed street, not too touristic, like the Marais, which is becoming sterile,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a notion that all French social housing is in the suburbs, but this is an area that has social housing alongside bourgeois housing.\u201dThat said, a mosaic is not a melting pot. Coexistence and integration are not the same. After all, while the old Jacobin ideal of French republicanism imagines a colorblind nation based on liberty and equality, on the ground, the country remains a patchwork of racial divisions and other boundaries, visible and not. Headlines lately have fixated on borders: the ones colonial powers drew in the Middle East after World War I; the ones the Islamic State militant group has redrawn in Syria and Iraq; the ones Europeans now debate closing.But most borders in cities are invisible. They are porous, shifting, forever being negotiated and renegotiated, block by block.To walk along Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud today is to find a mix of peoples and borders. A big blue, white and red banner hangs across the Omar mosque. \u201cNot in My Name,\u201d it says. Soldiers stand outside Jewish schools around the corner on Rue Saint-Maur, stamping their feet against the cold. Like much of Paris, this part of the city maintains a proud and uneasy equilibrium that now passes for normal.A storekeeper at a bookshop, Al-Azhar \u2014 which, like the half-dozen or so other bookshops and Islamic clothing stores clustered around the mosque, sells prayer mats, incense and candy \u2014 said, \u201cSince the attack, people in the neighborhood look differently at us.\u201d He declined to give his name.On Friday afternoons, hundreds of men \u2014 the overflow crowd from the mosque \u2014 pray outdoors, in the middle of Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, on the little square facing the stores, with a few congregants keeping a wary eye on passers-by.\u201cWe don\u2019t want trouble,\u201d the storekeeper at Al-Azhar said.\u201cIt\u2019s not his responsibility to police everybody who goes there to pray,\u201d said Bernard Godard, a political scientist in France\u2019s Interior Ministry, who specializes in Paris\u2019s Arab communities and has been studying Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud since the 1970s. \u201cIslam in France is generally conservative and tells Muslims to respect the Quran, even to be opposed to certain ways of life in France. But that doesn\u2019t mean to be violent.\u201cThe typical French person thinks that this mosque is radical because it is fundamentalist,\u201d Mr. Godard added. \u201cThe Muslims on Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud exist side by side with the bobos and everybody else. The street is neutral ground.\u201dUp to a point, anyway. Philippe Mourrat directs the Maison des M\u00e9tallos, a city-run culture center directly across the street from the mosque, in what used to be the metalworkers union headquarters where Mr. Cohen went book shopping. The center hosts lectures on climate change and evenings of calypso dancing. Five years ago, two men poured gasoline over an Algerian playwright, Rayhana, who had been hired by the M\u00e9tallos to present a play about women in the Maghreb. Bertrand Delano\u00eb, then Paris\u2019s mayor, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand, then France\u2019s culture minister, expressed outrage. The attackers, who failed to set Rayhana on fire, were never caught.Mr. Mourrat cast that event as an exception in the neighborhood. During a recent Ramadan, he pointed out, men praying at the Omar mosque rushed to defend a patron who was mugged as he left the M\u00e9tallos.But Mr. Godard said he saw that episode differently, as an example of growing tensions over gentrification. For many years, the area was home to small-time craftsmen and industrial warehouses. It was a working-class hub and immigrant magnet. Jews from the Alsace region moved to Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud before World War I. Marc B\u00e9darida, an architect who settled on Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud in the early 1980s, remembers that the storefront on the ground floor of his handsome 1840s apartment building, which now houses a fancy hairdresser, used to be a wholesaler of doorknobs. The chain-store grocery across the street used to be a warehouse for industrial shelving.Factory jobs attracted waves of postwar immigrants from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia; some Chinese, too. Jean-Pierre Timbaud was a labor leader murdered by the Nazis. He headed the metalworkers union in a former piano factory.There are many beautiful industrial buildings up and down the street. They fell vacant when the economy collapsed and jobs dried up, leaving behind 1970s social housing and prime real estate for the creative classes. The architect Jean Nouvel opened his office just off the street in 1994 in a former workshop for making bags; his longtime assistant, Charlotte Kruk, recalled the other day that it had been a ramshackle site with dead pigeons on the floor.Now, the area is a little reminiscent of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s in the 1970s, or the East Village of the 1980s, with all that foretells. \u201cIt\u2019s a district of advertisers, designers, graphic artists,\u201d Mr. Nouvel said. \u201cYou have bars and cafes, but not yet for the very rich. So it\u2019s a hybrid situation, a kind of meeting place for lots of different types of Parisians \u2014 although with apartments becoming very expensive, you see changes. The Muslim population is decreasing.\u201dThe other morning, I stopped in to Kol Yehouda, a bookstore on Rue Saint-Maur, just around the corner from the Omar mosque. The young salesman would give only his surname, Cohen. He said Jewish residents in the neighborhood used the market that opens at one end of Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud on Saturdays and Sundays. \u201cWe see each other; we don\u2019t talk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s calm and normal.\u201dRue Saint-Maur roughly marks the present tide of gentrification where it crosses Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud. Bobo bars, so called because of their \u201cbourgeois bohemian\u201d clientele, have crept up to Saint-Maur, but only a few share the Muslim area: among them the Caf\u00e9 Cannibale, where you can order Norwegian brunch and Japanese whiskey, and where old men from the neighborhood read the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration over coffee at the zinc bar.Farther down the block, market stalls sell fruits and espadrilles under ranks of colored umbrellas and corrugated metal roofs along Boulevard Richard-Lenoir, another invisible border of sorts. At the far end of Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, bankers and hedge fund guys are moving into apartments.\u201cThe Paris that most Americans know is not this place,\u201d Ms. Gomes, the hairdresser, said. \u201cThey know the Marais and the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and\u201d \u2014 she wrinkled her brow, as if trying to retrieve some obscure name \u2014 \u201cSaint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s.\u201d\u201cHere,\u201d she said, \u201cyou find locals, architects, actors, people with cash.\u201dMuslims and Jews, too, I said, who have been around longer.\u201cI have Jewish and Muslim clients,\u201d Ms. Gomes replied. \u201cWe live on the same street. But we don\u2019t mix. That\u2019s Paris, no?\u201dShe waved through the storefront window. \u201cWe are all together, on our own, and wave to each other.\u201dPierre Desorgues contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin Chides Turkey, Praises Trump and Talks Up Russia\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUsing a crude expression to describe the Turks as ingratiating themselves with Washington, he said perhaps they \u201cwanted to lick the Americans in a certain place.\u201dThe Russian leader was alternately pugnacious and conciliatory during the news conference, which was more than three hours long. In years past, he has had sharp words for Washington, but this time he praised the efforts of Secretary of State John Kerry to find a political solution to the war in Syria.Mr. Putin also veered close to an admission that Russian soldiers had fought in the war in eastern Ukraine, saying, \u201cWe never said there were no people there solving certain questions, including in the military sphere,\u201d but he denied that they were on active duty with the regular army.\u201cGet a sense of that distinction,\u201d he said.He even gave a few hints of his closely guarded family life, talking proudly of his two adult daughters, who he said were living in Russia and \u201ctaking the first steps of their careers.\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt that he is a very bright and talented man,\u201d the Russian leader said. \u201cIt is not our business to assess his merits; that is up to the U.S. voters. But he is an absolute leader of the presidential race.\u201d In Russian, the word for \u201cbright\u201d has several meanings, including outstanding, brilliant and even gaudy.He went out of his way to say that Russia\u2019s economy had hit bottom this year, and that it was now bouncing back \u2014 though independent economists and even Russia\u2019s central bank, in a report issued this month, have contested that view.At times, Mr. Putin sugarcoated grim economic news Russians were bound to discover in any case. While the government might soon lift the retirement age to save money, that is cause for celebration, he said, because Russians are now living longer \u2014 to an average age of 71.Mr. Putin backpedaled on his prediction a year ago that Russia would pull out of its current slump within two years, and blamed the tumble in oil prices. \u201cAfter this fall in prices in energy resources, all the indicators slipped,\u201d he said.Despite the recession, Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity remains extraordinarily high, with support above 80 percent in some polls. While the economy is biting at home, even as Mr. Putin pursues a swaggering foreign policy, the hardship has not yet translated into widespread political discontent.Surveys and the answers to questions posed to focus groups show that the pillars of Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity shifted in early 2014, just before the current downturn. Russians now say they admire Mr. Putin more for a role as a \u201cprotector\u201d from external threats than for the role of \u201cprovider,\u201d a study by an influential Russian sociologist, Mikhail E. Dmitriyev, concluded this year.Over the years, these events have provided a chronicle of Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy thinking as it grew progressively anti-interventionist.In 2008, he complained bitterly about the United States\u2019 backing independence for Kosovo, and railed about Washington\u2019s propensity to intervene in countries\u2019 internal affairs where and when it sees fit. \u201cWe are told all the time, \u2018Kosovo is a special case,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cIt is all lies. There is no special case, and everybody understands it perfectly well.\u201dHe propounded the same anti-interventionist theme in later years in the case of Libya, where he was embittered at having been misled into supporting a \u201chumanitarian\u201d intervention that ended up in what he saw as a disastrous exercise in regime change.\u201cNo matter how they explained their position, the state is falling apart,\u201d he said in 2012. \u201cInterethnic, interclan and intertribal conflicts continue.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd you want us to constantly repeat these mistakes in other countries?\u201dHe argued against intervention by outside powers in Syria as well, adding that Russia was \u201cnot concerned with the fate\u201d of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.\u201cOf course, changes are being demanded, but it\u2019s something else that concerns \u2014 what will happen next?\u201dMr. Putin brushed aside a question about the cost to Russia\u2019s struggling economy of the bombing campaign in Syria. It would be paid for, he said, out of the Defense Ministry\u2019s training budget.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a better training drill,\u201d he said of the bombing in Syria.Since Turkey shot down a Russian warplane that it said had violated its airspace, Mr. Putin has engaged in a war of words with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and ordered a number of retaliatory measures. On Thursday, he made clear that Russia has made Syria a no-fly zone for Turkish airplanes.\u201cTurkey used to violate Syrian airspace all the time,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cLet them try and fly there now,\u201d he said, noting that Russia\u2019s most advanced air defense system, the S-400, can hit any target in Syria.Russia under Mr. Putin has deployed its military in several countries, and at one point on Thursday the president suffered a slip of the tongue in answering a question about Georgia, where Russia fought a war in 2008 and later recognized two separatist regions.\u201cConcerning the territorial integrity of Ukraine, ah, excuse me, of Georgia. ... \u201d he said, going on to say that the breakup of Georgia was the fault of that country\u2019s former leaders, not of Russia.Speaking about his daughters, he said that they \u201chave never lived in the limelight\u201d but that they speak three European languages that they use \u201cin their daily work.\u201d He did not directly deny reports published this year that the pair held jobs at Russian universities.Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shenzhen Landslide Casts Shadow Over China\u2019s Success Story", "Date": "2015-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHENZHEN, China \u2014 With little more than an architect\u2019s drawing and a sales pitch to go by, Tim Chen paid around $500,000 last month for a small apartment being built above a shopping mall on the outskirts of this southern Chinese metropolis.\u201cI wanted to grab a larger unit in the first batch that went on sale, but I didn\u2019t grab fast enough,\u201d he said in the lobby of the development\u2019s salesroom, echoing an urgency that has gripped many buyers in recent months.Even as the broader Chinese economy has slowed and as housing values have slumped across much of China, the Shenzhen juggernaut has barreled ahead. High-tech start-ups replaced the factories that had made the city a pioneering showcase of Chinese-style capitalism. Millions of young people moved here from across the country. Construction is everywhere, with prices of new homes surging.In Jiazitang village, on the outskirts of Shenzhen, Li Xiuhua, a 21-year-old migrant worker, complained on Wednesday about a deserted construction project next door.\u201cNo one seems to care about this construction site anymore,\u201d Ms. Li said, pointing to the heaps of rubble and construction waste alongside the road. \u201cSince I moved here two years ago, the construction has been stopped and no one has come to clear away this waste.\u201dA landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.The landslide in Shenzhen casts a dark shadow over what had come to epitomize the China story, a gleaming metropolis of 11 million people, where only 3.3 million are registered as locals. The migrant city, which did not exist a few decades ago, even seemed to defy the country\u2019s current economic problems.In November, prices of new homes contracted in 49 of the 70 cities included in the main official survey of the market, data released on Friday showed. Prices in metropolises like Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai fared better than in most places, rising 8 percent to 13 percent from a year earlier.But Shenzhen is in a category of its own. Home prices soared 44 percent last month, the fastest rise in any Chinese city since the official survey began in its current form, in 2011.The property market has become a vexing political issue at the highest levels. This month, the Politburo of the governing Communist Party announced plans to address an enormous housing overstock nationally, including relaxing restrictions on internal migration to help create demand for homes in outlying cities.But the frenzy in Shenzhen highlights the difficulties that China faces as it tries to manage a crucial engine of the economy.On Sunday, a man-made hill of dirt and construction debris collapsed in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.Compared with the rest of China, \u201cShenzhen has a much higher reputation for dotting its i\u2019s and crossing its t\u2019s, and being much more business-friendly,\u201d said Christopher Balding, an associate professor at Peking University HSBC Business School who has been based in Shenzhen for nearly seven years. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m not surprised something like this happened, because even in Shenzhen buildings are just flying up.\u201dShenzhen is the ultimate symbol of modern China\u2019s economic transformation.The city, which was only a coastal fishing village when the country started reopening to the world in the late 1970s, leapfrogged ahead of China\u2019s other metropolises on the path of capitalism thanks to its status as a special economic zone, separated from the rest of the country by an internal border. Tax breaks, cheap land and proximity to Hong Kong lured foreign investment. Many millions of migrants from other parts of China provided an able supply of low-cost labor.In recent years, the area has also transitioned more smoothly than others to the latest phase in China\u2019s development, a growth model that revolves around services and consumer spending. The factories churning out lower-value products like garments and shoes are closing down, relocating inland or heading to cheaper destinations like Southeast Asia and Bangladesh.The transformation is evident in places like Longhua, where the housing development Unitown is under construction. For decades, the district was part of greater Shenzhen. But it sat on the less-developed side of the internal border that separated the core economic zone downtown from the rest of the city, a barrier that migrant workers from outside Shenzhen were restricted from crossing.But in the five years since Shenzhen\u2019s internal border controls were abandoned, Longhua evolved into a thriving residential suburb.An office worker who would provide only her given name, Xia, recently bought a large three-bedroom apartment at Unitown. She and her husband are upgrading from a smaller unit in the same district, where she has lived for about a decade. Their son will be able to walk to school in a few minutes.\u201cWe only looked for apartments in Longhua, because it\u2019s so convenient,\u201d she said. Because of rapidly rising prices, she had to take out a larger mortgage. \u201cThat puts a lot of pressure on me,\u201d Xia said.Shenzhen\u2019s housing market has always been considerably more volatile than that of most of the rest of the country.China\u2019s central bank moved in March to ease restrictions in most cities that require buyers of second homes to make a down payment of up to 70 percent of the value of the home, lowering the threshold to 40 percent. But in first-tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen, where housing demand remains high, those restrictions are supposed to remain largely in place.However, in interviews, many real estate agents and home buyers in Shenzhen said those restrictions had generally been relaxed for people who are buying a second home because they intended to upgrade.\u201cShenzhen\u2019s is the freest market in China,\u201d said Zhang Jianwei, a sales agent at Colorful Garden, a new development of more than 500 apartments in the city center.\u201cPrices rise the fastest, but also fall the fastest,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s capitalism first.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research from Shenzhen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Honda Pilot Is Useful Like a Van, but No Longer Square", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenThe Pilot can be ordered with front drive, which starts at $30,895. The only biblical natural event not experienced during my week in it was locusts, so the Elite model\u2019s standard all-wheel drive was welcome. The weather was so bad during my test that I actually used the mud and snow drive modes. There\u2019s no mode for locusts.Slightly larger but some 240 pounds lighter now, the Pilot is quick. On dry pavement, the dash from 0 to 60 miles an hour should take about seven seconds. And while the outgoing Pilot suffered from road noise, this new generation is much more hushed.Every Pilot gets a smooth 3.5-liter 280 horsepower V6 with 262 pound-feet of torque. Lower trim levels shift with a 6-speed automatic with a normal gear selector. The two top models have a push button-activated 9-speed with paddle shifters. I find the niner to be occasionally indecisive. Its button operation takes getting used to.Body movements are well controlled, but the Pilot feels large \u2014 minivan large. It\u2019s comfortable, not sporty, with steering effort on the light side. Visibility is excellent, partly because the Pilot rides high. Again, like a van.Great technology like radar-assisted cruise control is standard on the Elite. So is Lane Keep Assist, with cameras reading the road stripes. If the Pilot wanders out of its lane, the system gently nudges it back and vibrates the steering wheel. It doesn\u2019t beep, so passengers won\u2019t be alerted to sloppy driving.Fuel economy is up by about 2 miles per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which rates the all-wheel-drive models with the 9-speed at a combined 22 m.p.g.The interior is more airy and upscale, though it should at $47,320 as tested. Front chairs in the Elite are heated and vented; the steering wheel is warmed. The large center console top with its midcentury modern design is a solid perch for a purse. Inside, five iPads could be stowed. Adjusting the sound system volume with a touch surface is frustrating. A knob, Honda, give us a knob.The Pilot can seat up to eight, but the Elite is capped at seven. A few passengers found the midrow seats flat. They get rump roasters, though, and children can hook any media device up to the ceiling-mounted display. More important to the parents? A simple touch slides the seats forward for easy access to the third row.Row 3 is mounted low to the floor, meaning knees are high. There are belts for three, but I\u2019d keep it to two.Some competitors activate power lift gates when someone simply stands close to it for a few seconds or waves a foot under the bumper. The Pilot makes you use the latch, which is less handy with full hands. With the third row raised, the Pilot has space for three suitcases or a decent-size cooler. The load floor is reversible from carpet to quick clean plastic. With both rear rows folded, there is an enormous amount of room.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Accord Is a Healing Step, if Not a Cure", "Date": "2015-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisScientists who closely monitored the talks here said it was not the agreement that humanity really needed. By itself, it will not save the planet.The great ice sheets remain imperiled, the oceans are still rising, forests and reefs are under stress, people are dying by tens of thousands in heat waves and floods, and the agriculture system that feeds seven billion human beings is still at risk.\u201cI think this Paris outcome is going to change the world,\u201d said Christopher B. Field, a leading American climate scientist. \u201cWe didn\u2019t solve the problem, but we laid the foundation.\u201dThe agreement reached here on Saturday will, if faithfully carried out, achieve far larger cuts in emissions than any previous climate accord. It will reduce, without eliminating, the risk that runaway climate change might render parts of the Earth uninhabitable. It will lessen somewhat the possibility of a collapse of one of the ice sheets, which would cause a rise in the sea of 20 feet or more.A group of 195 nations reached a landmark climate agreement on Saturday. Here is what it means for the planet, business, politics and other areas.The deal, in short, begins to move the countries of the world in a shared direction that is potentially compatible with maintaining a livable planet over the long term.Hans Joachim Schellnhuber \u2014 a pioneering environmental scientist, chairman of the German government\u2019s advisory committee on climate change, and climate adviser to Pope Francis \u2014 declared on Saturday that \u201cthis is a turning point in the human enterprise, where the great transformation towards sustainability begins.\u201dPerhaps the most important part of the deal is that it explicitly recognizes that countries were not ambitious enough in the emissions cuts they pledged ahead of the Paris negotiations, pledges that were incorporated into the document. The agreement, in effect, criticizes itself for not doing enough.To compensate, the deal sets up a schedule of regular review that will encourage countries to raise their goals over time. It envisions a tighter system to monitor whether the nations are keeping their promises \u2014 though how tough that will really be was put off to future debates.In interviews, scientists with long experience studying climate change, and a long history of being discouraged by the politics of the issue, said they were heartened by the cooperative tone in Paris.But for the deal to mean anything, they said, the celebratory moment must give way immediately to an era in which intensive efforts are made to squeeze emissions out of the world economy. That task will fall largely to businesses and investors, operating under emissions-reduction policies that countries have pledged to put into effect by 2020.Highlights from the final draft text of a climate agreement submitted to the delegates in Paris.Yet 2015 will nonetheless be the hottest year in recorded history, breaking a mark set only one year earlier. All 10 of the hottest years in a global record stretching to 1880 have occurred since 1998. No one under 30 has ever lived through a month of global temperatures below the 20th-century average.Since an agreement in Cancun in 2010, the official goal of international climate policy has been to limit the warming of the Earth to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, above the level that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution. With the rapid warming that has occurred since 1950 as a result of industrial emissions, the planet is already nearly halfway there.The Paris deal sets a more ambitious target, declaring that the global average temperature rise ought to be kept \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius, and that countries should try go further, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.As small as that difference might sound, as an average warming over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually substantial. Scientists say it could make the difference, for example, between saving much of the Greenland ice sheet and losing it.The research organization Climate Central found recently that 280 million people live on land that could eventually be submerged by the sea if warming were allowed to reach the higher number. If it were kept to the lower target, that number would be cut by more than half, to 137 million people.Yet action on global warming has been delayed for so long, and emissions allowed to rise so high, that reaching either target will be exceedingly difficult.Scientists say that limiting warming to the higher target would require that industrial emissions of greenhouse gases come to an end by roughly 2050, and to stay below the lower target, by about 2030.But coal-burning power plants are being built today that can be expected to operate well past 2050, and fossil-fuel companies are spending hundreds of billions a year looking for new reserves that cannot be burned if either target is to be met.A serious campaign to meet the more ambitious goal would mean that in less than two decades, the nations of the world would likely have to bring an end to gasoline cars, to coal- or gas-burning power plants in their current form, and to planes or ships powered by fossil fuels.Countries have offered no plans that would come remotely close to achieving either goal, and, given the current state of technology, it is difficult to see how they could be achieved. That led some scientists on Saturday to dismiss the tighter temperature targets as feel-good measures with no real meaning.And yet, the tighter targets do throw the seriousness of the situation into sharp relief. Experts hope that, by highlighting the gulf between humanity\u2019s stated goals and its plans to achieve them, the Paris deal will launch a more intensive push to figure out how it might actually be done.\u201cWe lost a lot of time squabbling over the science,\u201d Dr. Field said. \u201cWe lost a lot of time that could have been used trying out innovative solutions. Now, we have a lot of experimentation still to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A single shot from Burr\u2019s pistol ended Hamilton\u2019s life. It was the \u201cduel that stunned the nation,\u201d as the novelist and biographer John Sedgwick calls it in his lively, wide-\u00adranging and immensely readable book. The world of \u201cWar of Two\u201d is often more personal than political, an intimate portrait of Hamilton and Burr as they plunged toward their fatal collision.They were veterans of the Revolutionary army, accomplished lawyers and devoted family men whose sexual affairs had become notorious. Both were members of the founding generation, but their trajectories through the young nation could scarcely have been more different.Hamilton, of illegitimate birth in the Caribbean, rose to become a key aide to Gen. George Washington. Soon he was an architect of the new Republic, its defender in The Federalist and its first secretary of the Treasury. Burr\u2019s roots in the colonial aristocracy were deep, but to this cynical, swashbuckling man, the new United States mainly offered avenues for satisfying his own political, financial and sexual appetites.Their fates converged in the election of 1800 when each recklessly tried and failed to sabotage the presidential candidate of his party. They both became political pariahs. And in 1804, their mutual contempt turned deadly. At a dinner in February, a guest recorded Hamilton\u2019s inflammatory description of Burr as \u201cdangerous.\u201d Then word circulated that Hamilton had expressed a \u201cstill more despicable opinion\u201d of him. That was the last straw. Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel.Though dueling was termed an \u201caffair of honor,\u201d Hamilton himself regarded it as the \u201cworst method\u201d to protect a reputation. Indeed, it had become, as the historian Joseph Ellis remarked, \u201ca pathological ritual in which self-proclaimed gentlemen shot each other in juvenile displays of their mutual insecurity.\u201d Hamilton had been devastated by his eldest son\u2019s death in a duel in 1801. Why, then, did he accept Burr\u2019s challenge?With his political career in ruins, finances in tatters, reputation stained by sexual scandals, did he feel compelled to risk his life to protect what was left of his honor? Or did he hope to eliminate Burr from public life, convinced that this unscrupulous rogue undermined all the principles and values of the American experiment? Or were they, as Sedgwick suggests, like \u201ca pair of wolves in a tight cage; \u00adeventually they became all fangs\u201d?On the eve of the duel, Hamilton made the decision to waste his first shot, giving time for Burr, he wrote, to \u201cpause and reflect\u201d \u2014 thus exposing himself to Burr\u2019s fire. \u201cA fatalism that verges on the suicidal,\u201d as Sedgwick puts it. Hamilton died painfully, leaving his wife and seven children to cope with his debts.As for Burr, the killer became a wanted man. Fleeing to the South, he hatched a surreal conspiratorial scheme to seize Western land and turn it into his own personal empire. Acquitted of treason in 1807, he decamped to Europe, returning in 1812 to live out his life in impoverished obscurity.The man he killed achieved an immortal place in the first rank of founders (and is now the subject of a hit Broadway musical). Hamilton was a farsighted modernist who established the Bank of the United States, stabilized the nation\u2019s credit and drew up plans for a diversified industrial economy. More prescient than any of his peers, he envisioned the United States as the great economic and military power it became.For all his audacity, though, Hamilton had spells of self-doubt. In 1780, momentarily despondent, he wrote that he did not feel \u201cfit for this terrestreal Country\u201d and hoped to make \u201ca brilliant exit.\u201d Mission accomplished.WAR OF TWOAlexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and the Duel That Stunned the NationBy John SedgwickIllustrated. 455 pp. Berkley Books. $27.95.Susan Dunn, a professor of humanities at Williams College, is the author of \u201cDominion of Memories: Jefferson, Madison, and the Decline of Virginia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top New York Restaurants of 2015", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review20 PhotosThe new restaurants I reviewed this year gave me a very deep bench from which to pick this year-end list. Ruthlessly, this ranking of my favorites was capped at 10, but I could have stretched it to 15 without any noticeable drop-off in quality.Two places that made the cut, Momofuku Ko and Mission Chinese Food, were transferred from their original sites. They are new restaurants in my book because they have almost nothing in common with their first incarnations. But had I rejected them, I could have made room at the end of the list for, say, Houseman or Rebelle or Untitled at the Whitney or the Clocktower or Chomp Chomp, all places I\u2019ll return to if I ever get a free night.This is a sign of real strength. Before winding down into a disappointingly meager fall season, it was an excellent year for New York restaurants. I suspect that we\u2019ll look back on 2015 as the high-water mark in postrecession dining.Sluggish economies breed cautious restaurants. This year\u2019s crew is anything but. Cosme dared New York to see Mexican food in new ways. (We took the dare.) Momofuku Ko and Mission Chinese Food stretched far beyond anything they\u2019d achieved at their prior addresses. The chef Gabriel Kreuther gambled that his exacting and generous cooking could still lure crowds without the imprimatur of Danny Meyer. Wildair\u2019s owners guessed that the city was ready for a modern wine bar like Manfreds in Copenhagen. Superiority Burger doubled down on the idea that the whiff of Birkenstocks could be expunged from veggie burgers and other crunchy hippie food. Its prices \u2014 nothing over $10 \u2014 are recession-friendly, but its risk-taking spirit is pure 2015.The Restaurants column last Wednesday, which listed Pete Wells\u2019s 10 favorite openings of 2015, misstated the address of Upland.

{"Headline": "Dip in Tourism After Most Attacks Is Short-Lived, Study Says", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesIn the hours after the terror attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, airlines, hotels and travel agencies witnessed a surge in cancellations as anxious visitors sought to avoid the French capital.The attacks, which targeted Parisians and foreigners attending a rock concert or sitting at restaurants and cafes, killed 130 people and wounded hundreds more.They also threatened one of France\u2019s most vital sectors, tourism, as Paris joined a long list of cities where terror struck indiscriminately, like London, Madrid, Beirut in Lebanon and Mumbai in India.But a recent analysis of the impact of terrorist attacks on travel and tourism suggests that the long-term effect is more muted than what occurs after a natural disaster. The finding is significant for France, which is the world\u2019s top tourist destination, with 84 million foreign visitors last year, and where the travel and tourism industry accounts for nearly 9 percent of the country\u2019s economy.London and Madrid, for instance, both had a fast rebound in foreign visitors after they were bombed, according to a study by the World Travel and Tourism Council, a trade group that includes hotel chains, airlines and tour operators.The group found that, on average, it takes about 13 months for tourism to recover after a major terror attack, compared with about 24 months after an environmental disaster.\u201cTerror attacks tend to be very localized, and happen in one place and at one time,\u201d said David Scowsill, the group\u2019s president and chief executive.Olivier Jager, the co-founder and chief executive officer of ForwardKeys, a travel data-analysis company, said that flight cancellations to Paris lasted for about five days after the attacks. Bookings for future trips, in the meantime, had dropped by about a third compared with the same time last year, suggesting that the impact of the attacks might be felt for several months.\u201cTravel, and specifically leisure travel, is very fragile but it is also super-resilient,\u201d Mr. Jager said. \u201cLeisure travelers are not booking today. But it\u2019s not fear, it\u2019s common sense. You can\u2019t blame them.\u201dOther countries, however, have seen sharper declines and are still struggling after repeated attacks that have often been aimed at foreign visitors.\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re witnessing a situation that has reached the point of no return,\u201d Mr. Jager said about the short- to medium-term prospects for Tunisian tourism. \u201cThere is really no hope of a rebound in tourism there.\u201dEgypt has also seen a big drop in visitors. It lost about five million annual visitors after the political turmoil of the Arab Spring that began in 2010, according to Mr. Scowsill. But the country still greets some 10 million visitors each year, many of them Russian, especially to beach resorts in Sharm el Sheikh.\u201cTerrorists have proven that Sharm can be attacked, even though it was under heavy protection,\u201d Mr. Jager said. \u201cCan Sharm continue this way?\u201dLast week, British Airways and EasyJet, a low-cost European airline, both canceled all their flights to Sharm airport until January, at the earliest. The next day, another suicide bomber killed seven people in a hotel in the northern Sinai.Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, the chief executive of Airbus, said in a recent interview that the air travel industry had proved that it was well equipped to face terror threats.\u201cSecurity may put a break in some places but we\u2019ve demonstrated that we knew how to deal with those threats in the past,\u201d Mr. Br\u00e9gier said.There is a much longer lag when countries experience natural disasters, which can often destroy basic infrastructure. After the 2004 tsunami in Thailand and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, it took from 14 to 22 months for foreign visitor levels to recover, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council study.After the 2011 tsunami and nuclear meltdown of the power plants in Fukushima, the number of foreign visitors to Japan dropped by 28 percent. Even so, within two years of the nuclear accident, the number of foreign arrivals had rebounded. By 2013, the number of visitors to Japan exceeded 10 million people for the first time ever, surpassing the prenuclear accident arrival numbers by 20 percent.In recent years, however, efforts to streamline visa applications and entry procedures has led to a large increase in the number of visitors, which jumped to 75 million in 2014, up from 54 million in 2009.The risk in the United States is for the government to overreact to tragedy by turning back its visitor-friendly policies, according to travel professionals. Authorities should resist calls to freeze the visa waiver program, which streamlines visa applications to the United States and has been one of the key drivers in attracting more tourists in recent years, they said.\u201cWalking away would be a big mistake,\u201d Mr. Scowsill said.Roger Dow, the president of the U.S. Travel Association, a group that advocates on behalf of the industry, said it was too soon to tell what impact the recent attacks in Paris and elsewhere might have on domestic and international travelers. But he added: \u201cThe biggest damage these terrorists can do is getting people to be more antsy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voter Insecurities Feed Rise of Right-Leaning Populist Politicians", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Mass shootings by Islamist militants. Migrants crashing borders. International competition punishing workers but enriching elites.Many of them \u2014 as Mr. Trump did this week \u2014 have made headlines by railing against Muslim immigrants, calling them a threat to public safety and cultural identity. Left-leaning critics have compared the populists to the fascists of the early 20th century. Some riding the wave, like the Freedom Party in Austria or Golden Dawn in Greece, have specific neo-Nazi roots.Unlike earlier right-wing movements, this generation of populists disavows the overt racism, militaristic rhetoric and associations with fascism that until recently scared away many mainstream voters.Before the recent terrorist attacks or the European migrant crisis cast a spotlight on Muslim immigration, the populists had built support as trade protectionists or economic nationalists appealing to working-class voters who felt disaffected from established parties and political elites. And, for the first time in nearly a century, established parties across Europe and the United States are struggling to fend off or counter the populist insurgents as their competition pulls the mainstream to the right.\u201cWhat you are seeing here is quite a radical shift,\u201d said Roger Eatwell, a political scientist at the University of Bath who studies right-wing parties.Ms. Le Pen is the best-known figure from more than a dozen right-leaning populist parties across Europe that have scored big gains over the last two years. This week, her National Front party won the largest share of the vote in the first round of regional elections in France, with 30 percent, making her a contender for the presidency in 2017. She campaigns against what she calls the Islamization of France and has compared Muslims praying in French streets to the Nazi occupation.But Ms. Le Pen fuses her cultural chauvinism with appeals to the economic anxieties of working or lower-middle class voters who \u2014 like their counterparts across Europe \u2014 have suffered from high unemployment, stagnant wages and growing income inequality, especially since the financial crisis of 2008.\u201cThey are pulling out all the stops for the migrants, the illegals, but who is looking out for our retirees?\u201d Ms. Le Pen asked in a recent campaign appearance. \u201cThey are stealing from the poor to give to foreigners who did not even ask our permission to come here.\u201dMr. Trump on Monday evoked comparisons to Ms. Le Pen and her European counterparts with his call to close American borders to all Muslims \u201cuntil our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u201dMs. Le Pen said that was too much for her, perhaps in part because she feared jeopardizing the progress she had made in shedding her party\u2019s previous image as racist and anti-Semitic.\u201cSeriously, have you ever heard me say something like that?\u201d she asked on Thursday when questioned about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments during a television interview. \u201cI defend all the French people in France, regardless of their origin, regardless of their religion.\u201dOthers in Europe\u2019s right-leaning populist parties, though, are applauding Mr. Trump for breaking with what they call the multiculturalist orthodoxy of dominant political elites.\u201cHe is a phenomenon,\u201d said Gawain Towler, a spokesman for the U.K. Independence Party, a right-leaning populist party here.\u201cThey are glad that somebody is saying things along these lines, and that is the same reason why you are now seeing significant support for political groups on the continent of Europe \u2014 whether in France, or Denmark or Finland or the others \u2014 who do not just repeat the shibboleths of the old establishment,\u201d Mr. Towler said. In all the countries, he said, \u201cthe same people have been governing for a long time, and they have completely let down the indigenous inhabitants, particularly at the lower end of the economic spectrum.\u201dStreaks of nativism have surfaced in Western Europe since it first welcomed waves of immigrants from former colonies in the middle of the last century, with thousands of Indians, Jamaicans and others arriving in Britain.But only in the last two decades \u2014 with the growing numbers of people arriving from Asia, the Middle East and Africa \u2014 has nativist sentiment in Europe approached its prominence in the United States, where immigration is central to the national experience.In another change, the voices that have taken up the cause of defending national borders and cultures against immigration and other perceived threats are now coming for the first time from populist voices outside the political establishment. (One exception is Hungary, where Mr. Orban, the prime minister, is a right-leaning populist who leads an establishment party, pulled further rightward by competition from a more extreme rival, the Jobbik party.)Links that once tied parties to their constituencies \u2014 Christian Democrats to Roman Catholic churches, for example, or Social Democrats to labor unions \u2014 have frayed. Changes in mass media have made celebrities of some political leaders while devaluing some traditional party organizations.But at the same time, establishment parties on the left and right alike have also largely failed to provide solutions to the problems that most vex working-class voters: income stagnation, insecurity and inequality in an age of technological change and global competition.A poll conducted in Europe last spring by the Pew Research Center found extraordinary gloom about the state of their economies: Sizable majorities in a half-dozen countries expected children to be worse off than their parents. That pessimistic view was held by 58 percent of the German respondents, 68 percent of the British, and 85 percent of the French.A Pew poll in the United States around the same time found that two-thirds of respondents believed government polices since the 2008 financial crisis had primarily benefited the wealthy instead of the middle class or the poor \u2014 a view held by 70 percent of those making less than $75,000 a year and by 55 percent of Republicans.Even before the migrant crisis and the recent terrorist attacks, the populists scored big gains in a dozen countries during the European parliamentary elections in the spring of 2014 and led the polling in Britain and France.\u201cThe financial crisis and the eurozone crisis and all the problems the E.U. was having \u2014 they all created fears that these parties were able to channel very well,\u201d said Ruth Wodak, a professor at Lancaster University in England and the author of \u201cThe Politics of Fear: What Right-Wing Populist Discourses Mean.\u201dIn each case, the core constituencies of the new right-wing parties were working-class men. \u201cThese are voters who feel economically left behind, under threat from immigration and rapid social change, and cut adrift from established politics,\u201d said Matthew J. Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent who studies the right.Mr. Trump, similarly, draws much of his support primarily among voters without a college education. The latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll showed that Mr. Trump had the support of 40 percent of Republican primary voters without a college degree, but 26 percent of those who had a degree. No other candidate\u2019s support was related so closely to level of education. The poll was largely taken before his statement on Monday afternoon proposing to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States.But like Ms. Le Pen and others on the right, he has combined his signature themes about the perils of immigration with stances that speak to the economic anxieties of working people as well. He has accused hedge funds of \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d calling them \u201cguys that shift paper around and get lucky.\u201d And he has denounced free-trade deals, vowed to put tariffs on imports and to stop immigrants or foreign workers from competing for jobs.Pat Buchanan, who ran his own right-leaning populist presidential campaigns in the United States for three elections beginning in 1992, said in an interview that he recognized many of his own cultural and economic themes in the speeches of Mr. Trump, Ms. Le Pen and the others around Europe. Their movements were manifestations of the same global forces, he argued.\u201cNationalism and tribalism and faith \u2014 these are the driving forces now, and they are tearing apart transnational institutions all over the world,\u201d he said.It all reminded him, he wrote in a follow-up email, of a line from the \u201cThe Second Coming,\u201d by W.B. Yeats: \u201cThings fall apart; the center cannot hold.\u201dAurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders Falls Behind in a Race Centered on Security", "Date": "2015-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIt was a litany of priorities that made good sense when Mr. Sanders announced his presidential bid in April. But after the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., he made fighting terrorism sound like an afterthought.These are challenging times for Mr. Sanders as the chief opponent to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. His progressive political message, so popular with liberals for much of 2015, now seems lost in a fog of fear. Americans are more anxious about terrorism than income inequality. They want the government to target the Islamic State more than Wall Street executives and health insurers. All of this plays to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strengths \u2014 not only as a hawkish former secretary of state but also as a savvy politician who follows the public mood. After months of pivoting to the left on domestic issues to compete with Mr. Sanders for her party\u2019s base, she is now talking about security and safety far more than Mr. Sanders \u2014 and solidifying her lead in opinion polls.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.At Saturday\u2019s debate, Mr. Sanders struggled to undercut Mrs. Clinton. He pointed out aspects of her record, including her relationships to Wall Street executives and her years at the State Department, in relatively respectful fashion rather than seizing on them to strongly question her judgment. He apologized to her for a breach by his campaign of her voter data, and he complimented her on being a transformative first lady. In his treatment of Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders was more gentleman than giant killer.\u201cHillary is now in the driver\u2019s seat in a way she has never been before,\u201d said Arnie Arnesen, a New Hampshire liberal and talk radio host who admires Mr. Sanders but is uncommitted in the race. \u201cIt\u2019s Bernie\u2019s turn to pivot.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if he can,\u201d she added, \u201cor whether his base will approve. They love him for the man he is, not the leader he needs to become.\u201dMost candidates evolve: Barack Obama and George W. Bush became better at communicating and campaigning during their first presidential races, and their agendas developed overarching themes. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, was repeating old talking points on Saturday night \u2014 like breaking up big banks and increasing taxes on the rich \u2014 without convincingly saying how he would achieve those goals or presenting them in powerful new language. As the debate demonstrated, he has yet to grow from a movement messiah into a national candidate whom many people can imagine as president. Mr. Sanders has few options at this point. Barring a scandal or another extraordinary event that consumes Mrs. Clinton, his only way to beat her starts with a lightning strike: winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1 and then the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. Such victories would instantly raise questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strength and electability and provide political momentum, fund-raising energy and far greater visibility for Mr. Sanders in the next major contests, in states like South Carolina, Colorado and Texas, where he is not well known.But Mrs. Clinton has been ahead in Iowa for three months, while Mr. Sanders has a slight lead in New Hampshire polls. Mrs. Clinton held a lead in Iowa in 2007, too, before losing there to Mr. Obama. But he had far more endorsements from state leaders and a sharper line of attack against Mrs. Clinton (over the Iraq war) than Mr. Sanders has. Mrs. Clinton is vulnerable this time around on her ties to Wall Street, and there is also an opening for a candidate to run to the left of her on national security issues. But Mr. Sanders, who has ruled out negative campaigning, has not done anything memorable on either front. When he did challenge her on Saturday, accusing her twice of being \u201ctoo into regime change\u201d to topple dictators and enemies, he did it as respectfully as possible \u2014 after which Mrs. Clinton hit him hard both times for voting to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the former Libyan leader. Mr. Sanders could have brought up the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that occurred on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s watch as secretary of state, but instead he all but surrendered, saying that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cright\u201d that dealing with dictators was a \u201ccomplicated issue.\u201dOn Wall Street, meanwhile, he said that corporate chief executives \u201cmay like\u201d Mrs. Clinton as president but would not like him \u2014 a contrast that could have been made more sharply. See what the candidates are saying about gun control, immigration and more, and how their positions align with the American people.Mr. Sanders has many strengths, but moxie is not one of them. He speaks the language of a high-minded policy wonk, not a street fighter. Gutsy aggressiveness has been so lacking in his campaign that it was one reason the news media paid so much attention on Friday when his advisers went to court against Democratic National Committee officials after they punished the Sanders campaign over a data breach.The bold move showed that the Sanders team could throw a punch \u2014 including against the Clinton campaign, which Sanders aides suggested had also breached data. Yet Mr. Sanders himself backed off the issue at Saturday\u2019s debate, apologizing to Mrs. Clinton for the breach. Just as he refused to attack her at the first Democratic debate over her private email server as secretary of state, he showed on Saturday that he would rather repeat his policy priorities than shake up the race by trying to score political points by challenging Mrs. Clinton. At one point in the debate, Mr. Sanders agreed that Americans were \u201cfearful and anxious\u201d about the security issues that Mrs. Clinton has focused on.\u201cBut you know what else they\u2019re anxious about?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they\u2019re worried about their kids, and they\u2019re seeing all the new income and wealth, virtually all of it, going to the top 1 percent. And they\u2019re looking around them, and they\u2019re looking at Washington and they\u2019re saying: \u2018The rich are getting much richer. I\u2019m getting poorer. What are you going to do about it?\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Sanders seems willing to rise or fall on his message about a rigged American economy, even if 2016 is looking more and more like a national security election.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The Big Short,\u2019 Economic Collapse for Fun and Profit", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a trip. At the end, your brain hurts and you feel sick to your stomach, as can happen when too much adrenaline has been surging through your system. But that queasy, empty feeling is the point: This is a terrifically enjoyable movie that leaves you in a state of rage, nausea and despair. What is to be done with those feelings is the great moral and political challenge Mr. McKay has set for the audience, which I hope is vast and various. I don\u2019t condone mob violence and I\u2019m supposed to keep my political opinions to myself, but as soon as I\u2019m done writing this I\u2019m going out to the garage to look for a pitchfork.Back in 2010, when Mr. Lewis\u2019s book came out, it was as ubiquitous an accessory for business-class airline passengers as the \u201cTwilight\u201d novels were for adolescent girls. Part of the book\u2019s appeal \u2014 a side effect of its author\u2019s smart, breezy, plain-spoken style \u2014 was that it offered readers the illusion of retroactive prescience. You could read about the insanity of bundling subprime mortgages into highly rated investment products and think: Well, of course that was a recipe for disaster. Of course a drop in the housing market would bring the whole thing crashing down like a Jenga tower. It was obvious. We knew it all along.In fact, almost none of us did. Certainly not the government officials and banking executives who remain at liberty and in positions of power to this day. Or if they did know, they didn\u2019t care. The truth about what the banks and their enablers were doing was obvious only to a handful of people (one of whom, in the movie, is shown demonstrating the Jenga tower metaphor I just borrowed). Mr. McKay, with a comedy writer\u2019s eye for archetypes, sorts them into an amusing array of strongly defined characters.There is the antisocial numbers guy, Dr. Michael Burry (Christian Bale), a fund manager who sits in his office wearing a T-shirt and flip-flops, blasting death metal, beating on his desk with drumsticks and betting his client\u2019s money on financial catastrophe. There is the righteously angry crusader, Mark Baum (Steve Carell), a disaffected Wall Streeter who sees a similar wager as the perfect expression of his contempt for the big banks (including the one he technically works for). And there are the young indie upstarts, Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro), college buddies whose \u201cgarage band\u201d fund was started with their own money and who want to show that they can play in the big leagues.Which, to some extent, it is. Mr. McKay is not above using paid-for female nudity as a signifier of capitalist excess, nor acknowledging, more generally, the hedonistic aspects of greed. He is a naturally exuberant director, and his antic energy matches the rhythms of the story. The teams conspiring to short the market are impossible not to root for, and the work of the movie\u2019s sprawling ensemble is never less than delightful. (This is the place to appreciate the contributions of Rafe Spall, Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong, who play Baum\u2019s baffled minions; Adepero Oduye, who plays his liaison to the bank that houses his fund; and Marisa Tomei, who as Baum\u2019s wife is like the only civilian in a combat picture.)But when we root for Baum and Burry to be proven right, for Shipley and Geller to hit pay dirt and for Vennett to earn the right to be smug in perpetuity, we are also hoping for ruin to be visited on millions of ordinary people. Houses, nest eggs, jobs and lives will be lost. Brad Pitt, in a gravelly turn as Ben Rickert, Shipley and Geller\u2019s paranoid guru, makes this point explicitly when he scolds his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s for celebrating their good fortune. He says what needs to be said, but the achievement of \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is that Mr. McKay doesn\u2019t only underline the moral of the story in dialogue. The film\u2019s final images, its abrupt shift in tone from exhilaration to exhaustion, its suddenly downbeat music (by Nicholas Britell) all combine to trigger a climactic wave of almost unbearable disgust.Because, as we know \u2014 and as we can stand, from time to time, to be reminded \u2014 there is no happy ending to this story, no punishment for the crime. A movie is unlikely to change that, and \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d in many ways a startlingly ambitious film, is modest about what it can do. It offers no solutions, and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker.\u201cThe Big Short\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). All that is solid melts into air; all that is holy is profaned.

{"Headline": "Seismic Political Shock in Spain", "Date": "2015-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn retrospect, it might seem surprising that the voter backlash had not come earlier. Though Spain\u2019s austerity regime has not been as drastic as Greece\u2019s, unemployment remains above 20 percent, with young people affected most severely, many services have been cut back, and more hardship lies ahead. While the Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy could claim that Spain had turned the corner with growth projected at 3 percent this year, it was apparently not enough to counter austerity fatigue and a sense that the burden was not being equally shared because of the cronyism, corruption scandals and stagnation of the established parties.It may take a long time to sort out who will govern next. Mr. Rajoy gets the first crack at forming a coalition, but it\u2019s not certain he will find willing partners. It\u2019s thus possible that new elections will have to be called for early next year. The markets quickly reacted to the uncertainty \u2014 Spanish bonds and stocks fell on the results. Beyond Spain\u2019s borders, leaders of other European Union countries facing austerity fatigue, like Italy and France, are likely to wonder whether imposing too much belt-tightening might spell political disaster for them as well.On the other side of the ledger, the Spanish shock should compel the European Union and its sternest member, Germany, and the International Monetary Fund to re-examine the austerity they have been imposing on countries most affected by Europe\u2019s debt crisis. Spain is not Greece \u2014 it is the fourth-largest economy of the eurozone, and Mr. Rajoy had been willing to take the needed medicine. What the vote showed is that there are limits to the sacrifices people in any country will take, and that when sacrifices are demanded, leaders must spread them equitably and transparently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Votes in Congress Move to Undercut Climate Pledge", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a provocative message to more than 100 leaders that the American president does not have the full support of his government on climate policy, the House passed resolutions, already approved by the Senate, to scuttle Environmental Protection Agency rules that would significantly cut heat-trapping carbon emissions from existing and future coal-fired power plants.The House votes \u2014 by 242 to 180 and 235 to 188, mostly along party lines \u2014 expanded to a global level the already profound gulf between Mr. Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress on domestic issues, demonstrating that the United States was hardly unified on the issue of climate change even as the president and other leaders sought to project solidarity.The measures will be sent to the White House, where Mr. Obama has said he will veto them. The Senate approved each measure by an identical margin, 52 to 46, signaling that Republican congressional leaders would not be able to muster the two-thirds majority needed for an override.At a news conference at the climate summit meeting in Paris, Mr. Obama faced repeated questions about whether other leaders could trust that the United States would be able to fulfill his commitments, even after his term ends in January 2017, a sentiment that some Republicans reinforced\u00a0Tuesday.\u201cWhile the president is at this climate conference, the American people have that as a very, very low priority,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming. \u201cThey are focused on jobs, the economy and terrorism.\u201dIn a later interview, Mr. Barrasso was even blunter. \u201cThe president\u2019s promises cannot be relied on,\u201d he said, noting that the congressional action to block the administration\u2019s environmental rules was just one reason foreign leaders in Paris could not trust Mr. Obama\u2019s commitments.In Paris, Mr. Obama struck a confident pose, portraying the United States as the superpower leader on many of the world\u2019s most difficult challenges, not only on climate change, but also on nuclear proliferation issues and global health concerns.\u201cMy expectation is that we will absolutely be able to meet our commitments,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\u201cThis is part of American leadership,\u201d he said at another point, adding, \u201cBecause we\u2019re the largest country, because we have the most powerful military, we should welcome the fact that we\u2019re going to do more \u2014 and oftentimes we\u2019re going to do it first.\u201d\u201cEven if somebody from a different party succeeded me, one of the things you find is when you\u2019re in this job, you think about it differently than when you\u2019re just running for the job,\u201d he said.But back in Washington, Republican criticism of the president while abroad was unusually pointed. \u201cWe want the world to know that there is disagreement with the president on this issue \u2014 not about the fact that the climate is changing, but about the priority that is being placed on it,\u201d said Representative Edward Whitfield, Republican of Kentucky, in a speech on the House floor.\u201cWhy should this president penalize Americans and put us in jeopardy compared to other countries of the world and require us to do more than other countries are doing, just so he can go to France and claim to be the world leader on climate change?\u201dOther Republicans, including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s effort to pass cap-and-trade legislation in his first term had failed in the face of bipartisan opposition, and they said the president was ignoring important reductions in carbon emissions brought about without imposing new government fiats.\u00a0\u201cBy advocating for policies like cap-and-trade \u2014 which will kill jobs, increase costs and decrease the reliability of our energy supply \u2014 the president is ignoring America\u2019s greatest success story in recent memory,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cOur energy revolution brought on by fracking is growing our economy and reducing carbon emissions at the same time.\u201dCongressional Republicans have taken numerous steps in recent weeks to draw clear distinctions between Mr. Obama\u2019s views on environmental protection and their own policy preferences, which favor increasing energy production in the United States and further lowering costs for businesses and consumers.As well as voting on the two resolutions, the House opened floor debate on\u00a0a major energy bill focused on increasing natural gas pipeline development. The bill would also lift a ban on crude oil exports.In Paris, Mr. Obama showed no sign of limiting his lofty goals, though he said he was most immediately focused on securing a global accord.\u201cThis one trend, climate change, affects all trends,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we let the world keep warming as fast as it is and sea levels rising as fast as they are, and weather patterns keep shifting in more unexpected ways, then before long we are going to have to devote more and more and more of our economic and military resources not to growing opportunity for our people, but to adapting to the various consequences of a changing planet.\u201dMr. Obama added: \u201cWith respect to climate and what\u2019s taking place here, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. We still need a Paris agreement. So my main focus is making sure that the United States is a leader in bringing a successful agreement home here in Paris.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farmers Try Political Force to Twist Open California\u2019s Taps", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "The Parched WestFew in agriculture have shaped the debate over water more than the several hundred owners of an arid finger of farmland west of Fresno.Supported byFIVE POINTS, Calif. \u2014 The message that Maria L. Gutierrez gave legislators on Capitol Hill was anguished and blunt: California\u2019s historic drought had not merely left farmland idle. It had destroyed Latino farm workers\u2019 jobs, shuttered Latino businesses and thrown Latino families on the street. Yet Congress had turned a deaf ear to their pleas for more water to revive farming and farm labor.So Latinos \u2014 the nation\u2019s fastest-growing ethnic group, she noted pointedly \u2014 were sending a warning that politicians could not ignore.California\u2019s snowpack testing on Wednesday was more encouraging than last year, but officials were far from certain that the drought was ending. And the prolonged drought has laid bare the patchwork way water is parceled out.Farmers here have become a target not just of city dwellers forced by conservation decrees to shorten showers and let their lawns go brown, but also of other farmers. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in Northern California this year, growers grudgingly cut production to free up water for Central Valley farms, driven less by charity than by fear that the state would demand even more water if they did not.But while California\u2019s farmers could conserve more \u2014 fewer than half use low-flow irrigation methods \u2014 the reality is more complex. Agriculture makes up just 2.2 percent of California\u2019s economy, but this area remains the nation\u2019s green grocer, and farming is still the economic lifeblood of the state\u2019s arid center. Both locally and nationally, farmers pack a political punch well above their weight.\u201cWe\u2019ve been feeding people with this food for generations,\u201d said Shawn Coburn, 47, whose 1,200-acre farm here in Five Points is scarred with fields that lie fallow for lack of water. \u201cYou want to pay more for food? Or you want all your food from China? Fine. Don\u2019t come complaining to me.\u201d\u201cThey have an amazing amount of money to spend, and yet they plead hardship,\u201d said Patricia Schifferle, a Truckee, Calif., environmental consultant who is perhaps Westlands\u2019 most dogged critic. \u201cWe\u2019re all paying for this largess that goes to the select few.\u201dWestlands\u2019 size and its broad influence make it a prime target for detractors like Ms. Schifferle. The district calls the attacks unfair, and says that its clout is overrated. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to pick on Westlands, because Westlands is big,\u201d the district\u2019s deputy general manager, Johnny Amaral, said in an interview. But Westlands\u2019 principal water source \u2014 the Central Valley Project \u2014 has been cut off for two straight years, he noted, despite its best efforts.\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who wouldn\u2019t work for their share in the same situation,\u201d he said.Twenty dams big and 500 miles of canals long, the Central Valley Project offered area farmers a boundless supply of Northern California water for decades. But as a second canal system, the State Water Project, began tapping the same northern rivers in the 1970s, problems emerged.Commercial salmon fisheries collapsed. East of San Francisco, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers unite in an estuary, striped bass, sturgeon, shad and smelt began precipitous declines.Congress\u2019s solution \u2014 a 1992 law reserving at least a minimum amount of water for wildlife \u2014 touched off a long-running political backlash by San Joaquin Valley farmers. For 23 years, Westlands has led the mostly losing battle to get that water back: in courts, in Washington and along California roads, where placards condemning a \u201cCongress-created Dust Bowl\u201d blame the government, not drought, for water shortages.The district comes to the fight well prepared. Mr. Amaral was until this fall the top aide to Representative Devin Nunes of nearby Fresno, a Republican. Mr. Amaral\u2019s predecessor, Jason Peltier, oversaw Western water issues in the Interior Department under President George W. Bush.Westlands\u2019 pre-eminent lobbyist, David Bernhardt, was the Bush Interior Department\u2019s solicitor before joining a Denver law firm that Westlands retained after President Obama was elected in 2008.Others have also helped Westlands court federal decision makers. Vin Weber and Denny Rehberg, former Republican representatives from Minnesota and Montana, have been paid more than $550,000 since 2013 to lobby Congress.At least $530,000 more was spent from 2009 to 2013 for lobbying on endangered-species issues by Julie A. MacDonald, formerly Mr. Peltier\u2019s assistant at the Interior Department. Ms. MacDonald resigned that post in 2007; an internal inquiry later concluded that she had improperly disclosed information about Endangered Species Act deliberations to critics of the law. Ms. MacDonald, who has denied wrongdoing, was not charged with any legal violation.The farmers\u2019 political action committee and the Westlands board have given generously to the campaigns of friendly federal legislators, contributing at least $120,000 to Central Valley House members in the 2014 election. But one of the district\u2019s most notable contributions was made decades ago, not long after Congress\u2019s allotment of water for wildlife set off a backlash from farmers. In 1994, Westlands\u2019 thoroughly Republican leaders spurned their party\u2019s best hope for the Senate, and instead held a fund-raiser for the first-term Democratic incumbent, Dianne Feinstein.Ms. Feinstein has a strong environmental record. Yet she has also labored repeatedly to secure water for California agriculture, and especially for Westlands farmers. For the last two years, Ms. Feinstein has led the effort to push federal drought legislation through the Senate. And perhaps never has the tug-of-war between those competing priorities been so visible.As federal water supplies to California farmlands dried up in 2014, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives \u2014 where Kevin McCarthy, from a San Joaquin Valley district adjacent to Westlands farmland, is the majority leader \u2014 swiftly passed a bill to undo environmental restrictions on greater transfers of Northern California water to farmers.The most influential farm voice in that process was Westlands, represented by its lobbyist, Mr. Bernhardt, and by its general manager and top executive, Thomas W. Birmingham.The confidential draft Ms. Feinstein\u2019s staff produced that fall offered something for everyone: calls for new and bigger dams, money for water conservation projects and tweaks to existing rules that would send more northern water to southern farms.She tried again this year, with a drought bill that restored some environmental protections for endangered species to assuage fellow Democrats and Northern Californians. But that collapsed in an acrimonious confrontation this month with Republicans in the House, who wanted those safeguards relaxed.Ms. Feinstein has promised to try again in 2016. But with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, no drought legislation is likely to pass without help from Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.George Miller, a former Democratic representative from Northern California, sponsored the 1992 law that mandated a minimum amount of water for the region\u2019s fish. He was Westlands\u2019 fiercest adversary in Congress before retiring last year.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give them an \u2018A\u2019 for effort,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThese boys are committed. They play at the highest level, and they never sleep \u2014 ever.\u201dBut Westlands farmers are unapologetic. Mr. Coburn, the Five Points farmer, not only says that effort is necessary, but he also plays his part in it as an unofficial ambassador to journalists and policy makers. \u201cBig Ag polls poorly, family farms poll well,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to hate on Shawn the farmer.\u201dLuxury crops are replacing staples on some California farms.Some farmers, as well as California residents who blame farming for the state\u2019s water woes, shake their heads at that. Westlands farmers note that their fields are among the most water efficient anywhere.\u201cWe just have to stay in line until we get someone in the White House who is going to listen to us,\u201d Mr. Coburn said. \u201cThis is about politics, not rain.\u201dIndeed, even as efforts to cajole more water from Congress stalled this autumn, Westlands\u2019 managers and their lawyers were sealing a very different bargain with water regulators at the Interior Department.Westlands\u2019 first farmers won Congress\u2019s blessing to tap the Central Valley Project, knowing that their fields had a flaw: Beneath them, a layer of clay kept water from draining away. Irrigating the fields would release salts and toxic elements like selenium and boron \u2014 which, trapped in the soil, would eventually turn the ground barren.The 1960 law that extended federal water to Westlands included a solution: a 188-mile canal, built by the government and later to be paid for by Westlands, to carry the irrigation runoff away. But in the early 1980s, local opponents stopped the ditch at mile 85 amid a federal wildlife refuge, where selenium-laden irrigation runoff quickly wiped out birds and fish.Since then, Westlands and the Bureau of Reclamation have battled over how to handle the toxic runoff. The safest and most cost-effective fix, buying and fallowing fully half of the Westlands fields, was rejected. But the remaining options, which would fallow less land and build desalination plants to purify the runoff, would cost billions \u2014 more than Westlands or the Bureau of Reclamation could afford or were willing to pay.In September, the two sides settled their three-decade dispute. But the agreement has only spawned more contention among supporters and critics of Westlands.Under the accord, Westlands frees the government of its obligation in the 1960 law to provide drainage, promising to solve the problem on its own. In return, the $350 million debt Westlands still owes for the infrastructure that delivered federal water would be written off. Its 25-year contract for a share of Northern California river water would be made permanent, and its rate would become among the lowest available.The negotiations took years. Three months after Mr. Obama took office, Westlands made a tactical switch, paying Tony Coelho, a former representative from California, to advise on the negotiations. Mr. Coelho, one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress in the 1980s, once represented the district that included Westlands and the wildlife refuge that was devastated by selenium pollution.He said that the notion of Westlands as a bully, flattening Northern Californians in its thirst for water, was a canard.\u201cIt takes two sides to have a fight,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe people in the Bay Area haven\u2019t been pansies. They\u2019re more effective, I would say, than Westlands in preventing Westlands from doing things, and as a result, a lot of people are going out of business because water hasn\u2019t been there.\u201dThat is not a universal view.\u201cEvery study I\u2019ve seen, farmers make more money when there\u2019s drought than when there isn\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Beard, the Bureau of Reclamation director under President Clinton. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if they end up on the top of the heap again.\u201dIn early 2013, Westlands placed a million-dollar bet that it could change that calculus.That March, a retired Mexican diplomat, Martha Elvia Rosas, held a news conference in Fresno to introduce a new group, El Agua Es Asunto de Todos \u2014 an effort, she said, to give Latinos a louder voice in the debate over drought.Ms. Rosas promised a campaign on Spanish-language radio, television, social media and in newspapers to show Latinos how important water was to their future.And she played commercials that would soon blanket Spanish-language media: ordinary Latinos in cars and on doorsteps, delivering a simple message: \u201cSin agua, sin trabajo.\u201d No water, no work.Mr. Amaral, Westlands\u2019 deputy general manager, denied that, calling El Agua \u201cpurely an educational initiative.\u201d As a quasi-governmental agency, he said, Westlands is barred from promoting political initiatives.Michael Fenenbock, the architect of the campaign, said it had vaulted water from a nonissue among California Latinos to a top concern. Moreover, he said, many Latinos now see environmental regulations as the cause of water shortages, and farmers as sympathetic figures.\u201cIt\u2019s been explosive,\u201d Mr. Fenenbock said, adding that many Latinos now \u201cvery strongly support what we think is the centerpiece of the debate: a reliable water supply that is very much on the side of agriculture.\u201dThe Fenenbock Group has spent $700,000 on ads this year and could spend $3 million in 2016 as election-year interest in water heats up, said Daphne Weisbart, the firm\u2019s chief executive and Mr. Fenenbock\u2019s wife. Westlands financed most of the group\u2019s operations in 2013, but Ms. Weisbart said that a number of agricultural water districts now pay for the ads.Ms. Rosas insisted that Westlands received nothing in return.\u201cThey do not dictate what we say,\u201d Ms. Rosas said. \u201cWe have made it clear from the start that we are in charge of this. This is our project, they are not in control.\u201dBut Mr. Fenenbock said he was contemplating forming an El Agua political arm. Its contributions would carry weight with politicians, he said, because among many California Latinos, what El Agua says about water is taken as the truth.\u201cThe brand,\u201d he said, \u201cis golden.\u201dAn article on Thursday about lobbying efforts by California farmers to get more irrigation water referred incorrectly in some editions to the location where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet. It is east of San Francisco, not west.A picture caption on Dec. 31 with the continuation an article about lobbying efforts by California farmers to acquire more irrigation water misidentified the type of trees shown in the grove. They are pistachio trees, not cashew trees.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For E.U., Things Can Get Worse", "Date": "2015-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 By any measure, it has been a year from hell for the European Union. And if Britons vote to leave the bloc, next year could be worse.Not since 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell and communism crumbled across Eastern Europe, has the Continent\u2019s geopolitical kaleidoscope been shaken up so vigorously.But unlike that year of joyous turmoil, which paved the way for a leap forward in European integration, the crises of 2015 threatened to tear the union apart and left it battered, bruised, despondent and littered with new barriers.The collapse of the Iron Curtain led within two years to the agreement to create a single European currency and, over the following 15 years, to the eastward enlargement of the European Union and NATO up to the borders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. That appeared to confirm a prediction of the European Union\u2019s founding father, Jean Monnet, that a united Europe would be built out of crises. In contrast, this year\u2019s political and economic shocks over an influx of migrants, Greek debt, Islamist violence and Russian military action have led to the return of border controls in many places, the rise of populist anti-European Union political forces and recrimination among European Union governments.Jean-Claude Juncker, who describes his European Union executive agency as the \u201clast-chance commission,\u201d warned that the union\u2019s Schengen Area of passport-free travel was in danger and the euro itself would be unlikely to survive if internal borders were shut.Mr. Juncker resorted to gallows humor after the last of 12 summit meetings this year, most devoted to last-gasp crisis management: \u201cThe crises that are with us will remain and others will come.\u201dHis gloomy tone was a reality check on the \u201cwe can do it\u201d spirit that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel \u2014 Europe\u2019s preeminent leader \u2014 has sought to apply to the absorption of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them from Syria.Ms. Merkel has received little support from her European Union partners in sharing the migrant burden. Most have insisted that the priority is sealing Europe\u2019s external borders rather than welcoming more than a token number of refugees in their own countries.This is partly due to latent resentment of German dominance of the bloc and payback for its reluctance to share more financial risks in the eurozone.Some partners also accuse Berlin of hypocrisy over its energy ties with Russia, while friends such as France, the Netherlands and Denmark are simply petrified by the rise of right-wing anti-immigration populists at home.One of the sharpest rebuffs to sharing more of the refugee burden came from France, a close ally. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said of Ms. Merkel\u2019s open-door policy toward Syrian refugees: \u201cIt was not France that said, \u2018Come!\u201d\u2019Ms. Merkel\u2019s critics rounded on her at an end-of-year European Union summit meeting. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, backed by Portugal and Greece, attacked her refusal to accept a eurozone bank deposit guarantee program. The Baltic states, Bulgaria and Italy denounced her support for a direct gas pipeline from Russia to Germany at a time when the bloc is sanctioning Moscow over its military action in Ukraine and has forced the cancellation of a pipeline to southern Europe.One problem likely to worsen in 2016 is that Europe\u2019s main leaders are politically weak and so preoccupied by domestic challenges that they are unable to take the necessary collective action.Ms. Merkel\u2019s survival in the chancellery hinges on her ability to bring down the number of refugees flooding into Germany next year and show she has migration under control. But without \u201cMutti\u201d (Mommy), as she is affectionately known back home, the union would be in even direr straits.The year of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France has been bracketed by militant attacks on the streets of Paris in January and November that caused shock across the Continent over the Islamist threat from within and over failures in European police and intelligence cooperation.France\u2019s influence in Europe is diminished by its economic weakness as Mr. Hollande struggles for re-election in 2017 against the rising far-right populist Marine Le Pen and Mr. Hollande\u2019s conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy.The British prime minister, David Cameron, cares only about finding a face-saving deal on changes in Britain\u2019s European Union membership terms in February to win a knife-edge referendum that he has hinted he hopes to hold sometime next year.Mr. Cameron has effectively mortgaged Britain\u2019s future to an attempt to deprive immigrants from eastern European Union countries of the same in-work benefits that low-paid British workers get \u2014 something many Euorpean Union members say would be illegal.Given British public alarm over immigration, an anti-elite mood and age-old suspicion of Europe fanned by a skeptical news media, the referendum is an accident waiting to happen.If Britain \u2014 Europe\u2019s second-biggest economy and one of its two main military powers \u2014 became the first member state ever to vote to leave the union, it would be a shattering blow to the bloc\u2019s confidence and international standing.Die-hard European federalists like to believe a \u201cBrexit\u201d would unshackle the remaining members to move ahead in a much closer union built on the eurozone.But that is to ignore the myriad east versus west, north versus south, free-market versus protectionist, socialist versus conservative and independent versus integrationist divisions among the other 27 member states.More likely, a Brexit vote would prompt demands for referendums elsewhere, from Poland to Denmark, amid acrimonious negotiations between London and Brussels over the terms of Britain\u2019s departure and future relationship with the bloc.Denmark has just shown the political risk when governments anywhere in Europe ask voters whether they want even a tiny bit closer cooperation. The answer was \u201cnej tak\u201d \u2014 no thanks.If Mr. Cameron wins and Britain stays in the bloc on improved terms, some fear political contagion, with other national leaders tempted to emulate his tactic of taking Brussels hostage for domestic ends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Earmarks Billions to Help Prod Its Companies", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s central bank announced a small but perhaps symbolically significant change to its stimulus efforts on Friday, earmarking 300 billion yen a year, or $2.4 billion, to buy shares in companies that expand the economy by investing in their factories or by raising workers\u2019 pay.Coming just two days after the United States Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis, the move emphasized the growing divergence between tighter monetary policy in the United States and the ultra-accommodative stance of Japan. The bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said the timing of the two decisions was merely coincidental.Instead, Mr. Kuroda said, the bank wants to refine its existing program, which analysts say has beaten back \u2014 but not yet defeated \u2014 the deflation that has haunted Japan for two decades.\u201cThe business environment is favorable, but there are still differences in the way companies have responded,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said. \u201cThe B.O.J. is doing what it can to support capital spending and investment in human resources.\u201dBy focusing on companies that invest in production and workers, Mr. Kuroda was addressing a stubborn obstacle to his efforts to promote consumption and stoke inflation: Many businesses are defensively hoarding cash rather than injecting it back into the economy. That has kept a lid on wages and prices, forcing the bank to postpone a goal of achieving around 2 percent inflation.\u201cThe B.O.J. is sending the message through the market: Please cooperate,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.The central bank also on Friday extended the average maturity of the government bonds it buys from a range of seven to 10 years to seven to 12 years, in what Mr. Kuroda called a \u201ctechnical\u201d adjustment.Investors seemed unsure what to make of Friday\u2019s moves, which were less assertive than others made by Mr. Kuroda since he took over as central bank chief in early 2013. His mandate was to overturn the bank\u2019s previously cautious approach and take it into a \u201cnew dimension\u201d of aggressive monetary expansion.The Nikkei 225 average jumped immediately after the announcement on Friday and the yen fell against the dollar, but both moves were soon reversed. Japanese stocks closed nearly 2 percent lower on the day.The Bank of Japan already buys \u00a53 trillion of equities a year under its existing asset-purchasing program, as well as tens of trillions of yen of government bonds and other financial instruments. That is many times more than it set aside with the new stock-buying program that it announced on Friday and said would begin in April.And unless the bank raises its target for overall monetary expansion by the time the additional buying starts, it will have to reduce its accumulation of other assets to make room, weakening the effect on financial markets.Nonetheless, it came as a surprise, Ms. Sera added, because few investors had expected the bank to take any action at all.The bank has left its policy settings unchanged for months, despite softening prices, to the disappointment of some analysts and investors. Its last major monetary expansion occurred more than a year ago, in October 2014.Mr. Adachi, of JPMorgan, said that if nothing else, the bank had sent a message that it was still actively looking for new ways to support the economy.\u201cThe B.O.J. doesn\u2019t want markets to conclude that it\u2019s never going to ease again,\u201d he said.Mr. Kuroda seemed to concede that point at a news conference after the policy announcement. Referring to a view expressed by some critics that the bank had effectively run out of ammunition in its stimulus drive \u2014 it is now buying up a majority of the bonds that the government puts on the market \u2014 he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that qualitative and quantitative easing will reach a limit anytime soon.\u201dIn its announcement, the bank said the new stock-buying initiative would target index funds \u201ccomposed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively making investment in physical and human capital.\u201dThe program, it said, would start by buying funds that track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400, a relatively new index made up of Japanese companies that are judged to meet high standards of governance and profitability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Missed Opportunity of Ultra-Cheap Money", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYears of ultralow interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve may have breathed life back into the economy and buoyed Wall Street. But they have not managed to solve problems like the aging Portal Bridge.The 105-year-old railway bridge in northern New Jersey has for decades caused delays for commuters in and out of New York. \u201cWe have long desired the bridge\u2019s replacement,\u201d said Stephen Gardner, an executive vice president for Amtrak, whose trains use the bridge. \u201cIt\u2019s time for it to retire.\u201dA replacement bridge would cost an estimated $1 billion, the sort of sum that financial markets can raise for a private corporation in the blink of an eye. Yet even though the federal government and the state of New Jersey can borrow at rock-bottom rates, the overhaul remains unfunded.There are many such infrastructure projects needed around the country, providing a stark reminder of the deeper problems in the economy that the Fed\u2019s easy-money policies have not been able to fix.\u201cWe are not where we should be when it comes to investment, public or private,\u201d said William A. Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Galston in particular lamented the failure to set up a government-backed infrastructure bank in recent years. \u201cThis will go down as one of the great missed opportunities,\u201d he said.Public investment spending as a share of overall economic activity has fallen to lows not seen since the 1940s, according to an analysis by James W. Paulsen of Wells Capital Management.Political impasses have, of course, restricted the flow of money into government projects aimed at improving aging roads, bridges and mass transit. But even in the private sector, many of the hoped-for benefits of low-cost borrowing have not occurred.Corporations have tapped the markets for trillions of dollars in recent years, yet they plowed relatively little of the money into new operations. Such investments might have bolstered hiring and made American business more efficient and globally competitive.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.In some ways, these are the wasted opportunities of the cheap-money years \u2014 and they may well remain squandered now that the cost of borrowing appears to be heading higher, even if the initial increases after the Fed\u2019s decision Wednesday to move its benchmark up from close to zero will remain modest.The Fed\u2019s stimulus policies worked in many ways. They prompted banks and investors to lend, lifted stock prices and bolstered the confidence of consumers and chief executives. The economy eventually regained strength, causing unemployment to fall, auto sales to take off and house prices to rise somewhat.But important indicators suggest that the money did not flow where some economists and analysts say it is needed to improve the long-term potential of the economy.Corporations may not have made the most of the Fed\u2019s largess. In theory, low interest rates should spur companies to borrow money that they then invest in new machines and technology that will make their operations more efficient. These investments can improve profitability and make firms more competitive in global markets.But business investment as a percentage of gross domestic product has remained below historical levels since the Great Recession. A surprising lack of investment also shows up in the recent borrowing habits of companies that issue junk bonds, a market that ballooned after the Fed cut interest rates.From 2009 through September of this year, United States companies issuing such bonds spent a mere 2 percent of the proceeds of those bonds on capital expenditures, or \u201ccapex,\u201d according to an analysis of data provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The capital expenditures figures may not capture all investment, the bank\u2019s analysts noted. Even so, the data shows that the lion\u2019s share of bond proceeds went to pay off other debt owed by the companies and to finance acquisitions and leveraged buyouts.\u201cVery little of it has been used for capex,\u201d said Michael Contopoulos, head of United States high-yield and leveraged loan strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a big problem.\u201dThe lack of corporate investment may hold back the United States\u2019 growth rate in the future. Higher capital expenditures might have bolstered productivity, a crucial economic yardstick that measures how much an economy produces with resources like labor and capital. Growth in productivity has slowed in recent years, disturbing economists.Paradoxically, it is possible that the low interest rates have held back forces that would have made companies more efficient. In an influential speech in 2014, Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and now a professor at Harvard, cited the experience of Japan, where interest rates have been low for a long time.The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has begun the process of raising interest rates, a move that her predecessors have taken in recent decades as they put their own distinctive stamp on the economy.The Fed\u2019s higher interest rates may now usher in a period of upheaval in corporate America. Recent turmoil in the junk bond market suggests that investors expect bankruptcies, particularly in the energy sector. And the pain today may create the sort of longer-term changes that would make the economy stronger. Conversely, if banks and bond investors cut back too much on lending, the economy could suffer.But even as interest rates appear to be heading higher, some economists say there is an optimistic, alternative possibility.Under this theory, productivity was weak in the years after the crisis because high unemployment kept labor costs depressed, giving companies an easy way to maintain margins. \u201cEmployers can be pretty sloppy in terms of efficiency,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former member of President Obama\u2019s economic team and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to squeeze the heck out of labor costs.\u201dNow, as unemployment has fallen, companies may compete more for workers, potentially pushing up wages. Confronted with higher labor costs, companies will have no choice but to invest to become more efficient, the theory goes. \u201cYou want an economy and labor market where firms can\u2019t afford to be inefficient,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said.Question marks, however, will most likely continue to hang over the country\u2019s roads and railways as interest rates rise.If the economy continues to grow and fiscal pressures ease, the federal government, state and cities may find more to spend on infrastructure even if they face higher borrowing costs.But the substantial investment that some Democrats are hoping for seems improbable. Many Republicans assert that the infrastructure needs are overstated and that the private sector, rather than the taxpayer, needs to play a much greater role.Any rebuilding will take longer and cost much more than earlier plans. But advocates for public works, while saying the transportation bill falls short of the overall needs, nonetheless see reason to be encouraged.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic; there\u2019s been big strides made,\u201d Mr. Gardner, the Amtrak official, said. \u201cInfrastructure is starting to creep back into people\u2019s minds as an issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robust Jobs Report All but Guarantees Fed Will Raise Rates", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsider it a done deal.In addition to announcing 211,000 new hires last month \u2014 a bit more than Wall Street had expected \u2014 the Labor Department also revised upward its earlier estimate of job creation in September and October by a total of 26,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5 percent.The labor market strength evident in the November data removes the last major uncertainty before the Fed decision.\u201cThis is a green light from our perspective,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. Wall Street, which in the past has sold off after strong jobs data and the prospect of higher interest rates, greeted the report with enthusiasm, perhaps because it removes any remaining uncertainty about the Fed\u2019s plans. Stocks reversed Thursday\u2019s losses and rose more than 2 percent; bond yields fell slightly. The report on Friday echoes other recent positive data on job openings, new weekly claims for unemployment benefits and private payroll surveys, Mr. Orlando added. \u201cThis is a good number for liftoff,\u201d he said, referring to the expected move by the central bank, which has held rates near zero since December 2008.If hiring continues at a healthy pace next year, as most economists now predict, it could also blunt Republican criticism in the presidential campaign of Democratic economic policies, which have been a prominent target for the current crop of G.O.P. candidates.With an average monthly payroll increase of 210,000 so far this year, the 211,000 gain in November \u2014 though still subject to revision \u2014 has a metronome-like element of consistency. It is also near the average monthly increase of 199,000 in 2013 and 260,000 in 2014.\u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve thought the labor market was in pretty good shape, and this just confirms that,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. After the release of the jobs report, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Patrick T. Harker, added his voice to the chorus of Fed officials who said it was time for the central bank to raise interest rates.\u201cRaising rates this year will, in my view, serve to reduce monetary policy uncertainty and to keep the economy on track for sustained growth with price stability,\u201d Mr. Harker said at a Fed conference in Philadelphia.Still, even after more than six years of economic recovery from the devastating financial crisis, the labor market is well below its pre-recession levels and pockets of economic weakness remain.At 62.5 percent, the proportion of Americans in the labor force remains near multidecade lows. The jobless rate for African-Americans rose by 0.2 percentage point in November to 9.4 percent, which is more than twice the 4.3 percent level for white Americans.Moreover, the economy is still 2.8 million jobs short of where it would have to be to match pre-recession employment levels while also absorbing new entrants into the work force, according to the Hamilton Project, a research group associated with the Brookings Institution in Washington. Even if the current trend continues, that so-called \u201cjobs gap\u201d will not be closed until mid-2017.In addition to the tempo of hiring and the unemployment rate, Fed policy makers have been paying close attention to the pace of wage increases. In November, the government said wages rose by 0.2 percent, leaving the 12-month change in average hourly earnings 2.3 percent higher.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Despite steady hiring gains and a falling unemployment rate, wage growth in recent years has barely advanced faster than inflation. In October, that trend seemed to improve, with an unexpectedly strong 0.4 percentage point increase in average hourly earnings that pushed the 12-month gain to 2.5 percent even as the pace of inflation fell, mostly because of lower energy prices.But with November\u2019s figures reverting to the earlier trend, Mr. Clemons said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of wage pressure yet.\u201dHe foresees two more interest rate increases next year, bringing short-term rates to about 0.75 percent at this point next year. Other analysts, like Mr. Orlando, expect the Fed to raise rates roughly every other meeting next year, which would bring the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to about 1 percent in the fall of 2016.\u201cIt is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to,\u201d she added.In the November data, the mix of sectors doing the hiring was encouraging, with big gains in construction, education and health services, and the white-collar professional and business services sector.On the other hand, the mining and logging sector lost 11,000 jobs, hit by continuing job cuts in the oil patch and other commodity-dependent industries.One wild card in the November report was the retail sector. But the data showed that stores added 31,000 retail jobs.The transportation and warehousing sector added 6,400 jobs in November, reversing losses in September and October.In Chicago, Redwood Logistics has been on a steady growth track all year, adding about 100 employees in the last 12 months, said the company\u2019s chief executive, Todd Berger. With a nationwide work force of about 425, Mr. Berger said he anticipated hiring another 100 workers in the next year. Although many people might consider strong shoulders to be the main qualification for a job at a shipping and transportation company, the reality is very different.Most of Redwood\u2019s jobs require a college degree, Mr. Berger said. In November, Redwood filled three managerial positions, all of which paid more than $100,000 a year and required specialized training and experience.Salaries for less-skilled positions, like truck drivers, have also been creeping up. In Texas, Redwood has been hiring drivers from among those laid off from the energy industry.\u201cOur drivers will go to work in the oil fields when that\u2019s hot,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re coming back.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korean Labor Leader Leaves Temple to Surrender to Authorities", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A fugitive labor leader who had taken refuge in a well-known Buddhist temple surrendered to the authorities on Thursday, ending a 24-day standoff that had set off a rare police raid within the temple complex.Since then, the Jogye Temple, which is the headquarters of South Korea\u2019s largest Buddhist denomination, had come to resemble an urban fortress under siege as the monks denied entry to the police, who sought to arrest Mr. Han on charges related to the Nov. 14 protest and previous ones. The police erected barricades and screened people passing through the temple gates, and rival groups of Buddhists shouted and even shoved one another as they bickered over whether their temple should give Mr. Han refuge.On Thursday, a day after the police finally entered the temple grounds and surrounded the building where Mr. Han was staying, the labor leader turned himself in.\u201cI am not a murderer, an immoral criminal, a robber or a mastermind of violent riots but a laid-off worker,\u201d Mr. Han, 53, a former auto factory worker, said during a news conference before leaving the temple to be detained. \u201cToday, I cannot avoid being arrested, but we will continue to fight to expose the true face of this unjust government.\u201dDuring South Korea\u2019s decades of military dictatorship, temples and churches often provided shelter and moral support for political dissidents, including student and labor activists on the run from the police. Police officers chasing them often stopped at their gates.But in recent years, a growing number of South Koreans, including major conservative news outlets, have urged the police to disregard that tradition and apprehend such fugitives, calling them crime suspects who abuse religious facilities.On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of police officers finally entered the temple complex, removing monks and temple officials who had formed a human chain in front of the building where Mr. Han was staying. The police surrounded the building and prepared to storm it, but the Venerable Jaseung, president of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, asked them to give the monks until noon Thursday to persuade Mr. Han to leave voluntarily.The police were enforcing a court-issued warrant for Mr. Han\u2019s arrest. But they also had another powerful backer: President Park, who has sounded increasingly frustrated with the National Assembly\u2019s failure to approve a raft of labor legislation that has angered union leaders and other progressive critics, who argue that it will make it easier for big businesses to fire workers. The November protest was driven by opposition to the labor bills, among other issues.Ms. Park, who says her labor legislation is needed to make South Korea more competitive, has also vowed to crack down on illegal, violent protests, going so far as to compare demonstrators who wore masks during the November protest to Islamic State militants. A 68-year-old farmer who was struck by water cannon at close range while protesting at the rally remains in a coma.A smaller, peaceful demonstration calling for Ms. Park\u2019s resignation took place in central Seoul on Saturday, with many protesters wearing masks to mock her remarks.Mr. Han\u2019s organization, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, is the country\u2019s second-largest and most militant labor group. It played a crucial role in turning South Korean labor into a potent force, helping organize workers in automaking and other important industries, despite police crackdowns that were sometimes brutal.In recent years, however, many South Koreans concerned about a slowing economy have become skeptical about militant labor activism. Some have accused the confederation of speaking mainly for powerful unions representing workers at big corporations, urging it to fight for the rights of temporary-contract \u201cirregular\u201d workers, whose ranks have ballooned as South Korean companies have increasingly sought such workers.The police recently raided the offices of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, searching for evidence that it had helped organize illegal protests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rates Are Going Up. What Could Go Wrong?", "Date": "2015-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisFire or ice?When expansions end and the economy tips into recession, one or the other is usually to blame.In the past, the culprit has frequently been fire \u2014 an overheating economy and rising inflation \u2014 that prompted the central bank to push up interest rates until they ultimately choked off growth. Ice is more unusual, at least in the United States, but often more painful, as excess capacity, weak demand and falling prices foster a deflationary slump that can prove difficult to escape.\u201cRaising rates the first time may have been the easy part; now comes the challenging part,\u201d said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist for UBS Wealth Management Americas.Fed officials do not have to look far for real-world examples of what can go wrong.European central bankers raised rates twice in 2011, killing off a nascent recovery and plunging the eurozone into a double-dip recession that it is still struggling to overcome.The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has begun the process of raising interest rates, a move that her predecessors have taken in recent decades as they put their own distinctive stamp on the economy.But being too slow to tighten the reins of monetary policy can prove perilous, too.A series of steady quarter-point rate increases by the Fed between 2004 and 2006 seemed prudent at the time, but in hindsight the central bank has been blamed for moving too slowly, failing to head off the economic catastrophe that followed the implosion of the housing bubble in 2007.The biggest problem is that higher interest rates do not bite in predictable ways. Not only do they take time to percolate through the real economy, but there is also a difficult-to-foresee threshold at which the impact can suddenly shift from mild to severe.\u201cI\u2019m sure there is a tipping point,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to know in advance precisely where that is.\u201dAt least for now, though, few analysts expect the Fed\u2019s initial moves to bring the nation\u2019s six-and-a-half-year-old expansion to an abrupt end.\u201cThe rate hike this month and those next year may not really be felt until 2017,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cEvidence from past cycles suggests it could take a year, rather than the next quarter or two.\u201dOfficials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.The Fed\u2019s task this time is even more complicated because other central banks are leaning in the opposite direction.In Asia, the People\u2019s Bank of China is also in easing mode, as officials try to cushion what looks like an increasingly hard landing for the economy there, the world\u2019s second-largest. Similarly, Japan\u2019s central bank is keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels to encourage growth.The combination of lower rates abroad and rising ones at home is making the United States dollar surge against other currencies. While that might be good for American tourists heading overseas, it hurts American manufacturers seeking export markets and makes imported goods more competitive, undermining the country\u2019s trade balance.For now, most economists say the danger of too little inflation outweighs the risk of too much: Ice, in effect, may be more of a worry than fire.\u201cThe risk is skewed toward moving too fast,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true as the strong dollar and lower-priced imports keep inflationary pressures at bay in the United States.\u201dAlthough Mr. Gapen, like most seers on Wall Street, is generally upbeat about the economy\u2019s prospects next year, some of his colleagues elsewhere are less sanguine. David Levy, a longtime private economist, is warning clients that the Fed may be forced to reverse course as weakness in China and emerging markets redounds to the United States.The Fed\u2019s rate increase on Wednesday, Mr. Levy cautioned, \u201cmay well mark a high point in economic expectations for 2016.\u201dIn its statement Wednesday about the decision to raise rates, the Fed itself noted there had been a \u201cshortfall\u201d in terms of actual inflation\u2019s not measuring up to the central bank\u2019s 2 percent goal, which it considers helpful in supporting a more robust economy.Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco, believes the reference to stubbornly low inflation is significant. \u201cThis is new language,\u201d he said. \u201cThe doves on monetary policy are saying they will go along with the rate hike now, but want to see some acknowledgment that low inflation is still a concern.\u201dExactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.For his part, Mr. Anderson expects the economy to continue to grow at a moderate annual pace of about 2.4 percent in 2016. If that forecast for growth is correct, he predicts the Fed will raise rates three times next year, lifting the benchmark rate to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent by the end of 2016.\u201cConsumers are cautious but they still have the capacity to spend,\u201d Mr. Anderson added. \u201cJobs and incomes are growing, debt levels are low and gas at about $2 a gallon should help. When people realize the sky isn\u2019t falling because the Fed is raising rates, they will go back to their usual spending habits and save the day.\u201dA growth rate of about 2 percent would be in line with the steady, but disappointing, advance that has characterized the current recovery since it began in mid-2009. By contrast, the economy grew by 3.8 percent in 2004 when the last tightening cycle began, and by 4 percent in 1994 when an earlier round of rate hikes got underway.The comparatively weak recovery, which has left most Americans struggling to maintain their standard of living, is the principal reason the Fed has promised to move more slowly during this tightening cycle than in past ones.In the mid-2000s, the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage point at every meeting between June 2004 and June 2006, 17 straight increases that lifted rates by more than four full percentage points over two years.The tightening campaign in the 1990s was even steeper, as rates moved up three points in one year. Although that wreaked havoc on the stock and bond markets in 1994, the move may have helped slow growth to a sustainable pace and set the stage for the 1990s expansion to extend for a full decade.Many analysts say that the current expansion could display that kind of longevity.\u201cExpansions don\u2019t die of old age,\u201d Mr. Ryan of UBS said, echoing comments by the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, at her news conference on Wednesday. \u201cThey die from exhausted demand, but consumers aren\u2019t exhausted.\u201d\u201cAnd the backdrop of low inflation won\u2019t force the Fed into an aggressive stance,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThis expansion can go on for a while.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shift to Security Disrupts U.S. Presidential Race", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaWASHINGTON \u2014 Suddenly, the biggest year-end development in the race for the White House is no longer Donald J. Trump\u2019s bombast. It is the reshaped agenda facing every candidate.Recent terrorist attacks now mean that national security, rather than the economy, is at the center of the 2016 campaign. That\u2019s rare in American presidential politics.The shift has already damaged the campaign of the soft-spoken Republican candidate Ben Carson; the former neurosurgeon\u2019s poll standing has dropped amid questions about his grasp of foreign policy.As voting nears in Iowa and New Hampshire, the change could further scramble the Republican race, to say nothing of the general election.Presidential campaigns typically turn on a version of what Ronald Reagan asked in his 1980 debate against the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201dEven that year, as Iranian revolutionaries held American hostages in Tehran, voters said the economy would influence their decision more than foreign policy.\u201cThe natural tendency is for any given election to be about domestic issues,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who advised John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid. \u201cIt has to be pulled, hard, in the other direction.\u201dThe last election to be pulled hard enough was in 2004, three years after the Sept. 11 attacks. Even then, said Mr. Mellman, it took a terrorist massacre in Russia on the eve of the Republican National Convention in New York to \u201clead people back to a national security focus\u201d and cement President George W. Bush\u2019s advantage with jittery American voters.The campaign this year began with a focus by both parties on reducing income inequality and lifting long-stagnant middle-class incomes. Then came Paris and San Bernardino.Public sentiment shifted instantly. In the New York Times-CBS News Poll in early November, a plurality of respondents named the economy as the top issue; in early December, a plurality named terrorism. In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released this week, 40 percent called \u201cnational security and terrorism\u201d the federal government\u2019s top priority, while 23 percent said \u201cjob creation and economic growth.\u201dShifts in the rhetoric of candidates came just as rapidly. In the Republican presidential debate on Tuesday, the changing dynamic led Lindsey Graham, a national security hawk, to utter words previously unspoken in the 2016 campaign: \u201cI miss George W. Bush. I wish he were president right now.\u201dWhether that decisively reshuffles the deck of candidates cannot be forecast. Mr. Trump has defied predictions that his brusque style would eventually turn off voters. Much of the Republican rank-and-file judges him a strong leader and backs his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States.Marco Rubio hopes to profit from his willingness to support government surveillance programs that his rivals Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have opposed. Mr. Cruz casts himself as an \u201cAmerica first\u201d leader who, unlike Mr. Rubio, won\u2019t repeat Mr. Bush\u2019s mistakes in Iraq even as he vows to \u201ccarpet-bomb\u201d the Islamic State.Under once-conventional political calculations \u2014 discounting both her gender and party affiliation \u2014 a shift toward national security would put Hillary Clinton at a disadvantage next November. The Democratic incumbent she aims to succeed is already on the defensive.Yet Mrs. Clinton has managed to etch a slightly more hawkish profile than President Obama. And her first-term service as his secretary of state gives her more national security experience than any other major candidate, although whether that will pay off is unclear.\u201cLack of experience may be better than the experience she does have,\u201d cautioned Jan van Lohuizen, President Bush\u2019s pollster in 2004.That\u2019s one big question for the campaign\u2019s new contours. Even bigger is whether the shift will last.\u201cI don\u2019t know how durable this is,\u201d Mr. van Lohuizen said. \u201cEleven months is a long way to go.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some of those lawmakers argued that the fund did not need more money, while others said the organization was lending recklessly. Last week, however, the Obama administration and the Republican leaders agreed to include ratification of the I.M.F. reforms in the omnibus spending bill that the president signed on Friday.The Republicans appear to have realized that their inaction was undermining America\u2019s leadership in the world. For example, China has been so frustrated that its voting share at the I.M.F. and the World Bank are small relative to the size of its growing economy that it has begun building its own international financial organizations. Several American allies, including Britain, Germany and South Korea, have agreed to invest in one of those new Chinese initiatives, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.Congress also inserted a condition into the omnibus law that should improve the way the I.M.F. makes loans. The American representative on the fund\u2019s board is required to use his vote and influence with others on the board to get the I.M.F. to repeal a controversial policy that allows it to lend to countries that cannot hope to pay back all their loans when the fund\u2019s board determines that not making a loan would harm the global financial system.If the fund and the World Bank are to remain relevant and be truly global organizations, they cannot be seen as European and American fiefs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Rush to Cram Pet Projects Into Spending Deal Ahead of New Deadline", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional negotiators are lurching toward a year-end deal that could combine a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill with a slate of more than $750 billion in tax breaks for businesses and low-income workers, setting off a frenzied push by lawmakers, lobbyists and interest groups to attach pet provisions to the catchall legislative package.Republican leaders on Capitol Hill conceded that they will miss a Friday deadline, and the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday put forward a stopgap measure to prevent a government shutdown and give negotiators an additional five days to reach an agreement.With a presidential election year approaching, and control of Congress also at stake, the current negotiations represent one of the few opportunities in the near future to pass sweeping legislation.\u201cAnyone who wants to get anything done, who has already been frustrated by a virtually nonfunctioning Washington, is trying to cram whatever they can into this bill,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.The proposed changes include numerous Republican priorities, such as blocking an environmental regulation that would expand federal authority over domestic waterways and rejecting a proposed Department of Labor conflict-of-interest rule that would impose new restrictions on financial advisers handling retirement funds.And there are other provisions that would have a more narrow impact, like a tweak to a Depression-era law protecting creditors that critics say would pointedly benefit Apollo Global Management, which owns the Caesars Entertainment casino conglomerate. The House has voted twice in recent months for bills that would lift the ban on crude oil exports, a move eagerly sought by lawmakers in oil-producing states.Ms. MacGuineas has called the end-of-year legislation a borrowing \u201cbonanza\u201d with both parties prepared to add about $1 trillion to the nation\u2019s debt, partly because Democrats are eager for more spending and also because Republicans in Congress do not insist on offsetting tax cuts with reductions in spending.As the risk of a government shutdown looms, lawmakers are racing to attach pet provisions to a sweeping catchall legislative package, including numerous policy prescriptions by Republicans.\u201cIf we were paying for this bill, if we were paying for the tax extenders portion, you wouldn\u2019t be able to put in all these other things,\u201d she said.The spending measure and the tax package were drawn up separately, and ultimately may reach the House and Senate floors that way as well. But as is often the case in Congress, many of the underlying issues have become intertwined as negotiations come down to the wire, and political and policy imperatives collide.Among the policy prescriptions sought by Republicans is a provision that would prevent the National Labor Relations Board from enforcing a rule that would make it easier for employees of fast-food restaurants to unionize.Democrats, in turn, are hoping to extract major concessions in exchange for lifting the oil export ban, including indexing of the child tax credit to inflation, long sought by the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.There are also bipartisan efforts to use the year-end deal to complete legislation that for various reasons lawmakers could never quite push across the finish line, including a bill that would aid emergency workers now suffering from health ailments related to the work at the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack in New York City.In recent years, persistent deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over budget policy \u2014 as well as the general elimination of so-called earmarks, the individual lawmaker-designated provisions, from appropriations bills \u2014 has often left Congress and the White House negotiating over relatively tiny changes in discretionary spending, with far less room for maneuvering by special interests.Paul Winfree, the director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, a conservative think tank, said that some Republican lawmakers were hoping to extract a victory through the policy changes because they were not satisfied with the accord in October that lifted the spending caps.\u201cThey\u2019ve already had weeks and months to negotiate an agreement,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cAnd the only reason that we haven\u2019t come to an agreement is the continued insistence on the part of Republicans to insert ideological riders into the process.\u201dMs. MacGuineas said Democrats and Republicans were complicit in a long legacy of failed federal fiscal policy making.\u201cIt all goes toward a bigger picture in that we don\u2019t budget in a sensible way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have these terrible deals and both sides patting themselves on the back and chortling about successful bipartisan efforts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russian Truckers, Irate Over New Tolls, Block Roads Near Moscow", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe direct object of their ire was Igor Rotenberg, the scion of a billionaire oligarch clan close to Mr. Putin, who owns half of a new, GPS-based system that, when fully operational, will charge truckers fees on all federal highways.Their larger anger, however, was reserved for what they called the government\u2019s failure to alleviate the devastating effects of inflation and recession over the past year, prompted by the steep drop in oil prices, sanctions the West imposed over Ukraine and retaliatory sanctions the Kremlin imposed on Western food imports.\u201cThere is no economic program at all \u2014 where is all the money?\u201d said Vladimir Romanov, 65, the part-owner of a small Moscow trucking firm with three 18-wheelers. \u201cThe country is very rich, yet we live like hell.\u201dThe Russian economy is deeply troubled and shows few signs of escaping from its rut, at least as long as prices for oil and other commodities remain depressed. Inflation is running at 15.6 percent and the economy has shrunk nearly 4 percent in the last year. The ruble has lost about half its value against the dollar, and foreign reserves were hovering around $366 billion, compared with $419 billion a year ago.While that should mean hard times for everyone, some analysts say something else is at work. Given the shrinking oil revenue and the economy, they say, the Russian elite is seeking new revenue streams even at the expense of the middle class.\u201cAt a time when the pie is shrinking, the clans are trying to keep their portion or even expand it,\u201d said Nikolai Petrov, a professor at Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics. The privatized toll system creates a new income source, he noted, but it will cause friction.The truckers are widely dispersed and hence difficult to control, and their sentiments reflect those of the entire middle class, Mr. Petrov said. \u201cThey feel that the government is trying to fix budgetary problems by increasing taxes and taking money out of their pockets,\u201d he said.Under the new system, drivers must buy a tracking device and pay according to their mileage. An 800-mile round trip between Moscow and St. Petersburg costs an extra $33 at current exchange rates and will rise to $66 next March.Truckers said that the new toll amounted to about 10 percent of their revenue for each trip, and that it came on top of other hefty transportation taxes, sharply reducing their monthly wages of around $500 to $600.The government argues that the trucks cause significant road wear and says the tolls will generate more than $700 million a year to pay for maintenance. \u201cThis is how a transportation system functions worldwide,\u201d Maxim Y. Sokolov, the transportation minister, told state television this week.Truckers mocked the idea that the toll money would end up being invested in Russia\u2019s notoriously poor roads.\u201cThey have already increased taxes on fuel and promised to cancel the transportation tax, but they have only increased it,\u201d said Vladimir Deryugin, 51, whose truck sat among roughly 20 lined up in an Ikea parking lot in Khimki, a small city on the northern edge of Moscow. A few bore signs saying \u201cNo to Platon!\u201d \u2014 the Russian acronym for the system. Police cars had blocked all entrances and exits to the lot.The demonstrations-on-wheels are the closest thing to large-scale political protests that Russia has seen since the professional classes took to the streets of Moscow in 2011 and 2012 to oppose the way Mr. Putin returned to the presidency for a third term. That movement was centered in the narrow world of the Moscow and St. Petersburg intelligentsia.The truck drivers are the kind of bedrock Russians for whom Mr. Putin has long been a hero. And even as they railed about the new tolls and the economy, they retained a certain reluctance to criticize the man himself.\u201cOur president was duped,\u201d Mr. Romanov said. \u201cHe signed without thinking. His friends duped him. The son studied in Britain, then he came back. He needs to earn money. So Rotenberg comes to the president and tells him: let the son earn money.\u201dThe new toll system is operational only in the Moscow region for now, but since that is such a national hub it has already elicited protests across the country, including in the Dagestan republic, in the cities of Vologda, Nizhny Novgorod, Bryansk, in Smolensk in eastern Russia, in Yekaterinburg in the central Urals, and in St. Petersburg.One trucker from distant Vladivostok commented on social media that he wanted to join the demonstrations but that the roads were so bad it would take him 12 days to make the cross-country trip.Some analysts consider the protests proof that what is widely called the \u201ctelevision\u201d \u2014 government propaganda about Russia\u2019s rising status in the world \u2014 is losing its edge over the \u201cfridge,\u201d or economic problems.\u201cThe reserves are not limitless,\u201d said Alexander Auzan, the economics dean at Moscow State University, speaking on Dozhd television. \u201cWhat we see now, the situation with the truckers, is the first rumble of thunder somewhere far away.\u201dThe government evidently hopes to ride out the protests, which went unreported on the main state-run television news channel.The police were the first line of defense, establishing checkpoints on the outer reaches of the capital to block access to the MKAD, the major ring road circling the city. If that becomes paralyzed, traffic backs up all across Moscow.The police tried a number of strategies to thwart the protesters. They declared some drivers drunk, truckers said, allowing them to suspend their licenses for 24 hours. Sometimes the police \u201cdiscovered\u201d a mechanical problem making the vehicle unfit to drive. Some drivers were forced to sign pledges that they would not join any protest. Eventually the police settled for corralling the trucks into one six-mile section of the road and diverting other traffic.The city of Moscow announced on Friday that it would have to limit traffic the city center in December to prepare for the Victory Day parade \u2014 which is held in May. The state Duma, or Parliament, has tried to mollify the protesters, lowering the fines for noncompliance and limiting the penalty to one fine per day.The Putin administration itself repeatedly offered dialogue and compromise in the form of graduated tariffs, but the truckers are demanding the tolls be scrapped entirely. Mr. Putin himself has not commented publicly on the protests.His spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters that it was not a presidential matter but an issue for the ministry of transportation.Truckers like Mr. Romanov said that support for Mr. Putin \u2014 whose approval ratings have been above 80 percent ever since he annexed Crimea in March 2014 \u2014 has dropped universally among drivers forced to pay the new tax. There has been some online chatter and some public discussion about whether the anger was enough to spark a Maidan, the protests in central Kiev that brought down the government of neighboring Ukraine in early 2014.Mr. Romanov said that the drivers had no such thing in mind, and that they only wanted to earn a living.\u201cWe don\u2019t need a Maidan here, we don\u2019t need any extremism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are normal people without political demands. We just don\u2019t want the government to get into our pockets.\u201dSome of those watching had other ideas. All across Moscow, the movement of the trucks circling the city was being monitored on various social media, inspiring a lively stream of criticism and support.\u201cWhy only the ring road?\u201d said one, \u201cWhy not Red Square?\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Scenes in Luxury", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBain, Boston Consulting and McKinsey are the big boys on the block but many smaller agencies play significant roles in luxury brand research and development. Here is a short introduction to a few of them:PCHFrom design to deliveryLiam Casey is an evangelist on the subject of user experience.As one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on bringing products from concept to consumer, Mr. Casey believes that great experiences are the capital of the 21st-century economy. He is the founder and chief executive of PCH, a manufacturing consulting firm based in Cork, Ireland, with satellite offices in San Francisco and Shenzhen, China.Over the past two decades, PCH, which acts as a middleman between makers of high-tech devices and China, has helped some of the world\u2019s biggest companies deliver such experiences.Relying on a network of 1,200 factories in China and more than 2,600 employees worldwide, the company designs, engineers, develops, fabricates and distributes mostly hardware products for clients that include Apple and Beats by Dre.According to a PCH fact sheet, 11.5 million components pass through its operations daily. In 2014, the company\u2019s revenues totaled more than $1.1 billion.Mr. Casey, 49, who comes from County Cork, Ireland, cut his teeth in the fashion business. After spending time in Southern California, he worked for a company that traded in computer hardware. The year was 1996, and he sensed an opportunity in Asia. He founded PCH \u2014 then called PCH International, after the Pacific Coast Highway in California \u2014 that same year.\u201cOne thing I saw early on was the tech world wasn\u2019t very user-friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fashion world was. You could go to a fabric mill and take the fabric to a contract manufacturer and produce a garment pretty fast, whereas in the technology world, there was a very long lead time.\u201dMr. Casey is convinced that thanks to the advent of such tools as 3-D printing and crowdfunding, the notion of \u201cfast tech\u201d is around the proverbial corner.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing fashion cycles with devices that you wouldn\u2019t have seen in the past \u2014 like Zara bringing a product from concept to store in two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to happen in tech.\u201dWith PCH\u2019s Highway1 program, Mr. Casey is helping entrepreneurs, especially those in wearable devices, bridge the tech and fashion worlds. Start-ups \u2014 such as the smart jewelry maker Ringly and Chronos, a device maker whose disc transforms a traditional timepiece into a wearable \u2014 send staff members to San Francisco to spend four months learning how to develop, manufacture and distribute their products.Christina d\u2019Avignon, the founder and chief executive of Ringly, joined the program in August 2013. She said that she had not known about PCH or Mr. Casey but that after meeting him, she was sold.\u201cHis vision struck a nerve with us,\u201d Ms. d\u2019Avignon said. \u201cHe\u2019d worked on a bunch of Apple products and his attention to detail and good design resonated with us. It was really about learning how to build a hardware company and learning everything involved in building and shipping a product.\u201cOne of the biggest takeaways for me: It helped expand our network in manufacturing and hardware,\u201d she added. \u201cPlus, we were introduced to people in that space and other companies involved in the program. We can now call up those other companies and ask them things like \u2018Who did you use for PR?\u2019 It\u2019s nice to have that network.\u201dThe final piece of the puzzle is retail. In March, PCH acquired the e-commerce site Fab so it could deliver products directly to consumers. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating the Netflix of hardware,\u201d Mr. Casey likes to say, meaning the website will sell things that cannot be found elsewhere (like Netflix\u2019s original programming).He predicts that customized experiences focused on \u201cdiscovery and limited-edition items\u201d will become increasingly important as a bulwark against global homogenization. \u201cPeople travel so much and see everything through social media,\u201d he said, \u201cso product has to be different in different geographies and stores.\u201dMr. Casey points out that the luxury trade, with its emphasis on exclusive, small-batch production, is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the new manufacturing paradigm, which involves creating lean supply chains. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in filling warehouses with products,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think make less, not more.\u201d \u2014 VICTORIA GOMELSKYVELVETGetting in touch, digitally, in AsiaDespite its economic downturn, China continues to lead luxury spending, accounting for 31 percent of global sales, according to the annual report from the consultancy Bain & Company.But brands, including some of the world\u2019s biggest luxury names, still need help in telling their stories in China.\u2018\u2018You need to educate the Chinese market,\u2019\u2019 said Patrice Nordey, a digital consultant. \u2018\u2018The challenge is the way you tell the story. You have to look to the future and be contemporary in communication.\u2019\u2019Mr. Nordey and his Shanghai agency, Velvet Group, are helping to decrypt digital in China for clients such as Dior and Bottega Veneta, advising them on how to reach shoppers through native social media such as Weibo and WeChat.\u2018\u2018China is a great playground to work for luxury companies, even though they\u2019re late in adopting these trends,\u2019\u2019 he said.In 1998 Mr. Nordey began his own online magazine, which the French television network M6 later bought. He then worked with L\u2019Atelier, BNP Paribas\u2019s finance and technology digital consulting arm, which took him to China.Even though he grew up in the window-shopping paradise of Paris, Mr. Nordey said he didn\u2019t know much about luxury, or at least he didn\u2019t think he did, until he moved to China. \u2018\u2018It was a specialty I didn\u2019t know I had,\u2019\u2019 he said, until he realized he was a Parisian accustomed to luxury as quotidian.Mr. Nordey branched out in 2013 and opened his Shanghai agency after deciding he wanted to \u2018\u2018live the big adventure of digital here.\u2019\u2019He says that in China, Western brands cannot expect to be successful if they use the same techniques they use at home. \u2018\u2018Delivering a campaign full of Caucasian faces doesn\u2019t work,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Nordey said. \u2018\u2018Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne with Mango work. But anyone lesser known doesn\u2019t translate.\u2019\u2019For the Spanish retailer Mango\u2019s recent global campaign #somethingincommon, Velvet Group adapted the campaign\u2019s photo-sharing concept for Chinese markets by creating a custom user-driven Web application for WeChat and other platforms.WeChat, which boasted of as many as 600 million users in August, is a gateway for European and American brands to connect to young, affluent Chinese consumers, he said.\u2018\u2018No one can explain WeChat, but it\u2019s like Facebook mixed with WhatsApp. You have to come here to get it,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Nordey said \u2014 or, as he prefers, you can just ask his team.The company also has trained clients like L\u2019Oreal and Kering\u2019s Asia operation in digital culture, so they can formulate their own digital strategies. \u2018\u2018We have no fear of not being used after,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Because we keep track of digital and innovation so they don\u2019t have to.\u2019\u2019Santiago Alvarez, a general manager for the Spanish company Puig, hired Velvet to better understand the Chinese digital terrain and to help particularly with marketing fragrances from its brand Nina Ricci brand.\u2018\u2018The digital scene is constantly evolving in China,and we thought that an agency was able to cope with that evolution better than us,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Alvarez said. \u2018\u2018The key was then to find someone whom we felt comfortable and could really partner with, and Velvet clearly understood our company ambition and brands\u2019 DNAs.\u2019\u2019Despite its digital focus, the Velvet Group doesn\u2019t discount the value of an old-fashioned face to face contact. In September, the agency organized the third edition of Shanghai Fashion Web, an annual conference that connects luxury brands and digital influencers such as bloggers.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s two different worlds,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The world of geeks and world of fashion don\u2019t necessarily get along. But we bring them together.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 JAKE CIGAINEROMATERIAL CONNEXIONSustainability and innovationSustainability may be only one of the thoughts in luxury companies\u2019 minds when they come to Material ConneXion to research fabrics and materials, but the resulting products often do reflect that value.\u2018\u2018The luxury market is perhaps one of most sustainable because of the longevity of the product,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Andrew Dent, one of the company\u2019s vice presidents, said. \u2018\u2018It might use expensive materials and require a lengthy process, but I might keep it 10, 15, 20 years.\u2019\u2019Material ConneXion, whose clients include BMW, Herm\u00e8s and Neiman Marcus, maintains what it calls \u2018\u2018the world\u2019s largest subscription-based materials library, with more than 7,500 innovative materials and processes across all disciplines of design,\u2019\u2019 samples that may be examined by library members such as Chanel, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Tiffany & Co.Those materials, all of which are commercially available, are kept in offices in seven cities around the world, including New York, Milan and Tokyo, with about 60 employees maintaining and curating the collection. Dr. Dent, who earned his doctorate in materials science from Cambridge University in 1994, has been vice president of the company\u2019s library and materials research since 2006.The company, privately owned by the diversified media company Sandow, also advises clients who are looking for specific types of materials or trying to have something created for innovative, high-performance products they are creating. Materials that appeal to luxury industries tend to fall into two categories, Dr. Dent said: traditional and technological.In either case, it\u2019s the work that goes into honing a material into something capable of extraordinary performance that makes the difference, he noted: \u2018\u2018With the right amount of time and effort, you can take some quite pedestrian materials and make them work incredibly well.\u2019\u2019During consultations, he said, Material ConneXion works to educate clients on the value of reducing environmental impact. impacts.\u2018\u2018There are no sustainable materials, only the sustainable use of those materials,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Dent said, adding that true sustainability requires looking at the big picture. \u2018\u2018You need to be aware of the overall impact. Sometimes using a virgin rather than recycled material turns out to be the more sustainable choice.\u2019\u2019The use of carbon fiber in the nose cones of Boeing airplanes is an example, he said: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a composite material, but the weight reduction, compared to the metal that it used to be made of, saves so much fuel that it becomes ecological in its use.\u2019\u2019A problem that supporters of sustainability run into, he said, is that some of the most effective tactics are the hardest to explain. Making use of recycled materials, by contrast, is easy to understand and to convey to the public.\u2018\u2018People hear that you\u2019re using recycled materials, so that must be better,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Dent said, but if something requires replacing in a few years, or less, any benefits derived from its production are lost.\u2018\u2018The challenge a lot of companies have, is they need to do a little of both. They need the attention-grabbing statement, but they also need the fundamental system efficiencies,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018Yes, use recycled materials, get that market share, get everyone talking about you, but also take steps that will allow shaving seconds off the process, of shaving grams off the final product,\u2019\u2019 which will make a larger difference in the end. \u2014 HUGH BAILEYINNOSIGHTDisruption becomes the futureWords seem to suggest themselves in pairs when it comes to Innosight, the 15-year-old business strategy consulting company. One pair, in a play on the company\u2019s name, is innovation and insight; another, to judge by a recent visit, is nature and art; still another, a question: \u2018\u2018What else?\u2019\u2019Innosight occupies a two-story brick building that the company leases in a research park in Lexington, Mass., not far from Boston and Cambridge.Here and there among its offices, glass walls unexpectedly frame birches and other ornamentals in an example of what home d\u00e9cor magazines call bringing the outside in. And the company\u2019s offices, which are anchored by a skylighted lobby and include such elements as \u2018\u2018team rooms\u2019\u2019 and the flexible and modular Business Design Lab, for idea and strategy sessions, are punctuated by colorful modern art on rotational loan from the nearby deCordova museum.Founded in 2000 by Clayton M. Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who originated the business theory known as disruptive innovation, and Mark W. Johnson, Innosight is rooted \u2018\u2018entirely in the future business,\u2019\u2019 said Scott D. Anthony, the company\u2019s managing partner, who is based in Singapore. (The company has 15 people there, with 75 others in North America and six in Lausanne, Switzerland.)Innosight has worked on projects like Procter & Gamble\u2019s New Growth Factory and reorganizing the jeanswear division of VF Corporation, resulting in, it has said, $100 million in new revenue in the first year.Disruptive innovation theory, Mr. Anthony explained, is one that \u2018\u2018transforms an existing market or creates a new one by making the complicated simple and the expensive affordable,\u2019\u2019 adding that it can \u2018\u2018give you some lenses where you look at the world a little differently and see things that you might miss otherwise.\u2019\u2019 (The theory has been hotly debated and drawn some critics, particularly in the last year or so.)\u2018\u2018We\u2019re not about looking backwards to try to analyze what happened to help people do an even better job of what they\u2019re currently doing today,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Anthony said during an interview at the home office. \u2018\u2018Rather, we\u2019re about helping them interpret what can be very soft signals sometimes \u2014 to pick up what can be \u2018edge senses\u2019 about what might happen \u2014 and then very confidently move forward in the face of significant uncertainty.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 MAUREEN BROWNAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Leaders Commit to Energy Goals at Climate Conference", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Unilever. Total. Bank of America. Patagonia. Ikea. Some of the world\u2019s largest companies \u2014 and brands \u2014 announced their commitment on Tuesday to cutting carbon emissions and participating in practices that would support sustainable energy.Also, representatives of the Chinese government, the world\u2019s No. 1 carbon emitter, released new climate goals that called for a substantial buildup of alternative energy sources like wind and solar.To be sure, the executives were self-selective, agreeing to appear on panels because of their interest in embracing climate goals, which are being intensely discussed by representatives of 195 countries at a converted airplane hangar north of Paris in Le Bourget. The deadline for a deal is Friday.But the array of companies \u2014 from furniture to food, investment funds to insurers \u2014 acknowledging the need for rapid and strong action to offset the worst effects of climate change was nonetheless notable.\u201cScience shows that climate change will reduce food productivity and food security at the same time our world\u2019s population is growing and requiring us to feed more people with fewer natural resources,\u201d said John Bryant, the chief executive of the Kellogg Company, who announced that by 2050 the company would cut its emissions by 65 percent and help reduce those of its suppliers by 50 percent.The business executives spoke of the need to address the problem and the profit-making opportunities solutions could offer.\u201cWe are not going to solve this at government level,\u201d said John Kerry, the United States secretary of state, speaking to an audience largely drawn from the business community at the American ambassador\u2019s Paris residence on the eve of the conference. \u201cYou are going to make the difference.\u201dIn a passionate speech, Mr. Kerry said that he thought the current United Nations-organized negotiations to tackle climate change were different from past efforts because \u201csomething is happening at the grass-roots level of countries around the world.\u201dMr. Kerry forecast that the business community would produce breakthroughs in areas like clean energy. But, some said, what may be even more powerful is the business world\u2019s realization that operations that produce low emissions and that are otherwise sustainable are now good business, rather than a luxury that few can afford.Business leaders on Tuesday concurred.\u201cBusiness isn\u2019t stupid; we are not putting money into a bottomless pit,\u201d said Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, the maker of consumer goods.Mr. Polman said that Unilever\u2019s recent investments in new plants running on clean energy and other new technologies were producing hefty 23 percent returns on capital.In the medium term, though, the shift is likely to be disruptive and uncomfortable, especially for companies wedded to outdated business models, some said.Particularly hard hit will be electric utilities, which are struggling to adjust to an environment in which the power they produce from natural gas and coal is being squeezed out by wind and solar energy. There are even questions about whether the traditional electric power system will survive.Among the highlights of the conference:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Plan to Rank \u2018Just\u2019 Companies Aims to Close the Wealth Gap", "Date": "2015-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaul Tudor Jones II, the hedge-fund billionaire, has a plan to reduce income inequality. He wants to rate companies on their probity, not their profits.Just Capital will rank corporations on how well, or \u201cjustly,\u201d they treat employees, society and the environment. The idea is to laud companies that offer better pay, happier workplaces and greater transparency \u2014 and perhaps shame others to follow suit.This kind of moral index, Mr. Jones said, \u201ccould not only impact investors, it could impact consumers, it might impact the way companies hire, the way people go and work with companies; it will impact boardrooms, everything.\u201dThe project began, improbably enough, in 2011 in the chic Manhattan design store ABC Carpet and Home when Mr. Chopra was whisked away from his salon in a friend\u2019s chauffeured car to an Occupy Wall Street rally.Today, with a presidential election looming and calls for the wealthy to pay more in taxes coming not only from populist politicians but also from billionaires like Warren E. Buffett, even members of the top 1 percent of the 1 percent are passionately inveighing against the wealth gap.While there has not exactly been a groundswell among the wealthy to significantly raise their own taxes, Mr. Icahn and Mr. Buffett are among several of America\u2019s prominent top earners who have endorsed changing the tax loophole that treats a large portion of private-equity and hedge-fund managers\u2019 income \u2014 known as carried interest \u2014 as more lightly taxed capital gains and require it to be taxed as regular salary. In a statement responding to questions for this article, Mr. Jones said his \u201cstrong opinion\u201d was that carried interest should be taxed as ordinary income.\u201cBillionaires see a backlash coming,\u201d said Sam Wilkin, an economist and author of \u201cWealth Secrets of the One Percent.\u201d Mr. Jones has experienced it firsthand. In March, the Hedge Clippers, a coalition of labor groups and community activists, marched on his Greenwich, Conn., estate to protest the influence of hedge-fund managers.Mr. Jones argues that income inequality is being driven by what he calls \u201cshareholder hegemony,\u201d the principle that companies first and foremost should satisfy investors. The solution is for companies to make social responsibility as important as profits and share price.Mr. Jones, who declined to be interviewed, has a net worth Forbes estimates at $4.7 billion and was one of the few hedge-fund managers who foresaw the 1987 market crash. He is known for founding the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization started in 1988 that raised $101 million last year for anti-poverty programs in New York.There are many nonprofits that seek to address income inequality. Mr. Jones and Mr. Chopra bring a waft of New Age spirituality to theirs. The Just Capital board includes Arianna Huffington, a founder of The Huffington Post, and several wealthy business leaders who also are directors of the Chopra Foundation.Mr. Chopra, in an interview, described his friend as being on a path of self-discovery. \u201cThis is an evolution for him.\u201dIt all started with meditation. In early October 2011, Dylan Ratigan, an MSNBC anchor who later left to become what he described as a \u201csustainability entrepreneur,\u201d was on his way to a private meditation session at Mr. Chopra\u2019s salon in ABC Carpet and Home just as the Occupy Wall Street protests were getting started in Zuccotti Park. On an impulse, Mr. Ratigan told his teacher that he had a car waiting downstairs and asked Mr. Chopra to go with him to the park.When they arrived, Mr. Ratigan asked the protesters to let Mr. Chopra speak. Some of them fiercely objected to letting a celebrity jump the line, but Mr. Ratigan prevailed, and Mr. Chopra led the crowd in a meditative prayer that, as he put it, \u201cquieted the angry rhetoric.\u201d That fall, he became a featured guest at several Occupy events and was so struck by the \u201cperceived injustice\u201d fueling the protests that he told a friend: \u201cWe need to do something about this.\u201dThe idea for Just Capital emerged from a seminar Mr. Chopra held at Columbia Business School called \u201cJust Capital and Cause-Driven Marketing.\u201d A student suggested creating an index of companies based on their value to society, not quarterly profits. Mr. Chopra took the idea to Mr. Jones, whom he had met through Mr. Jones\u2019s wife, Sonia, a yoga and wellness enthusiast.Mr. Chopra said that, so far, he had not received skeptical responses to the Just Capital idea, but he conceded that the jury had been small and \u201cself-selected.\u201dMr. Jones set up the foundation in 2013, hired a staff and underwrote a survey of 43,000 Americans to determine what people most valued in a company. The No. 1 factor was pay and benefits. (At No. 10 was creating jobs in the United States.) Next year Just Capital plans to publish a ranking of the top 1,000 publicly traded companies based on a scale derived from the survey. \u201cAmericans want a seat at the table,\u201d Mr. Jones said at the September presentation.There are many research firms, including MSCI and Sustainalytics, that examine companies for social responsibility, although their data is mostly reserved for clients and subscribers. Just Capital plans to make its ratings public at no charge.Because Just Capital will examine only publicly traded corporations, Mr. Jones\u2019s hedge fund and thousands of others like it will be exempt from scrutiny. At the Just Capital presentation, Mr. Jones said he checked to make sure his own company, Tudor Investment Corporation, was in line with Just Capital\u2019s principles.Tudor Investment employs about 400 people, according to a spokesman, Patrick Clifford. Its traders, of course, make well above a living wage.At first, the wages of gardeners, dishwashers and janitors at Tudor were not included in the review because they are employed by subcontractors, not Tudor directly. When managers examined the salaries, however, they found that the firm had 16 subcontracted workers who were paid $10.50 an hour.\u201cIt was literally eye-opening and embarrassing at the same time,\u201d Mr. Jones said. He said he raised their hourly rate to $15.For comparison, in Fairfield County, where Tudor is based, janitors who belong to Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union make $14.10 an hour, not including benefits, and $20.49 an hour with benefits factored in. According to the M.I.T. living wage calculator, the living wage for a single worker in the county is $12.78 an hour and for an adult with one child it is $27.72.Last spring, Mr. Jones leased an office and bought a $71 million house in Palm Beach, Fla., in a state with no income tax. He also said he increased the percentage of profit the company donates to charity to 4 percent a year from 1 percent. According to CECP, an organization that monitors corporate giving trends, the industry median last year was 1 percent.At the conference this year announcing Just Capital, a guest asked him if he was the best messenger to preach corporate altruism, given that \u201cshareholder hegemony\u201d helped make him wealthy. Mr. Jones had a ready reply. He had been rethinking the capitalist dream, he said, ever since hearing about the \u201cgiving pledge,\u201d a promise made by Bill Gates, Mr. Buffett and others to give away much of their wealth.\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of accumulating all this money when I\u2019m just going to give it back to the people I conceivably took it from?\u201d Mr. Jones said.An article on Monday about Just Capital, a nonprofit organization created by the hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones II and the self-help author Deepak Chopra to address income inequality, described Mr. Chopra\u2019s eyeglass frames incorrectly.

Living in a yurt, he spends his days pondering the transcendent wisdom of tweets by top venture capitalists before apparently being trampled to death by vicu\u00f1as.He leaves behind scattered writing, including lovingly handwritten reproductions of tweets from the real feeds of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful investors, including Brad Feld (\u201cReminder to self: Not happy with game? Change the game\u201d) and Paul Graham (\u201cIf you try to outlaw the future it will just happen somewhere else\u201d).Recipients of the book, including venture capitalists and prominent journalists who cover the technology industry, were baffled. Was this a brilliant viral marketing scheme, a literary treasure hunt orchestrated by some corporation angling for free publicity to promote a new energy drink or video game? Or was it a purely artistic endeavor, aimed at stimulating a discussion about how the tech boom has altered our culture, economy and society?Months later, the mystery remains unsolved. But the question of who wrote the book, and why, is still eating away at some tech industry insiders and could soon be confounding a much wider audience. On Tuesday, Farrar, Straus & Giroux\u2019s paperback imprint, FSG Originals, is publishing a small paperback edition of \u201cIterating Grace,\u201d with a 10,000-copy print run.\u201cEveryone assumed it must be corporate hackery, because who does this just for fun?\u201d said Alexis Madrigal, the editor in chief of the news organization Fusion and one of the recipients. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird in this day and age to just do an art project.\u201dTheories and accusations ricocheted around social media as readers debated who was behind the elaborate stunt. Prime suspects included the novelists Dave Eggers and Joshua Cohen, who have both written sharply satirical novels about Silicon Valley, as well as Po Bronson, Susan Orlean and Robin Sloan.\u201cI wish I had done it,\u201d said Mr. Sloan, author of \u201cMr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore.\u201d \u201cIt pains me to deny authorship, because it\u2019s so cool.\u201d\u201cIterating Grace,\u201d which amounts to an extended inside joke for techies, may not find many converts outside Silicon Valley. Its antihero, Koons Crooks, is a parody of a burned-out programmer, \u201can inexhaustible foot soldier of the first dot-com boom.\u201d He shouts commands at his dog in Unix, an early computer operating system, and is \u201cfully post-meal,\u201d subsisting on endless snacks like frozen dumplings. His trampled, decomposing body is discovered near a tattered fleece vest that says Pixelon, a reference to a failed start-up from the first dot-com boom and bust.After consulting Koons\u2019s mad scribblings in the margins of books, an unidentified narrator pieces together the story of his journey to Bolivia, and his growing obsession with the Twitter feeds of venture capitalists. \u201cHe contemplated individual tweets for days, sometimes weeks,\u201d the anonymous narrator writes. \u201cThe answers he\u2019d been searching for had been there, in the Bay Area\u2019s innovation economy, all along \u2014 articulated, unwittingly, by an elite class of entrepreneurial high priests.\u201dThe brief, tragicomic tale is just 18 pages long, interspersed with reproductions of handwritten tweets. The paperback costs $8, and the e-book is $5.Even with the backing of a major publishing house, the authors \u2014 there are two of them \u2014 have insisted on hiding their identities. Not even their editor, Sean McDonald, knows who they are. Only one person at the publishing house, a person who works in the contracts department, knows their real names, Mr. McDonald said.\u201cThey don\u2019t see any point to being identified,\u201d said Mr. McDonald, who spoke to the authors on the phone and exchanged emails with them. \u201cIt sounds kind of goofy to say it, but there\u2019s a purity in people paying attention to the book itself, and putting a name on that might deflate that.\u201dMr. McDonald said he first learned about the book over the summer after speculation arose that Mr. Sloan, one of the authors he works with, was the mastermind behind the project. He was instantly intrigued. So was Mr. Sloan\u2019s literary agent, Sarah Burnes, who also asked Mr. Sloan if he was the author. He denied it, but told her he was a fan of the work and urged her to reach out to the author through an email address listed on the booklet.She sent an email, and about three weeks later, got a reply. After several conversations, the authors agreed to publish \u201cIterating Grace,\u201d as long as their identities were not revealed. Farrar, Straus & Giroux paid a low five-figure sum for the book. Through the publisher, the authors declined an interview request.\u201cWe kept talking about how obviously it was impossible to publish this kind of thing at a major publishing house, but it seemed crazy enough and fun enough to try to make it possible,\u201d Mr. McDonald said.To reproduce the Twitter messages, Farrar, Straus & Giroux sought permission from the venture capitalists who wrote them, among them Mr. Feld and Mr. Graham as well as Chris Sacca and Andrew Parker, whose cryptic tweet, \u201cthe decentralization of everything,\u201d already sounds like a parody.Not everyone agrees the story succeeds as satire.Casey Newton, the Silicon Valley editor for the technology news site The Verge, who was one of the first recipients, said he still suspected that the book was part of some viral marketing scheme.\u201cWhen it comes to any sort of stunt that gets a lot of attention on social media, all roads lead back to Taco Bell or Mountain Dew,\u201d Mr. Newton said. \u201cThe mystery would be more interesting if the book was good.\u201dOthers argue that the book perfectly captures the profound and growing influence that venture capitalists wield in today\u2019s start-up culture.\u201cV.C.s have become San Francisco\u2019s de facto philosopher kings, doling out financial, political and spiritual advice while amassing enormous cultural sway,\u201d said Nellie Bowles, a former writer for the tech blog Recode, who has a cameo in \u201cIterating Grace\u201d and is working on a TV show about start-ups for Fox. \u201cIt\u2019s high time people take the whole thing to task.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fannie and Freddie\u2019s Government Rescue Has Come With Claws", "Date": "2015-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn May 9, 2012, the executives of Fannie Mae, the beleaguered mortgage finance company, finally went public with good news: After three and a half years as a ward of the state, it was profitable again.But even as Fannie\u2019s profit report brought hope to shareholders, it also stirred government officials to action. The day after Fannie\u2019s announcement, court documents show, a high-level official at the agency that regulates the lender sent an email to a colleague. In it, the official asked for legal advice regarding a proposed change to the repayment terms of the government\u2019s bailout of Fannie Mae and its brother mortgage backer, Freddie Mac.The decision to sweep into the Treasury all of the companies\u2019 profits \u2014 which by now have far exceeded the amount of the total bailout and dividends owed \u2014 has attracted legal challenges from institutional investors and speculators in Fannie and Freddie. Originally set up by the federal government to make homeownership feasible in good times and bad, Fannie and Freddie were private companies with an implicit government guarantee.The investors maintain that the government\u2019s action was an improper taking of private property. Some legal experts also contend that the action violated state laws. The Obama administration disputes the charges and is fighting them in court.Whatever the legal implications, the August 2012 change in the bailout terms reflected a series of decisions made by the Obama administration that have prevented the mortgage companies from benefiting fully from their recovery.Indeed, from their September 2008 bailout until the present day, these government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.s \u2014 which guarantee 80 percent of mortgages nationwide \u2014 have faced demands from their overseers that were far more draconian than anything asked of the big banks also rescued during the financial crisis.Logan Beirne, a fellow at the Information Society Project at Yale Law School and a lecturer there, is among those who are critical of the government\u2019s action.\u201cThe political winds of the moment make it popular to punish these companies and their remaining owners and reap the benefits for the taxpayers,\u201d Mr. Beirne said, adding that he did not own a stake in either Fannie or Freddie. \u201cBut I think it sets a horrible precedent and it violates the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 as well as traditional corporate law practices.\u201dSome investors who are now suing the government bought shares in the companies after the government profit-taking led to another collapse in their value. These investors believed the companies would turn around once the mortgage crisis receded and the economy recovered, and also saw an opportunity to challenge the legality of the government\u2019s move.Legions of individuals who bought their shares before the crisis no doubt expected to see their investments recover, as holders in Bank of America and Citigroup, two major recipients of taxpayer assistance, have. They have been disappointed.An unexpected clue to the Obama administration\u2019s stance on Fannie and Freddie emerged last year in a trial about another government bailout: that of the American International Group, the insurance giant.Testifying in the case, Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, said that when the government took over Fannie and Freddie, as well as A.I.G., it made clear \u201cthey would be dismembered, not allowed to live on as independent entities with the scope and reach they had before the crisis.\u201dThrough a spokesman, Mr. Geithner declined to comment.That legislation, which set new capital requirements for Fannie and Freddie and created a new, more powerful regulator to oversee them, was clear about what would happen in a government takeover: If placed temporarily into conservatorship, the companies were to be managed in ways that would safeguard their assets.Since the earliest days of the Obama administration, however, the Treasury and F.H.F.A. have worked closely together, documents show.A spokesman for the Treasury, Adam Hodge, said the decision to take the companies\u2019 profits ended a vicious cycle in which the companies paid dividends to the government even if they did not have the money to cover them. The agreement to change the deal \u201cwas executed by two sophisticated parties,\u201d he added.As to the matter of F.H.F.A.\u2019s independence from the Treasury, Mr. Hodge said the regulator \u201chas repeatedly demonstrated its independent authority\u201d; he cited F.H.F.A.\u2019s refusal to allow principal reductions in Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s loan modification programs, as well as its recent decision letting the companies increase executive pay.But the government\u2019s actions have even hurt its own investment in Fannie and Freddie. Under the terms of the bailout, the Treasury received a large stake in both companies. This stake would rise in value if the companies were allowed to keep their profits and rebuild their capital.Moving back and forth between private practice and public service, several people had central roles inside the Obama administration in developing a new housing finance policy that would phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Richard X. Bove, a longtime bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, said it was difficult to measure what taxpayers might receive for their stake if the companies were allowed to recapitalize and exit the conservatorship. But the value of the stake could exceed $200 billion, he said.\u201cThey\u2019re just giving it away for nothing,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cI don\u2019t get that.\u201dThe timing of the 2012 profit sweep announcement was fortunate for the Obama administration: It followed a tumultuous period when government spending had come up against the debt ceiling, threatening to cause a federal default with potentially catastrophic consequences. Since then, the profits from Fannie and Freddie have helped the Treasury Department manage its debt during showdowns with Congress.But beyond noting that absorbing Fannie and Freddie\u2019s profits protects the taxpayer, the government has said little about how the profit sweep decision came about. Indeed, in the shareholder lawsuits, the Obama administration has made unusual demands for secrecy, keeping a tight lid on documents related to the move.(Lawyers for The Times have asked the judge overseeing this case in the Court of Federal Claims in Washington to unseal some of the materials, a request the government has battled. In September, the judge said it was too soon to rule on that request.)The administration\u2019s dealings with Fannie and Freddie reflect its stated desire to wind down the companies. And for years after their rescue, the companies were political pariahs because of the size of the taxpayer bailout. Some experts say that phasing out the government-sponsored mortgage lenders could ultimately make the housing finance system safer and sounder.But the administration, by law, cannot put Fannie and Freddie out of business. That job rests with Congress, which would have to revoke the companies\u2019 charters. In the meantime, the 2008 Housing and Economic Recovery Act directs the companies\u2019 conservator to \u201cpreserve and conserve\u201d their assets and property.Two legislative efforts to eliminate Fannie and Freddie have failed to pass in Congress in recent years. During the same period, the Treasury and F.H.F.A. made a series of decisions that have pushed Fannie and Freddie to draw more money from the government\u2019s coffers.The dividend rate the companies were required to pay in the bailout, for example, was 10 percent \u2014 twice that required of the banks receiving money under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.Another disparity: The Treasury provided monetary incentives to the big banks to help cover their costs of modifying borrowers\u2019 mortgages, but Fannie and Freddie received no such funds.The government also imposed far stricter requirements on Fannie and Freddie in another way. The companies had to set aside money for expected mortgage losses early on in their conservatorship. Although these were only accounting provisions, they forced the companies to draw more funds from the Treasury rescue than they would have otherwise.For one thing, the set-asides far exceeded the actual losses experienced by the companies after the crisis subsided. Even more telling: The provisions for loan losses were significantly higher than those required of the major banks by their auditors.From 2006 through 2011, for example, provisions for losses at Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were about one to one \u2014 that is, roughly equivalent to the actual net losses the banks took on home loans from 2007 through 2012.The story for Fannie and Freddie was different. Under the government overseers, the companies\u2019 provisions for loan losses were 1.65 to one during the same period.Edward J. DeMarco, a former Treasury official, was acting director of F.H.F.A. from September 2009 to January 2014, the period when many of these decisions were made. He declined to comment for this article, citing the litigation. A spokeswoman for the F.H.F.A. declined to comment.And when Mr. DeMarco in 2013 outlined F.H.F.A.\u2019s plans for the companies in conservatorship, he noted that the administration \u201chas made clear that their preferred course of action is to wind down the enterprises.\u201dBut in 2012, when profits began to materialize at Fannie and Freddie, a huge accounting windfall was created at the companies. Those profits created what is known as a deferred tax asset.Recognizing the value of this asset \u2014 a combined $74 billion \u2014 became necessary once it was clear that Fannie and Freddie were profitable again.Instead of allowing the companies to keep the assets on their books, helping rebuild their net worth, the government required the companies to pay the $74 billion in cash. Fannie Mae had to borrow to pay for some of that.That $74 billion payment to the Treasury has become a flash point in the shareholder lawsuits. The plaintiffs contend that the government must have known the companies\u2019 deferred tax assets would be valuable when Fannie and Freddie became profitable again. They wonder if this recognition spurred the August 2012 profit sweep.Government officials have maintained they had no idea the reversal of the tax assets would result in such a bonanza. In a December 2013 declaration, Mario Ugoletti, former special adviser to the director of the F.H.F.A., said that at the time of the profit sweep, the F.H.F.A. and the companies \u201chad not yet begun to discuss whether or when the enterprises would be able to recognize any value to their deferred tax assets.\u201dMr. Ugoletti added that the profit sweep was not intended to \u201cincrease compensation to Treasury.\u201dMr. Ugoletti, who resigned as interim ombudsman at F.H.F.A. this fall, did not respond to a request for comment.But documents cast doubt on Mr. Ugoletti\u2019s declaration. They also raise questions about the government\u2019s contention that Fannie and Freddie were in a death spiral when the Treasury began taking all their profits, an argument the government initially made in answering the legal challenge in Federal Claims Court.Fannie and Freddie\u2019s operations were monitored closely by their government minders, suggesting the overseers had plenty of warning that the companies were turning the corner in 2012. Moreover, F.H.F.A. officials were well placed to know that accounting rules would require the reversal of the companies\u2019 deferred tax assets once they became profitable again.According to Mr. DeMarco\u2019s calendars, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, he had regular meetings with the chief executives of both Fannie and Freddie. The Treasury also received periodic updates from the companies\u2019 financial officials.Documents show that as early as June 2011, more than a year before the profit sweep, the Treasury had been told the companies were improving and that their tax assets could generate significant value.That discussion occurred in a private meeting with a group of restructuring experts, from Blackstone, the financial services giant, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a New York law firm.According to that presentation, Fannie and Freddie were \u201cshowing improved financial performance and stabilized loss reserves.\u201d It noted that Fannie and Freddie could build up their capital from \u201cthe reversal of loan loss reserves.\u201dDocuments show that as early as June 2011, the Treasury Department had been told that Fannie and Freddie were on the road to recovery and that their tax assets would most likely generate significant value.Testimony by Ms. McFarland, chief financial officer of Fannie at the time of the profit sweep, appears to conflict with Mr. Ugoletti\u2019s declaration. In a heavily redacted court document, lawyers for Fairholme noted, \u201cIn light of Ms. McFarland\u2019s testimony, Mr. Ugoletti\u2019s sworn statement that neither agency envisioned recognition of the deferred tax assets is not credible.\u201dThe testimony upon which those conclusions were based was blacked out.The court document suggests that Ms. McFarland testified that she told officials at F.H.F.A. about the impact the deferred tax asset would have on the company\u2019s net worth. Mr. Ugoletti\u2019s calendars, also obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show Ms. McFarland meeting with him on July 12, 2012, about a month before the profit sweep was announced.Ms. McFarland did not return several phone calls seeking comment.The August 2012 profit sweep surprised investors, but documents show that it came long after Treasury officials had indicated privately that they wanted to ensure Fannie and Freddie shareholders would receive none of the companies\u2019 future profits.A December 2010 memo to Mr. Geithner from Jeffrey A. Goldstein, undersecretary for domestic finance, referred to \u201cthe administration\u2019s commitment to ensure existing common equity holders will not have access to any positive earnings from the G.S.E.s in the future.\u201dIt is impossible to predict how the judges overseeing the shareholder lawsuits against the government will rule on the Fannie and Freddie matters. But some investors are hopeful.Joseph \u201cWoody\u201d Woodruff is a longtime Fannie Mae shareholder who was elected to the state circuit court in Tennessee last year after practicing law for decades.\u201cThe federal government entered into a legal arrangement with the G.S.E.s that contained certain undertakings and fiduciary obligations,\u201d Mr. Woodruff said, stressing that he was speaking as an investor, not as a judge.\u201cThen it unilaterally rewrote the terms of the relationship and began in a very lawless manner sweeping the profits and transferring them to the Treasury,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton: How I\u2019d Rein In Wall Street", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSEVEN years ago, the financial crisis sent our economy into a tailspin. Over five million people lost their homes. Nearly nine million lost their jobs. Nearly $13 trillion in household wealth was wiped out.Under President Obama, our economy has come a long way back. Our businesses have created more than 13 million jobs. People\u2019s savings are being restored. And we have tough new rules on the books, including the Dodd-Frank Act, that protect consumers and curb recklessness on Wall Street.But not everyone sees that as a good thing. Republicans, both in Congress and on the campaign trail, are dead-set on rolling back critical financial protections.Right now, Republicans in Congress are working to attach damaging deregulation riders to the must-pass spending bill. They\u2019re attempting to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They want to roll back common-sense efforts to prevent conflicts of interest by financial managers. And they\u2019re trying to undo constraints on risk at some of the largest and most complex financial institutions.President Obama and congressional Democrats should do everything they can to stop these efforts. But it\u2019s not enough simply to protect the progress we have made. As president, I would not only veto any legislation that would weaken financial reform, but I would also fight for tough new rules, stronger enforcement and more accountability that go well beyond Dodd-Frank.My comprehensive plan has already won praise from progressives like Sherrod Brown and Barney Frank. Here\u2019s what it would do.First, we need to further rein in major financial institutions. My plan proposes legislation that would impose a new risk fee on dozens of the biggest banks \u2014 those with more than $50 billion in assets \u2014 and other systemically important financial institutions to discourage the kind of hazardous behavior that could induce another crisis. I would also ensure that the federal government has \u2014 and is prepared to use \u2014 the authority and tools necessary to reorganize, downsize and ultimately break up any financial institution that is too large and risky to be managed effectively. No bank or financial firm should be too big to manage.My plan would strengthen the Volcker Rule by closing the loopholes that still allow banks to make speculative gambles with taxpayer-backed deposits. And I would fight to reinstate the rules governing risky credit swaps and derivatives at taxpayer-backed banks, which were repealed during last year\u2019s budget negotiations after a determined lobbying campaign by the banks.My plan also goes beyond the biggest banks to include the whole financial sector. Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall, which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren\u2019t traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn\u2019t have limited their reckless behavior. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks and other non-bank institutions. My plan would strengthen oversight of these activities, too \u2014 increasing leverage and liquidity requirements for broker-dealers and imposing strict margin requirements on the kinds of short-term borrowing that also played a major role in spurring the financial crisis. We need to tackle excessive risk wherever it lurks, not just in the banks.Second, I would appoint tough, independent regulators and ensure that both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are independently funded \u2014 as other critical regulators are now \u2014 so that they can do their jobs without political interference. I would seek to impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading, which makes markets less stable and less fair. And we need to reform stock market rules to ensure equal access to information, increase transparency and minimize conflicts of interest.Finally, executives need to be held more accountable. No one should be too big to jail. I would seek to extend the statute of limitations for major financial crimes to 10 years from five and enhance rewards for whistle-blowers. I would work to ensure that financial firms admit wrongdoing as part of settlements in instances of egregious misconduct, and increase transparency about the terms of settlement and the fines actually paid to the government. Fines should be more than just the cost of doing business to these companies \u2014 they should be an effective disincentive for illegal behavior.And it shouldn\u2019t just be shareholders and taxpayers who feel the pain when banks make bad decisions; executives should have skin in the game. When a firm pays a fine, I would make sure that the penalty cuts into executives\u2019 bonuses, too. And I would fight to close the carried interest loophole that gives some fund managers billions of dollars in tax breaks: They should be taxed like every other citizen.Republicans may have decided to forget about the financial crisis that caused so much devastation \u2014 but I haven\u2019t. The proper role of Wall Street is to help Main Street grow and prosper. When our financial sector works the right way, it helps families buy their first homes, entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses and hardworking Americans save for retirement. Rather than pursuing the kind of high-stakes speculation that devastated our economy before, Wall Street should focus on building an economy that creates good-paying jobs, rising incomes and sound investments so that more families can achieve the security of a middle-class life.Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wages Up, Prices Low: Shake Shack\u2019s Food for Thought for the Fed", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyWhen Federal Reserve officials meet in two weeks to decide whether to raise interest rates, they will probably eat catered food at their Foggy Bottom headquarters. If they want to get some fresh air, though, they might consider heading to the nearest Shake Shack, where they could find both tasty burgers and insight that will make their decision smarter.That\u2019s because the latest forecasts from Shake Shack and several other restaurant chains suggest that a mainstay of economic thought \u2014 that higher wages for workers will quickly translate into higher prices for consumers \u2014 may not apply as strongly as traditional economic theory suggests.Chain restaurants present a particularly useful window into the ways that an improving economy is, or isn\u2019t, transforming into broad-based price inflation. And inflation is the core issue facing the Fed as it considers a rate increase to prevent the economy from overheating.Why restaurants? Labor costs represent a larger portion of their total costs than in many other types of companies, and so any wage increases are more likely to flow through to higher prices for consumers. That sensitivity \u2014 combined with the ubiquity of the sector \u2014 makes it an interesting bellwether for the economy. And conveniently, because worker compensation and pricing are such crucial components of the companies\u2019 financial performance, restaurant chain executives often talk about what they are seeing in conference calls with investors.Shake Shack executives, for example, talked to Wall Street analysts on Nov. 5 of their plans for 2016. Labor costs are going up \u2014 in part because of local minimum wage increases, in part because of the company\u2019s emphasis on attracting good, loyal workers. \u201cWashington, D.C., at $12 an hour, we\u2019re paying $11 an hour in Texas, well above minimum wage, and we\u2019re going to continue to think about that,\u201d said Randall Garutti, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe haven\u2019t decided on the dates, but we do know that we\u2019ll be increasing our wages. We want to get the best team, we want to have the best people, driving sales and driving our restaurants.\u201dBut the price increase the company envisions is small. \u201cOur plan in early 2016 in January is to take just a small menu price increase, just 1 percent to 2 percent, which will not completely offset those increases in labor that we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d said the chief financial officer Jeffrey Uttz at a Morgan Stanley retail conference on Nov. 17. (That does come after a 3 percent price increase this past January. Average the two years out, and Shake Shack is doing its part to keep consumer prices rising at roughly the 2 percent annual rate the Fed aims for.)Other restaurant chains present a similar impression: Labor costs are going up, but it\u2019s just one more thing to manage through, not an excuse to raise prices substantially. And it\u2019s not just in the cheeseburger business.\u201cWe have a lot of great franchisees out there that really don\u2019t look for excuses,\u201d said Jeffrey Lawrence, chief financial officer of Domino\u2019s Pizza, in an earnings call in October. \u201cThey\u2019re really focused on managing. And whether it\u2019s food cost or labor line item, they\u2019re going to manage through it. So we\u2019re not overly concerned about wages at the moment.\u201dThe same idea applies if you favor a high-end steak place instead. \u201cOn a wage rate, in certain parts of the country, we are seeing some pressures there,\u201d said Thomas Pennison Jr., chief financial officer of Del Frisco\u2019s, adding that the company was \u201cadjusting our operations as best we can to counteract that.\u201dWhat kind of price increases does that translate to? \u201cWe\u2019re under 1 percent right now year over year,\u201d he said, though it\u2019s above 2 percent in certain markets. \u201cMost of our pricing that we\u2019ve been doing right now is specific to markets where we\u2019ve dealt with minimum wage or some of the labor impacts.\u201dWhat about fast-casual burritos? \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t have any plans right now for any kind of national price increase to deal with wage pressure,\u201d said Chipotle\u2019s chief financial officer, John Hartung, though there may be some price increases in \u201cisolated markets.\u201dPrefer some baby back ribs? With barbecue sauce? They should remain affordable. \u201cWell, Tom\u2019s talking about a 3 percent increase in wages, and we\u2019re talking about a 2 percent price increase,\u201d said Wyman Roberts, the chief executive of Chili\u2019s restaurant chain, referring to the company\u2019s C.F.O., Thomas Edwards Jr.Others say they do intend to raise prices to keep up with wages \u2014 but just can\u2019t do so yet. Panera Bread\u2019s prices are up 2.1 percent over a year earlier. \u201cThis price increase is not quite enough to cover structural wage benefit and food inflation in the quarter, but going forward, our plan is to do just that,\u201d said Ronald M. Shaich, the company\u2019s chairman, in late October.None of this means that inflation will remain calm forever. Food prices are stable right now, reflecting a global commodity glut. Other chains may do as Panera intends to, and try to raise prices to reflect higher worker pay gradually.But there\u2019s also this: The last seven years have featured flat wages in inflation-adjusted terms, combined with rising corporate profit margins, two phenomena that aren\u2019t completely unrelated. The behavior we\u2019re seeing out of major restaurant chains may just be a sign that this is reversing, and that worker compensation will gain at the expense of corporate profits. If that\u2019s the case, worker pay has some room to run before consumer price inflation is a real problem.A few earnings calls from just one sector of the economy certainly don\u2019t prove that\u2019s happening, but the possibility may be enough to justify that Janet Yellen and her colleagues get out for lunch once in a while.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Immigrants, America Is Still More Welcoming Than Europe", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneThe United States has some of the most hostile policies toward an immigrant population found in the developed world.The difference is worth pondering.There is no question that citizens across the West are gripped by anxiety about immigration. It entwines a fear of imported terrorism with the older xenophobia of natives threatened by ethnic diversity.Contrasting the experiences in Europe and the United States could help us better enable immigrants and their descendants to find their identities and flourish in the new world in which they live. And it will improve the prospects for greater economic growth and less strife for the rest of us.The very notion of integration is nebulous of course. By some standards one could say immigrants to the United States integrate poorly. Rates of naturalization are low. Less-educated immigrants often work for very low wages. Immigrant poverty rates are substantially higher in the United States than in the European Union.In fact, the children of the least-educated immigrants are much better educated than their parents. They find much better jobs.\u201cCurrent immigrants and their descendants are integrating into U.S. society,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cIntegration increases over time, with immigrants becoming more like the native-born with more time in the country, and with the second and third generations becoming more like other native-born Americans than their parents were.\u201d\u201cThere are complex arrays of similarities and differences,\u201d Professor Alba told me.Still, they identify unique hurdles in the way of immigrants that make it difficult for those coming from outside the European Union to get ahead in Europe.One in four of the economically active is out of work in France and one in three in Belgium and Sweden. And these poor employment prospects persist down the generations. Youth joblessness among the European-born children of immigrants is almost 50 percent higher than for those with native-born parents.As Professor Foner put it: \u201cThe United States does a better job at accepting immigrants as Americans in the making.\u201dTo be sure, immigrants make up a smaller share of the population of the United States than they do of the populations of immigrant havens like Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Still, that share is considerably larger than that of ethnically distinct immigrants from outside the bloc who live in the European Union nations.The United States is a nation of hyphenated identities. Europe\u2019s nation-states, deeply rooted in history, are not.The most common criticism of this sort of analysis is that it misses the role of religion. Most immigrants in the United States are Christian. In Europe they are mostly Muslim. Europeans\u2019 hostility is often justified by arguing that Islam is incompatible with values inherent to Europe\u2019s liberal democracies.Professors Foner and Alba suggest this incompatibility has perhaps less to do with Muslim intransigence than with the European insistence that immigrants adopt a narrow set of behaviors, including Christian traditions and, importantly, secular values.In the United States, they write, \u201cto be religious is to be in sync with mainstream norms.\u201d Many Americans have more trouble accepting atheists than Muslims. In Europe, by contrast, \u201cclaims based on religion have much less acceptance and legitimacy.\u201d\u201cMuslims feel they have a secondary status in these societies,\u201d Ms. Foner told me.The American approach to immigration, of course, could improve enormously. Ending the active persecution and deportation of 11 million living illegally in the United States would vastly improve not only their own odds of success, but those of their 4.5 million American-born children \u2014 citizens all \u2014 as well.But in this moment in which bigotry and hatred flow so freely from the campaign stump, the most critical insight might be to understand the value of America\u2019s traditionally more open and welcoming approach.And let\u2019s hope it stays that way. Erecting walls would blunt one of the United States\u2019 most powerful tools of social cohesion and economic progress. It would produce a society less able to accept, mold and succeed from the many immigrants in our midst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spain\u2019s Enigmatic Leader Faces New Generation in Election", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe incumbent, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, refused to participate in the forum that included the country\u2019s two emerging parties \u2014 which polls indicate could gain almost 40 percent of the vote \u2014 dismissing them as irrelevant. In his place was an empty lectern.After four years in office, Mr. Rajoy \u2014 often criticized for being reserved to the point of aloofness \u2014 remains something of an enigma. He has also suddenly become a lightning rod of Spanish politics, the symbol of an old guard challenged by a younger generation of rivals who have singled him out as the obstacle to much needed change.The election on Sunday is expected to be a cliffhanger, and Mr. Rajoy is provoking unusually strong passion for a man long considered more of a political technician and party insider than a magnetic or particularly polarizing leader.When Mr. Rajoy finally did debate this week, he sat across from only his main Socialist opponent, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who said the prime minister should have resigned because of a corruption scandal that has dogged his conservative Popular Party. \u201cThe prime minister must be a decent person,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez said to him, \u201cand you aren\u2019t.\u201dAt a campaign stop on Wednesday, Mr. Rajoy was punched in the face by a 17-year-old, who was later reported to have said he was \u201cvery happy to have done it.\u201dIt is a surprising turn for a man of professorial countenance who, while also a southern European leader, is \u201cthe exact opposite of somebody like Berlusconi,\u201d the brash former Italian prime minister, according to Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1lvarez, a Spanish professor of leadership at the Insead business school near Paris who also wrote a book about Spanish prime ministers.Spain\u2019s election, Mr. \u00c1lvarez suggested, \u201chas turned into a weird personal referendum about the leadership of somebody who doesn\u2019t seek to present any kind of individual identity.\u201dHaving steered Spain through a tumultuous debt crisis, Mr. Rajoy managed to arrest the country\u2019s economic slide and recently fulfilled his pledge, however slightly, to lower Spain\u2019s high unemployment compared with four years ago.Along the way, he and his Popular Party also clamped down on the kinds of large-scale protests set off by earlier budget cuts \u2014 through what has become known as a \u201cgag law\u201d that stiffly penalizes unauthorized demonstrations.In his appeal to voters, Mr. Rajoy has warned that changing tack now, after years of belt-tightening, would risk derailing an economy that required a banking bailout in 2012 but is set to grow 3 percent this year, outpacing those of Spain\u2019s main European partners.That progress, however, has come at the cost of a sharp erosion in support for Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party, which took a beating in municipal elections in May and seems poised to lose what has been an ironclad majority in Parliament.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s opponents accuse him of stifling dissent, and for ushering in lower salaries and wider income disparities while protecting Spanish institutions to the benefit of a narrow circle of business and political interests.He and his party have now become a dividing line in the debate over Spain\u2019s future.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s opponents, especially the new upstart parties, want more than a change of leadership. They want to move Mr. Rajoy out of the way so they can overhaul what they say are inefficient institutions \u2014 including the Senate, the upper chamber of Parliament \u2014 and to put an end to endemic corruption that has tainted Spain\u2019s political establishment.The battle is as much generational as anything. Mr. Rajoy, 60, was already a government minister in the 1990s. He and his party lost two elections before winning on their third attempt, in 2011, when voters punished the Socialists for pushing Spain into economic crisis.Among his opponents, Mr. S\u00e1nchez, the Socialist leader, is 43; the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, is 37; and Albert Rivera, who leads Citizens, is 36.In fact, Mr. Rajoy has contrasted his leadership experience and 30 years in politics with what he has called the \u201cproliferation\u201d of new parties.He has insisted these new parties are ephemeral, one-man organizations that are only \u201cthe product of a television show or a marketing campaign.\u201d During a political meeting in Las Palmas last week, he told supporters that \u201cevery quarter of an hour appears a different one.\u201dAs for his refusal to debate against the leaders of the new parties in November, Mr. Rajoy argued that, as the head of government, he has a busier agenda than they do.His opponents and some political observers say he has been burying his head in the sand at a moment when the pressure for change has spread across the full spectrum of Spanish politics and society.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s refusal to debate against newcomers is \u201clegitimate in terms of electoral strategy,\u201d but it leaves Spain with \u201ca democratic deficit,\u201d said David J\u00edmenez, editor in chief of El Mundo, a conservative newspaper.\u201cIf you present yourself to an election and consider yourself the best candidate, why not demonstrate it?\u201d Mr. J\u00edmenez asked.The answer was in part already provided in an autobiography, titled \u201cIn Confidence,\u201d that Mr. Rajoy published in 2011, before winning his first general election.In it, Mr. Rajoy recalled a quiet upbringing, under a father who was climbing the ranks of the judiciary during the Franco dictatorship. \u201cI believe that I\u2019m a lot like my father,\u201d Mr. Rajoy wrote. \u201cHe is a perfectionist, somewhat introverted and very cautious.\u201dMr. Rajoy qualified as a land registrar, like two of his three siblings, but then switched to politics when Spain transitioned to democracy.Having steadily worked his way up the Popular Party, whose leadership he took over in 2003, Mr. Rajoy has managed to remain \u201cthe quiet administrator.\u201dEven as prime minister, he has appeared more willing to play commentator for soccer matches on radio than to take part in risky political debates on television.\u201cI think that he is the politician who most understands a basic rule of politics, which is that it\u2019s first and foremost about survival, rather than always trying to rise to the challenge and be seen doing things,\u201d said Mr. \u00c1lvarez, the leadership professor and author.Mr. Rajoy called Sunday\u2019s election at the latest possible date to give himself time to present a 2016 budget containing tax cuts and erasing some of his earlier austerity policies.His personal approval ratings have fallen sharply in the meantime. The decline has been in no small part because of his failure to contain a series of corruption cases, including one centering on his party\u2019s former treasurer, Luis B\u00e1rcenas, who awaits trial after admitting to paying kickbacks to party officials.This month, Mr. Rajoy sent his younger deputy prime minister, Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, as his substitute to one of the televised debates. The move fueled speculation about whether Mr. Rajoy, for all his survival skills, could keep his party under tight control for much longer.If his party is forced into a coalition after Sunday\u2019s vote, the price its partners may demand to support a minority conservative government could be Mr. Rajoy\u2019s removal.Seeking to blunt the image of generational stonewalling, the Popular Party has used posters of Ms. S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda alongside those of Mr. Rajoy as part of its campaign advertising.However, the attempt has not convinced even all those in the party, like Cayetana \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, one of the few members not seeking re-election on Sunday because of differences with the party leadership over its strategy.\u201cYou cannot compete in terms of novelty and youth, or even on corruption issues, if your candidate is Rajoy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why the Popular Party is trying to offer voters a choice between security and experience versus the risks of the unknown.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poor in Guinea, but Making a Living From Crisp New Banknotes", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConakry JournalCONAKRY, Guinea \u2014 The euro is slipping, the American dollar is holding steady and the world\u2019s new digital currency, Bitcoin, is trying to find its foothold. But on a recent sunny afternoon along a main thoroughfare in this busy capital city, the market for stiff new Guinean francs was hopping.\u201cHello, Madame!\u201d a group of men cried out as they stood along a busy roadway with large stacks of shrink-wrapped Guinean francs tucked under their armpits and stuffed into their back pockets.Guineans like their francs crisp and clean for handing out on special occasions, and that has created demand for new paper money that a cadre of young men, who would otherwise probably be jobless, are eager to serve. Ibrahim Kamera, 29, and his friends make a living selling brand new bills.Standing near a pedestrian bridge across from one of this city\u2019s sprawling markets, they try to reel in customers who want to trade in their old francs, wrinkled, sweaty and dirty, for new ones that have become status symbols to give as gifts at weddings and other celebrations.In much of West Africa, where credit card machines and A.T.M. s are sparse, cash is king. But here in Conakry, freshly printed Guinean francs rule. And that has created opportunities in a nation where unemployment is a serious problem, especially for young people \u2014 some government estimates say that as many as 60 percent of youth in the nation are jobless.Journals, a fixture of the international section, allow correspondents to step back from the news and write about places that intrigue them. We hope you enjoy our choices.The lucky young men find jobs driving taxis or pushing wheelbarrows at construction sites. Others adopt more unsavory professions, on evidence at the local pickpockets\u2019 market, where the day\u2019s catch of mobile phones, leather wallets and stolen items is on display.And then there are these men, most in their 20s but some as young as 15, gathered under the bridge.\u201cOur life is in this,\u201d said Ishmael Isho Kamera, 23, one of the money-changers and no relation to Ibrahim Kamera, as he patted his stacks of brand new francs. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything else to do.\u201dAcross the globe, the legal market for money is huge. Numismatists collect old coins and trade them for hundreds or thousands of times their original face value. The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded for a profit, is estimated to be a $5.3 trillion-a-day operation.And in some parts of the world, the illegal market for money also is thriving.\u201cIn many countries there\u2019s a black market for currencies that is very lucrative for some people,\u201d said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company in New York.Here in Conakry, Ibrahim Kamera, who like his friends wears a soccer jersey and flip-flops, considers it a good day if he earns 200,000 francs a day, the equivalent of about $26. Typically, a day may bring in half that much. That is still considerably more than the average daily income in Guinea, which in 2014 was less than a dollar and a half.The money-changers under the bridge have learned to be good businessmen. Years ago, they found an original investor, a friend who gave them some starting capital. Now, they earn about 50,000 francs in profits \u2014 about $6.50 \u2014 on every 1,000,000 francs they sell.Potential customers are easy to pick out, especially the women, who usually are on their way to a wedding, carrying umbrellas and large bags for toting the paper money.Most clients buy large stacks of bills; they have to if they want their cash gifts to be meaningful. In Guinea, where inflation has taken a toll in past years, a typical lunch of fish, rice and plantains at a restaurant costs about 114,000 francs. One loyal customer buys 15 million francs at a time.The young men have also honed their sales skills. Mr. Kamera gives discounts to repeat customers. Sometimes he sings to clients, to entertain them so maybe they will buy just a little more money than intended. When Mr. Kamera learns that a customer shares his last name, a common one in parts of West Africa, he makes a scene, pretending to be related for the sake of improving customer relations.Mr. Kamera and his crew compete with one another, jostling to be first to get to an approaching customer. But it is just part of the job, and all is generally forgiven in a matter of minutes. The men possess a charm and cheerful spirit that belies the danger of their trade and the seeming hopelessness of their lot in life.The police occasionally swarm the area by the pedestrian bridge, beating the men, confiscating their stacks of money and jailing them, sometimes for days. After all, their work is illegal.\u201cThis job,\u201d said Desmond Conte, 27, in slow, deliberate words, \u201cis not safe.\u201dWhen it comes to sales of new francs, the competition is real. A group of young Guinean-born men plies the same trade on the other side of the bridge no more than 30 feet from the turf Mr. Kamera and his friends have staked out. The groups mostly ignore each other, except for exchanging dirty looks.For both groups of men, business has been slow because fears of violence around the October presidential election made people wary of scheduling weddings and other events in the city. One day shortly after the election, it was probably the presence of two American journalists that kept customers away from Mr. Kamera and his friends.Business was better for the competition on the other side of the bridge, where a woman in a red and gold head scarf and yellow gown dug into her large bag as she approached to conduct business. The woman was buying new francs to hand out to children as gifts, she said before scurrying away without offering her name.Mr. Kamera and his friends often think about another way of life. Most said they wanted one day to become soccer superstars. If that did not pan out, some said they would like to own a business. Others wanted to become soldiers.\u201cOur future belongs to God,\u201d Mr. Kamera said, \u201cbut for now there are no new opportunities.\u201dMr. Kamera was forced to end his education when he was 12 years old to flee Sierra Leone. He would like to finish school then try for his dream job.\u201cI want to be an American Marine,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Her Time Is Up, but Argentina\u2019s President Is Not Going Quietly", "Date": "2015-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From ArgentinaBUENOS AIRES \u2014 In her last days in office, she has appointed ambassadors and signed decrees that will drain federal coffers. Her political appointees refuse to resign. She has even antagonized her successor with stinging remarks at public appearances.After eight years as president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner clears out her office at the presidential palace on Thursday. But far from preparing the ground for Mauricio Macri, the president-elect, she is obstructing the transition in a final show of muscle, observers say.\u201cIt is by no means a smooth transition,\u201d said Dante Caputo, a former foreign minister. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a transition that protects the well-being of the nation. Rather, Mrs. Kirchner seems irritated about having to hand over power, and she\u2019s expressing it by taking decisions that jeopardize Argentina\u2019s delicate economic situation.\u201dHer resistance is also widely viewed as a maneuver to build an image as an unyielding opposition leader, especially as she prepares for a power struggle within her political movement.Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters have long considered Mr. Macri, 56, the center-right Buenos Aires mayor, too close to corporate interests. And as he prepares to roll back her interventionist economic policies with market-oriented changes favored by business leaders, Mrs. Kirchner is refusing to fade into the background and, analysts say, is spraying grit into the machinery of his plans.Even though these moves could eventually be overruled, they were malicious, said Federico Thomsen, an independent economist here. \u201cShe would never have done it at the start of her own four-year term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of showing: \u2018We\u2019re leaving in a fighting mood.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHer political appointees at public institutions like the Central Bank have also refused to step aside. Mr. Macri, who needs to control monetary policy to carry out his changes, has chosen a lawmaker from his party to lead the bank. But Alejandro Vanoli, a Kirchner appointee whose term ends in 2019, has stood firm.\u201cIt seems clear to me that the president does not want to collaborate,\u201d Mr. Macri told reporters last week. \u201cIt feels like she\u2019s fueling this idea of: \u2018How many new obstacles and problems can I create for the next government?\u2019\u00a0\u201d There have been voices of dissent even from within Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political movement. Mr. Macri could maneuver around congressional checks and balances to remove Mr. Vanoli and other political appointees by decree. But that could jeopardize one of his key campaign promises: to decentralize the government by diluting the power of the presidency.When Mrs. Kirchner and Mr. Macri agreed to meet at the presidential residence here soon after his Nov. 22 victory, many Argentines hoped for a tidy transition. But Mr. Macri said the meeting had been largely pointless because Mrs. Kirchner refused to discuss subjects apart from his inauguration ceremony. Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s press office did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting.Arguments have even broken out about the ceremony details, friction that points to Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s ambitions beyond the end of her presidential term, according to analysts. \u201cShe\u2019s playing to the last minute, reluctantly relinquishing power and showing signs that she doesn\u2019t want to disappear from the political arena,\u201d Ms. Llanos said.Still, supporters of Mrs. Kirchner played down the tension, with some pointing to Argentina\u2019s turbulent recent history, in which two presidents have relinquished power earlier than scheduled because of crises.\u201cAfter eight years in office, she is handing over the presidency in due time and form,\u201d said Cecilia de Cort\u00e1zar, 29, a math professor. \u201cShe has made a lot of Argentines believe in politics again and I reckon that she actually deserves their affection and applause.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Wire, House Passes Big Package of Tax Cuts", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe accompanying $650 billion tax-cut measure is another matter. Until becoming speaker, Mr. Ryan was chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, and he remains his party\u2019s leader on tax policy.By a vote of 318 to 109, the House on Thursday approved the tax-cut package, which will add more than a half-trillion dollars to the deficit, and supporters and critics alike said that the bill represented Mr. Ryan\u2019s deeply held belief that tax cuts ultimately pay for themselves by fostering economic growth.The approach also fits with his long-term vision for a more sweeping overhaul of the tax code that would lower rates for corporations and individuals and, according to some skeptics, would leave less money in the budget to spend on government programs.The tax measure, which is expected to be approved by the Senate on Friday, would permanently extend several tax breaks that have been renewed repeatedly on a temporary basis, including a popular business tax credit for research expenses and a benefit for certain capital investments. It would also permanently extend an enhanced child tax credit, a $2,500 college tax credit and a more robust earned-income tax credit for low-income families.Other provisions in the bill include a small-but-symbolic tax deduction for teachers who spend their own money on books, supplies and computer equipment used in the classroom; and a separate deduction for state and local sales taxes. The measure would also postpone some key components of the Affordable Care Act, by delaying, for example, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost, employer-sponsored health plans.In a statement after the vote, Mr. Ryan called the bill \u201ca pivotal step towards rewriting our broken tax code by ending Washington\u2019s days of extending tax policies one year at a time.\u201d Mr. Ryan added, \u201cThis package of permanent extenders will shield families from a tax hike and provide businesses with greater economic certainty to grow and prosper, which means higher wages and more full-time jobs for American workers.\u201dSome senior Democrats, however, have railed against the measure, saying it favored big corporate interests over the middle class.The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who voted against the measure, said that it was wrong of Republicans not to offset the cost of the tax breaks. \u201cHaving all that unpaid for, in my view, is unconscionable,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference.Mr. Levin said that Democratic leaders strongly supported the child tax credit, earned-income tax credit and college tax credit, but that they could not support the bill because it would serve a larger Republican goal in further shrinking the resources available for discretionary domestic spending on government programs.\u201cWhat it does is to really starve the beast, which for Republicans is discretionary spending,\u201d Mr. Levin said, noting that the level of discretionary spending as part of the economy is the lowest since 1962.Among the programs to face cuts in recent years, he noted, were Head Start, Pell grants for college students, the National Institutes of Health and job training. (The omnibus spending measure includes a substantial increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health after several years of cuts.)Other Democrats said the opportunity to extend permanently the tax breaks for middle-class and working-poor Americans was too important to pass up.\u201cWe have been trying forever to get something good for the middle class and the working poor \u2014 and this is a jackpot,\u201d the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said in an interview.With negotiations over the huge year-end deal down to the wire, Mr. Reid said he spent all day Sunday at home fielding calls from senators eager to secure their priorities. \u201cI never took off my pajamas \u2014 65 phone calls,\u201d Mr. Reid said, adding, \u201cIt would have been nice if I had showered.\u201dMr. Reid praised Mr. Ryan for taking a practical approach, comparing him to the former Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi. \u201cHe was a pragmatic man; he wanted to get things done,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s how Paul Ryan approaches me. No one can question his conservative credentials, but if there were ever an example of pragmatism, it\u2019s what we have done in the last few days.\u201dSome fiscal watchdog groups, however, said that Republicans and Democrats were complicit in supporting a huge legislative package that would bust through previously agreed-upon spending caps and add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see that hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be added to the debt with such bipartisan support,\u201d said Stephen Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group.Maya MacGuineas, president of the Washington-based Committee for a Responsible Budget, said the reason the tax breaks had been temporary was because Congress could never agree to offset the cost of them.\u201cThey were temporary policies in the first place because no one was willing to pay for them,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cSpending and tax cuts shouldn\u2019t be treated differently \u2014 they should both be paid for.\u201dShe said that Mr. Ryan over his career had often put forward fiscally responsible tax and spending proposals but that the current package fell short.\u201cThe challenge for Paul Ryan is twofold \u2014 to move away the obstructionist tactics of the House Republicans such as threatening a government shutdown or default, which he successfully did in this negotiation, and to push for fiscal responsibility,\u201d she said.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, who succeeded Mr. Ryan as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, insisted that the tax package represented sound policy.\u201cIt\u2019s financially responsible because preventing a tax increase is never a cost,\u201d Mr. Brady said in a speech on the House floor. \u201cRepublicans have always worked to stop Washington from taking more money from the hard-working Americans who earned it.\u201d He said, \u201cThis bill serves as a path forward to pro-growth tax reform.\u201dAn article on Friday about a tax cut measure passed by the House of Representatives misstated the total amount of the cuts. It is $650 billion, not $650 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York to Aid Immigrants Amid Stalled National Reforms", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImmigration may be under attack across the country, but New York\u2019s top officials used a national conference in Brooklyn on Monday to defend immigrants, though their soaring rhetoric overshadowed their fairly modest proposals.Then, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vowed to continue to crack down on wage theft and the exploitation of workers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants who fear reporting abuse to the authorities. He announced that in the last five months, a state task force had recovered $28 million for 24,000 workers who had been cheated out of their wages.Both Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo invoked their Italian immigrant heritage, and both were steadfast in their welcome of Syrian refugees. But it was Mr. Cuomo, also a Democrat, who delivered the more blistering critique, rising to singsong poetry that brought the audience of nearly 1,000 advocates to their feet.\u201cYou want to build walls, you want to keep Muslims out \u2014 we believe in freedom of religion. It was a founding premise of the entire country,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. He then seemed to parrot Donald J. Trump without naming him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to keep the Syrians out, you\u2019re going to keep the Mexicans out. This is our land!\u201d\u201cWe know that when executive action fully takes effect, a huge number of New Yorkers will benefit, but we also know they need the legal assistance to fully benefit from these opportunities,\u201d the mayor said.Rounding out a group of three top New York Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the former United States senator campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, also spoke at the conference at the end of the day.The city\u2019s plan, called ActionNYC, will offer legal services through existing community groups. It wants to reach up to 75,000 immigrants in its first year.Javier Vald\u00e9s, the co-executive director of Make the Road New York, one of the participating organizations in ActionNYC, said the city\u2019s added legal services were coming at a critical time.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, because of what\u2019s been going on in national rhetoric about immigration, who don\u2019t come forward, and who are always afraid to interact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go into the communities and not wait for those to come forward.\u201dFor ActionNYC, five nonprofits will handle outreach. Seven groups will hire 24 community navigators, people who, while not lawyers, can speak the language of a neighborhood and who can conduct legal screenings under the supervision of lawyers.Mario Russell, the director of immigrant and refugee services for Catholic Charities Community Services in New York, which is taking part, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting and new model. The city is saying, \u2018Here are a half-dozen lawyers; let\u2019s deploy them in these areas and in this way.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cThe challenge is how are we going to meet those tremendously ambitious goals, given that we\u2019re not going to see a huge surge of immigrants coming out and making themselves eligible,\u201d said Steven Choi, the executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, one of the hosts of the conference.Mr. Cuomo, like Mr. de Blasio, noted that the state had a duty to immigrants, calling them a backbone of New York\u2019s economy. He said his administration would not tolerate abuse of workers in any industry, especially those that employ undocumented laborers. \u201cUndocumented workers are defenseless, and people without scruples can exploit them whenever they want,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.In a sweeping speech that also covered education and his push to raise the minimum wage to $15, Mr. Cuomo concluded by reminding the audience that in New York State, \u201cwe are all immigrants.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the court that in 2014 blocked actions taken by President Obama to create a program that would both expand the existing deferred deportation rule for those who come to the United States as children and protect parents of United States citizens. It was a federal appeals court in New Orleans, not a Texas appeals court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China to Track Renminbi Based on Basket of Currencies", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s central bank said Friday night that it would start tracking the value of the country\u2019s currency against a basket of many other currencies and not just the dollar. The move is likely to reignite speculation about the possibility of another devaluation by Beijing and could fan trade tensions.The People\u2019s Bank of China posted a commentary on its website saying it would calculate and release the value of the renminbi based on a basket of foreign currencies, after many years of relying overwhelmingly on calculations based on the renminbi\u2019s value in dollars.The Chinese central bank did not say when it might make such a move, which could rock global financial markets.The last change in the central bank\u2019s method for determining the renminbi\u2019s exchange rate occurred in August and accompanied an immediate 2 percent devaluation. That was followed by a further slide in the renminbi in the next couple of days of trading, before the Chinese central bank intervened heavily to keep the currency from tumbling further.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.With the American economy expanding while Europe, Japan and many emerging markets languish, the dollar has rallied strongly for the last couple of years, and many economists expect that to continue. Basing the renminbi\u2019s value on a group of currencies would cause it to fall against the dollar if the dollar\u2019s strength persisted in the coming months.\u201cManaging the renminbi\u2019s value relative to a basket of currencies rather than just the U.S. dollar would allow China to make a smoother transition to a more market-determined exchange rate,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who used to be the head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division. \u201cOne consequence of such a shift, given the prospects of further dollar strength in the coming months, would be a further depreciation of the renminbi relative to the dollar.\u201dMr. Prasad added that \u201cthis would certainly be helpful for the Chinese economy, although at best marginally, at a time of slowing growth and weak exports.\u201dBut a weaker renminbi relative to the dollar would make Chinese goods even cheaper in the United States, helping to forestall inflation. Prices in the United States for imported goods have fallen nearly 10 percent in the last year, although partly because of falling commodity prices.The People\u2019s Bank, China\u2019s central bank, clearly pegged the renminbi to the dollar until July 2005. It then allowed a one-time appreciation in the renminbi and said it was starting to peg the renminbi to a basket of currencies. But many statistical analyses by Western economists have shown that the People\u2019s Bank essentially adopted a program of very gradual appreciation to the dollar, with the renminbi showing little correlation with other currencies.As the dollar has strengthened, and as wages in China have risen by double-digit annual percentages, China has found its export competitiveness beginning to weaken. The People\u2019s Bank said in its statement on Friday evening that the renminbi appreciated 2.9 percent against the central bank\u2019s new index during the first 11 months of this year, even as the renminbi weakened slightly against the dollar.As a result, the central bank said, the renminbi \u201cis still a strong currency.\u201dThe International Monetary Fund last week added the renminbi to the fund\u2019s special drawing rights, essentially anointing it as one of the world\u2019s leading reserve currencies alongside the dollar, euro, yen and British pound. China had intervened heavily to preserve the value of the renminbi through its many months of campaigning for accession to the special drawing rights, and the I.M.F.\u2019s decision may have reduced the need for Beijing to continue intervening.China has the world\u2019s largest overall trade surplus and consistently runs extremely large trade surpluses with the United States, exporting $4 worth of goods to the United States for every $1 of American goods that it imports. The Commerce Department released trade data last week showing that the American trade deficit in goods rose to $306 billion in the first 10 months of this year, compared with $282.9 billion during the same period last year.That was roughly half the overall American trade deficit in goods. American banks and other service providers have been asking Beijing for greater regulatory permission to do business in mainland China, which could someday begin to narrow the deficit.China needs to run very large trade surpluses because it has considerable overcapacity in many industrial sectors, and domestic consumption has been growing but not fast enough. Investment in China has been weak.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Graduation Rates Rise, Experts Fear Diplomas Come Up Short", "Date": "2015-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGREENVILLE, S.C. \u2014 A sign in a classroom here at Berea High School, northwest of downtown in the largest urban district in the state, sends this powerful message: \u201cFailure Is Not an Option. You Will Pass. You Will Learn. You Will Succeed.\u201dBy one measure, Berea, with more than 1,000 pupils, is helping more students succeed than ever: The graduation rate, below 65 percent just four years ago, has jumped to more than 80 percent.It is a pattern repeated in other school districts across the state and country \u2014 urban, suburban and rural \u2014 where the number of students earning high school diplomas has risen to historic peaks, yet measures of academic readiness for college or jobs are much lower. This has led educators to question the real value of a high school diploma and whether graduation requirements are too easy.\u201cDoes that diploma guarantee them a hope for a life where they can support a family?\u201d asked Melanie D. Barton, the executive director of the Education Oversight Committee in South Carolina, a legislative agency. Particularly in districts where student achievement is very low, she said, \u201cI really don\u2019t see it.\u201dBut \u201cthe goal is not just high school graduation,\u201d Arne Duncan, the departing secretary of education, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe goal is being truly college and career ready.\u201dIn South Carolina, even with a statewide high school graduation rate of 80.3 percent, some business leaders worry that not enough students have the abilities they need for higher-skilled jobs at Boeing, Volvo and BMW, which have built plants here in recent years. What is more, they say, students need to be able to collaborate and communicate effectively, skills they say high schools do not always teach.\u201cIf you look at what a graduation diploma guarantees today,\u201d said Pamela P. Lackey, the president of AT&T South Carolina, \u201cthe issue is we have a system of education that prepares them for a different type of work than we have as a reality today.\u201dStill, there is no single reason these rates have increased.Over the past decade in California, several large urban districts adopted coursework guidelines aligned to entrance requirements at the state\u2019s public universities. Los Angeles initially required that students earn at least a C in those classes, but the number of students on track to graduate plummeted. Now grades of D or higher are accepted.\u201cIt\u2019s a push and pull between rigorous standards that are harder to meet,\u201d said Russell W. Rumberger, a professor of education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, \u201cand less rigorous standards that are easier to meet but don\u2019t necessarily ensure that you know that much.\u201dIn South Carolina, students must take four years of English and math and three years of social studies and science. Last year, the legislature voted to eliminate the exit exam. Parents of students with disabilities argued that the test made it difficult for their children to graduate, while business leaders said it did not indicate that students were ready for work. Last year, the legislature required all 11th graders to take a test assessing college and career readiness, as well as an exam that measured academic skills needed for most jobs.Even on simpler tests of the cognitive skills needed for many jobs, fewer than two-thirds of South Carolina 11th graders could show sufficient skills in both math and reading.Here at Berea High School, a rare, racially integrated campus with similar numbers of African-American, Hispanic and white students, administrators are proud of the rising graduation rate. Addressing the low scores on the ACT, administrators said many 11th graders had not yet learned the material covered when they took the test. And some educators say such tests do not accurately predict whether students will do well in college or in the workplace anyway.Imari Nicholson, a 17-year-old student at Berea, has expressed interest in sports therapy or dentistry. After he failed chemistry his junior year, his counselor reminded him that he would need the course to qualify for a college program in his chosen fields.He is retaking it this semester. This time, he is getting an A.But he said he was not satisfied with his scores on the ACT, which indicated that he was not yet ready for college. \u201cI expect better of myself,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Economy Is Ripe for Fed Interest Rate Increase", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI think the economy is on the road to recovery,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing well.\u201dWhile insisting the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee would not make a final decision until its meeting Dec. 15 and 16, Ms. Yellen said raising rates would be \u201ca testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession.\u201d\u201cIt is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to,\u201d she said.The Fed has held short-term rates near zero for seven years, seeking to stimulate the economy by pushing lenders to take larger risks and encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow. When the Fed begins to raise interest rates, it will reduce those incentives.The Fed will get one more big piece of economic data before its December meeting. The government on Friday will release a preliminary estimate of November job growth. Absent an unexpected labor market collapse, investors and analysts expect the Fed to move.\u201cShort of saying \u2018We\u2019re going to hike rates in two weeks\u2019 time,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Yellen\u2019s remarks \u201ccould hardly have been clearer,\u201d wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Ms. Yellen offered an upbeat assessment of economic conditions, although she emphasized that the recovery from the recession remained incomplete. She said labor markets had improved substantially, and she noted a \u201cwelcome pickup\u201d in wage growth.\u201cThe economy has come a long way toward the F.O.M.C.\u2019s objectives of maximum employment and price stability,\u201d she said, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed\u2019s policy-making group.She added, \u201cI anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that will be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in the remaining margins of labor market slack and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent objective.\u201dShe noted also that some drags on the economy had subsided. The risks from foreign economic events have diminished, and Ms. Yellen said she expected that government spending would contribute to growth in the coming years. That is a significant change from the postcrisis period, when a combination of spending cuts and battles over fiscal policy weighed on the economic recovery.Other Fed officials have joined Ms. Yellen in beating the drum.Mr. Lockhart said the December meeting could be \u201chistoric in character.\u201dMore than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.\u201cWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress and the economy is on the cusp of full health,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next appropriate step is to raise rates. My preference is sooner rather than later.\u201dA minority of Fed officials continue to express misgivings that the economy is ready for higher rates, but the focus of internal debate has shifted to the pace of subsequent increases.She has also emphasized that the domestic economy remains weak by historical standards.The Fed stimulates the economy by holding interest rates below the level that would otherwise prevail, based on the demand for money. But demand remains weak, and that natural interest rate accordingly remains quite low. The gap between the Fed\u2019s policy rate and the real rate accordingly may be quite small, a reason to move slowly in increasing the benchmark rate.Ms. Yellen acknowledged this point on Wednesday, saying it was a reason for the Fed to move carefully. But she said she expected the natural rate to rise with the economy.The Fed is basically ready to make a bet that the economy will continue to recover. Monetary policy exerts a gradual influence on economic conditions, so the Fed must constantly guess what happens next. And officials are increasingly convinced that the odds are on the side of higher rates.Waiting too long, Ms. Yellen said, might \u201ceven inadvertently push the economy into recession.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton\u2019s Focus Is on G.O.P.", "Date": "2015-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Clinton largely looked past her Democratic rivals in Saturday night\u2019s debate, instead repeatedly assailing the Republican field, led by Donald J. Trump. She called Mr. Trump a threat to the nation\u2019s safety, saying he was fast \u201cbecoming ISIS\u2019 best recruiter.\u201dMrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, sought to frame next year\u2019s election as a choice between her cleareyed approach to national security and the recklessness of Republicans who have demonized Muslims since the recent attacks on Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.\u201cI worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States, and literally around the world, that there is a clash of civilizations,\u201d she said, \u201cthat there is some kind of Western plot or even war against Islam, which then, I believe, fans the flames of radicalization.\u201dMrs. Clinton defended herself forcefully when she came under assault from Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley.But from her opening statement on, she took every opportunity \u2014 and even created some \u2014 to ignore her adversaries onstage and go after what she suggested was the true opposition.Her above-the-fray posture in the debate, held at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., signaled Mrs. Clinton\u2019s confidence, just weeks before the first votes in Iowa, that neither of her Democratic rivals would prove a significant obstacle on her march to the nomination.\u201cBringing Donald Trump back into it,\u201d she said at one point, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition\u201d \u2014 referring to the Muslim nations that would be sought as military allies in fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley both did their best to anger Mrs. Clinton. Mr. O\u2019Malley claimed that she changed her views on guns \u201cevery election year,\u201d and Mr. Sanders reminded viewers of her 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq.\u201cOur differences are fairly deep on this issue; we disagreed on the war in Iraq,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, accusing Mrs. Clinton of being overly hawkish in embroiling the United States in overseas conflicts. \u201cSecretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.\u201dMrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders for his previous opposition to bills backed by supporters of gun control, but was at her fiercest after he challenged her on national security.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201cWith all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya,\u201d she said, before mentioning the former Libyan dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. \u201cYou joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Qaddafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.\u201dBoth her rivals argued that the United States needed to fight the Islamic State, but not necessarily to depose President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.\u201cIt is not Assad who is attacking the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. O\u2019Malley agreed. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be the ones declaring Assad must go,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a role to play, but it is not the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.\u201dMrs. Clinton all but accused her rivals of na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians,\u201d she said, adding that she had wanted to arm the moderate Syrian opposition years ago to avoid the creation of a dangerous power vacuum. \u201cI wish it could be either-or,\u201d she said.Mr. O\u2019Malley, who has been lagging badly behind both of his rivals, proved an irritant to Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. He faulted them both for being insufficiently courageous on gun control and made a point of noting his relative youth next to Mr. Sanders, 74, and Mrs. Clinton, 68.\u201cMay I offer a different generation\u2019s perspective on this?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Malley, 52, interjected at one point.Later, in an exchange about assault weapons, he said, \u201cISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show, and it\u2019s because of the flip-flopping political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on the stage have represented there for the last 40 years.\u201dMrs. Clinton has spent much of this year repositioning herself to appeal to her party\u2019s progressive base, but she bypassed the best chance she had Saturday to embrace the sort of populism that is Mr. Sanders\u2019s calling card.When she was asked, \u201cShould corporate America love Hillary Clinton?\u201d \u2014 a reference to a magazine article during her 2008 presidential campaign \u2014 she spread her arms.\u201cEverybody should,\u201d she said, grinning. \u201cI have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.\u201d She spoke at length about wanting to strengthen the economy and offered praise for responsible employers, noting that her father had been a small-business man.Mr. Sanders, finally stepping in after Mrs. Clinton was finished, was blunt about his views but only glancingly criticized her ties to corporate interests.\u201cThey ain\u2019t going to like me,\u201d Mr. Sanders said of the business community. \u201cAnd Wall Street is going to like me even less.\u201dMr. O\u2019Malley did criticize Mrs. Clinton for her Wall Street connections, recalling that at the Democratic debate last month in Iowa, she defended her fund-raising from the financial industry by suggesting those donors supported her efforts to rebuild Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Mrs. Clinton said again on Saturday that donations from Wall Street made up a small percentage of her contributions, then turned the question around by noting that Mr. O\u2019Malley had gladly raised money from Wall Street as head of the Democratic Governors Association.There were a few such tense moments, but the disputes were tamer than those that have become routine on the Republican debate stage, and were entirely on policy grounds.Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders for proposing expensive government programs without providing details of how to fund them. She estimated that his proposals to make health care and college free would require a 40 percent increase in federal spending, or $18 trillion to $20 trillion. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be really thoughtful about how we\u2019re going to afford what we propose,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich is why everything I propose, I explain exactly how I\u2019m going to pay for it.\u201dMr. Sanders said his plans would help middle- and working-class families and likened them to Social Security and the New Deal. Pressed repeatedly on how he would pay for them, Mr. Sanders cracked a wry smile and said, \u201cNow, this is getting to be fun.\u201dMr. Sanders said his plans would require an increase in taxes but would ultimately save working Americans money. He said a three-month family leave for working families would amount to only $1.61 a week in higher taxes. Mr. O\u2019Malley also would not rule out potentially raising taxes.Mrs. Clinton, casting an eye toward tax-averse general election voters, made a firm pledge not to raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year.At another point, Mr. Sanders attacked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street. But he also pointed to the policies of the presidential administration of her husband, Bill Clinton, including the dismantling of part of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, leading to the commingling of commercial and investment banks. \u201cI led the effort,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, \u201cagainst Alan Greenspan, against a guy named Bill Clinton \u2014 maybe you know him, maybe you don\u2019t.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton scarcely wanted to engage her rivals, except when sharply attacked, and the three Democrats found much to agree on. Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton both, for example, proposed building a coalition of Muslim countries to help fight the Islamic State.\u201cTell Yemen, go to war against ISIS,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI would tell Qatar, instead of paying $200 billion on the World Cup, spend it on fighting ISIS, which is at your doorstep.\u201dSee what the candidates are saying about gun control, immigration and more, and how their positions align with the American people.There were even moments when undiluted comity broke out.Asked whether it was time for the role of the presidential spouse to be redefined, Mrs. Clinton said that her husband would not, as first gentleman, pick out the china or flowers for state dinners, but would offer advice on policy issues, particularly \u201chow we\u2019re going to get the economy working for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.\u201dMr. Sanders used the question to heap praise on Mrs. Clinton, saying she \u201cnot only did an outstanding job as our first lady but redefined what that role could be.\u201dAt the outset, Mr. Sanders was asked about the revelation that at least one of his aides had gained access to and copied information about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters from the Democratic Party\u2019s voter database. But neither he nor Mrs. Clinton showed any appetite to relitigate it.Asked by the ABC News moderators whether Mrs. Clinton, who looked on icily as Mr. Sanders explained the data breach, deserved an apology, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cYes, I apologize.\u201d\u201cI very much appreciate that comment, Bernie,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIt really is important that we go forward on this.\u201dBut Mr. Sanders said that his aides might not have been the only ones viewing information they should not have seen.\u201cI am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign,\u201d Mr. Sanders added.Yet even the unsubstantiated suggestion of impropriety by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was not enough to lure her into a back-and-forth on the subject.As in the first two debates, Mrs. Clinton was the focal point throughout \u2014 even when she was not actually on stage. As the moderators resumed after a long commercial break, both her opponents returned to their places to answer questions about the economy, but Mrs. Clinton\u2019s podium stood empty.\u201cSorry,\u201d she said with a grin as she returned.Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Malley used their closing statements to compare the Democratic trio favorably with the Republican field. \u201cI think we have a lot more to offer the American people than the right-wing extremists,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.But Mrs. Clinton, emerging from another debate unscathed, seemed to acknowledge that much of the American public was probably more absorbed, on the Saturday night before Christmas, by the return of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise.\u201cThank you, good night, and may the force be with you,\u201d she said, beaming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Build a Sustainable City", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsGlobal warming, drought, migration and population growth have put our cities under heavy strain. What does the future hold for them \u2014 and all of us \u2014 in this scenario?Cities have a very significant impact on climate change: It\u2019s estimated that urban areas are responsible for 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Before the climate conference in Paris in December, developed and developing nations alike pledged to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to reach worldwide consensus. But does this consensus absorb the world\u2019s many different realities, cultures and levels of economic development? And is looking at the issue on a country scale the best one to take effective action?If the majority of the world\u2019s population is living in cities, and urban dwellers\u2019 activities have such a large environmental impact, doesn\u2019t it stand to reason that it\u2019s in cities where solutions that will improve people\u2019s lives and our relationship with the planet must be sought and implemented?I firmly believe that cities can help to provide the solutions to the challenges we are facing; that every city, regardless of its size and wealth, can significantly improve in two or three years; and that cities are our society\u2019s last refuge for solidarity.As the list of megacities grows and as more and more people move into cities from rural areas, every city should prioritize three issues that have great impact on the quality of urban life, beginning to find answers that will sustain our society in the long term: mobility, sustainability and sociodiversity.Cars occupy much more space than any human does. An average parking space occupies 25 square meters. If you own a car, it occupies 25 square meters near your home; if you drive to work, it occupies another 25 square meters near your workplace, meaning that a total of 50 square meters are immobilized for parking purposes. In many places in the world, 50 square meters is the size of a family home, or of a workplace. Think of the incredible benefits if at least some of those areas were used to combine home and employment; were appropriated for small, community-building businesses like bakeries, coffee houses, bookshops, flower shops and offices \u2014 or for pocket parks.Our priority in fostering urban mobility should be to provide comfortable, safe, reliable, affordable and easy-to-use public transportation. Every mode (train, subway, bus, tram, taxi, bike) has to operate optimally and be integrated into a transit network. Car shares and bike shares like Paris\u2019 Autolib\u2019 or V\u00e9lib\u2019 also have their role.But it\u2019s my belief that the future of public transportation is in systems like bus rapid transit, which some think of as a \u201csurface subway.\u201d BRT systems make use of existing infrastructure \u2014 changes often involve designating dedicated lanes, making adjustments to right-of-way rules, and targeted technological upgrades to eliminate the delays associated with urban buses. Because of their good performance, cost effectiveness (it\u2019s cheaper than building a subway) and flexibility in implementation, BRT systems, which started in the Brazilian city of Curitiba in 1974, are now in place in almost 200 cities worldwide including Bogot\u00e1, Seoul, Istanbul, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro, and many more could follow. I see the BRT as evolving to one day become a system of light electric vehicles with rubber tires running on exclusive tracks, re-charging at each stop.When addressing sustainability problems, the key is to avoid wasting energy, time and resources. Some simple ways to get started are within everyone\u2019s reach: Use your car less; live closer to work; recycle and compost. Although more efficient and energy-saving construction techniques and materials are important, it is a city\u2019s layout that can make the biggest difference to the effort to create a more sustainable urban environment. The layout is the city\u2019s structure of organization and growth.A healthy city is an integrated structure of life, work and movement. It requires urban design that respects the land and the area\u2019s ecosystem: the topography, bodies of water and vegetation. This design guides investments made by the public and private sectors and must involve the intelligent use of density, compactness and a mixture of uses and income levels.As the urban economy has shifted toward service, retail and knowledge-based industries, more jobs are now closer to people\u2019s homes, and with the help of new technologies, many people can work from anywhere at any time. The shorter the commute between home and work, the more time and energy we save. Cultural amenities and quality public spaces that can be reached by public transit or on foot are also a part of this equation.On the other hand, fragmenting cities into areas with specialized functions such as suburbs, central business districts and downtown areas condemns these spaces and their infrastructure to be idle during long periods of the day or night. A more compact city that supports a diversity of activities leaves more land for conservation, water catchment and farming.When you\u2019re working on issues arising from diversity, it\u2019s important to remember that cities have long been seen as \u201cmelting pots\u201d that absorb new dwellers. Much of the New World was built according to this recipe, and we cannot forget the lessons of our past. But now, both the New and Old worlds are fearful of the waves of people who challenge the status quo. Our society is facing problems of identity posed by increasing sociodiversity, and the recent migration crisis brings the need for coexistence front and center.Cities must offer hope, not desperation. A sense of shared identity, the feeling of recognition and of belonging to a specific place, improves quality of life. A city must provide reference points to which people can relate and connect \u2014 rivers, parks, public buildings. Such spaces tell stories and protect memories, much like a diary or a family portrait.At the same time that a city\u2019s identity is preserved, sociodiversity must be fostered. A city cannot condone ghettos, be they intended solely for the rich or the poor, or for people from specific ethnic backgrounds or certain age groups. Walls and fences are illusory protective barriers: Safety and security are a function of the respect and civility that derive from integration and coexistence.Economic prosperity brings peace and stability. But instead of seeking solutions to generate economic growth mostly through fiscal mechanisms, we should invest in quality of life. Imagine the number of jobs \u2014 and therefore income \u2014 that could have been generated all over the world if at least part of the billions of dollars that were poured into the banking system and automotive industry had been invested in education, health, culture, good infrastructure.A city\u2019s design must be a collective construct, a shared dream, so that a feeling of co-responsibility informs our efforts. That does not mean that consensus must be reached every step of the way: The search for absolute consensus can lead to a state of paralysis. Democracy is not consensus but a permanent conflict that society must arbitrate with great sensitivity. Long-term policies should be adjusted through constant feedback from the people.The crises we are experiencing should fuel efforts to start building better cities now. A more cohesive and sustainable society arises from its public spaces and landmarks, good streets, squares, parks, memorials, theaters and museums. These are a city\u2019s \u201cliving rooms,\u201d where urbanity happens. A human construct by definition, a city is a setting for people to meet. We must shape its future.Jaime Lerner is an architect, urban planner and former politician in Brazil. He is the author of \u201cUrban Acupuncture.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Triple-digit inflation is eating away at salaries and shortages have Venezuelans waiting in hours long lines just to buy sugar, diapers and other basic goods. But this crisis is of the government\u2019s making, not the result of a \u201cwar\u201d by shadowy right-wing forces. And that\u2019s why the opposition was able to endure a tough campaign and break through a rigged electoral system.It was a historic win: More than 74 percent of Venezuelans voted \u2014 up from 66 percent in the last parliamentary election \u2014 and 112 of the National Assembly\u2019s 167 seats went to the opposition coalition, giving it the coveted supermajority. But before the opposition celebrates its success, it would do well to look back at the last 17 years since President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor and ideological godfather, took power.The \u201cChavistas\u201d have proved again and again that they are democrats when they win a vote and authoritarians when they lose. It would be surprising if things were different this time around. Indeed, the opposition-controlled National Assembly may be powerless before its term even begins if the government decides to try to cripple it.There are unsettling precedents. In 2007, a referendum on radical constitutional reforms put forward by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez failed by a narrow 51-to-49 margin. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez insulted the opposition\u2019s victory, crudely calling it meaningless, and over the next several years enacted every one of the rejected reforms, including a controversial amendment abolishing term limits on the presidency.Passing a bogus law giving the executive branch legislative powers and rigging the courts to undermine the Parliament would be a dangerous path for Mr. Maduro. He would not only be engaging in constitutional fraud, adding to a growing list of prosecutable offenses, but he would be ignoring the demands of a fed-up electorate that so far has been patient and generally avoided violent protests.All eyes are on Mr. Maduro, and he is risking whatever support he may have left in the region as well as the survival of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela. But if history is any guide, he is likely to be tempted to nullify the election results and grab as much power as he can.The new members of the Parliament will be sworn in on Jan. 5, 2016. The weeks before then will be critical for determining whether Mr. Maduro will be willing to work with the National Assembly, prove that rule of law exists in Venezuela and deal with the tanking economy \u2014 or if he will insist on fighting fictional wars. If he cares about his country\u2019s future, he\u2019ll sit down with the opposition.Ra\u00fal Stolk is a Venezuelan lawyer and writer. He blogs at\u00a0caracaschronicles.com.Advertisement"}

(\u201cGosh, darn!\u201d Mr. Romney would exclaim; Mr. Bush chides supporters against sounding like \u201cnervous Nellies.\u201d)Both were personally likable policy aficionados who inspired tremendous loyalty from aides. But like Mr. Romney before him, Mr. Bush has showed difficulty connecting with many voters in a visceral way.\u201cThere\u2019s a stiffness, there\u2019s an awkwardness, there\u2019s a question about the ability to relate to people in their lives,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, who was a strategist for President George W. Bush.Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama, said: \u201cThey\u2019re both like America\u2019s awkward dad, and have a tendency to say cringe-inducing things, either because they\u2019re just awkward things or political mistakes.\u201dMr. Romney, of course, went on to win the Republican nomination. But Mr. Bush \u2014 who criticized Mr. Romney at times in the 2012 campaign, memorably saying he seemed \u201creluctant to share what\u2019s in his heart and who he is\u201d \u2014 faces a far more complicated political reality this cycle, with a crowded field filled with more colorful personalities and ample political talent and charisma.Tom Rath, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist who worked on Mr. Romney\u2019s presidential bids in 2012 and 2008, said that Mr. Bush, like Mr. Romney, was deeply interested in policy. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to come out there and be Jay Leno for 10 minutes and then get down to serious business,\u201d said Mr. Rath, who is now supporting Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t come naturally.\u201dIn conversations months ago about Mr. Romney\u2019s vulnerabilities and weaknesses, the Bush team tried to learn from Mr. Romney\u2019s mistakes, according to aides, tweaking elements like press strategy and campaign style.When Mr. Romney ran in 2012, his strategists cast him as a repairman for the country\u2019s floundering economy. But many voters never warmed up to him or came to believe that he cared about them.By contrast, Mr. Bush frequently talks on the trail about the need to \u201cshow what\u2019s in my heart,\u201d aiming to persuade voters that he has their interests and their families\u2019 concerns in mind.\u201cWith Mitt, there was a strategic assumption that the election would be a referendum on President Obama,\u201d said David Kochel, a top Bush campaign strategist who previously worked for Mr. Romney. \u201cNow there\u2019s a recognition that you have to have a little bit of an open window into who the candidate is.\u201dMr. Romney infrequently took questions from reporters, creating a vacuum that magnified any verbal misstep. The Bush team, knowing they have a candidate prone to similar misstatements, says it is determined not to make that mistake.Mr. Bush makes a point of holding news conferences every few days, and seems almost physically incapable of ignoring queries thrown his way. When he leaves events or is getting into his car, he often will turn back to respond to reporters\u2019 shouts, as if he cannot bear to leave a question unanswered.This week in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush chided an aide who tried to cut short a news conference, and the next day, finding himself surrounded by reporters, said gamely, \u201cO.K., a couple of questions.\u201dAnd he recently hired Jon Kraushar, an image-maker and debate coach, to help with how to sidestep questions and stick to his talking points \u2014 or what he tactfully called \u201cthe new art\u201d of respectfully listening to a question \u201cand then answering what\u2019s on my mind.\u201dAnd while Mr. Bush shows discomfort with what he considers \u201cbragging,\u201d he is getting used to talking about his achievements. At a luncheon in Columbia, S.C., he talked up his record in Florida and allowed that he had the \u201cleadership skills to fix a few big complex things.\u201d But he could not help but preface those remarks by saying, \u201cI was taught never to toot my own horn, but here goes.

{"Headline": "Republicans Make Presence Felt at Climate Talks by Ignoring Them", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExcept for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California, no prominent Republican has participated in the events in this Paris suburb.Of the candidates seeking the party\u2019s nomination for president, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Donald J. Trump reject the scientific consensus that human activities are warming the planet, while Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio have acknowledged that the planet is warming but oppose President Obama\u2019s view that the government can and should do something about it.Anxiety that the Republican-controlled Congress or the next president might undo Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious goals for weaning Americans off fossil fuels was so high that 10 Democratic senators flew here last week to reassure other countries.\u201cThe Republicans do not have the votes to overturn the president\u2019s clean-power rules,\u201d Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts said last Friday, at Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s event at the Paris City Hall.Republicans have derided the talks as a waste of time. On Monday, the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based think tank that does not accept the scientific consensus on climate change and has ties to Republican lawmakers, held its own conference, at a hotel in Paris. The next day, Mr. Cruz led a subcommittee hearing in Washington on whether political bias had influenced climate science.In that way, the Republicans are very much present in Paris. Delegates and supporters of a deal are aware that Mr. Obama cannot portray one as a \u201ctreaty,\u201d because a treaty would never be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate. In discussions before the talks, many Europeans expressed dismay over United States politics, coupled with an urgency to reach an agreement before Mr. Obama leaves office.The Republicans\u2019 unyielding approach has even sympathizers shaking their heads.\u201cParis could provide a chance for the Republican Party to get on the right side of history,\u201d said Andy Karsner, who was an assistant secretary of energy under President George W. Bush.At the International New York Times Energy for Tomorrow Conference in Paris on Wednesday, Mr. Karsner, now an adviser to Google X, Google\u2019s research and development arm, urged climate-change skeptics to leave the realm of the ideological and view the promotion of renewable energy in economic terms.That is the view espoused by Mr. Schwarzenegger, who in a Facebook post on Monday said that even if climate science was bunk, Americans should support a shift to clean energy because of the deaths caused by air pollution; because fossil fuels are not inexhaustible; and because renewable power sources are a better bet economically.\u201cAs long as you can give Republicans the choice of saying, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t really think that 20 years from now there will be a sea level rising,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t think that is human-caused,\u2019 and stuff like that, you give them an opening, and they will use it,\u201d he said in an interview on Tuesday. He added that it was far more effective to frame the argument in terms of the immediate effects on health and the economy.Secretary of State John Kerry took a similar tack in a speech here on Wednesday.\u201cFor a moment \u2014 and a moment only \u2014 let\u2019s give the climate deniers the benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said. Even if the overwhelming scientific consensus is wrong, he asked rhetorically, \u201cwhat is the worst that could happen\u201d by shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy?\u201cWell, we absolutely would create millions of new jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would boost our economies, and for some countries where they\u2019ve slowed down, they need that boost. They need the capital that would flow into energy investment. We would see a healthier population, healthier children.\u201dHe added, almost as a side note, there would be \u201ca huge contribution to global security.\u201dGov. Jerry Brown, who succeeded Mr. Schwarzenegger in California, said that \u201cif we can get an authoritative announcement that carbon pollution is real, that it is an existential problem and the countries of the world are committed,\u201d it will erode what he called \u201cRepublican denial,\u201d which he said had been effective at \u201csowing doubt and engaging in very sophisticated obfuscation.\u201dSurveys have shown that in no other country is climate-change denial as prevalent as it is in the United States.If that changes, it may be because of the business community as much as anything else. Several progressive companies, like Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Michelin, Nissan-Renault and Unilever, have taken part in the Paris climate meetings or related events, and Mr. Kerry has praised Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs for their climate-related financing commitments.Coral Davenport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And no less than Harrison Ford has shown what a president can do if he is Han Solo and Indiana Jones rolled into one.With the Islamic State suddenly rivaling the economy as their top concern in recent polls, many voters are looking for wartime strategies from the 2016 presidential candidates. But after seven years of a cerebral President Obama, there is no denying that some also want a leader who radiates gutsiness and a take-charge resolve. Not simply the \u201cstrong leader\u201d that pollsters ask about, but someone who makes them feel safe on a visceral level.\u201cIn scary times, you want heroes as presidents,\u201d said Barbara Hovland, the Republican chairwoman in the Mason City area of Iowa. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want a president who can take care of himself, his family and the country at the same time, like Harrison Ford did? When Donald Trump said recently in Iowa that he would cut off the heads of ISIS, the crowd went wild.\u201dMr. Trump and Hillary Clinton, and to a lesser extent Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, were the candidates most mentioned as likely to strike fear into the hearts of America\u2019s adversaries during interviews with about 20 voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first nominating contests in February.\u201cWe need someone who understands that ISIS is 10 times more dangerous than Al Qaeda was,\u201d said Dean Nason, a Republican in Wakefield, N.H. \u201cMovie presidents make you feel good. Trump makes people feel good. And Hillary Clinton, she may have problems, but she knows how to survive.\u201dYet the desire to feel in control, at a time of turmoil, is having ugly consequences in the eyes of some voters. Many Republican officials are trying to stop Syrian refugees from entering the United States, and some have used incendiary language about Muslims, which some voters see as stoking the recent violence and threats against mosques in Connecticut, Florida, Nebraska and Texas.\u201cI have more fear of Americans who want to take charge and take things into their own hands than I do of international terrorists coming into our country,\u201d said Kim Van Es, the Democratic leader in Sioux County, Iowa. \u201cThese Americans are already here.\u201dMr. Trump, in an interview, had no regrets about the Alabama crowd\u2019s roughing up the black man, saying, \u201cPeople were very angry at his disruptions, and their feelings matter, too.\u201d He said he \u201cunderstood\u201d that his tough talk could stir passions, but he instead attributed the violence to Americans\u2019 pent-up frustrations, which he said a president has to face, and not to some deep-seated racism or ill will.\u201cAmericans are very tired of feeling pushed around,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing with ISIS, immigration, China, Russia, the border, good jobs. We can have victories. Victories don\u2019t just have to be in the movies.\u201dWhile Mrs. Clinton denounced Mr. Trump last week for \u201ctrafficking in prejudice and paranoia,\u201d she is calibrating her own gung-ho style of leadership to people\u2019s insecurities.She has proposed more aggressive actions in Syria \u2014 like imposing a no-fly zone and ordering more airstrikes \u2014 than Mr. Obama has taken. And while some voters see Mr. Obama as weak because he is unwilling to risk American troops and avoids blunt language like the Republican catchphrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d Mrs. Clinton is open to more Special Operations troops in Syria and has been using the phrase \u201cradical jihadism\u201d to try to counter the buzzwords of the right.Many Democrats now say they believe that Mrs. Clinton would be a more formidable commander in chief than any of the men running in either party. This itself is a notable development, given how much time she spent in the 2008 campaign trying to convince Americans that a female president could be a strong leader. Back then, her campaign ran an ad saying that voters could trust her with emergency 3 a.m. phone calls, and her aides half-joked that she was manlier \u2014 using a saltier anatomical reference \u2014 than Mr. Obama and John Edwards combined.\u201cI get the sense that Hillary hates backing down, that she really believes in fighting, and I think our enemies would realize that she would make life harder for them,\u201d said Darlene Nulk, a teacher and Democrat in Lee, N.H.But several Republican analysts said the rise in terrorism has helped Mr. Trump in the short term. He has rebounded recently in opinion polls, with voters praising his focus on keeping terrorists and undocumented immigrants from entering the country.Others said Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Syrian refugees \u2014 \u201cI want to know who the hell they are\u201d \u2014 could not have been scripted better to appeal to Republican voters.\u201cHis words are exactly what Americans want to hear,\u201d said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, citing a profanity that Mr. Trump used in promising to bomb Islamic State militants. \u201cRepublicans want to kill our enemies before our enemies kill us,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re not asking for a long r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a list of advisers.\u201dMr. Trump, like many Republicans, said Reagan \u2014 a movie star who knew the persuasive power of performance \u2014 was an inspiration in how he projected toughness. He said he, too, liked movies with heroic presidents. And he suggested that many Americans love movies and swagger more than politics and restraint.Mr. Ford, a lifelong Democrat, declined to comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Rate Move May Not Hurt Eurozone, but It Won\u2019t Help Much, Either", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Cheap oil. A weak euro. Money printing by the central bank.The larger question for Europe is why the eurozone\u2019s economy is not responding more to the help it is getting not only from its own central bank but also, inadvertently, from the Fed.But because the Fed has signaled its intentions so clearly, not much is likely to change for the eurozone on Wednesday unless there is a surprise \u2014 for example, a statement by the United States\u2019 central bank pointing to faster interest rate increases than investors are expecting.\u201cThe prospect of the Fed raising rates and the E.C.B. easing policy in December has been fully priced in by currency markets,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in an email.The euro was trading at $1.10 on Tuesday, down from $1.25 a year earlier.The Fed is expected to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade because the American economy has achieved modest but steady growth and unemployment is within the range considered de facto full employment in the United States job market.That is in sharp contrast to the eurozone, where joblessness remains high and economic growth is still sluggish despite everything the European Central Bank has thrown at it. Growth in the 19 countries of the currency zone will be just 1.5 percent this year, at an annualized rate, according to European Central Bank forecasts. Unemployment in October was 10.7 percent.The eurozone does have some forces that should work in its favor. Besides having an attractively weak currency, the eurozone economy has gotten a slight lift from lower energy prices, which give consumers more money to spend on other things. And the European Central Bank has been buying government bonds and other assets, a form of money printing that has helped reduce borrowing costs for companies and individuals. Fears that higher interest rates in the United States could spread to Europe have not materialized.All those factors, taken together, are the economic equivalent of performance-enhancing drugs. Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B., said during a speech in Bologna, Italy, on Monday that stimulus measures \u201care producing their desired effects.\u201dBut the effect has been muted by too many negative factors, economists say. And Fed action is not likely to change that. Mr. Draghi also warned on Monday that monetary policy alone \u201ccannot bring lasting prosperity for our economies.\u201dThe eurozone is still recovering from the effects of the global financial crisis that began in 2007, followed by the Greek debt crisis. Many banks are still weighed down by problem loans, which discourage them from issuing new loans to finance business expansion and hiring.Mr. Schmieding of Berenberg estimated that the cheap euro, the main side effect of Fed policy, adds just 0.1 percent to eurozone growth. That only partly offsets the effect in Europe from turbulence in developing countries like China, which are important customers for eurozone exports like cars and luxury goods.\u201cThe exchange rate is always a secondary factor,\u201d said Marie Diron of the ratings agency Moody\u2019s. \u201cWhat drives exports really is demand. Cheap doesn\u2019t help if the demand isn\u2019t there.\u201dThe Fed is partly the cause of the emerging market turbulence. Investors are less willing to gamble on developing countries like South Africa and Turkey when they can earn a reasonable return in the United States, with less risk.But many of the problems in emerging countries stem from decisions made by their own governments. Slower growth in China was caused in part from overinvestment in steel factories and other industries, along with a bumpy shift to an economy based more on consumer demand.As a result, businesses in Europe remain cautious \u2014 even in strong countries like Germany.At first glance, Germany would appear to have all the elements for a boom. Credit is cheap and plentiful. Unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is less than half the eurozone average and lower than in the United States. Germany\u2019s many export companies benefit from the devalued euro.And yet a survey published on Tuesday of midsize companies in Germany found that managers were more pessimistic than six months ago. Stefan Bielmeier, chief economist at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, which conducted the survey with two other banks, said that company executives were worried not only about China but also about economic instability in Russia, war in Syria and the influx of migrants into Europe. Fed policy is barely on their minds.Mr. Bielmeier said he expected eurozone growth in 2016 to be 1.5 percent, worse than this year. \u201cWhere are the impulses?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have already have had strong stimulus for a long time. Yet growth is still moderate.\u201dStefano Micossi, an economist who is director general of Assonime, an Italian business group, said that eurozone leaders had failed to address some of the problems that hold back growth in the eurozone.Italy and France have not done enough to make their economies more competitive, he added.In his view, E.C.B. stimulus measures, including monthly asset purchases of 60 billion euros, or $66 billion, and a benchmark interest rate of only 0.05 percent, have merely dulled the pain of Europe\u2019s underlying problems.\u201cWe are fully under the influence of morphine,\u201d Mr. Micossi said, warning that Europe\u2019s problems had yet to be fully felt.\u201cThe tensions are still underwater,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are likely to emerge at some stage.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gates Takes On Climate Change With Nudges and a Powerful Rolodex", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been a bit surprised that the climate talks historically haven\u2019t had R.&D. on the agenda in any way, shape or form,\u201d Mr. Gates, 60, said in an interview last week on the sidelines of the summit meeting, which ends on Friday.Mr. Hollande and Mr. Obama agreed to work with Mr. Gates to assemble a coalition of governments to double their spending on energy research and development. For added heft, Mr. Gates volunteered to organize a group of billionaires to fund clean-technology start-ups. He reached out to his extensive network, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Jack Ma of Alibaba and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, all of whom agreed to participate.Last week, on the opening day of the Paris meeting, Mr. Gates joined Mr. Obama and Mr. Hollande to introduce the coalition. It will commit 20 governments to doubling their renewable energy research budgets to a total of $20 billion over the next five years.\u201cBill Gates is the intellectual architect of this,\u201d said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama on energy and climate change policy, referring to the group of private investors.The partnership has already drawn criticism. With the new clean-energy fund, detractors say Mr. Gates and other members of the coalition are overly focused on energy moonshots that will take decades to pay off \u2014 if they ever do.\u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing to stipulate that countries underinvest in R.&D., but it doesn\u2019t change the fact of the time frames involved,\u201d said Joe Romm, a former United States Energy Department official and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.The new coalition also will not come close to supplying what is needed to make the global energy transition necessary to stop climate change. The World Bank has estimated the cost of such an effort at up to $100 billion annually.Mr. Gates said the coalition was focused on early-stage investments but any breakthrough start-ups could raise more capital to finance deployment of their technologies. \u201cThe more than $2 billion we have committed right now is just a start,\u201d he said. \u201cAs deals come in and the government pipeline increases, that number will grow.\u201dThis account of how the public-private partnership came together is based on more than a dozen interviews with people involved in the effort, who spoke on the condition that they not be named because many of the conversations were private.The seeds for a partnership were planted in January when President Obama visited Mr. Modi in New Delhi. Mr. Obama\u2019s goal was to forge a close relationship with Mr. Modi, in hopes of finding common ground on climate change. During those conversations, Mr. Modi pointed out his challenge: He needed new electricity to help raise India out of poverty, but coal was the cheapest power source. He said India would use clean energy if there were tech breakthroughs that provided that energy inexpensively.Mr. Modi\u2019s message prompted Mr. Obama to consider how to achieve more clean-energy innovation. One idea was a multigovernment coalition to increase spending on clean technology.The foundation, whose endowment is now more than $41 billion, says it has spent $34.5 billion in the 15 years since it was formed, concentrating on initiatives to alleviate world poverty, enhance global health and improve education in the United States. In June, Mr. Gates met with Mr. Hollande to lay out his ideas. Over the summer, Mr. Gates also discussed the issue with Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides.At that meeting, the men discussed India, \u201csaying, \u2018Come on, world, we need to do R.&D.\u2019\u201d for more clean energy, Mr. Gates said. The two agreed about a public-private partnership to fund clean-energy innovation, with Mr. Modi even coming up with a name: Mission Innovation.At the same time, the Obama administration solidified its idea of creating a coalition of governments to increase public spending on clean energy.Mr. Gates also proposed creating a group of private billionaire supporters. To link it with the government coalition, he stipulated the billionaires would not invest in clean technology in a country unless that country\u2019s government was part of the joint government fund.He said he knew he needed patient investors, because energy technologies typically take decades to refine and deploy. So he reached out to contacts worldwide, including the Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal and the Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. In mid-September, he emailed Mr. Bezos, the Amazon chief, who agreed immediately to join.Mr. Gates also emailed Neil Shen, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist in China. \u201cHe knows many parts of the global economy,\u201d Mr. Shen said of Mr. Gates. \u201cI think that kind of leadership fits very well to rally these kinds of investors in a coalition.\u201dMr. Gates discussed the effort with Reid Hoffman, a co-founder and executive chairman of LinkedIn. At a meeting in Seattle this fall, Mr. Gates made it clear that he needed people to contribute meaningful amounts of capital, not just lend their names to the push, Mr. Hoffman said.\u201cBill has committed to investing $1 billion of his own money,\u201d Mr. Hoffman wrote in an email, \u201cso in joining the coalition you have to put in real dollars.\u201dCoral Davenport reported from Le Bourget and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Skelos and Silver, How to Save Albany", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAlbany \u2014 AFTER just a day of deliberation, a jury found former State Senate majority leader Dean G. Skelos and his son guilty on Friday of federal corruption charges. The decision came less than two weeks after another jury handed down a similar verdict against former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.Of course, New York isn\u2019t alone: Across the country, state-level corruption is a common story. And yet Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver fit a pattern. These cases follow similar convictions against a long list of New York political leaders, including Pedro Espada Jr., John L. Sampson, Malcolm A. Smith, Thomas W. Libous and Joseph L. Bruno (though his conviction was overturned on appeal).Obviously, all of these men betrayed our state. But it\u2019s not enough to blame a few bad apples when we have a cart full of them. There\u2019s a problem with the system, too \u2014 namely, our part-time Legislature.Despite the fact that New York is one of the largest states in the country and one of the largest economies in the world, my colleagues and I work shockingly few hours: Next year we are scheduled to spend just 57 days in Albany between Jan. 6 and June 16, when the legislative session ends.Thirty of those days will go toward completing the state budget, due at the end of March. Those days will be totally consumed with fiscal analysis and negotiation, leaving only 27 days between April 1 and June 16 to consider all other governmental business, including more than 10,000 bills. There\u2019s little chance we\u2019ll get to more than a handful of those. Our part-time Legislature fails the needs of the public and sets the lowest of expectations for legislators.The recent criminal convictions demonstrate an even more pressing reason for a full-time Legislature. When the Assembly and Senate are in Albany, the members are able to question and look over the shoulders of the leaders. When the Legislature is out \u2014 which is to say, most of the time \u2014 too much power is abdicated to the two legislative leaders and the governor. A full-time Legislature would temper that power and allow for far more scrutiny of the conduct of legislative leaders.This isn\u2019t a new idea, and it has its critics. Oddly, some claim that the part-time, \u201ccitizen-legislator\u201d model honors our founders\u2019 vision of democracy. But the 18th century is long past \u2014 and in any case, our founders were pragmatic men who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to change the rules when needed. We pay them no respect by failing to live up to their faith that future American generations would do the same.Others claim that our state Constitution would need to be amended to keep the Legislature active throughout the entire year, a lengthy and cumbersome process. But our state Constitution contains no such requirement. The number of days the Legislature spends in Albany is entirely up to the Senate and Assembly.Four additional reforms are necessary to counter corrupt influences and open the process to greater public scrutiny.As in Congress, state legislators should not engage in outside employment. Their exclusive and unyielding loyalty must be to the citizens of New York, not the clients of their law firms, the corporations or the special interests that employ them. Instead, they should be full-time employees of the state, with sufficient incomes to offset the loss of outside employment.Moreover, to open the legislative process to the public, the Legislature must adopt a televised system similar to C-Span. Not only should floor debate be broadcast, but also committee meetings, where much of the real work gets done.Yet another reasonable reform would be a ban on slush funds. One of the revelations at Mr. Silver\u2019s trial was that he had control over large amounts of public money, and answered to no one in determining to whom his largess would flow. Even more shocking to many New Yorkers was that such a fund was legal in the first place.The people have the right to know how each public dollar is spent. There must be a straightforward schedule of all such funding published on the state\u2019s website identifying the amounts, the recipients and the identity of the legislator initiating an appropriation.Finally, we need to recognize that these convictions have brought public faith in the state government to an abysmal new low. In response, the Legislature should conduct public hearings on legislative integrity throughout the entire state. New Yorkers have every right to express their concerns and offer ideas on how to improve our legislative process. Public-interest groups and social and political scientists should be heard as well.To bounce back from the Silver and Skelos convictions, the Legislature needs to clean house, beginning with these common-sense reforms. New Yorkers deserve no less.Charles D. Lavine, a Democratic assemblyman from Long Island, is co-chairman of the New York State Legislative Ethics Commission and chairman of the Assembly Standing Committee on Ethics and Guidance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Down From the Trees, Humans Finally Got a Decent Night\u2019s Sleep", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterOver the past few million years, the ancestors of modern humans became dramatically different from other primates. Our forebears began walking upright, and they lost much of their body hair; they gained precision-grip fingers and developed gigantic brains.But early humans also may have evolved a less obvious but equally important advantage: a peculiar sleep pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird, compared to other primates,\u201d said Dr. David R. Samson, a senior research scientist at Duke University.Until recently, scientists knew very little about how primates sleep. To document orangutan slumber, for example, Dr. Samson once rigged up infrared cameras at the Indianapolis Zoo and stayed up each night to watch the apes nod off.By observing their movements, he tracked when the orangutans fell in and out of REM sleep, in which humans experience dreams.\u201cI became nocturnal for about seven months,\u201d Dr. Samson said. \u201cIt takes someone who wants to get their Ph.D. to be motivated enough to do that.\u201dIn the new study. Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn combined that information with studies of 19 other primate species. The researchers found wide variations in how long the animals slept. Mouse lemurs doze for seventeen hours a day, for example, while humans sleep just seven hours or so a day \u2014 \u201cthe least of any primate on the planet,\u201d said Dr. Samson.The scientists looked for factors that could explain the differences. Compared with big mammals, for example, smaller species tend to sleep more during the day and in short bouts, perhaps because they need to eat many times a day.Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn found that the time each primate species spends asleep generally corresponded to its physical size, along with other factors, such as the average number of primates in a group.The one big exception: humans. We sleep a lot less than one would predict based on the patterns seen in other primates.From time to time while sleeping, we slip into REM sleep and dream. All told, we spend about 22 percent of sleep in REM, the highest ratio of REM to total sleep in any primate, the researchers reported.Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn have an explanation for how humans ended up sleeping so little, and so often in REM.Over tens of millions of years, they assert, changes in our ancestors\u2019 ecology drove the evolution of new sleeping patterns. Humans increasingly have been able to achieve a good night\u2019s sleep.A number of studies suggest that REM sleep benefits the brain. Some scientists argue that it sweeps out molecular debris, and others say it consolidates new memories into lasting impressions.But it was not easy for our monkey-like ancestors to reach REM sleep. They slept on branches, and their nights were anything but easy. As monkeys try to sleep today, they get roused by winds, tree snakes and the jostling of their fellow primates.\u201cIt\u2019s like economy class on a plane,\u201d said Dr. Samson. Monkeys, he believes, have to rest longer to get the benefits of REM sleep.The fossil record suggests that 20 million years ago, the ancestors of humans and other apes changed their sleeping habits because they became too big for branches. Today, no primate that weighs over 60 pounds sleeps on a branch. Instead, chimpanzees, bonobos and their cousins build sleeping platforms each night from sticks and other materials.Dr. Samson and his colleagues have found that apes take great care in choosing trees to sleep in and the materials to build their platforms. The reason, he suspects, is that apes aim to get the best night\u2019s rest they can.Dr. Samson and the primatologist Robert W. Shumaker found that orangutans that got to make platforms of foam and other comfortable materials scored better on cognition tests the following day than apes that slept on straw.Early human ancestors probably continued to sleep in trees until about two million years ago, Dr. Samson said. By 1.8 million years ago, new hominins like Homo erectus had left the trees. \u201cI think we can be safe in saying Homo erectus slept on the ground,\u201d Dr. Samson said.Early humans probably slept around fires in large groups, able to ward off predators. The result, said Dr. Samson and Dr. Nunn, was the chance to get an even better night\u2019s rest. Humans were able to fall more soundly asleep and to experience deeper bouts of REM sleep.Since it took less time to get the benefits of REM sleep, humans were able to get by with less sleep over all than other primates. They gained a few extra waking hours each day, which they might have used to make new tools or share stories.Dr. Patrick J. McNamara, a neurologist at Boston University School of Medicine, found the new study compelling. \u201cWe as a species have found a way to get more out of a shorter sleep span than other species,\u201d he said.But he and other scientists also said that the study raises many puzzling questions.Dr. Robert A. Barton, an evolutionary biologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, noted that mouse lemurs are so tiny that they can sleep inside tree cavities. They ought to be able to enjoy short, efficient sleep as we do, but instead they are marathon dozers.While our REM sleep may be unusual among primates, it is not so special among mammals. \u201cThe platypus is the champion,\u201d said Dr. Jerome M. Siegel, a sleep researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. That creature spends half of its sleep in REM.Dr. Samson replied that the evolution of sleep may be driven by different factors in different groups of species. Figuring out what those factors are will take many more sleepless nights of research.\u201cThese first studies are really exciting indicators that something really profound is going on here,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think the jury\u2019s still out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There isn\u2019t one partner dictating to the other, whereas Western nations come in saying, \u2018You go left, you go right.\u2019\u201dStill, experts say that Beijing will have to skillfully adapt to a changing relationship with Africa. China\u2019s insatiable demand for raw materials, which has fueled much of the rapid growth in Africa, has cooled as the Chinese try to steer their own economy away from construction and exports to consumption and services.As the price of commodities has also plummeted, the economies of former models of solid growth, like Zambia, Angola and Mozambique, have tumbled.Zhong Jianhua, China\u2019s special representative on African affairs, said the summit meeting signaled the start of a new stage in relations \u2014 one marked by a \u201cnew normal\u201d of slower growth in China.\u201cBoth sides need to review and look back to see what we have done, and also see what we can do more,\u201d Mr. Zhong said.Expectations from African nations are high.President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos of Angola had met Mr. Xi the night before to emphasize the need to broaden China\u2019s involvement in Africa\u2019s economy beyond raw materials, said Samuel Andrade da Cunha, director of Asia and Oceania in Angola\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry.\u201cWe would like technology and everything to be transferred from China to Angola,\u201d Mr. da Cunha said. \u201cWe would like to make products in Angola by building factories or developing agriculture in Angola, which we can then export to other countries.\u201dChris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The number of Cuban medical professionals who defected for residency in the United States reached a record this year, putting a crimp in the newly restored relations between the two countries and forcing Cuba to scramble to stop the exodus.Cuba denounced the program in recent weeks as the two nations met to discuss American immigration rules that give Cubans special opportunities to enter the United States and become residents.With so many Cubans worried that the coveted status will melt away now that diplomatic relations have been established with Havana, there has been a wave of people from all professions leaving the island over the past year.\u201cNo country is going to welcome engineered defections of its nationals,\u201d Mr. Muse said. The United States, he said, was \u201cnot acting in the spirit of normalized relations.\u201dMedical diplomacy is also an indispensable source of income: Cuba rents out the services of tens of thousands of doctors, nurses and dentists to other developing countries in exchange for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil and cash.Such rewards, though, are won on the backs of medical professionals who work for little money in tough conditions, doctors say.Dr. Lino Alberto Neira, an orthopedic surgeon who practiced in Cuba for 23 years before he left for Miami in 2013, said that his monthly salary of $25 back home barely lasted four days. He got by with tips from patients who worked in tourism, he said.\u201cSomeone who cleans floors in a hotel is supporting you,\u201d said Dr. Neira, speaking from Miami. \u201cThat\u2019s very humiliating.\u201dCuba more than doubled some doctors\u2019 salaries last year, to about $70 a month. But faced with such small salaries at home, many doctors accept a posting overseas to make extra money.Still, they earn only a fraction of what the host country pays Cuba for their work.Dr. Mara Mart\u00ednez, a dentist who is Dr. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, said she was a staunch supporter of the Cuban revolution but became disillusioned when she arrived in Venezuela to find that she had to work six days a week and sleep three to a room for a salary of $210 a month. Venezuela, she was told by her supervisors, was paying $7,000 per month for her services.\u201cIt\u2019s modern-day slavery,\u201d said Dr. Mart\u00ednez, 25, who left Venezuela with Dr. S\u00e1nchez.Many of the doctors in Venezuela are stationed in cramped quarters without air conditioning, overwhelmed by the country\u2019s soaring inflation and deteriorating economy. \u201cIt was worse than Cuba,\u201d said Dr. Dailanis Barbara Mart\u00ednez Peralta, a general practitioner who after leaving Venezuela waited seven months in Colombia to come to the United States.More than 7,000 Cubans have been approved for residency since the program began almost a decade ago, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.According to Homeland Security statistics, 1,663 Cuban medical professionals posted overseas were accepted to enter the United States in the 2015 fiscal year, a 32 percent increase from the year before. The number of doctors admitted to the program has more than tripled since 2011, when 386 people were approved.Cuban officials have repeatedly assailed the medical parole program as a \u201creprehensible practice\u201d aimed at \u201cstealing\u201d Cuban talent. A State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the United States \u201cdoes not recruit Cuban medical professionals,\u201d but simply gives them a voluntary route to residency. The Department of Homeland Security suggested that the delays were the result of the increased number of applicants. Dr. Mart\u00ednez said that out of a group of 250 or so medical workers who were stranded, along with her and Dr. S\u00e1nchez, all but a dozen were eventually given residency.An American official who was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly said that the program had been held up because some applicants had presented fraudulent credentials, which caused the government to rigorously review documents.The day after the talks, Cuba announced that starting Dec. 7, specialist doctors would have to get permission to travel abroad, reverting to a restriction lifted two years ago and deeply angering many medical professionals on the island. The move came just three months after the Cuban government issued a call for doctors who had defected to come home, promising them the opportunity to attend conferences and resume their careers.Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said the decision to restrict travel was \u201cpart of the chess game,\u201d intended to put pressure on the United States to end the program and revise other regulations that offer residency to almost any Cuban who makes it to a United States border. One surgeon in Havana who asked that his name not be used said that the Cuban government\u2019s restrictions had not surprised him because \u201cso many doctors are leaving.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since you can live off a doctor\u2019s salary,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThose who aren\u2019t leaving \u2014 it\u2019s because they can\u2019t get the money together for a plane ticket.\u201dMedical professionals from any country who migrate to the United States often find that their credentials are inadequate and that the jobs that are available pay poorly.In Miami, Dr. Neira is caring for an older Cuban man and studying to be a nurse because his Cuban qualifications are not recognized. In Paterson, Dr. S\u00e1nchez, who works on a ragged downtown strip in a job that pays $15 an hour, said he planned to do the same. First, though, Dr. Mart\u00ednez, his fianc\u00e9e, will try to get her dentistry license.There are days, said Dr. S\u00e1nchez, especially weekends, when Paterson gets him down. \u201cYou start to think about family,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout your neighborhood. About what everyone would be doing on a Sunday. About the baseball game.\u201dStill, he enjoys his freedom and appreciates how Americans mind their own business. He would like to move to Miami, where there is year-round sunshine and a big Cuban population. \u201cWe depend on our own efforts, on getting our careers off the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For many, years of investment and work have evaporated in recent months, with minimal help coming from provincial governments led by Mr. Zuma\u2019s party, the African National Congress. If losses continue or deepen, the drought could eventually pose a challenge to the African National Congress, which relies increasingly on the support of rural black voters to maintain its hold on power nationally.Some of the A.N.C.\u2019s most loyal supporters are small-scale black farmers who benefited from the government\u2019s land redistribution policies.Since 1994, the government has taken more than 200 million acres of agricultural land owned by whites and distributed it among 235,609 black South Africans, according to the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. The figure is far below the A.N.C.\u2019s goal of redistributing 30 percent of the land; by 2011, only 3.7 of agricultural land had been redistributed.White South Africans still dominate commercial farming. Many black farmers have been unable to move beyond small-scale or subsistence farming because of a lack of capital, experience and land.Still, between 30 to 40 percent of black-owned farms were profitable before the drought, according to the National African Farmers Union of South Africa, which represents black farmers like Mr. Koee. The drought is wiping out many of the gains black farmers made after the end of apartheid, said Mandla Buthelezi, the union\u2019s senior vice president. He said he had lost 300 cows out of a herd of 800 in recent months on his farm in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal.\u201cThis knock will take black farmers not less than 15, 20, 30 years to recover,\u201d Mr. Buthelezi said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do our homework very well. We weren\u2019t proactive. We\u2019re just reacting to the drought.\u201dWillem de Chavonnes Vrugt, a white farmer and an official at a farmers\u2019 association that runs workshops for black farmers, called the drought an \u201cact of God,\u201d but said that problems such as overstocking or overgrazing had aggravated the situation. \u201cNobody can plan for the severity of the drought the way it is,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the drought is more severe if you\u2019ve got bad farming practices.\u201dOn his farm, fields normally blanketed in cornstalks by now were brown and unplanted because of the drought. Out of 300 cows, he had lost three.Main Mmopelwa, a black farmer, has also lost three cows this year, including one on a recent morning, and now had only 12 left. A decade ago, he had amassed as many as 24 cows.Unable to buy enough feed for his surviving cows, Mr. Mmopelwa did not know what to do with them.\u201cWho\u2019s going to buy them when they are this thin?\u201d he said.Mr. Mmopelwa shares a 1,800-acre piece of land with 14 other families in Lekubu, a village about 100 miles northeast of here. About 600 cows graze on land that the absence of seasonal rains has left with balding patches of short grass. The provincial government has given struggling black farmers cattle feed, though far too little to prevent significant losses, farmers said.With few fences inside their property, the 15 families are unable to control livestock to avoid overgrazing.\u201cThe problem with black farmers is the lack of capital, land and skills,\u201d said Jeremiah Moiloa, 24, who majored in agricultural sciences in college. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can\u2019t manage the animals during the drought.\u201dHis father, James Moiloa, the chairman of a group representing the 15 families, has lost four cows recently, leaving him with about 100. A former civil servant, Mr. Moiloa, 73, became a full-time cattle farmer 12 years ago. He had attended workshops run by a farmers\u2019 association, but his experience, he said, was limited.\u201cWhen we buy feed from the white farmers, we ask them for advice,\u201d he said, looking at a pen that held his cattle, some of them visibly emaciated.His son, though, was not pessimistic. He had written his final college report on how to breed Holstein cows in South Africa.\u201cThis country\u2019s population is growing and more people are drinking milk,\u201d he said. \u201cDairy products are going to be very, very big.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Needs a National Slavery Monument", "Date": "2015-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFresno, Calif. \u2014 ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY years ago today, America ratified the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery throughout the country. It was a momentous victory. But it also prompted a protracted campaign to whitewash how slavery would be remembered, one waged in Southern parks and squares, on the region\u2019s university campuses and statehouse grounds. By the 1930s, Confederate monuments stood watch all over the South, buttressing a white supremacist interpretation of the past.Finally this year, after the Confederate sympathizer Dylann Roof murdered nine black worshipers in Charleston, S.C., protesters began to demand the removal of proslavery memorials and flags from the commemorative landscape. This movement has now spread beyond the South and beyond the issue of slavery, as students from Bowdoin, Princeton and other schools have pushed their institutions to rethink the honors they have bestowed upon prominent racists.White Americans have long used monuments to propagate a flawed understanding of slavery and its role in the Civil War. When Charlestonians raised a memorial to the South Carolina statesman John C. Calhoun in 1896, they praised his dedication to truth, justice and the Constitution \u2014 ignoring his devotion to slavery, which he famously called \u201ca positive good.\u201dHundreds of similar monuments convinced generations of white Southerners, and others, that the Confederacy had gone to war to defend states\u2019 rights, liberty and the Southern way of life. Anything but slavery.Meanwhile, a second set of monuments depicted slavery as a benevolent system that fostered loving relationships between masters and slaves. In 1896 in Fort Mill, S.C., a Confederate veteran installed a monument \u201cdedicated to the faithful slaves who ... guarded our defenseless homes, women and children\u201d during the Civil War.The Confederate Monument at Arlington National Cemetery, unveiled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1914, features a black body servant following his master off to war and a \u201cmammy\u201d taking charge of a white soldier\u2019s infant. In 1923, the Daughters obtained Senate approval to erect a mammy monument in Washington, a national memorial to those who, according to one congressman, \u201cdesired no change in their condition of life.\u201dThe mammy memorial was never built, as black opponents, joined by some whites, stopped it. One African-American newspaper warned that it would bomb the memorial if it were constructed. Completed statues also elicited protest. Black Charlestonians vandalized the Calhoun monument, as they had an earlier Calhoun statue on the same spot.Antislavery voices have put up their own memorials as well, from the bronze relief of Robert Gould Shaw and the Massachusetts 54th Regiment on Boston Common to the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall.Yet even these monuments can reinforce myths about slavery. The 1876 Freedmen\u2019s Memorial to Abraham Lincoln, also in Washington, portrays the president as the Great Emancipator, standing tall as he grants freedom to a crouching slave. That tens, even hundreds of thousands of enslaved people \u2014 including Archer Alexander, whose likeness served as the model for the sculpture\u2019s bondsman \u2014 seized their own liberty before and during the Civil War is not acknowledged.Monuments raised in recent years better convey an accurate picture of slavery. New York\u2019s African Burial Ground National Monument, marking the graves of more than 400 enslaved and free blacks, was unveiled in 2007 and provides a counterpoint to the belief that slavery was only a Southern institution. And Charleston\u2019s monument to Denmark Vesey \u2014 a former slave who plotted an unsuccessful 1822 slave insurrection \u2014 highlights the brutality of antebellum slavery as well as the lengths to which the enslaved would go to win their freedom.The campaign for a Vesey monument underscores the difficulty of memorialization projects rooted in a frank assessment of slavery. Advocates struggled to overcome fierce opposition for nearly two decades; they succeeded in 2014 only after agreeing not to place the memorial in a prominent city square, opposite the Calhoun monument, but in a park on the edge of Charleston.Rather than relegating slavery to the margins of memory, we must place it front and center. Decades ago, scholars demolished claims that slavery did not cause the Civil War and debunked fairy tales about faithful slaves and doting masters. New research has gone further, exposing how American capitalism and democracy \u2014 once thought to be antithetical to slavery \u2014 emerged hand-in-hand with it.Our nation\u2019s capital is replete with memorials to presidents and veterans. Why not raise a slave monument alongside them? Congress actually entertained the idea in 2003, when the National Slave Memorial Act was introduced, but ultimately authorized the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture instead.Next year the museum will open its doors, and it will turn a spotlight on the pivotal role that African-Americans have played in this nation\u2019s history and economy, often against their will. But its broad scope and mission mean that there is still space, and a need, for recognition of slavery itself.The Charleston massacre in June provoked serious conversations about how we commemorate our past. One hundred and fifty years after emancipation, it is time for a serious memorial to America\u2019s original sin.BLAIN ROBERTS and ETHAN J. KYTLE are professors at California State University, Fresno, who are writing a book about the memory of slavery in Charleston, S.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel\u2019s War for Europe", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMBURG \u2014 FOR the 10 years that she has occupied the German chancellor\u2019s office, Angela Merkel has kept her country out of any meaningful military engagement, most recently in Libya, even if this meant leaving her European partners in the lurch. Now, with her decision to commit fighting forces in Syria, the chancellor is not only entering her first war, she is entering a new kind of world war.Ms. Merkel has been deeply skeptical about military interventions, not for ideological reasons (she endorsed the Iraq war in 2003), but out of pragmatism. It didn\u2019t take any special prescience to see how badly they would turn out, and to Ms. Merkel, the likelihood of losing the support of Germany\u2019s traditionally pacifist mainstream \u2014 and therefore, likely, her job \u2014 always appeared significantly higher than of winning a war.So strong was her aversion to military risk that she even stayed out of NATO\u2019s minimally interventionist operation in Libya in 2011, despite a United Nations authorizing resolution and Arab League consent.What made the chancellor change her mind in Syria? It\u2019s not just that a majority of Germans, 57 percent according to recent polls, favor military action against the Islamic State. It\u2019s also that Ms. Merkel had to change her course in the Middle East in order to keep her course for Europe.Ms. Merkel understands that the war in Syria represents a different kind of conflict. It pits not just countries and alliances against one another, but ideas \u2014 in particular, three ideas of world order: the authoritarian world order, embodied by Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad and his ally Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who put stability above human rights and democracy; the liberal world order, represented by Western Europe and America, which value the reverse; and the Islamic State, which seeks to upend both orders and replace it with a world-spanning caliphate.This three-way clash presents a potentially fatal challenge to European unity, and Ms. Merkel seems to believe that she had to change her course in the Middle East in order to keep her course for Europe. By sending reconnaissance jets and refueling planes to Syria and a frigate into the Mediterranean, she is fighting less to destroy the Islamic State than to save what\u2019s left of European Union solidarity.The combination of the euro crisis, the enormous refugee influx and the Paris attacks have brought the union\u2019s political cohesion to an unprecedented low. More clearly than ever before, we see that sharing common values held only until it was tested. Whereas the currency crisis revealed long-unaddressed economic culture clashes across the Continent, the refugee crisis exposed an even deeper divide within the bloc \u2014 above all, very different, and clashing, ideas about tolerance.Eastern European states have made it clear that they will accept neither Muslim refugees nor their free movement in Europe. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Victor Orban, says he wants \u201cto keep Europe Christian.\u201d One of the first public acts of the newly elected right-wing government of Poland was to remove the European flag from its press briefing room \u2014 a clear sign that the country will cordon itself off from the European Union if Germany continues its open-door policy for refugees.These xenophobic, anti-union views, long relegated to the far right in the West, have broken into the mainstream in the wake of the Paris attacks. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front, shares the Eastern European view that the union should be all but dismantled, starting with the Schengen idea of borderless travel. She also shares the broadly Southern European view that the euro is an unhealthy corset that suffocates the breathing of national economies.Ms. Le Pen was already scoring high in France\u2019s polls before the terrorists hit Paris. And her party was the big winner in regional elections on Sunday, with a 30 percent share of the votes nationwide. The chances that she will be the next president of France are real.If this happens \u2014 if one of the main powers behind the European Union elected a radically anti-union leader \u2014 the whole thing could begin to disintegrate.Not only would the core of the European Union, the French-German partnership, split; Germany would find itself more or less isolated as the last big \u201ctraditionalist\u201d European Union country. Britain might well follow France\u2019s lead and withdraw \u2014 already a strong possibility \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t take long for other countries to do the same.And in an atmosphere of instability and fear, Europeans could well decide that it\u2019s payback time against Germany, the annoying headmaster, whose economic and cultural domination has rankled too many for too long.At least, this is the fear in Berlin, and this is why Germany has now jumped into Syria.But to what end? As opposed to France, Russia or America, destroying the Islamic State isn\u2019t Ms. Merkel\u2019s main goal. Rather, she wants to demonstrate, alongside France and Britain, that Europe\u2019s political center can still act coherently, decisively and in solidarity against what Europeans regard as a common threat to their liberty and safety.The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, did not invoke NATO\u2019s Article 5 after the Paris attacks. Instead, he invoked the solidarity clause of the European Union treaty, the first leader ever to do so. Ms. Merkel\u2019s challenge, then, is to show that the principle behind the treaty, behind the European Union itself, isn\u2019t an empty promise \u2014 for her sake, and for the Continent\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Pushes to Revive Fracking, Possibly Under National Parks", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government is once again trying to revive its flagging effort to extract the country\u2019s natural gas and oil from shale rock.On Wednesday, members of Parliament voted 298 to 261 to approve legislation allowing use of the shale-gas-extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing 1,200 meters, or nearly 4,000 feet, beneath the surface of national parks and other protected areas, including World Heritage sites.The opposition Labour Party criticized the government for weakening the protection of areas that need it. \u201cWe should have a moratorium on fracking in Britain until we can be sure it is safe and won\u2019t present intolerable risks to our environment,\u201d said Lisa Nandy, a Labour energy spokeswoman.Britain, in a separate effort to generate greater interest in shale, is expected to soon award new licenses for shale gas and oil exploration, possibly in national parks.The government, which says that it will not allow fracking to be conducted from wells inside national parks and other protected areas, appears to be trying to find a balance between the demands of environmentalists to ban the practice entirely in parks and the oil and gas industry, which is pushing to be allowed to tap new resources.Britain is particularly interested in shale gas because it could provide cleaner fuel for generating electricity than the coal-fired plants the country plans to phase out by 2025.\u201cWe currently import around half of our gas needs, but by 2030 that could be as high as 75 percent,\u201d Amber Rudd, the British minister for energy and climate change, said in a speech last month. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re encouraging investment in our shale gas exploration, so we can add new sources of homegrown supply.\u201dDespite government support, the British shale industry has struggled to gain traction. Environmental groups and local opposition have contributed to slowing the allocation of exploration licenses.The biggest obstacle to the growth of hydraulic fracturing, though, has been a lack of proof that the commercially exploitable resources exist despite studies suggesting large quantities of gas sit beneath some parts of Britain.Chris France, director of planning at the park, said that in considering whether to allow fracking, park officials would weigh the possible environmental damage against the potential economic benefits. \u201cAbsolutely economic benefits and the U.K.\u2019s need for shale gas are very much issues we would have to take into account, \u201c he said by telephone.British national parks attempt to meld preserving scenic beauty and wildlife with some commercial and residential activity. North York Moors is already the site of gas production from nonshale sources, by a company called Third Energy.The company said on Wednesday that it expected Britain to allocate new onshore exploration licenses soon, and that it had applied \u201cfor many\u201d of them to expand its 300,000-acre portfolio.Stephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Results in Spain Are a Stinging End to Europe\u2019s Year", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the Spanish vote, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, a center-leftist who had built a good relationship with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, renewed his attack on austerity and, quite nearly, Ms. Merkel personally, effectively blaming her policies for the rise of populism across Europe.\u201cWe have to be frank,\u201d Mr. Renzi told The Financial Times. \u201cEurope has to serve all 28 countries, not just one.\u201dThe disgruntlement added to the sense of isolation that has been building in Berlin over a migration crisis and Germany\u2019s economic prescriptions, as well as the near-shredding of European unity that the year had already brought.The postelection muddle in Spain was yet another setback in a year of cascading crises, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London.\u201cIt has been an annus horribilis,\u201d Mr. Grant said, noting that decades of European political stability built on strong political parties were crumbling as upstart political forces like Podemos, a leftist movement that finished third in Spain, challenge the old order.\u201cThis is the end of the bipolar era in Spain,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Lafond, the executive director of EuropaNova, a research group based in Paris. \u201cThe same thing is happening in France, in Italy and other countries. We now have a fragmented political system all around Europe.\u201dThe Spanish election results mirror the increasing disarray in the European Union itself, and thus pose perhaps the gravest challenge for Germany, which has risen for decades as Europe\u2019s No. 1 power by presenting its policies as European, rather than German, goals.\u201cWe are pretty much isolated on the refugee question,\u201d said Sylke Tempel of the German Council on Foreign Relations. But \u201cit\u2019s not just austerity, or the refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger thing.\u201dEurope\u2019s rising populist parties are \u201cabout to throw away everything we have built over the last decades,\u201d Ms. Tempel said. This means the European Union urgently needs to convince disillusioned publics that it is relevant, and necessary.Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a committed European, conceded in an interview in the current issue of Der Spiegel that \u201cthe refugee crisis has mercilessly exposed the rifts in Europe\u201d when \u201cthe results of the financial crisis are far from having been overcome.\u201dEuropean authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.The mantra of members of the European elite like him has long been that the Continent emerges more unified from each of its many crises. But even Mr. Steinmeier admitted that \u201cit is not easy\u201d to trust in that history these days.With the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria surging to No. 1 in polls, the country\u2019s chancellor, Werner Faymann, a Social Democrat, suggested in an interview this month that the best way for established parties to win votes was not by austerity, but by kick-starting the anemic European economy.\u201cThe best thing is if somebody who is unemployed today gets a job again. And that is not the case for 24 million people in Europe at present,\u201d Mr. Faymann said. \u201cIn some regions, that is not the case for more than half the young people. And perhaps just as big a number again cannot live decently from what they earn.\u201dPopular unhappiness with Europe has helped create a space filled by insurgents on the right like the nationalist Marine Le Pen in France. With memories of Fascism still strong in Spain, Greece and Portugal, it is the radical left that has surged there.Membership in mainstream political parties is slumping across Europe. A study led by a researcher at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands found that mainstream parties in France, Italy and Britain had lost about two-thirds of their members since the 1990s.Mr. Lafond, the Paris research group head, said this disenchantment with traditional parties reflected a mood of angry impotence as the real power to shape events largely shifted from national political leaders to the market, the institutions of the European Union and corporations.\u201cThe world is getting more and more complicated, but political leaders have less and less impact on reality,\u201d he said, adding that this left voters open to populists\u2019 promises to beat back what they present as anti-democratic forces of Brussels technocrats and global financiers.Outside Greece, where Syriza, a coalition of radical leftists, swept to power in January, Europe\u2019s political insurgents are not strong enough to win elections outright. But, as may happen in Spain, they can paralyze the formation of stable governments.Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research group, and a former official in the European Commission, cautioned that austerity, though an easy target for political insurgents, had been overblown as a reason for Europe\u2019s political disarray when there is also intense alarm over migration and economic globalization.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame austerity for this. If you look at the facts, austerity is basically over,\u201d Mr. Wolff said, noting that the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm in Brussels, had steadily let up the pressure for spending cuts.All the same, he added, Spain\u2019s political muddle sends \u201ca clear signal that we have huge economic problems along the periphery\u201d and that \u201cGermany is not the growth locomotive for Europe that it should be.\u201dProducing strong growth and dealing with the refugee crisis are only Europe\u2019s most visible challenges for 2016. Leaders in Brussels and in Berlin face a yet more daunting task if they want to save what has been built, Ms. Tempel said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t manage very well to give the E.U. a positive narrative as something that we want and not something that we need,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need it, and we should want it as well.\u201d Speed, but also patience, is of the essence, she added. \u201cThe time of fooling ourselves is over.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Slowdown Tarnishes Economic Boom in Copper-Rich Zambia", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNDOLA, Zambia \u2014 Pulling up in his white Mercedes S.U.V., Liu Youbin shouted over the din of the construction site where Chinese supervisors in red uniforms and helmets watched over a couple of dozen Zambian workers. He vaunted the speed of Chinese construction crews, later handing out a pamphlet that read, \u201cDollar Hill Shopping Mall, Wholesale City & Amusement Park. Coming Soon!!!\u201d\u201cBefore, everything was great,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we lose money every day.\u201dBut China\u2019s economic slowdown has caused Zambia\u2019s economy to tumble. Thousands of jobs have been lost, and the outlook is now so grim that Zambia recently held a national day of prayer to revive its currency, one of the world\u2019s worst performers this year.The emergence of a new consumer class across Africa in the past decade, as well as growth and investment in the service sector, fueled hopes of sustained economic expansion on the continent. But the quick downturn in recent months in many of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing economies suggests how much of the impressive growth in the past decade and a half was still driven by a boom in commodities \u2014 one supercharged by China.Now, China\u2019s demand for raw materials has cooled, as it tries to shift its economy away from construction, investment and exports to one driven by consumption and services. That transformation is already jolting countries in Africa, from those with diversified economies, like South Africa, to those dependent on a single export, like Zambia or Angola, even as the Chinese government and businesses express long-term commitment to the continent.In a sign that China is moving beyond its focus on Africa\u2019s raw materials \u2014 and perhaps in response to critics who say that the benefits to Africa from that focus have been limited \u2014 Mr. Xi is expected to announce plans to help bolster industrialization and manufacturing.Chinese businesses are still investing in Zambia and elsewhere. South Africa recently said that China had pledged $50 billion to help it industrialize, including the deployment of 200,000 Chinese industrial managers to train locals.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see how much capacity, strength or will China has toward Africa during this period,\u201d said Ross Anthony, the acting director of the Center for Chinese Studies at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. \u201cIf they play it right and show commitment irrespective of their own domestic issues, that could really cement relations between China and Africa, because there are many people in Africa that are still sitting on the fence.\u201dHere in the Copperbelt of Zambia, two mines have closed in recent weeks, after their owners blamed the low price of copper and Zambia\u2019s worsening electricity shortages for rendering their businesses unprofitable. Six thousand workers have lost their jobs. But the shock was compounded by the fact that one of the mines had a Chinese owner, the China Nonferrous Metals Company.\u201cPeople expected China, or Chinese companies, to be the last to retrench workers,\u201d said Godfrey Hampwaye, an economic geographer at the University of Zambia and an expert on relations between China and African countries. \u201cPeople thought China was Africa\u2019s best friend.\u201dZambia\u2019s president, Edgar Lungu, who faces an election next year, recently spent five days touring the Copperbelt in an attempt to assuage rising anger, but he was often met with jeers.China surpassed the United States in 2009 as Africa\u2019s biggest trading partner. But as its demand for commodities has diminished \u2014 helping to bring down the worldwide prices of everything from copper, iron ore and oil to coal, diamonds and gold \u2014 many other African governments are confronting yawning holes in their budgets.Some previously high-flying, commodity-dependent countries, like Zambia, Angola and Ghana, have borrowed heavily from international creditors in recent months to raise badly needed cash. With creditors now demanding higher interest rates, the debt load of some African nations has started to increase, a decade after the debts of many African countries were written off.The continent\u2019s two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, are slowing down, contributing to what the International Monetary Fund said would be 3.75 percent growth in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015, the slowest rate since 2009.In some nations that sell commodities to China \u2014 including Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo \u2014 authoritarian governments with shrinking resources to quiet political challengers are responding with increasing force.Here in Zambia, as well as in many other African nations, there are few signs that governments used the profits from the commodities boom to diversify their economies and to make them less dependent on foreign investors and less subject to cycles of boom and bust. Copper, which makes up more than 70 percent of Zambia\u2019s exports, is now worth less than half of its peak price just a few years ago.\u201cThe time for reckoning has come because we have been putting all our eggs in one basket,\u201d said Nkole Chishimba, the president of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, the country\u2019s largest labor umbrella organization. \u201cZambia, since independence in 1964, has talked about the need to diversify beyond copper, and we have just missed another great opportunity to do that.\u201dZambia could have used revenues from the copper boom to develop other areas, like agriculture and tourism, Mr. Chishimba and others said.Some Chinese here say they will keep doing business as Zambia rides out its current slump.\u201cLong-term, this place is still a good investment,\u201d said Mr. Liu, 35, the businessman behind the new shopping center here, near the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium, one of two stadiums that China has built in Zambia.His family, which is from Fujian Province, founded Mei-Mei Zambia Limited about eight years ago as a manufacturer of concrete blocks, and is expanding its business by building the shopping center.Many Chinese noted that China\u2019s engagement with Zambia dated back to Mao Zedong, under whom China built a railway linking Zambia and Tanzania in the mid-1970s, a huge project that still earns China good will on the continent.That history, and the business opportunities here, still draw Chinese like Yu Qi, 26, a physician from Jiangxi Province. After completing his residency, Mr. Yu said, he joined his large family in Zambia, where he helps manage a copper mine in Chingola, about 100 miles northwest of here.\u201cZambia\u2019s full of opportunity,\u201d he said.An uncle, he explained, had stayed in Zambia after completing a government project two decades ago. He founded a company that now has several divisions and employs 10 family members, including Mr. Yu, who runs China Copper Mines in Chingola.One of the mine\u2019s owners, Richard Zhang, 54, began working in the copper industry in Jiangxi Province in 1982, just a few years after China embraced market policies.\u201cTwenty or 30 years ago, China was also very poor, even poorer than this stage of Africa,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cAfter we bring these new ideas and technology to Africa, maybe after 20 or 30 years, Africa can maybe surpass China. I would be happy to see that.\u201dFrom the early stages of China\u2019s economic modernization, the government ensured that Western and Japanese companies seeking to do business in China, including in the copper industry in Jiangxi, transferred skills and technology.But Zambia and other African nations appear to have failed to benefit broadly from the commodities boom, whether by not negotiating better terms with Chinese companies, not insisting on technology transfers or not using the revenues from raw materials to diversify their economies.\u201cWe have to look inwards as sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d said Kryticous Nshindano, the executive director of the Civil Society for Poverty Reduction Zambia, a good-government organization. \u201cIs it an issue of leadership, institutions, corruption? We know what we\u2019re supposed to do, but why are we not doing what we\u2019re supposed to do?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is it also true for what we call progress? Are all the dazzling technological inventions and social transformations of our time nothing more than superficial variations on an unchanging template?Certainly the pace of change in life today is dizzying, for better and for worse. We are in incessant contact with each other and can instantly access all the knowledge accumulated across human history; we will soon be transported in driverless cars and healed by robot physicians. On the social front, to be gay or transgendered is ceasing to be a curse of Cain \u2026Yet it is also true that the more rapidly we move forward, the greater the resistance. At the most terrifying end of the reactionary spectrum, fanatical Islamists adopt cutting-edge technology for their murderous rush to an idealized past. And even in a bastion of prosperity, literacy and freedom like the United States, there is a bizarre and spreading resistance to science, whether on climate change, vaccine or evolution.So does that mean, as King Solomon opined almost three millennia ago, that in the end there is nothing new under the sun, that the frenetic pace of invention and evolution of the 21st century ultimately amounts to been-there-done-that? I know that when I stand on a cliff over the sea on an autumn day mesmerized by the ceaseless crash of waves below, it is hard to resist the wise monarch\u2019s conclusion that \u201cIt has been already in the ages before us.\u201d But then I remember that we are causing these seas to rise dangerously, and the fish to vanish, and I wonder, will it really be the same in the ages after us?My Russian friend and Solomon are right, of course, in the sense that in the end we remain bound by the same passions, the same natural rhythms and mortality as all our ancestors were. But the paradox is that part of that constant is an insatiable curiosity and an extraordinary ingenuity that forever seek to channel those passions, manipulate the rhythms and defy the mortality. Change is in our genes: We and our fellow creatures are programmed to forever evolve in order to survive. And when we mess up, we change again, and again, and again. Nothing new under the sun?

{"Headline": "Venezuelan Opposition Claims a Rare Victory: A Legislative Majority", "Date": "2015-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Government opponents surged to a rare victory here on Sunday in key congressional elections framed by the country\u2019s deep economic crisis, claiming a legislative majority for the first time in years and handing a significant setback to the heirs of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his socialist-inspired movement.The victory significantly alters the political balance in this deeply divided country and augurs a power struggle between the long-marginalized opposition and the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the successor and disciple of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.Tibisay Lucena, the head of the electoral commission, announced about 12:30 a.m. Monday that the opposition, represented by the Democratic Unity coalition, had won 99 seats and that the government\u2019s United Socialist Party had won 46 seats. She said final results were not in for 22 seats.\u201cChange has started today in Venezuela,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Torrealba, the head of the Democratic Unity coalition.As word filtered out that the opposition coalition, which includes a range of parties, had won a majority of seats, activists at the group\u2019s election-night headquarters in a Caracas hotel smiled broadly and exchanged high-fives.\u201cWe are entering a period of transition,\u201d said Henry Ramos, an opposition leader who predicted that the coalition had received as many as 113 seats in the 167-member National Assembly. \u201cThe government is very weak.\u201dHe predicted that Mr. Maduro would not reach the end of his term in 2019 and that he would be removed by \u201cconstitutional means,\u201d such as a recall referendum, a change to the Constitution, or by being forced to resign.Before the results were announced, a stage that had been set up in central Caracas for a government party celebration was taken down.\u201cWe have come with our morality and our ethics to recognize these adverse results, to accept them and to tell our Venezuela, \u2018The Constitution and democracy have triumphed,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mr. Maduro said, appearing on television immediately after Ms. Lucena announced the outcome of the election.But he stopped far short of accepting responsibility for the electoral debacle, laying blame for the loss on what he calls an economic war that he says is being waged against the country by shadowy capitalist forces, rather than on his own economic policies.\u201cIn Venezuela the opposition has not won,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, a counterrevolution that is at our doorstep has won.\u201dThe election took place 17 years to the day after Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was first elected president \u2014 and for virtually all of that time, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, his allies or his political heirs controlled the National Assembly.At many polling sites in Caracas, voters showed up as early as 5 a.m. on Sunday. While opposition activists reported some irregularities \u2014 including confrontations between supporters of different parties and scattered delays caused by malfunctioning digital voting devices \u2014 voting in general appeared to take place in an atmosphere of calm.\u201cI always used to support the government, but not anymore,\u201d said Gabriela Le\u00f3n, 37, after casting her ballot in a hilltop slum long known as a pro-government bastion. \u201cI feel let down.\u201dShe said that she was fed up with rising prices, long lines to buy food and other necessities and rampant crime. \u201cI want my kids to grow up in a safe place, in a pretty country,\u201d she said.Mr. Maduro said before the vote that an opposition victory would be a nightmare and that he would take to the streets in rebellion in that case \u2014 an unusual suggestion by a sitting president who still controls most levers of power. The government entered the balloting carrying a heavy burden amid two years of recession expected to represent a shrinking of economic production of about 15 percent.Many voters said that they did not know the names of the opposition candidates they were voting for, nor did they care \u2014 they planned to press the symbol of the opposition Democratic Unity coalition on the touch-screen ballot, a potent, anyone-but-these-guys rejection of the governing United Socialist Party.Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, an administrator in a government ministry, had a hard time coming up with the name of the opposition candidate he planned to vote for, saying in the end that he would simply look for the thumbs-up symbol of the opposition coalition.\u201cI\u2019m voting for the party, for change,\u201d he said, referring to the unity coalition. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez said that he had always voted for Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s movement.

{"Headline": "Volkswagen Terms One Emissions Problem Smaller Than Expected", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWOLFSBURG, Germany \u2014 It was the corporate equivalent of saying \u201cnever mind.\u201dThe automaker said Wednesday that it had overstated things last month when it announced an auto emissions problem that regulators had not yet detected \u2014 that it had misled the public about the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of 800,000 vehicles in Europe. The number, Volkswagen said on Wednesday, was only a small fraction of that \u2014 no more than 36,000.German transportation regulators have not yet confirmed the revised, smaller number. But if it is accurate, it means that Volkswagen would have to repay only a small fraction of the 2 billion euros, or $2.2 billion, in tax incentives that the company originally estimated customers in Europe had improperly received from their governments for driving cars with low emissions of greenhouse gases.The tax breaks were granted by governments on the basis of the low emissions and good fuel economy that Volkswagen had initially reported for the cars \u2014 and that the company on Wednesday said it could once again vouch for, in most cases.Whether \u20ac2 billion, or a much smaller figure, the money is only a portion of the many billions of dollars Volkswagen could end up spending in repairs, fines and lawsuit settlements over the much bigger scandal it has not been able to explain, or explain away. That is the problem of deceptive software it has admitted installing in more than 11 million diesel cars that was designed to let the cars cheat on emissions tests.If the scaled-back admission on Wednesday holds up, it might be a rare, if minor, piece of good news for the company. But it also raises questions about why the company announced the 800,000 figure and whether Volkswagen still has a public communications problem.Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it had chosen to err on the side of caution when it disclosed the new problem and gave the figure of 800,000 cars. The company said that after retesting the vehicles, it concluded that its original measurements of fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions were accurate for the vast majority of the vehicles.And even for 36,000 or fewer of the vehicles, Volkswagen said, the fuel economy and emissions discrepancies might be small enough that the company may not have to reimburse any tax breaks. The fuel data was off by the equivalent of less than two miles per gallon, the company said, and the carbon dioxide-emission figures were off by a \u201cfew grams\u201d per 100 kilometers, or about 60 miles, traveled.Volkswagen\u2019s bigger issue remains the diesel cheating scandal involving 11 million cars. Most are in Europe but about 500,000 of them are in the United States, where regulators disclosed the deception in September.On Thursday here in Wolfsburg, Matthias M\u00fcller, the Volkswagen chief executive, will hold his first news conference since the wrongdoing came to light and he was promoted to replace Martin Winterkorn, who resigned a few days after the deception was exposed.Mr. M\u00fcller is expected to provide an interim report on the company\u2019s own investigation of who was responsible for the diesel cheating. How forthcoming the company is able to be will be a test of its campaign to restore credibility.Volkswagen said late last month that it would be able to make diesel vehicles in Europe compliant with clean air rules by reprogramming the software. For some engines, Volkswagen said it would install a simple plastic part to improve the flow of air into the engine and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides \u2014 the gases that the deceptive software was meant to reduce during testing, but would allow at much higher levels during on-the-road driving.Though Volkswagen has yet to indicate how it will fix its diesel vehicles in the United States, where emissions standards are stricter, the remedial actions announced for Europe were much simpler and cheaper than expected.\u201cIn Europe, Volkswagen has mostly gotten the risks out of the way,\u201d said Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who specializes in the auto industry and is a prominent critic of Volkswagen.But he said the company was also benefiting from light enforcement of regulations in Germany. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, the regulatory agency for motor vehicles in Germany, is deliberately starved for resources by political leaders eager to protect the country\u2019s powerful automakers, Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said Wednesday. As a result, he said, the agency does not have the capacity to challenge Volkswagen\u2019s technical findings.Under European Union rules, approval by German regulators automatically confers approval in the bloc\u2019s other countries.Volkswagen also said Wednesday that it had replaced an executive who had earlier been suspended in connection with the diesel emissions cheating. The executive, Heinz-Jakob Neusser, will give up his duties as head of development for the Volkswagen brand and be replaced by Frank Welsch, the company said.Mr. Neusser will remain with the company and \u201cis available to take on other responsibilities,\u201d Volkswagen said.There is little political will in Germany to punish Volkswagen, which is one of the country\u2019s largest employers. But Volkswagen still faces intense pressure in the United States from the Environmental Protection Agency, and there are customers and dealers who have filed hundreds of lawsuits.\u201cThere is still the United States,\u201d Mr. Dudenh\u00f6ffer said.Advertisement"}

But he said that detecting posts on applications that are not available to the public is difficult and may not be appropriate.\u201cKeep in mind it was only a couple of years ago we were having a major debate about whether government was becoming too much like Big Brother,\u201d Mr. Obama said.On his way to Hawaii Friday night, the president plans to stop in California to visit with families of those killed in the terror attacks in San Bernardino.Mr. Obama defended his administration\u2019s policies in Egypt, Libya and Syria, although he acknowledged mistakes by the international coalition that fought the Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi \u201cfor not moving swiftly enough and underestimating the need to rebuild government there quickly.\u201cAs a consequence you now have a very bad situation,\u201d he said.In Syria, Mr. Obama continued to call for the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, but he suggested that a transition away from the Assad regime could be less than immediate.\u201cIs there a way to construct a bridge\u201d to a government without Assad, Mr. Obama asked, including one that would reassure the Russian government and Alawite minority. He suggested there might be.Mr. Obama opened the news conference asserting that \u201csteady, persistent work over the years\u201d by his administration had delivered economic and foreign policy successes, making the American people more secure at home and abroad. He cited economic improvement over the past year, legislative progress in Congress, and diplomatic deals on climate, Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and Cuba.\u201cI just want to point out I said at the beginning of this year that interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd we are only halfway through.\u201dMr. Obama promised that he will not act unilaterally to close the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, before letting Congress decide whether to approve or reject a legislative plan to do so.Closing the prison for terrorists was a central promise of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, and he moved to do it in the first days of his administration. But Congress has blocked those efforts.The White House has said Mr. Obama will present a new plan to lawmakers, but they have also hinted that Mr. Obama might act on his own to shutter the prison, which has become a symbol for recruitment by terror organizations.In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Obama pledged to let Congress act first.\u201cWe will wait until Congress has definitively said \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cbefore we say anything definitive about my executive authority here.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be forward leaning on what I can do without Congress before I\u2019ve tested what I can do with Congress.\u201dMr. Obama said that the global climate deal that he helped to strike in Paris this month will survive intact no matter who follows him as president.\u201cYou now have a global marketplace for clean energy that is stable and accelerating, he said, adding: \u201cThat then creates a different dynamic that is independent of what Congress does.He said that the great environmental victories of the previous 50 years were all accompanied by warnings from business interests that the new rules would ruin the economy, including efforts to clean the air, water and eliminate acid rain.But in each case, the costs were lower and efforts easier than any of the critics predicted, he said.\u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason why the same won\u2019t happen here,\u201d he said.Beyond the climate deal, America\u2019s global leadership is often best done not through the use of bombs but the kind of diplomacy that led to the Iran nuclear deal and the trans-Pacific trade agreement.\u201cSometimes the results don\u2019t come overnight, they don\u2019t come the following day, but they come,\u201d he said of diplomatic efforts.Mr. Obama vowed to not become a lame-duck president during his last year in office, adding: \u201cI plan on doing everything I can with every minute of every day I have left as president.\u201dMr. Obama has said he intends to sign the measure, which increases spending and makes permanent business tax breaks in exchange for tax credits championed by the president that are devised to help millions of people, including children, fight their way out of poverty.He said the budget allows the government to finance its military, invest in education and the environment, and early childhood education.\u201cIt was a good win,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some things in there that I don\u2019t like, but that\u2019s the nature of legislation and compromise.\u201dMr. Obama said that the success with the budget gives him \u201csome optimism\u201d that he and the Republican Congress can make some progress in 2016 on what he called \u201ca narrow set of issues.\u201dThose include, he said, passage of the trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and legislation to overhaul the country\u2019s criminal justice system. He said the criminal justice negotiations have been sincere and serious.He praised both the previous house speaker, John A. Boehner, and the current one, Paul D. Ryan. He said Mr. Ryan had acted professionally, saying \u201che has reached out to tell me what he can do and what he cannot do. It\u2019s a good working relationship.\u201dAt the White House, the president\u2019s top advisers said the budget deal capped a productive year that defied predictions of Mr. Obama\u2019s lame-duck status and the Democratic Party\u2019s clobbering in midterm elections at the end of 2014.At home, he beat back legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act, reached agreement with Republicans on an overhaul of national education standards and helped resolve a long-simmering dispute over how to finance transportation construction.Those accomplishments have been overshadowed in recent weeks amid growing concern in the United States about the threat of terrorism. Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings have slid recently as that issue has overtaken the economy as the central concern for most Americans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Key to Success of Climate Pact Will Be Its Signals to Global Markets", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLE BOURGET, France \u2014 As diplomats here work through the final points of a sweeping new climate change accord, experts said the ultimate measure of success of the agreement will be whether it sends a clear signal to global financial investors that they should move money away from fossil fuels and toward clean-energy sources such as wind and solar power.Without that signal, there is little chance that emissions will be reduced enough to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of global warming.The appeal to investors remained a question mark early Friday morning after Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who is presiding over the United Nations conference on climate change, released a near-final draft text.It addressed many sticking points of the talks, and largely cleared the way for a final deal that accomplishes many of the goals that climate-policy advocates say are necessary to start reducing global emissions.But the draft dodges the issue of how countries would monitor, verify and report their levels of planet-warming pollution.The impact of the deal hangs on that one section, experts say, because without it, no one will be able to trust that governments are doing what they say they will do to cut emissions. Without that certainty, investors will be skittish about shifting to renewable energy.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of what kind of signal you give to investors and people who decide where the dollars go,\u201d said Nathaniel Keohane, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, and a former adviser to the Obama administration. \u201cThey decide whether to invest in one kind of electric power plant or another.\u201dHundreds of negotiators have spent nearly two weeks in this compound of tents on the outskirts of Paris hammering out countless details in the substance of a deal, which could be passed into international law as soon as Friday night.A new version was released of the international agreement that negotiators at the Paris climate conference have been haggling over for more than a week.The emerging pact would require countries to enact plans to cut their fossil fuel emissions, set up a system for rich countries to pay for poor countries to mitigate and adapt to the ravages of climate change, and establish a legally binding timetable for countries to ratchet up the strength of their emissions plans over time.Such a transition would fundamentally transform the energy system that has powered the global economy since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas, now make up about 80 percent of the world\u2019s energy mix. The combined stock value of the world\u2019s coal, oil and gas companies is about $5 trillion. By comparison, stocks related to renewable energy are valued at about $300 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm.The questions about transparency will define Friday\u2019s negotiations.At the heart of the emerging deal are pledges by 186 countries outlining ways in which they will lower their greenhouse gas emissions through 2030.When combined, those pledges would still reduce planet-warming emissions by about half as much as is necessary to stave off a temperature increase above the catastrophic limit of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 the point at which the planet will be locked in to devastating climate consequences.However, poor and vulnerable countries, including low-lying island nations that are already experiencing the effect of sea level rise, have successfully pushed for the Paris deal to include language that would set an aspirational, although not legally binding, goal of cutting emissions enough to avoid an atmospheric warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius.Reaching that goal would prevent further devastation but require far more rapid and stringent economic action than governments have pledged. The new deal would require countries to come back to the table every five years and offer up new, stronger emissions reductions plans.\u201cThe text is trending towards the better than half-full outcome of what\u2019s been on the table \u2014 which would be historic,\u201d said Andrew Deutz, director of international government relations at the Nature Conservancy.\u201cThere are still details to be worked out on transparency and reporting, on markets, and on finance,\u201d he said, as well as sorting out the different obligations of developed countries compared with developing ones. \u201cThe deal isn\u2019t done yet, but we can see a clear path to success.\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.By early Friday morning, negotiators were hammering out language that would require countries to monitor, verify and report on how well they are reducing their emissions compared with their publicly stated targets.Secretary of State John Kerry is the chief advocate at the talks for aggressive transparency measures, and has been pushing to create a regime in which all government numbers on emissions reduction are made publicly available, and subject to verification by an outside body of experts \u2014 a sort of carbon emissions auditor.He said in an interview this week that he believes the final deal will succeed in creating that all-important signal to business markets.\u201cThere will be a sea change,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see more money begin following those outcomes, flowing to wind and solar, because there\u2019s trillions of dollars in profit to be made.\u201dSeven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.While the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest carbon polluter, is pushing for strong transparency measures, China and India, the world\u2019s largest and third-largest polluters, still oppose those proposals.They demand that the Paris deal reflect a division of responsibility inscribed in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which created lighter emissions monitoring and verification requirements for developing economies.\u201cWe already have a thorough system of accounting,\u201d said Ashok Lavasa, secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Of the proposal for an outside emissions auditor, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the need for a superinspector going around and seeing what we\u2019re doing.\u201dFor now, the language in the draft climate change pact is too vague to please either side.Unless it is refined, the final deal may be too weak to influence investors to put money into solar companies rather than coal companies.\u201cIn the Paris agreement, corporations will need to see these numbers,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. \u201cThat affects what they put in their spreadsheets, their decision-making.\u201dAn article on Friday about whether the new climate agreement reached in France will send a clear signal to global financial investors that they should move money away from fossil fuels and toward clean-energy sources transposed the names of the countries that are the world\u2019s largest and third-largest carbon polluters. China is the world\u2019s largest, and India is the third largest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imagining a World Without Growth ", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneCould the world order survive without growing?As world leaders gather in Paris to hash out an agreement to hold down and ultimately stop the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that threaten to make Earth increasingly inhospitable for humanity, there is a question that is unlikely to be openly discussed at the two-week conclave convened by the United Nations. But it is nonetheless hanging in the air: Could civilization, as we know it, survive such an experience again?The answer, simply, is no.Economic growth took off consistently around the world only some 200 years ago. Two things powered it: innovation and lots and lots of carbon-based energy, most of it derived from fossil fuels like coal and petroleum. Staring at climactic upheaval approaching down the decades, environmental advocates, scientists and even some political leaders have put the proposal on the table: World consumption must stop growing.\u201cThis is a subtle and largely unacknowledged part of some folks\u2019 environmental/climate plan,\u201d said Michael Greenstone, who directs the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Sometimes it is not so subtle. The Stanford ecologist Paul Ehrlich has been arguing for decades that we must slow both population and consumption growth. When I talked to him on the phone a few months ago, he quoted the economist Kenneth Boulding: \u201cAnyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.\u201dLimiting growth to zero, he found, had a modest impact on carbon spewed into the air. Only the \u201cde-growth\u201d situation \u2014 in which Canadians\u2019 income per person shrank to its level in 1976 and the average working hours of employed Canadians declined by 75 percent \u2014 managed to slash emissions in a big way.Working for the Sustainable Development Commission, set up in 2001 to advise the Labour government in Britain, Tim Jackson of the University of Surrey produced a nifty calculation. Accept that citizens of developing nations are entitled to catch up with the living standards of Europeans by midcentury, and assume that Europe will grow, on average, by 2 percent a year between now and then.Drawing what he saw as the inevitable conclusion, Professor Jackson published a book in 2009 called \u201cProsperity Without Growth\u201d (Earthscan/Routledge).Whatever the ethical merits of the case, the proposition of no growth has absolutely no chance to succeed. For all the many hundreds of years humanity survived without growth, modern civilization could not. The trade-offs that are the daily stuff of market-based economies simply could not work in a zero-sum world.\u201cIt would be a nonstarter to have zero growth within a given country in terms of creating conflict between groups,\u201d Professor Greenstone told me. \u201cIf one were to take this further and make it international, it feels like an even bigger stretch.\u201dLet\u2019s examine what our fossil-fueled growth has provided us. It has delivered gains in living standards in even the poorest regions of the world.Zero growth gave us Genghis Khan and the Middle Ages, conquest and subjugation. It fostered an order in which the only mechanism to get ahead was to plunder one\u2019s neighbor. Economic growth opened up a much better alternative: trade.The bloody 20th century \u2014 stage for two world wars, the Holocaust and other war-based genocides \u2014 still doesn\u2019t even come close.More than how to stop growth, the main question brought out by climate change is how to fully develop and deploy sustainable energy technologies \u2014 in a nutshell, to help the world\u2019s poor, and everybody else, onto a path to progress that doesn\u2019t rely on burning buried carbon.Advertisement"}

This would allow them to heat and light their homes while generating green credits. The extra money from the energy production could be sold to the power companies, lowering the nation\u2019s carbon footprint. The money from the sale of this surplus energy could be either used to pay back the initial investment to install the green technology so the program could continue on or allow the families in these homes to have a small amount of extra pocket cash to help them with whatever they need.\u25a0\u2009Annemarie Latimer, 71, Columbia, N.J.The Salvation Army, because they give most of their contributions to the people that need it.Research for pancreatic cancer because it took my mother.Addiction research because I work with addiction clients.Any effort to get rid of Monsanto because they are destroying America.Domestic violence centers because I know and knew so many people who were affected by it.Any public health agency who is nonprofit, whose C.E.O.s don\u2019t get the most benefit.All the children in poor families, because I have seen children suffer when the parents spent their money foolishly on themselves.Dental care for the people who need it and are unable to afford it.Emotional and physical care for all rape victims, because so many people stigmatize them.All child prostitutes and adult prostitutes because no one wants to be in that position because it is abuse. This includes trafficked victims.All torture victims because they need so much counseling.Tax credits for single people because they are too heavily taxed, proportionately.Counseling for children of divorce because they are heavily impacted.Counseling for abused people, regardless of the type of abuse.All single mothers and fathers who have difficulty providing for their children.\u25a0\u2009Daniel Mokrauer-Madden, 29, Bangalore, IndiaI would invest in education in communities around the world. Philanthropy has tended toward short-term measurable impact. This is an improvement over the past, but it also means that some sectors that see change over the longer term are seriously neglected.

Oftentimes when we think of one being \u201csick\u201d we think of a common cold, stomach flu or some sort of terminal illness. Hardly ever do we recognize depression as a sickness. I would pump resources into brain research and increase the funding for mental health facilities.\u25a0\u2009Ahmed Al Bayati, 25, Miami, Fla.I would use the money to improve the education system in impoverished areas as it is my believe that doing so would solve many of the challenges our society faces. There\u2019s a lack of access to opportunity that has crippled poor communities. Good education is the ladder that people can use to climb their way out of poverty. I used it myself to escape war-torn Baghdad. Among the poor kids in the United States is the next Steve Jobs, the next Barack Obama, and the scientist who will make a breakthrough in treating cancer. But none of that is possible if we don\u2019t make it easier to join a good school than to join a gang.\u25a0\u2009Mitchell Zimmerman, 73, Palo Alto, Calif.I would give billions to (1) basic research relating to global warming and (2) perhaps even more important, a massive educational and public relations campaign designed to force Americans to confront the reality and urgency of climate change.\u25a0\u2009Maksim Surguy, 29, Federal Way, Wash.I would spend a few billion to buy patent portfolios of companies in the following industries and make them available to anyone:\u2014 Food (agriculture, water desalination, genetics)\u2014 Energy (renewables, bio, solar)\u2014 Medicine (drugs, chemical compounds, methods)Then I would invest a billion dollars into machine-learning development, specifically hardware that doesn\u2019t exist yet, and create a marketplace of smart algorithms that can learn on their own. These algorithms will be used to further improve methods and processes to grow food, produce energy and help create new medicine. The rest of the money would be used to combat climate change and to automate mining resources on other planets instead of our own.\u25a0\u2009Wulin, 40, Calgary, Alberta, CanadaI would use the money to solve the dilemma all humans have: aging and space colonization. If we can extend our human life expectancy to experience more human activities while humans live in the space. As Stephen Hawking said: \u201cThe human race shouldn\u2019t have all its eggs in one basket ...\u201d\u25a0\u2009Marti Elkins, 62, Flat Rock, N.C.I would build more subsidized housing for seniors who are still trying to pay off their adult children\u2019s student loans living on a fixed income. I would build tiny houses for the homeless. I would provide expensive medicine for veterans who can\u2019t afford it and the V.A. won\u2019t pay for. We owe them everything for our freedom. I would invest in state-of-the-art mental health facilities to treat those poor souls who are on the street and no one helps and everyone ignores unless they kill people. I would provide educational scholarships to underprivileged students. Keep your donations mostly in the United States. People tend to forget how much poverty exists here. This will eventually make our country stronger again. Make free medical and dental clinics available because in spite of Obamacare, lots of people still can\u2019t afford either and just accept the tax penalty. Give money to our National Park Service. They are one of our greatest treasures; do away with expensive entrance fees so everyone can enjoy them. They belong to all of us.\u25a0\u2009Randy Rehwoldt, 66, Grand Junction, Colo.I would use existing organizations with proven track records. I would do it this way to avoid the problem Mark had with his first experience in his giving. I think the Salvation Army is one good organization to use, for they have proven themselves.\u25a0\u2009Ron Bannon, 58, Newark, N.J.Randomly to individuals on earth. The amount would equal the average local yearly wage. No strings attached.\u25a0\u2009Angelo Paraiso-Arroyo, 17, Berkeley, Calif.If I had $45 billion, I would give it to struggling small businesses. They are middle-class Americans and are necessary in order to have a strong economy. If they flourish, we all prosper. Plus, who needs $45 billion? Who needs a million dollars? Money comes and goes but the future is forever. Forty-five billion dollars is a gift, and like all gifts, it is always the thought that counts.\u25a0\u2009Dange Cris Bejoc, 21, Cebu City, PhilippinesMainly, I will build two foundations for those who are handicapped and for the homeless abandoned children. First reason is I want to help those who are disabled to see life differently and for them to see their true value despite of being incomplete. Give them training, education to mold their skills and talents. Second reason, for the homeless abandoned children so that they will feel that they are at home, protected by those people who love and respect them.\u25a0\u2009Noah Weiss, 13, Los AngelesI would give $45 billion to Alzheimer\u2019s research, because my great-grandma suffers from it, and other organizations around the globe.\u25a0\u2009Kate Krauss, 52, PhiladelphiaI would announce a $1 billion prize for a scalable cure for AIDS \u2014 we are close, but the funding is not there. I would offer $1 billion in grants to support an eclectic group of AIDS activists, who have been very successful over the years in supporting medical research.

{"Headline": "China's Fitful Economic Reforms", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBack in 2004, when I ran the China desk at the International Monetary Fund, my team sent some written questions to Beijing ahead of our meetings with Chinese officials. China\u2019s central bank had claimed that the value of the currency, the renminbi, was determined by market forces. But to the rest of the world, it looked like the currency\u2019s value was tightly managed \u2014 so tightly that its value relative to the U.S. dollar did not change. We asked how this was possible if the exchange rate was truly market determined. After all, market exchange rates among major currencies fluctuate a lot.The response from the central bank nicely summed up the Chinese approach to market forces: \u201cThe exchange rate is fully determined by market supply and demand. The authorities endeavor to manage both supply and demand in a manner that promotes the stable formation of the exchange rate mechanism.\u201dIn other words, the central bank controlled both supply and demand to fix the \u201cmarket-determined\u201d exchange rate at a constant level.On Monday, the I.M.F. elevated the renminbi to the status of a global reserve currency \u2014 deeming it available for wide use in trade and finance and suitable for safekeeping of other countries\u2019 foreign-exchange reserves. This was a prize China had long sought, in return for financial market and currency reforms that the I.M.F. had requested. But while the elevation of the renminbi is a validation of China\u2019s recent reform efforts, the government has a long way to go on the path to a market economy.The reality is that for all of the country\u2019s economic liberalization and progress over the past decade the government has still not entirely changed its approach to the free market. China today represents a grand experiment in whether the tension between two contradictory forces \u2014 the free market and the government\u2019s proclivity to do whatever it takes to maintain \u201cstability and order\u201d \u2014 can be reconciled.This experiment has come under pressure in recent months as Chinese economic growth has slowed, and the currency and stock markets have been volatile. But for all the doomsday prophesying rampant in the media, China\u2019s growth is not about to collapse and the stock market meltdown doesn\u2019t presage a financial crisis. Much of the volatility in stock markets and in the currency\u2019s value in recent months reflects, in large part, a well-intentioned but limited and poorly executed reform program.The government is, indeed, moving ahead with financial sector reforms that are essential for China to better manage its economy and allocate its massive pool of savings to more productive investment opportunities. Interest rates on bank deposits and loans are no longer determined by the government. State-owned banks now have to compete with private and foreign banks. The government also recently freed up exchange rates, so that the value of the renminbi can be more subject to market forces.But the way such reforms are implemented suggests a deep reluctance to allow markets to have free rein. The devaluation of the renminbi by about 2 percent relative to the dollar in mid-August caught more attention than changes ostensibly allowing the currency\u2019s value to be more freely determined with less intervention by the central bank. The move helped position the renminbi for the I.M.F. benediction on Monday, but the government did not communicate its intentions well at the time, leading to the widespread view that China was simply trying to cheapen its currency to improve the competitiveness of its exports.The ensuing volatility led the central bank to go right back to intervening in the foreign-exchange market to maintain stability of the exchange rate. Such a one step forward, two steps sideways approach to market liberalization has ironically increased the inevitable risks that arise during the transition to freer markets.The renminbi\u2019s newfound status as an official reserve currency will only heighten these tensions. Foreign investors will over time increase their demand for the currency to move more freely in and out of China\u2019s financial markets. Heavy-handed and unpredictable government intervention might make these flows more volatile.Meanwhile, the government has done little to improve corporate governance of Chinese companies or their accounting and auditing standards. The result has been wild swings in stock prices, as investors have sparse information about the companies that they are investing in.Even Chinese investors seem to value the benefits of a free market, but they still count on the government to step in when things turn sour. Responding to these expectations, the government has intervened on and off to prop up stock prices, confusing investors about its true intentions and adding to volatility, which could in turn erode political support for reforms.One key to controlling the impulse to intervene is managing expectations. On a visit this summer to Shenzhen, a major port city in Guangdong Province in southern China, I met a large group of entrepreneurs to discuss the state of China\u2019s economy. I asked for a show of hands for those who thought their country would attain this year\u2019s official G.D.P. growth target of 7 percent. About half of the hands went up. I then asked if they agreed with the perception abroad that their government was not managing the economy well. Virtually every hand in the room shot up, followed by a blistering attack on policy makers in Beijing for allowing the stock market to fall sharply and letting the currency become too volatile.These reactions highlight the challenges China\u2019s leaders face: They have to get Chinese citizens used to not just the freedom and benefits but also the inherent risks of the marketplace. A tall order in the best of times and harder when economic growth is slowing.The solution is not more government control but steps to improve regulatory frameworks and getting other institutional aspects such as corporate governance and transparency right while freeing up markets.The fundamental question that China\u2019s policy makers face is whether they will back up their commitment to financial sector reforms with broader measures that will truly free up markets and support them with a strong institutional foundation. Otherwise, the inherent contradictions in trying to free up markets while maintaining state control may cause well-intentioned reform efforts to backfire. This will simply create more volatility and generate few of the intended benefits. And that would not be good for China or the world economy.Eswar Prasad is a professor in the Dyson School at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and the author of \u201cThe Dollar Trap.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Where to Invade Next,\u2019 Michael Moore\u2019s Latest Documentary", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Mr. Moore \u201cinvades\u201d one country and then the next, beginning in Italy and ending in Iceland, you begin to suspect that heaven on earth is anywhere but in America \u2014 unless, of course, you belong to the top 1 percent.The film\u2019s premise is only half serious and wildly exaggerated, but there is enough truth in it to make you squirm and consider what went wrong. Every country has problems, many of them very serious. (The film was completed before the migrant crisis in Europe.)\u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d is really a fairy tale with a moral. As Mr. Moore visits European schools, workplaces, hospitals and prisons, the movie builds into a cri de coeur about America\u2019s weakening social contract: the widening inequality gap, the disappearing middle class and a military-based economy. \u201cA land of we,\u201d one talking head remarks, has transformed into a \u201cland of me.\u201dAt the beginning of the film, Mr. Moore fantasizes being summoned for advice by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose members, he imagines, are perplexed by America\u2019s having lost so many wars since World War II. Oh, what to do? Although he doesn\u2019t try to answer that question, the movie strongly implies that funding America\u2019s military is starving the country of money that would be better devoted to humanitarian endeavors. With a camera crew in tow, he tours Europe, with a side trip to Tunisia, looking for solutions to our social ills that he can bring back home.His examples of progressive European social institutions are cherry-picked to make American audiences feel envious and guilty. In a running joke he notes that many progressive European ideas and policies originated in the United States.In Italy, Mr. Moore interviews a radiant couple; they love their work in a furniture factory, where the employees have more than 30 days of paid vacation every year. Across Italy, mothers have five months of paid maternity leave.The next stop is France, where he visits a public school that serves multicourse, high-quality lunches to its students. Shown images of the typical slop served at a public school in the United States, the students recoil. In Finland, a country whose students are among the world\u2019s best educated, he learns that little to no homework is assigned, standardized testing is a rarity and education is based on learning an array of skills with the emphasis on the growth of the whole person.At around this point, \u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d becomes more serious and its critical attitude sharpens. Mr. Moore believes that every country has its own original sin, which in the case of Germany would be the Holocaust. In atonement, along with concerted efforts at remembrance, Germans are continually reminded of the country\u2019s Nazi horrors in monuments, landmarks and public art.America\u2019s original sins, Mr. Moore says, are the genocide of its native population and slavery, tragedies with which, he says, the country is still unable to come to terms. The mass incarceration of African-Americans for petty drug crimes, he suggests, is slavery in a new guise. The movie\u2019s most unsettling images are familiar from newscasts: black people, in and out of prison, being savagely abused by white police officers.\u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d becomes almost giddily optimistic once Mr. Moore visits Norway to investigate that country\u2019s prisons; the maximum sentence is 21 years. Even convicted murderers are housed in the equivalent of small Manhattan studio apartments equipped with televisions and cookware, even sharp utensils. No one is locked in solitary confinement, prisoners have a lot of mobility and the principal punishment is separation from the rest of society.As for the future, Mr. Moore points out, enormous positive change often happens suddenly and with little warning. His best example of this is the fall of Communism and the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. Behind despair lurks hope.\u201cWhere to Invade Next\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has strong language, some violent images, drug use and nudity. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Creates a World Bank of Its Own, and the U.S. Balks", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe China Factor | Part 4BEIJING \u2014 As top leaders met at a lush Bali resort in October 2013, President Xi Jinping of China described his vision for a new multinational, multibillion-dollar bank to finance roads, rails and power grids across Asia. Under Chinese stewardship, the bank would tackle the slow development in poor countries that was holding the region back from becoming the wealth center of the world.Afterward, the United States secretary of state, John Kerry, caught up with Mr. Xi in the corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Mr. Kerry said of the bank, according to Chinese and American aides briefed on the encounter.The enthusiasm didn\u2019t last long, as the Obama administration began a rear-guard battle to minimize the bank\u2019s influence.The United States worries that China will use the bank to set the global economic agenda on its own terms, forgoing the environmental protections, human rights, anticorruption measures and other governance standards long promoted by its Western counterparts. American officials point to China\u2019s existing record of loans to unstable governments, construction deals for unnecessary infrastructure, and villagers abruptly uprooted with little compensation.Countries are finding they must increasingly operate in China\u2019s orbit. And backing the new bank would bring financial advantages, as well as curry favor with Beijing. While many countries had similar doubts as the United States, they figured they could just shape the organization from the inside.The new bank \u201cis an instrument for China to lend legitimacy to its international forays and to extend its sphere of economic and political influence even while changing the rules of the game,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at Cornell University. \u201cAnd it gives the existing institutions a kick in the pants.\u201dEither China is serious about taking a leadership role in the global economy and prioritizing projects that broadly benefit Asia, or it plans to use the bank as a conduit to further its own ambitions.So far, China appears to be navigating the two extremes. It is assuaging critics by compromising on issues like board makeup, project oversight and procurement. But China is hardly yielding control, raising concerns about where the bank will land on issues like climate change and labor rights. The bank, for example, is still weighing whether to approve coal-fired power plants.The Chinese-led bank will also focus solely on infrastructure. To China, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank failed to deliver on big projects meant to transform backward parts of Asia, resulting in an estimated $8 trillion of needed investment in rails, ports and power plants.As a complement to the new bank, China is rolling out the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d program for the construction of a network of roads, rails and pipelines along the old Silk Road route through Central Asia to Europe. A maritime equivalent calls ports from Southeast Asia to East Africa to the Mediterranean.At the signing of the agreement for the bank in June, Mr. Jin and Mr. Xi posed for a photo alongside officials from the other 56 founding member nations in the Great Hall of the People.An unexpectedly large group, it included countries as diverse as Iran and Israel, Russia and Poland, and an array of American friends. The total capital commitment, $100 billion, was double the amount originally envisioned.Having underestimated the interest, the Obama administration is now starting to soften its stance. Three months after the signing, Mr. Xi met with President Obama at the White House, in the Chinese leader\u2019s first state visit. At the summit meeting, Mr. Obama urged the existing banks to cooperate with the new institution. The United States, though, would still not join.In late 2007, an influential Chinese official visited remote villages along the Mekong River in Laos.The World Bank, I.M.F. and Asian Development Bank compared.The official, Zheng Xinli, a senior figure in the policy research office of the Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee, noticed communities pockmarked with stilted huts and fertile ground that failed to produce. Any crops were difficult to sell, since farmers were far from markets and transportation was scarce.Mr. Zheng saw an opportunity for China, which has faced similar infrastructure issues. \u201cEconomically, it was complementary to China,\u201d said Mr. Zheng, who is referred to as the bank\u2019s godfather.He initially proposed the bank plan to aides of Hu Jintao, the president then. But they were not interested and the idea languished. Mr. Zheng left the party committee for an economic think tank.During the 2008 financial crisis, China\u2019s economy had continued to perform well, serving as a stabilizing force for the world when the United States was on the verge of a collapse. Yet Congress blocked an I.M.F. proposal, backed by the Obama administration, to make China the third-most-powerful country at the fund after the United States and Japan.\u201cThe U.S. Congress was delaying its approval of the I.M.F. reform, and we had a different view,\u201d said Xu Hongcai, head of the economic studies department at the China center. \u201cThe U.S. agreed to the conditions when the economy was in the downturn, but it backed down on its words when things got better.\u201dTo corral vastly disparate countries, China knew it needed to look beyond its usual slate of Communist officials, an often-insular group.Courting China\u2019s Asian friends was easy, with smaller countries like Singapore readily signing up. The major developed countries were a little more reluctant.In May 2014, the grandees of British and European capitalism gathered in London, where Mr. Jin spoke to representatives of several hundred wealth funds. \u201cWe all thought it was pie in the sky,\u201d said David Marsh, managing director of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, an advocacy group for public-private finance.Mr. Jin also tried to woo the Japanese, calculating that the Europeans would be impressed if the country, a Group of 7 member, joined. But the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had his own plans to promote development.Undeterred, Mr. Jin decided to tackle Washington instead.By the time Mr. Jin arrived in Washington in September 2014, the administration was already wary of the bank.The deputy national security adviser for international economics, Caroline Atkinson, who headed a series of high-level meetings on the bank, was known as a strong defender of the existing system. A graduate of Oxford and a former journalist, Ms. Atkinson had worked at the I.M.F., the Bank of England and the United States Treasury.China\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.Although Washington recognized the bank would go ahead, Ms. Atkinson and others wanted to influence the membership, according to a participant in the meetings. Important allies \u2014 Australia and South Korea, in particular \u2014 were discouraged from signing up, and G-7 countries were advised that the United States wanted a united front.Ms. Atkinson declined to be interviewed. A press representative for the National Security Council referred to earlier comments by President Obama about the need for more infrastructure in Asia, albeit with high standards.Behind the public argument lay deep suspicions about China\u2019s real goal. China\u2019s economic clout in Asia was strengthening yearly, and there were fears that Beijing would use the bank as another tool to project its influence.The China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China already financed big-ticket projects in Asia and Africa. By Chinese estimates, their combined overseas assets stood at $500 billion, more than the combined capital of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.Also, the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, the figure who would normally drive this agenda, knew little about the country. Mr. Lew had not visited China until he became secretary in 2013. His predecessors Timothy F. Geithner and Henry M. Paulson Jr. were steeped in China before joining the Treasury Department.Mr. Lew was not really involved in the administration\u2019s deliberations about the bank. In a sign the bank was not a priority for him, a cabinet meeting was never called on whether the United States should consider joining, said officials with knowledge of the discussions.During his visit to Washington, Mr. Jin tried to soften the Americans\u2019 objections. He suggested that the administration wait to see how the bank defined its standards before passing judgment.\u201cHe was encouraging us to be more positive,\u201d the official involved in the administration\u2019s deliberations said. \u201cHe was saying, \u2018You can be an ombudsman on transparency,\u2019\u201d meaning that the United States could measure the bank on its standards and make its findings public.But the National Security Council hung tough. \u201cI am not going to buy the cake you have cooked,\u201d Evan S. Medeiros, the council\u2019s senior adviser on China, said, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation.To which Mr. Jin replied: \u201cYou are always welcome into the kitchen to help with the baking.\u201dWith a March 31 deadline for membership fast approaching, Mr. Jin started courting other G-7 countries in earnest. He concentrated on Britain, a country he knew and liked, and where his daughter was an assistant professor of economics at the London School of Economics.His timing was serendipitous.China had put Britain in a diplomatic deep freeze after Prime Minister David Cameron met with the Dalai Lama in 2012. By early 2015, Britain was trying to claw its way out of the doghouse by adopting a mercantilist approach to China.As a practical matter, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, wanted London to be a prime center for trading in the renminbi. He also thought that Chinese investment was paramount for the nation\u2019s health.\u201cThere are some in the West who see China growing and they are nervous,\u201d Mr. Osborne said in a speech at Peking University in 2013. \u201cI totally and utterly reject that pessimistic view.\u201dThe British government kept the negotiations quiet. After deciding to join the bank in early March, the British gave Washington 24 hours\u2019 notice, a senior administration official said.To Washington, it was a major affront. The British were supposed to be America\u2019s most steadfast ally, but now they had chosen to side with China. Days later, other European allies rushed in. Australia and South Korea eventually followed.For China, British membership in the bank was a defining moment. Back in Beijing, Mr. Jin reached for his copy of Shakespeare\u2019s drama \u201cCymbeline.\u201dThe play takes place in Roman-occupied Britain and part of the action revolves around the British refusal to pay tribute. Mr. Jin read two lines by the character Cloten, who tells the Roman ambassador: \u201cBritain\u2019s a world by itself. We will nothing pay for wearing our own noses.\u201dMr. Jin realized that just as ancient Britain had refused to pay Rome in an earlier age, contemporary Britain had defied the United States and joined the Chinese bank.When Mr. Jin sat down with the Japanese head of the Asian Development Bank in May, he had some criticism.The bank\u2019s board, 12 officials from member countries who all live and work in Manila, was intended to provide direct supervision over loan disbursements, and is actively involved in the bank\u2019s management. But Mr. Jin considered it expensive patronage that justified its existence by demanding extra work on overanalyzed projects.At their meeting, the head of the Asian Development Bank, Takehiko Nakao, noted that the Chinese-led institution would not have a similar board. Mr. Jin responded: \u201cYour board is a disaster,\u201d according to a participant in the meeting.Mr. Jin now faces a balancing act between China\u2019s vision and critics\u2019 concerns.To speed up project approval, China had originally suggested that a technical panel would make final decisions, rather than a board of senior officials from member countries. But the setup, the British complained, was not transparent enough.By the time of a two-day workshop in Beijing attended by several hundred people, there was a compromise. The Chinese agreed to establish a 12-member board. Unlike the Asian Development Bank\u2019s board, however, members will not be involved in day-to-day management and will not live and work in Beijing.The bank adopted an Australian idea that procurement should not be limited to member countries, a pledge that would distinguish the bank from the existing institutions. That means companies in the United States and Japan can compete for contracts.Staff members could also be hired from nonparticipant countries. Two American veterans of the World Bank are working with the new bank: Stephen F. Lintner, a former senior adviser on quality assurance, and Natalie Lichtenstein, who recently retired as assistant general counsel.As the host of the workshop, Mr. Jin said he wanted the bank to be part of an orchestra working with other development banks, not a solo player. To allay fears that China would dominate, he sat at the end of the head table, letting delegates from other countries take the limelight. United States Treasury officials attended as observers.At the outset, China will have slightly more than 26 percent of the total votes, far short of the 50 percent the Americans understood to be in the proposal. China will not exercise veto power on day-to-day operations. But Beijing retains enough votes to block decisions on the matters it really cares about, like membership and the president.Mr. Jin promised a bank that would be lean, green and clean. There will be zero tolerance on corruption, he says.Still, concerns remain. The new bank, for example, is deciding whether it will give the go-ahead for highly polluting coal-fired power plants, which the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have effectively stopped financing.Mr. Jin suggested that the bank might make exceptions for poor places where people have no access to power. \u201cDo you leave these people in the dark? It\u2019s a human rights issue,\u201d he said.When Mr. Xi met President Obama in September, the administration\u2019s icy resolve over the bank had thawed, at least publicly.Washington has started encouraging the Bretton Woods banks to finance jointly with the Chinese institution. The Chinese, in turn, have pledged to increase their contributions to the World Bank, a sign they will continue to support the existing system.The Asian Development Bank has already agreed to finance a project or two with the Chinese-led organization. On an October visit to Washington, Mr. Jin was finishing a similar deal with the World Bank.He is not giving up on the United States, even if the chances are remote.\u201cWe have a standing invitation\u201d for the United States to join the bank, Mr. Jin said, during an appearance at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAnytime you think you are ready, pick up the phone, give me a ring.\u201dUPDATE: After this article was published, Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior adviser on China for the National Security Council, disputed the account of his conversation with Jin Liqun of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Mr. Medeiros, who originally declined to be interviewed for the article, said the exchange involving the analogy of buying a cake did not take place. The original source who described the conversation stood by the account.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Might Not Have the Luxury of Slow and Steady Rate Increases", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameAfter seven years of keeping United States interest rates at rock bottom, the Federal Reserve has signaled that Dec. 16 could be D-Day for a long-awaited increase. That was the message Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, conveyed in two public presentations last week.With a 0.25 percent rise in the Fed\u2019s main tool for influencing interest rates a near certainty, investors are already beginning to focus on rate increases that may lie ahead. Will they be gradual, as Ms. Yellen has suggested? Or will economic developments push the Fed to be more aggressive?Answering these questions requires a crystal ball, which no one has. But they are worth exploring, given the market dislocations that can occur when policy moves take investors by surprise.A slow and gradual approach to rate increases is what the Fed has telegraphed and is very much what investors expect and desire. But this may not be what they get.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.The first mistake investors are making relates to their excessive fears about the slowdown in domestic manufacturing and the oil industry. While these downturns are genuine and painful \u2014 and the spending drop in these arenas have been huge \u2014 their negative impact over all is limited, Mr. Shepherdson said.The entire manufacturing sector generates 12 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, but the oil sector and related manufacturing accounts for less than 5 percent.Moreover, the beneficiaries of this collapse far outnumber its victims. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened over the last 13 months is a giant transfer of resources from oil producers to consumers,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cConsumers are much more important to the U.S. economy, and the very things that have hurt manufacturing and oil have given consumers a great boost.\u201dThe second assumption that investors may be wrong about involves inflation and their belief that a stronger dollar will keep it in check in the United States. Such a situation would help put a lid on rate increases.A rising dollar certainly makes imported goods less expensive for American buyers. But only 15 percent of the core Consumer Price Index is dollar-sensitive, Mr. Shepherdson said.Rents make up 41 percent of the index, for example, while 34 percent consists of services, including medical costs, leisure and education. Expenditures on some of these items \u2014 especially rents and health care \u2014 are rising faster than other prices.Wage increases pose another wild card on inflation, Mr. Shepherdson said. Labor compensation has grown only modestly in recent years, Ms. Yellen pointed out in her speech, at annual rates of 2 to 2.5 percent. Now that may be changing.\u201cWe have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business sector,\u201d she said.If inflation heats up, it will represent a big shift. Core inflation is running at 1.25 percent for the 12 months that ended in October, the Fed said, well below its 2 percent inflation objective.Friday\u2019s healthy jobs report \u2014 211,000 workers hired in November, more than forecast \u2014 showed only a modest increase in compensation last month, but it suggested that rising wages may become even more of a factor as the job market continues to tighten. \u201cIf nominal wages accelerate, then the Fed\u2019s fervently held belief in gradual rate increases will come under pressure,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said.Finally, investors seem convinced that retail sales, a major economic bellwether, are in trouble. This may not be the case.It\u2019s true that growth in nominal retail sales, those measured in current dollars, is declining. But, Mr. Shepherdson said, if you look at retail sales in real terms, which are not adjusted for price changes, the growth is impressive. In the latter part of 2014, such sales were registering a 4 percent gain. Today, it\u2019s trending at about 5.5 percent, suggesting that the American consumer is better off than many investors think.If Mr. Shepherdson is right, that means that tens of millions of Americans will be seeing substantial improvement in their own financial well-being. That\u2019s worth celebrating, but it may unnerve many on Wall Street.Each economic data release has the potential to roil the market if it appears to counter the prevailing view of a more modest recovery. Investors who play down healthy trends in the economy are likely to be caught offsides if the Fed becomes more proactive.Right now, the market is forecasting only a 50-50 chance of a second rate increase by April. Mr. Shepherdson is predicting such a move in March, as unemployment continues to fall and wage gains pick up further.By raising rates, the Fed clearly signals its belief that the economy has recovered from the devastation of 2008. That, too, is great news. But the policy shift will also require investors to make a fairly significant attitude adjustment, so don\u2019t be surprised if the ride gets bumpy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denmark, a Green Energy Leader, Slows Pace of Its Spending", "Date": "2015-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen, in June, a center-left government was replaced by a right-wing, minority coalition determined to tighten spending and balance the budget in a program to improvethe economy.The budget cuts include a key fund that was used to seed green technology projects \u2014 a government subsidy that environmental advocates said had paid itself off many times over.\u201cThis funding has proven instrumental for Danish advances in clean tech for many years, and it is incomprehensible why it is being cut now,\u201d said Soren Houmoller, whose 1st Mile consulting company helps businesses apply for public funds in Denmark.Mette Abildgaard, a spokeswoman for green energy affairs for the opposition Danish Conservative People\u2019s Party, said the timing of the cuts was disappointing.\u201cI believe this is a very bad signal to be sending the world, for Denmark to be taking a step backwards just before the Paris climate summit,\u201d she said last month.Should the negotiators be able to put aside their conflicting agendas, and sign an accord when the talks end this week, they will then face another challenge: meeting their national goals.One lesson they may learn from Denmark is how it is possible to substantially replace fossil fuels with clean and renewable energy. But even when progress is made in reducing environmentally harmful carbon emissions, countries may have difficulty sustaining the gains because of politics, economic concerns and, in places like the United States, ideological disputes.The new government in Denmark argues that spending on alternative energy and innovation is still high, but that the budget must be reeled in as the country faces a predicted deficit of 3.3 percent in 2015. Shortly after taking over in June, the new government was forced to cut its forecast for economic growth to 1.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2016, citing a slow recovery in domestic demand.\u201cI think the criticism is over the top,\u201d Lars Christian Lilleholt, Denmark\u2019s energy minister, told the Politiken newspaper last month. He said the country still planned to invest 800 million krone, or $114 million, in green energy research in the coming year. \u201cThere is less money, but it is still a lot. And I sit in a government that must find a way for the Danish economy to make ends meet.\u201dBut people who have relied on government funds and other incentives to help finance their energy projects said the cuts were a mistake.One of them is Jens Dall Bentzen, who eight years ago began thinking about how to burn wood chips, grass clippings and other organic matter more efficiently to generate heat. He had an inkling he could contribute to Denmark\u2019s efforts to wean off fossil fuels by 2050, but he worried about quitting his job as a researcher to pursue his idea.With the help of a grant of 2.5 million Danish krone, or $356,000, he developed a prototype of the low-emissions furnace he had imagined. He started his own company, Dall Energy, and was able to sell the furnace to Warwick Mills, a manufacturer in New Ipswich, N.H. Since then, he has built two other furnaces for Danish municipalities, and attracted interest from elsewhere in Europe and the United States.He said the grant from the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program made it possible.\u201cI found it more tempting to leave my job and start a company,\u201d he said in an interview inside the heating plant in this Danish coastal town, where his furnace was turning the damp chill into cozy warmth. \u201cI started realizing it could be achievable.\u201dThe new governing party, Venstre, or Liberal, reached an agreement on its 2016 financial plan last month. The budget cut spending for research into green energy sources to 127 million krone, or $18 million, from 385 million krone, or $55 million.Around 20 percent of its annual budget of about $100,000 comes from the government. Mr. Hermansen said that with the cuts, he would have to reduce his small staff and shelve a biofuel project to convert methane waste from local farms to liquid natural gas to power the ferry to the island.\u201cThis is hurting everybody,\u201d Mr. Hermansen said. \u201cHow can you take that away?\u201dThe fund that helped Mr. Dall Bentzen develop his biomass furnace will be among the most deeply cut. Over the past eight years, the fund has paid out about three billion krone, said Aksel Laurids Beck, a special adviser to the fund. Starting next year, it will be cut to about 40 percent of its 2015 budget.Unlike conventional furnaces that burn only one organic fuel, usually dried wood chips or straw, Mr. Dall Bentzen\u2019s system can use a variety of materials. It converts them to gas, which is then burned. That results in dust emissions that are 95 percent lower than those produced by conventional biomass burners, and significantly lower carbon and nitrogen oxide emissions.\u201cWe want to provide heat as cheaply as possible, and if we can use garden and other waste as fuel, that will bring down the prices for us, for our customers,\u201d said Erik Wolff, who runs Sonderborg District Heating, which bought the furnace from Mr. Dall Bentzen\u2019s company with similar government support.This year, the Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program, which was started in 2007, distributed 380 million krone, or $54 million, to some 88 solar, wind and geothermal energy projects, as well as to systems to better integrate and use them.In the best scenario under the new budget, the government next year will provide support for one in every eight project applicants, instead of the current rate of one in every four.Besides setting a poor example for the climate summit meeting, critics said, the cuts are ill-timed. With the green technology sector taking off, and many people looking to Denmark for examples of successes, jobs and new businesses may be in jeopardy, critics said.Projects seeded by the fund have had a success rate of 84 percent, a quarter of which led to exports. Overall exports of green and clean technology grew 15.4 percent last year to 43.6 billion krone, or $6.2 billion, according to the country\u2019s energy ministry.\u201cThe government is saying that we have always been one step ahead in the green technology, so we have room to maneuver,\u201d Ms. Abildgaard said. \u201cBut being one step ahead is what gives us many jobs in this area. It is very important that we keep them.\u201dMr. Wolff said the furnace his company bought from Mr. Dall Bentzen was more expensive than conventional models and had not yet been tried on a large scale. But the grant he received made it possible for him to take the risk associated with investing in a new technology.\u201cWhen we bought the plant, we knew we would not have any guarantees, that we would not hit the bull\u2019s eye every time with every decision we make,\u201d Mr. Wolff said.The cuts will not hurt Mr. Dall Bentzen.

Senior Republicans in Congress are already preparing for a fight, they say on behalf of the American taxpayer.\u201cOur constituents are worried that the pledges you are committing the United States to will strengthen foreign economies at the expense of American workers,\u201d 37 Republican senators wrote last month. \u201cThey are also skeptical about sending billions of their hard-earned dollars to government officials from developing nations.\u201dMr. deBrum is undeterred.\u201cIt does not make sense for us to go to Paris and come back with something that says, \u2018In a few years\u2019 time, your country is going to be underwater,\u2019\u201d Mr. deBrum said in an interview at his seaside home in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. \u201cWe see the damage occurring now. We\u2019re trying to beat back the sea.\u201dSea walls on the eastern side of Majuro Island in Majuro Atoll.In the global fight over climate change, leaders of vulnerable low-lying island nations have long sought to draw attention to their plight. They have staged symbolic events like an underwater cabinet meeting, gone on hunger strikes and delivered anguished speeches to the United Nations. Those efforts have had little impact on the substance of the energy and economic policies that dictate governmental response to climate change.In the meantime, Mr. Anej and millions like him cope with the fallout while stranded on disappearing shores.\u201cI\u2019m the oldest \u2014 I can\u2019t leave my parents,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want my kids to drown here.\u201dWithin the world of high-level climate negotiators, however, Mr. deBrum has made inroads. He manages to get into meetings of the Major Economies Forum, a group of 17 world powers convened by Secretary of State John Kerry to talk energy policy ahead of the Paris meeting. He is widely credited with either introducing or significantly strengthening crucial points in the draft accord set to emerge from Paris \u2014 in particular, putting a price on the destruction caused by climate change.He has pressed to require meetings every five years after the Paris summit meeting to ratchet up the stringency of international carbon-cutting policies. Mr. deBrum notes that the environment minister of Brazil, one of the world\u2019s largest carbon polluters, has cited the tiny Marshall Islands\u2019 plan to reduce its carbon footprint as an influence on Brazil\u2019s ambitious plan to do the same.Most of the 1,000 or so Marshall Islands, spread out over 29 narrow coral atolls in the South Pacific, are less than six feet above sea level \u2014 and few are more than a mile wide. For the Marshallese, the destructive power of the rising seas is already an inescapable part of daily life. Changing global trade winds have raised sea levels in the South Pacific about a foot over the past 30 years, faster than elsewhere. Scientists are studying whether those changing trade winds have anything to do with climate change.But add to this problem a future sea-level rise wrought by climate change, and islanders who today experience deluges of tidal flooding once every month or two could see their homes unfit for human habitation within the coming decades.In neighborhoods like Mr. Anej\u2019s, after the sewage-filled tides wash into homes, fever and dysentery soon follow. On other islands, the wash of saltwater has penetrated and salinated underground freshwater supply. On Majuro, flooding tides damaged hundreds of homes in 2013. The elementary school closed for nearly two weeks to shelter families. That same year, the airport temporarily closed after tides flooded the runway.NorthPacific OceanLauraEjitMajuroAtollMajuroAmata KabuaInternational Airport1 milePacific OceanMajuroAtollEjitMajuro4 mileSSuch travails, voiced by Mr. deBrum, have meaning in Washington because what happens on the Marshall Islands affects the United States \u2014 on immigration policy, national security and taxpayer dollars. The two countries have a complicated history. During the Cold War, the United States military detonated 67 nuclear bombs on or close to the nearby Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll \u2014 after first relocating the Bikini Islanders to different locations around the Marshalls.At age 9, Mr. deBrum was fishing with his grandfather when he saw the flash of one of the tests on the horizon. \u201cWithin seconds, the entire sky had turned red, like a fishbowl had been put over my head, and blood poured over it,\u201d he recalled.The deal offered: an open door to the Marshallese and Bikini Islanders. That bargain has already fostered communities of thousands of Marshall Islanders in Springdale, Ark., and Salem, Ore., fleeing a deluged future. That 1986 compact also established a United States government fund to support Bikini Islanders \u2014 as long as they continued to live in the Marshall Islands. Now the Bikini Islanders want to use that fund to move to the United States.In the first decades of his career as a public official, Mr. deBrum, 70, worked as a diplomatic envoy to help his country recover from the impact of the nuclear testing. Now his focus has shifted to recouping the costs of climate change.\u201cTony\u2019s clearly been a very big player on the issue of loss and damage,\u201d said Todd Stern, the United States\u2019 top climate change negotiator. \u201cHe has a lot of credibility in these negotiations.\u201dAs Mr. Obama seeks a legacy on climate policy, officials in his administration have quietly encouraged Mr. deBrum to put the Marshall Islands forward as a symbol of the perils of climate change. The Obama administration may have boosted some of Mr. deBrum\u2019s efforts, but it has stopped short of backing language that would hold rich countries legally liable for loss and damage.In March, Mr. deBrum hosted Esther Kia\u2019aina, the Obama administration official who oversees the government\u2019s relationship with the islanders, showing her the impact of sea-level rise on his home country. And last month in Washington, he met with members of Congress, urging them to support the Bikini Islanders\u2019 request.The efforts are showing some results. On Oct. 20, Ms. Kia\u2019aina sent a letter to Congress, asking lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow the Bikini Islanders to restructure the terms of their fund to move to the United States.On defense matters, the Marshall Islands\u2019 strategic value to the United States no longer rests on the Pacific nuclear testing grounds but on Kwajalein, the largest of the Marshall atolls, which is home to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site. The 1,200 Americans who live on the base launch missiles, operate space weapons programs and track NASA research, supported by an annual budget of $182 million. About 900 Marshallese workers take a ferry to the base every day to support them.That is the kind of adaptation Mr. deBrum wants to see on the islands where his people live, and it would not be cheap. Among the most contentious terms to be negotiated in Paris will be a pledge, put forth during the 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen by Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state at the time, that rich countries would mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries control their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the punishing impacts of climate change. Countries have already established a \u201cGreen Climate Fund\u201d to receive contributions. Mr. Obama has pledged an initial United States donation of $3 billion.\u201cWe\u2019ll be among the first 15 countries in line,\u201d Mr. deBrum said.He envisions elevating Marshallese cities as much as six feet and building resilient new drainage systems. \u201cThat could buy us at least 20 years,\u201d he said.For now, on Majuro, the Marshall Islands\u2019 capital, the adaptation to sea-level rise is lower tech. In the neighborhood of Jenrok, a seaside cemetery has been eroded by the rising waves \u2014 about 10 rows of coffins and headstones have washed out to sea. To adapt, the Marshallese encase their dead in aboveground concrete tombs, but the rising waves have started to lap at those, too.At the western tip of Majuro, in the lush, verdant community of Laura, farmers like Kakiana Ebot grow breadfruit to sell in the island\u2019s central market. But Ms. Ebot\u2019s breadfruit tree recently rotted away and died, she said, the victim of saltwater soaking into the soil and seawater spray on the leaves, she believes. With the loss of the tree, she said, comes the loss of about $30 a day from selling its fruit.At a government-run farm, Steve Lipton, a crop production official for the Marshall Islands\u2019 Ministry of Agriculture, is experimenting with salt-resistant hybrids of crops such as taro and cassava. \u201cWe make the soil saltier and see what will survive, since we know it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d he said.At international gatherings, from the Major Economies Forum to the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. deBrum frequently speaks of his island\u2019s dying breadfruit crop, to convey the surprising but concrete ways that rising sea levels are affecting lives and economic growth.But for all his diplomatic acumen, Mr. deBrum\u2019s advocacy for a small island nation being swallowed by a vast ocean does not always rise above the roar of the surf. At a recent conference convened to draft the Paris accord, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar of India listened to his pleas, then responded brusquely, \u201cSo what?\u201dMajuro Island in Majuro Atoll.More on climate changeProduced by Craig Allen, Larry Buchanan, David Furst and Derek Watkins.Advertisement"}

Mr. Etlin is the longtime chief executive of Ita\u00fa BBA Investment Bank, part of Banco Ita\u00fa, which he joined in 2005.In the decade that followed, he played a key role in its rise, both when Brazil\u2019s economy boomed and experienced a record number of initial public offerings but also in recent years, when mergers and acquisitions have become the only viable exits for companies here and when private equity\u2019s role in those deals grew.CVC, based in Luxembourg, said it expected to look for opportunities throughout Latin America from its S\u00e3o Paulo office and make investments from the CVC Capital Partners VI fund. The fund was raised in 2013, pulling in about 10.9 billion euros, or $15 billion based on exchange rates at the time, according to the firm.Brazil is mired in recession, with the economy contracting for three consecutive quarters, and Goldman Sachs recently warned of a possible depression. Nevertheless, Bertrand Meunier, a managing partner at CVC, said in the statement that \u201cwe believe now is the right time to build a strong, local and experienced team\u201d in Brazil and Latin America.CVC, which has 23 other offices worldwide, has yet to make an investment in Brazil, a person close to the firm said. Its website names more than 250 companies that make up its historical portfolio, but not one is from Latin America.Compared with other international private equity firms, CVC appears to be making a late entry into Latin America. Advent International, where Mr. Etlin\u2019s brother Patrice Etlin is a managing director, has been making investments here since the late 1990s. The Carlyle Group formed a South America team in 2008.Still, there remains space for private equity here, especially as capital and financing become more and more scarce amid few signs of improvement in the economy.Deals continue to take place even if the dollar volume is down. According to Dealogic, the number of deals in Brazil so far this year is 643, only one less than the 644 made during the same period last year.Mr. Etlin, a former rugby player and advisory board member at Sotheby\u2019s, has been an adviser on numerous deals for Ita\u00fa BBA that involved private equity firms.\u201cJean-Marc\u2019s reputation and experience will be of great value to CVC Capital Partners and allow us to build out our presence in this exciting market,\u201d Mr. Meunier said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma Appoints Third Finance Minister of South Africa in a Week", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a written announcement Sunday night, Mr. Zuma, who hours earlier had defiantly dismissed his critics before crowds of supporters, also reappointed as finance minister Pravin Gordhan, whose tenure in that position from 2009 to 2014 has been widely praised.The selection of Mr. van Rooyen, an A.N.C. lawmaker who has no experience in finance and was an unknown political figure nationally, led to a sudden drop in the rand, South Africa\u2019s currency, and added to doubts among investors and credit rating agencies about the soundness of South Africa\u2019s financial management.The decision to replace Nhlanhla Nene with Mr. van Rooyen set off an avalanche of criticism that appeared to take Mr. Zuma by surprise.Over the weekend, amid individual calls that Mr. Zuma resign, groups of leading academics, church leaders, politicians and labor leaders sent open letters to the president questioning his judgment and his stewardship over the economy.The appointment of Mr. van Rooyen was particularly reckless, they said, because South Africa was already reeling from the worldwide drop in the price of commodities and nearly slipped into a recession recently.The South African Council of Churches called last week\u2019s appointment \u201cbordering on financially irresponsible,\u201d and it said the move would \u201cundoubtedly affect all South Africans \u2014 but the poor are likely to be hit hardest.\u201dOn Sunday, speaking to crowds of A.N.C. supporters, Mr. Zuma dismissed the criticism as coming from \u201cpeople who talk a lot on TV,\u201d according to the local news media.The reappointment of Mr. Gordhan, who Mr. Zuma said would promote \u201cfiscal discipline and prudence,\u201d calmed investors on Monday morning and led to a partial recovery of the rand. But critics said the damage to South Africa\u2019s reputation, and to Mr. Zuma, would be lasting.The second-biggest opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, said: \u201cThe country has had three finance ministers in one week. If anyone still does not think we are in a banana republic, they cannot be helped.\u201dMr. Zuma, who is serving his second and last term in office, has overseen a government that has grown increasingly corrupt.Accused by critics of cronyism, Mr. Zuma has appointed allies with little experience to important positions in government and at state enterprises.The recent reshuffling of finance ministers is believed to be related to a clash with the powerful chairwoman of South African Airways, the troubled national carrier. The airline\u2019s chairwoman, Dudu Myeni, has been pushing for the purchase of 10 aircraft, a move that was opposed by Mr. Nene, who served as finance minister until last week.Critics accused Mr. Zuma of abruptly removing Mr. Nene, who earned high praise during his year and a half as finance minister, and trying to replace him with the unknown Mr. van Rooyen as a way to facilitate the purchase of the aircraft.At a news conference Monday afternoon, Mr. Gordhan hinted strongly that he would not budge from his predecessor\u2019s opposition to the aircraft purchase.Without naming any individual, he said some officials treated state enterprises \u201cas if it\u2019s a personal toy from which you can extract money when you feel like it,\u201d and he called for \u201ca bit of national reflection\u201d about the management of national resources.Ms. Myeni was appointed to the board of South Africa Airways in 2009, and she later became chairwoman, even though she had no experience in the airline industry. Ms. Myeni, who is also the chairwoman of the Jacob G. Zuma Foundation, is regarded as very close to Mr. Zuma.Over the weekend, as Mr. Zuma defended his initial appointment as finance minister and denied that it was linked to the airline\u2019s management, he also directly addressed longstanding accusations that he had named Ms. Myeni to oversee the airline because they have been romantically involved.\u201cHer relationship with the president is purely professional, and is based on the running of the foundation,\u201d Mr. Zuma\u2019s office said.

{"Headline": "Lessons in Luxury", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of StyleWhen is luxury no longer luxury?Everyone knows that the fundamental definition of luxury has been changing. The concepts of exclusivity and rarity are blurring as a result of global expansion, the demands of adapting to an online marketplace and the continual, relentless, grinding search for growth.Three new books offer perspectives on this changing landscape, focusing on different strategies to help luxury companies of all sizes solidify their brands \u2014 and capture the imagination, and spending power, of the luxury consumer.Luxury companies are not only fighting for survival, they are facing an opportunity for eternal greatness, according to the authors of \u201cRocket: Eight Lessons to Secure Infinite Growth\u201d (McGraw Hill Education, $16.50), who dedicated the book to \u201cthe proposition that mere mortals can create immortality.\u201dMore down-to-earth concepts are explored in \u201cKapferer on Luxury: How Luxury Brands Can Grow Yet Remain Rare\u201d (Kogan Page, \u00a329.99), from the well-known brand expert Jean-No\u00ebl Kapferer, who contends that luxury is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success. The more luxury companies capture mass-market consumers, the more product they have to create. \u201cPut simply, the luxury market was not prepared to meet this kind of demand,\u201d writes Dr. Kapferer, a professor at the business school HEC Paris who has written widely on aspects of luxury and is co-author of the reference book \u201cThe Luxury Strategy.\u201dWith an academic\u2019s approach, he lays out the pitfalls of the mass market for an industry based on selling dreams. The modern industry must find a formula to grow, while still remaining exclusive, a situation he labels \u201cabundant rarity.\u201d\u201cHow can a company build a dream and abandon rarity?\u201d the professor asks. \u201cIn a sense, luxury is the art of absence.\u201dHe has brought together a wide array of research to show the different factors buffeting the industry, like lower pricing and the role of the Internet. And the future will not be simple for many industry players, he concludes \u2014 noting that family-owned luxury companies, including the ones behind many of Italy\u2019s most famous brands, will have to \u201ctransform themselves from manufacturers of rare products into creators of exceptional branded retail experiences.\u201dIn \u201cIndependent Luxury: The Four Innovation Strategies to Endure in the Consolidation Jungle\u201d (Palgrave Macmillan, \u00a331.99), the authors Jonas Hoffmann and Laurent Lecamp focus on the industry\u2019s smaller players, the ones being gobbled up by big companies or going out of business. Their thesis is simple: Independent luxury companies are becoming an endangered species (hence the book\u2019s somewhat \u201cJurassic Park\u201d illustration cover). To survive, they must innovate.Dr. Hoffmann, a professor of luxury strategy at the SKEMA Business School in France, and Mr. Lecamp, executive vice president sales for the Swiss watchmaker Carl F. Bucherer, offer four innovation strategies, with the catchy names of Eagle in the Aquarium, Game Changers, Code Breakers and Back to the Roots.(Eagle in the Aquarium refers to what they describe as \u201cinvaders\u201d in the luxury ecosystem, while Code Breakers are \u201cplaying with product and societal codes to culturally innovate and build the icons of today and tomorrow.\u201d)The four are layered through the authors\u2019 overall \u201cBA2RE luxury strategy\u201d for success. The acronym for believing, anticipating, acting \u2014 so in the book\u2019s typography the 2 is actually the squared symbol \u2014 reaching and enduring. Dozens of lengthy case studies are included, spotlighting large companies such as the watch giant Swatch Group and small brands including Thomas Mercer, which makes high-end chronometers, and the Chinese shoemaker Sheme.Many of their most vivid examples are from the watch industry, where they say the largest companies have been blocking development of smaller ones. Survivors are finding new ways to compete \u2014 like the Swiss watch independent HYT, which is using collaborations with other watchmakers to push boundaries with fluid-based mechanisms.In many ways, the book feels timely, with its emphasis on the need for design and engineering advances, as well as sections devoted to crowdfunding, 3-D printing, online retailing and the sharing economy \u2014 elements still just making themselves felt in luxury.The four \u201cRocket\u201d authors, all senior executives at Boston Consulting Group, take a more holistic approach to brand issues. The book is not focused on luxury, but its lessons will ring true for the industry. To build a great brand, companies must be slavishly devoted to pleasing \u201capostles,\u201d the company\u2019s best customers, according to the authors, Michael J. Silverstein, Dylan Bolden, Rune Jacobsen and Rohan Sajdeh.The top 2 percent of customers will directly generate 20 percent of sales and account for 80 percent of total business by recommendations and word of mouth, they theorize. Turning that elite group into apostles for the brand requires an understanding of the moments when consumers make buying decisions and, the authors say, \u201cMost companies don\u2019t get it.\u201d Instead, they just continue to research the mass audience and generate similar products.The book\u2019s 16 case studies focus on business leaders who do \u201cget it,\u201d in the authors\u2019 estimation \u2014 including Apple and Victoria\u2019s Secret. All the featured companies, including the Italian luxury brand Brunello Cucinelli, demonstrate inspiration, empathy for customers and a desire to \u201cdazzle through design.\u201dThe authors invoke the \u201cphysics of growth\u201d in their analysis, while still making it clear that smart marketing is not always rocket science.Advertisement"}

This is self-serving, he says, and only increases the gap between the rich and the poor. In his opinion, governments should find the means to invest more in social welfare, like primary education and health care.Before the world wars, he said, \u201cthe French elite used to say the same things that the Indian elite now say, that inequality would be reduced with rising development.\u201d But after the wars, he said, the French began to see that direct investment in welfare was the way forward.\u201cI hope the Indian elite learn from the stupid mistakes of the other elites,\u201d he said. \u201cLearn from history.\u201dIndia is just emerging from what many regard as a catastrophic experiment in a type of socialism, the sort that economists like Amartya Sen, the Nobel laureate, say was not socialism in the first place, because it neglected health care and primary education. What the Indian elite learned from that history was to fear and loathe the idea of the welfare state.In 1991, India reached the nadir of an economic crisis that forced it, in exchange for a financial rescue from the International Monetary Fund, to begin liberalizing its economy along the free market lines that were championed then by Washington. In the years that followed, the rich and the educated benefited the most, though the poor are better off today than they were before those changes.Having prospered in recent decades, the Indian elite have faith in this economic model. But there is also a wide acceptance that India\u2019s inadequate investments in education and health are holding the nation back.\u201cThe problems India is trying to solve are problems other countries are trying to solve,\u201d Mr. Piketty had said during his lecture. \u201cIndia is trying to solve very complicated problems.\u201d\u201cThe reasons for terrorism are complex,\u201d he told me.Mr. Piketty himself is a rich man now, his book having sold more than a million copies.

But the fact that hiking rates is even halfway defensible is a sign that the U.S. economy isn\u2019t doing too badly. So what did we do right?The answer, basically, is that the Fed and the White House have mostly worried about the right things. (Congress, not so much.) Their actions fell far short of what should have been done; unemployment should have come down much faster than it did. But at least they avoided taking destructive steps to fight phantoms.Unfortunately, the U.S. ended up doing a fair bit of austerity too, partly driven by conservative state governments, partly imposed by Republicans in Congress via blackmail over the federal debt ceiling. But the Obama administration at least tried to limit the damage.The result of these not-so-bad policies is today\u2019s not-so-bad economy. It\u2019s not a great economy, by any measure: Unemployment is low, but that has a lot to do with a decline in the fraction of the population looking for work, and the weakness of wages ensures that it doesn\u2019t feel like prosperity. Still, things could be worse.And they may indeed get worse, which is why the Fed\u2019s likely rate hike will be a mistake.Fed officials believe that the solid job growth of the past couple of years \u2014 which happened, by the way, as Obamacare, which conservatives assured us would be a job killer, went into full effect \u2014 will continue even if rates go up. I\u2019m among those who believe that America is facing growing drag from the weakness of other economies, especially because a rising dollar is making U.S. manufacturing less competitive. But those officials could be right, in which case waiting to raise rates could mean some acceleration of inflation.On the other hand, they could be wrong, in which case a rate hike could end the run of good economic news. And this would be much more serious than a modest uptick in inflation, because it\u2019s not at all clear what the Fed could do to fix its mistake.I\u2019m not sure why this argument, which a number of economists are making, isn\u2019t getting much traction at the Fed. I suspect, however, that officials have been worn down by incessant criticism of their policies, and want to throw the critics a bone.But those critics have been wrong every step of the way.

I believe in an agenda that\u2019s inspirational, that\u2019s inclusive, that\u2019s optimistic.\u201dMr. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president in 2012, added his powerful voice to a growing line of leaders of his party\u2019s establishment sounding an alarm about the tenor of the race just weeks before the first votes are cast in the nominating contests.\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Trump,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThis is about do we run on substance or do we run on personality? If we run on personality, we lose those elections.\u201dMr. Ryan, drafted by his party for his current job and popular across a wide spectrum of his fractured party, clearly intends to have a voice in the nominating process, which he said could drag into the summer. \u201cI will use this bully pulpit as effectively as I can,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s the bully pulpit we have.\u201dMr. Ryan said the divisions between an exclusionary strain of hard-right conservatism and one focused on broad-based economic growth were neither new nor insurmountable, recalling his work as a young aide to his mentor, Representative Jack Kemp of New York. \u201cI remember working for Jack fighting the Buchanan wing of the party on similar issues,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. He was referring to Mr. Kemp\u2019s efforts to combat Patrick J. Buchanan\u2019s campaign for president in 1992, which was rooted in a fight over America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d and anti-immigration sensibilities.\u201cThese are not new discussions,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThese are not new frictions. \u201cI come from the pro-growth wing of the Republican movement,\u201d he continued. \u201cI believe in an aspirational type of conservative that should prevail for lots of reasons, for moral reasons and because I think it\u2019s more successful. This is another chapter in that long evolving story.\u201dThe move to insert himself \u2014 and his Republican colleagues \u2014 into the presidential campaign is an abrupt detour from the road taken by his immediate predecessor, John A. Boehner, who stayed largely out of the 2012 campaign and had limited contact with the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. It also sets him apart from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who tends to focus on internal congressional business.Mr. Ryan, who as speaker will also serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer, said he would strongly support any Republican nominee. Still, he said, \u201cI am going to speak my mind.\u201dHe wants to begin now, he said, because \u201cwhat I realized was that in 2012, by the time we got to that conversation it was already too late.\u201d\u201cThe narratives of these campaigns start earlier, and the trajectory of these campaigns get fixed into place,\u201d he added.Members of Congress have tried to drive the agenda before with mixed results. But Mr. Ryan pointed to 1980, when Mr. Kemp put forward a tax reform plan that Ronald Reagan embraced and voters supported.In contrast, Newt Gingrich believed he could seize the agenda from President Bill Clinton when Mr. Gingrich was installed as speaker in 1995, only to conclude that the president\u2019s megaphone drowned out the speaker\u2019s.However, Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Ryan was \u201cexactly right\u201d to be pursuing an agenda against the backdrop of this campaign.\u201cI think an inclusive, optimistic, solutions-oriented party is very important, and it\u2019s really hard for candidates to do that at this stage,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cHaving the youngest speaker since 1869 puts a fresh face on it all.\u201dMr. Ryan, 45, has built credibility since he became speaker in October with bipartisan legislation on education, highway funding and a budget agreement. But he acknowledged that a presidential campaign year was unlikely to yield major legislation, and said he would instead use it to frame the choice between the parties.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve these big problems with this president in the next year,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the parties close together on these issues. I see the need to offer a bold alternative\u201d to eight years of the Obama administration\u2019s agenda.\u201cTo me it isn\u2019t \u2018Let\u2019s split the difference on these issues,\u2019 because our differences are so far apart,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s give an alternative agenda and bring it to the country and let the country decide.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want us to have an election like that where we run on platitudes, then all the sudden we pop this agenda after the election,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.Mr. McConnell, noting that numerous Republican senators are up for re-election in swing states, said the House was \u201cuniquely suited\u201d for articulating a broader message. \u201cI like the fact that the speaker is going to use the House as sounding board for new ideas,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.He added: \u201cThere is not much we can do here in Congress to affect the election. I am going to stay out of it and try and keep my eye on making as much difference as I can here in the Senate.\u201dMr. Ryan began thinking about a policy agenda late in the summer, when the match was lit on Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent. Long before he even considered becoming speaker, he began to think of how to promote a conservative message, and to encourage his party to put forward detailed policy ideas on improving the economy and combating the Islamic State.He gave a speech this month at the Library of Congress to lay out the challenge to his party, and said Republicans would meet at the beginning of the year to develop an agenda. Mr. Ryan said it would include a tax overhaul to criminal justice reform, \u201can issue I didn\u2019t fully grasp until I spent time learning about how people are trying to redeem themselves and have so many roadblocks in front of them that they can\u2019t.\u201dHe invited the Congressional Black Caucus and other minority caucuses to a holiday reception and will try to reach beyond the Republican base. \u201cIt means show up and talk to everybody, appeal to everyone,\u201d he said.And that will start with Republican primary voters, about a third of whom have been swayed so far by Mr. Trump\u2019s recipe of strict immigration policies, tough foreign policy talk, blunt and highly personal critiques of his competitors, and a vague appeal for general greatness.\u201cThere is this real, palpable anxiety in the country\u201d fueled by stagnant wages and slow economic growth, Mr. Ryan said, \u201cand then you turn on the TV and you see ISIS, you see San Bernardino and you see all these security threats, and it\u2019s like the world is on fire.\u201dAt the same time, \u201cwe have to make sure populism doesn\u2019t trump individual rights,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction to prey on fears.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Bank of Japan also continues to press for stronger growth.The divergence among the world\u2019s major central banks is creating a significant drag on the American economy. The dollar has gained strength as investors seeking higher returns invest in the United States. That has reduced demand for American exports, weighing on manufacturing and other sectors.But Ms. Yellen said increased spending by American consumers continued to drive a domestic economic expansion. While problems in the rest of the world may induce the Fed to raise rates more slowly, it is unlikely to wait.\u201cDomestic spending is on a solid course,\u201d Ms. Yellen told the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s been growing around 3 percent. Over all, on balance that\u2019s led \u2014 and I think it will continue to lead \u2014 to growth that is somewhat above trend.\u201dThe Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008 as the main force of its measures to stimulate the economy. Low rates encourage lenders to take larger risks, and businesses and consumers to borrow more money. As the Fed begins to raise rates, those incentives will fade. The Fed\u2019s hope is that the economy is now strong enough to continue growing without quite so much help.The Fed\u2019s march toward an increase still is drawing resistance from some Democrats and liberal groups. Inflation remains sluggish, the share of Americans with jobs remains lower than before the recession, and they argue there is little harm in pressing on.Ms. Yellen, pressed by Democrats on Thursday about any lingering hesitations, said the Fed continued to look at new economic data, and would pay particular attention to the government\u2019s first estimate of November job growth.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.But she added that the impact of any single economic report was limited, and that an accumulation of evidence suggested that the economy had gained strength.\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen some welcome hints\u201d of wage increases, Ms. Yellen said, although she cautioned, \u201cit\u2019s tentative evidence; we don\u2019t know if it will last.\u201dHer testimony repeated portions of a speech she gave on Wednesday, laying out in greater detail her reasons for economic optimism. Both closed on the same note, referring to raising rates as \u201ca day that I expect we all are looking forward to.\u201dMs. Yellen said, however, that the Fed is likely to raise rates slowly once it started, in part because of the different paths of the world\u2019s major central banks.\u201cThat difference in expectations about monetary policy has led to a substantial appreciation of the dollar,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cA combination of weak foreign growth and a stronger dollar, both of those things have depressed export growth.\u201dSenator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, asked whether raising rates would worsen that trend, causing the dollar to rise further. Ms. Yellen responded that investors already had priced in much of the divergence, but she declined to forecast where the dollar was headed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Narendra Modi Could Make or Break Obama\u2019s Climate Legacy", "Date": "2015-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.India embodies a critical tension that will play out in Paris between developed nations like the United States, which are calling for universal emissions cuts, and developing nations like India, which say they deserve to increase fossil fuel use as their economies grow or else receive billions of dollars to make the transition to cleaner energy.After Mr. Modi met Mr. Obama on Monday \u2014 their sixth meeting in 14 months \u2014 he told reporters that the two leaders had \u201csuch a deep relationship that we are able to openly discuss all issues,\u201d and he said that he was happy to work \u201cshoulder to shoulder with the United States.\u201d\u201cBut we in India face its consequences today,\u201d he said.\u201cI think Obama got carried away with Modi, frankly,\u201d said Jairam Ramesh, a leader of the opposition Indian National Congress party, who served as minister of the environment under the previous government. Mr. Modi has made one major breakthrough in talks with Mr. Obama, Mr. Ramesh said, committing \u201cagainst the advice of everyone in the system\u201d to limit the use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, a component in refrigerators and air-conditioners. Since then, he said, India\u2019s negotiators have returned to their familiar, confrontational manner.\u201cIndia is not an easy country to negotiate with,\u201d Mr. Ramesh said. \u201cWe are moralistic, we are argumentative, we are regressive. It has gone back to the old rhetoric, there is no doubt about it.\u201dIndia was the last major economy to submit its plans for a domestic climate change policy ahead of the Paris talks. And the proposal, while it included a significant expansion of renewable energy, would also see India\u2019s carbon pollution triple in the coming decades. Indian officials have painted that projection as a concession, saying that in a business-as-usual situation, their emissions would soar at an even higher rate.Leaders in New Delhi argue that limiting coal use would cripple the economy and harm a population struggling to escape poverty, including 300 million Indians who live without electricity. They also say India has done little to contribute to the problem of global warming: India\u2019s annual per capita carbon dioxide emissions are 1.7 tons, compared with 16.6 tons per person in the United States and 7.4 tons per person in China. During the climate change talks, India is expected to challenge the United States on three counts: to speed up emissions reductions by wealthy countries to compensate for emissions growth in poor countries, to pay more to poor countries to assist in mitigation plans, and to provide clean-energy technology to poor countries.Ashley Tellis, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Mr. Obama had \u201ctried hard\u201d to persuade Mr. Modi to shift India off those more hard-line negotiating positions ahead of the climate talks, \u201cbut failed.\u201d\u201cI still think that if the U.S. position comes to enjoy a strong consensus in Paris, India will not come in the way, but this acquiescence will materialize only at the last moment,\u201d Mr. Tellis said. He said that Mr. Obama, in his talks with Mr. Modi, should have focused on the more modest goal of ensuring that India would not block a consensus.The administration quickly disputed that contention.Knowing Mr. Modi\u2019s position, the Obama administration has been working to reduce the tensions with India and the developing world without significantly increasing taxpayer spending.The plans for the fund came together after the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who is deeply invested in the success of the Paris talks, invited Mr. Gates and Mr. Modi to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. As Mr. Obama has tried to find ways to bring Mr. Modi into a deal, his officials have worked closely with Mr. Gates.Most countries have pledged their greenhouse gas emissions goals. The pledges are the biggest cut ever achieved, but are still not enough.Some analysts caution against overreacting to India\u2019s negotiating postures \u2014 or, for that matter, its projections for expansion in its coal sector, which is dogged by corruption and inefficiency.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing them put forth their national interest, but you\u2019re also seeing a willingness to negotiate,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, an expert on international climate change negotiations with the World Resources Institute, a research organization. \u201cThey\u2019re staking out the priorities for their country. They know they\u2019re not going to get everything they need, but they\u2019re going to fight hard. This is classic positioning.\u201dMs. Morgan predicted that India would engage in hard-line brinkmanship into overtime sessions of the climate talks, but that ultimately Mr. Modi does not want a deal to collapse.Some Indian leaders expressed concern that India\u2019s contributions to climate efforts could be eclipsed by the negotiators\u2019 adversarial tone. \u201cI really believe that Modi wants to be remembered as the person who turned India green,\u201d said Anand Mahindra, the chairman of the Mahindra Group, who has joined an international group of corporate leaders calling for carbon pricing at the talks.\u201cHe is trying to take the lead as a green warrior,\u201d he said of Mr. Modi. \u201cHe is being held back by this old reflexive rhetoric.\u201dMr. Mahindra may be an outlier, though. Domestic audiences, on both the right and the left, are eager to see Mr. Modi and his environment minister, Prakash Javadekar, demonstrate influence in the international arena by standing up to pressure from Europe and the United States and demanding financing for green energy.India\u2019s major newspapers carried editorials on Monday from prominent figures urging negotiators to stand their ground, even at the cost of being labeled obstructionists or spoilers.\u201cThe more criticism India comes under in Paris, the more applause Javadekar will get in Parliament and elsewhere,\u201d said Mr. Ramesh, the former environment minister. \u201cThis is the dichotomy of the situation.\u201dCoral Davenport reported from Le Bourget, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s important, however, to keep two things in mind: A rate hike means that the economists at the Fed, as they review voluminous statistical data, believe that the economy is actually improving; and with rates at virtual all-time lows, a measly one-quarter percent increase should certainly not be devastating.In reality, it\u2019s only an increase from basically zilch to still very little.JOSEPH P. HUBERPlantation, Fla.The writer is a retired financial adviser.To the Editor:This is a purely symbolic gesture. An increase of 0.25 percent will have no material effect on the markets. What it will do is appease the credit markets, showing that the Fed will stand and fight inflation. Never mind that commodity prices are plummeting all over the world and we are on the edge of a deflationary spiral. Why let reality get in the way of politics?What will happen is that inflation will remain low and the right will claim a victory that raising rates kept inflation at bay. Let them have their hollow victory.This is not a one-way street. The Fed could just as easily drop rates in six months. Most likely, the Fed is looking for an interest level that the economy can tolerate. Then it will have a place from which to drop rates when things slow down too much. Conditions are already pretty slow, so we may not have to wait long for rates to drop.BRUCE ROZENBLITKansas City, Mo.To the Editor:Many of your articles about interest rates, such as this one, talk about the dangers of raising interest rates. How about the risks of keeping interest rates this low for this long? Insurance companies and pension funds are making risky investments in order to get enough yield to manage their business. In addition, there has been a huge distortion of capital flow from low-risk bonds to high-risk bonds and stocks.The recession was not caused by high interest rates and will not be cured by low interest rates. Jobs are threatened by automation and competition from abroad, and low interest rates will not cure those ills. Low interest rates are inflating stock prices and setting us up for another crash. If we enter another recession and interest rates remain this low, there will be no way to stimulate the economy with monetary policy.It\u2019s time we examine the negative impact of the current Fed policy.ERIC NEIKRUGSarasota, Fla.To the Editor:Oh my gosh, whatever shall I do with the extra dollar my savings might earn in interest next year?VANESSA HALLMillersburg, Mo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheldon Adelson Bought the Wrong Newspaper", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsBut why Sheldon Adelson, who controls the casino operator Las Vegas Sands, snapped up Nevada\u2019s top paper remains unclear. Acquiring The South China Morning Post might have made more business sense.Mr. Adelson tried to keep his $140 million purchase secret by using a Delaware-based shell company. When asked whether he was the buyer, the casino mogul said he had \u201cno personal interest\u201d in the newspaper. For now at least, The Review-Journal employs investigative journalists, so it\u2019s no surprise that Mr. Adelson was outed.But why own a publication with a declining circulation of around 170,000? Mr. Adelson, who got his start selling newspapers on a Boston street corner, is already a big deal in Nevada, and worth some $24 billion, according to Forbes. He\u2019s a huge Republican donor and Nevada is an important swing state. Yet The Review-Journal is already on Mr. Adelson\u2019s side, having endorsed the Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.More to the point, Vegas represents just a sliver of Mr. Adelson\u2019s gambling empire. The $35 billion Las Vegas Sands reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, of $208 million from its Las Vegas properties in the first nine months of 2015. Sands casinos in the former Portuguese colony of Macau, now administered by China, generated $1.6 billion of Ebitda \u2014 eight times as much, even after a 36 percent drop from the same period in 2014. The United States company\u2019s 70 percent stake in the Hong Kong\u2013listed parent of the Macau casinos accounts for more than half of its market capitalization.And the Macau operations need the most help. The junkets of Chinese businessmen and Communist Party officials that kept casinos humming have ground to a near halt thanks largely to President Xi Jinping\u2019s corruption crackdown. Casino gambling revenue in Macau is running 35 percent lower this year than last, and the territory\u2019s gross domestic product has shrunk by a quarter.Macau\u2019s secretary for economy recently met with casino operators to gauge their views on the crisis. Ideas like smoking bans and orders to create more family-friendly entertainment were on the table.For Mr. Adelson, the bully pulpit of a prominent newspaper in Hong Kong, close to the gambling pits of Macau, might do more for business than one in Vegas. But Alibaba, the e-commerce group founded by Jack Ma, just snapped up the Morning Post.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unloved 2-Point Conversions, Carolina\u2019s Lucky Loss and a Strange Coin Flip", "Date": "2015-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byT.M.Q. \u2014 Tuesday Morning QuarterbackWith a week remaining in the regular season, there have been 68 missed point-after attempts, versus eight in the entire 2014 regular season. But only 93 two-point conversions have been attempted, not hugely different from the 58 attempted in the 2014 regular season.The preponderance of deuce tries of 2015 have been by the trailing team and have happened in the second half, when the trailing team must catch up. Early on, trailing teams aren\u2019t going for two as much as might be expected: Scoring to pull within 14-12 in the first half versus Green Bay, the Raiders kicked a singleton. And hardly any N.F.L. coach is using the bolder approach of going for two when ahead in the first half.Facing Santa Clara in the second week of the season, the Steelers, who lead the league with 10 deuce attempts, went for two at 6-0 and again at 14-3 in the first half. Both tries succeeded, giving Pittsburgh a 16-3 edge, a nice improvement over 14-3. College play, especially by Chip Kelly when at Oregon, has shown that going for two early, adding an extra spin to the ole scoreboard, can dishearten the opponent.Over the next few games, the Steelers went for two early, when leading, versus St. Louis and Arizona, failing both times. This seemed to cause Mike Tomlin to lose interest in deuce tactics, though what happened on the last attempt tells nothing about what will happen on the next. (Pittsburgh is seven for 10 on deuce tries.) Meanwhile, most of the league hasn\u2019t experimented with going for two early or when already leading.The devil\u2019s advocate would note that Arizona, Carolina and New England, this season\u2019s best teams, have not attempted any deuces. This may be because kicked PATs are the preferred tactic \u2014 or because the best teams usually don\u2019t worry about the scoreboard. The other devil\u2019s advocate argument is that because 94 percent of PATs and 47 percent of deuces are succeeding this season, 100 tries of either type would yield 94 points, so what\u2019s the difference?But perhaps N.F.L. coaches are not embracing the deuce because they don\u2019t want to be blamed for a failed try. If an N.F.L. coach decides to go for two and ends up wishing he\u2019d kicked for one, that coach gets hammered by the sports press. If the coach sends in the place-kicker and it\u2019s a miss, the kicker or holder or long-snapper will be blamed. For the many N.F.L. coaches on the hot seat, avoiding negative Monday-morning headlines is essential.Speaking of the Patriots, their confusion regarding the coin toss in overtime is understandable \u2014 see below for details of the N.F.L.\u2019s super-obscure \u201ctwo privileges\u201d rule.T.M.Q. notes that on most N.F.L. plays, there is at least one player doing absolutely nothing. On this down, Miami linemen Brandon Albert, Dallas Thomas, Billy Turner and Jason Fox, plus wide receiver Kenny Stills, simply stood watching Tannehill be sacked, doing nothing. The snap was mistimed, but still it was fourth-and-goal on the final play and half the Dolphins\u2019 offense watched, hands on hips, as their quarterback was sacked. That\u2019s lump-of-coal sour.Now that J.J. Abrams wields control over the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, he has teleportation, precognition, warp engines, telekinesis, time travel, matter replicators and mind control in his tool kit. But his most important power is coincidence.Of course many movies rely on preposterous coincidence, but Abrams sci-fi takes it to another level. In the 2009 reboot flick \u201cStar Trek,\u201d the young Jim Kirk, not yet a captain, is forced into a survival pod and crash-lands on an uncharted planet. Kirk\u2019s pod touches down within walking distance of Mr. Spock, who was marooned by a different plot twist at exactly the same part of exactly the same uncharted planet. In \u201cTFA,\u201d Rey steals an abandoned starship that turns out to be the long-lost Millennium Falcon. She gets it up into space and almost immediately encounters a ship flown by Han Solo, who\u2019s not looking for the Falcon \u2014 he\u2019s there by coincidence. A typical galaxy is about 600 quadrillion miles across and 99 six-nines percent void. Yet by galactic standards, Han just happens to be within walking distance.In \u201cStar Trek,\u201d while marooned on the uncharted world, Mr. Spock looks into the sky and sees his home planet, Vulcan, explode. For Vulcan to appear as large in the sky as it does to Spock, he would have had to have been on a moon of Vulcan. In \u201cTFA,\u201d the heroic rebels led by Leia Organa look up into the sky and see the capital planet of the Republic blown up by the bad guys\u2019 latest world-killer weapon. To see the capital planet in this way, they too would have had to have been on a moon. The moon of a planet that just exploded would suffer terrible geological consequences, yet nothing happens to Spock\u2019s or Leia\u2019s terra firma.Sure, these are movies intended for suburban shopping malls. But now that J.J. Abrams is Earth\u2019s No. 1 person for depictions of outer space, he should step up his cosmic IQ.The Rams broke an 0-10 streak at Seattle.Carson Palmer is on a 26-4 streak.Houston opened 1-4 and since is 7-3.Since the start of the 2014 season, at home Tennessee is 2-0 versus Jacksonville and 0-14 versus all other teams.This season the Ravens are 2-0 versus the Steelers and 3-10 versus all other teams.Baltimore is on a 5-1 stretch versus Pittsburgh.Aaron Rodgers is 9-20 on the road versus winning teams.Peyton Manning has not played in six weeks, and leads the N.F.L. in interceptions.The big-deal New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day bowls can be a thrill for players, plus a chance to finish in the top 10.

Three Cowboys offensive linemen made the Pro Bowl last year, because last year the Boys line performed well; three Cowboys offensive linemen made the Pro Bowl this year, because now they have reputations. But this season the St. Louis offensive line has allowed the league\u2019s fewest sacks, yet got no one in the Pro Bowl. Buffalo and Seattle, the first- and third-ranked rushing teams, have no offensive linemen in the Pro Bowl.Chicago viewers tuning to CBS saw also-rans Jax at New Orleans, combined record 10-18, rather than Pats at Jets. Because Fox telecast Bears-Bucs to most of Illinois, Chicago had to be punished for supporting the Bears, first with CBS blacking out in Cook County the playoff-atmosphere Patriots at Jets, then punished anew with the beaming into tubes of the Jags-Saints woofer.Still, T.M.Q. thinks Griffin will play well again once he is freed from Chainsaw Dan\u2019s negative energy field. For contract reasons Griffin is more likely to be waived than traded; that will allow him to shop for the best situation. Griffin has potential to become the next Jim Plunkett. The 49ers\u2019 trade for Plunkett included three first-round picks, just as Washington\u2019s trade for Griffin included three first-rounders, Then the 49ers waived Plunkett, just as Griffin is likely to be released. Plunkett went from the waiver wire to winning two Super Bowls for the Raiders. RG3 may do something special after slinking out of Washington.O.K., the real standings count, too. There remains a chance Arizona could secure the first seed in the N.F.C., and the Cardinals love their sliding field \u2014 Arizona is 19-4 at home under Bruce Arians. But Carolina locks the first seed with a win in Charlotte versus erratic City of Tampa.Carolina 5-0Patriots 5-2Arizona 4-1Broncos 5-3Jets 3-2Steelers 4-4Green Bay 3-3Bengals, Chiefs, Texans 3-4Seattle 2-4Colts 2-5Minnesota 1-4Washington 0-3Some confusion during the coin toss \u2014 Patriots special teams captain Matthew Slater questioning referee Clete Blakeman \u2014 stemmed from the quirks of coin toss rules which, like so much else in football, are excessively complex.The result is like this. Team A wins the game-opening toss. If it defers, Team B always chooses the \u201cfirst privilege,\u201d kick or receive, then says receive; otherwise Team A will get the ball to start both halves. After Team B chooses to receive, the referee turns back to Team A\u2019s captain and offers the other privilege, which is selecting which goal to defend. So on a windy day, winning the opening coin toss is double value \u2014 Team A can defer to the second half and also control when it gets the wind.The second-half choice is simpler, since at that juncture there\u2019s no defer option. Team A is asked whether it wishes to kick or receive, and always says it wishes to receive. Then Team B chooses which goal to defend.At an overtime coin toss, the winner cannot defer \u2014 unless it can, hold that thought \u2014 and is offered only the \u201ctwo privileges:\u201d whether to kick or receive, or to decide which goal to defend. If the winner chooses to kick, as the Patriots did at Jersey/B, then the toss loser, the Jets, chooses which goal; had the Patriots elected to receive, again the Jets would have chosen a goal. Slater said that\u2019s why he got confused at midfield on national television. When the Patriots win a game-opening coin toss, they can kick off and also decide which goal they want. At the overtime coin toss, once New England elected to kick, the goal choice belonged to the Jets. Blakeman, the referee, knew that, and wasn\u2019t happy to hear Slater question him.Here\u2019s the nutty quirk \u2014 the winner of an overtime coin toss can defer, but only if it\u2019s in the playoffs. Regular-season N.F.L. games end after five quarters if the score is tied; postseason contests continue till someone wins. If a postseason game goes to a seventh quarter \u2014 that is, to a fourth half \u2014 there\u2019s another coin toss, modeled on the one that starts the second half. So in theory a team winning the overtime coin toss in the playoffs can elect to defer its choice to the seventh quarter, without, of course, knowing if there will be a seventh quarter. The excessively long N.F.L. rule book even spells out coin toss rules for the start of a ninth quarter. I\u2019m pretty sure no N.F.L. coach has ever deferred to start a playoff overtime. But should this happen, Belichick will be the one who does it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let the U.S. Treasury Rescue Puerto Rico", "Date": "2015-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorStanford, Calif. \u2014 Last week, Puerto Rico eked out a major round of payments on its enormous debt \u2014 surely the last one that the island can afford to pay in full. The territory\u2019s debt crisis reached a boiling point last summer and is beginning to overflow. By the new year, Puerto Rico will most likely be unable to meet payroll for basic services on the island.So far, Congress has languished in paralysis, failing to act on legislation to let the territory file for bankruptcy and restructure its payment schedule. That leaves the Obama administration, again, to compensate for congressional inaction with a creative solution. The Treasury Department can and should do so \u2014 immediately.If service cuts and asset sales remain the only response to the crisis, the economy is sure to worsen. Such measures will undermine Puerto Rico\u2019s ability to recover and pay its debts over the long run, leaving it like a debtor who sells his car to make a few more payments to a creditor but then can\u2019t reach his job.Without action from Washington, Puerto Rico lacks the authority to declare bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the fiscal free-fall leaves everyone progressively worse off \u2014 residents, creditors and America\u2019s municipal bond markets. While a time for critiquing Puerto Rico\u2019s past fiscal policies will come, such a critique cannot be allowed to substitute for action by the Congress or the Treasury now.A restructuring process for Puerto Rico\u2019s debts is the only chance to stabilize its economy. The primary goal would not be to forgive debt, but to establish a feasible plan for debt payment that could bend the curve of available government revenues upward again. That would facilitate not just the island\u2019s economic recovery, but also the highest repayment to creditors over time.Formal bankruptcy through a mechanism known as Chapter 9 is normally the best tool we have for a public agency\u2019s debt restructuring. It is designed to spare debtors and creditors a chaotic and expensive \u201crace to the courthouse,\u201d in which creditors separately sue to claim assets and collect what they can in the short term. Instead, the agency\u2019s creditors are ordered to a single negotiating table to seek a fair plan for repayment. That would be critical for Puerto Rico, which faces a large number of creditors set to disagree over who should get paid first.In Puerto Rico\u2019s case, only Congress can offer the solution of access to bankruptcy for the territory as a whole. Last week, the United States Supreme Court accepted a case that will determine whether the territory can authorize its municipalities and public utilities to seek bankruptcy restructuring. But even that case cannot accomplish what Congress can: allow the territorial government to restructure its own debt under something like Chapter 9, a process that is not available to states.If Congress continues to fail at a bankruptcy solution, the Treasury Department can \u2014 and must \u2014 pursue a second-best process modeled after Chapter 9 itself. While Treasury would be working more with the power of persuasion (like a big bank) than the power of legal coercion (like a court), that could still be enough influence with which to broker a solution.Treasury is capable of drawing creditors to the negotiating table. Its tools of persuasion could include the questionable legality of some of the debt, the self-interest of most creditors and the threat that Congress will eventually mandate bankruptcy. Treasury officials could take lessons from the leadership of federal, state and local officials who avoided or led bankruptcies in New York City in 1975; Harrisburg, Pa., in 2013; and the Big Three automakers in 2009.With a population larger than that of 22 states, Puerto Rico is \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d But it has a fundamental problem in moving Washington to action: It lacks the clout there that comes with a voting voice in presidential elections or Congress. If Puerto Rico defaults next year, it will be because Washington has shirked its responsibility for the well-being of eight million American citizens who either live on the island or have strong ties to it. Washington will also be understood to be favoring the few hedge funds that own more than one-third of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt. Because they have the wherewithal for endless litigation, they are the only potential winners under the status quo.The biggest losers are already the 3.5 million American citizens who live on the island. But their political handicaps in federal politics do not leave them entirely powerless to demand bold leadership from Treasury.Each of those voters on the mainland should watch closely this winter, demand leadership to help Puerto Rico, and judge our federal politicians by their actions on this crisis. On Nov. 8, 2016, they should be organized and ready to throw their weight around.Michelle Wilde Anderson is a professor of law at Stanford Law School.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trudeau\u2019s Canada, Again", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "FeatureWith support from President Obama and the legacy of his father on his side, Justin Trudeau sets out to redefine what it means to be Canadian.Supported by\u2018\u2018We\u2019re going to move this place around,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. \u2018\u2018This is very much the last guy\u2019s style, not mine. I\u2019ll have a smaller desk in the corner and a bigger couch so we can sit down and actually have discussions. I\u2019ll put a reclining seat over there, for me to read.\u2019\u2019 He smiled as he mentally redecorated the space, the Canadian version of the Oval Office. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a different approach.\u2019\u2019There is virtually no transition period in Canadian politics, and it was clear that the electoral win on Oct. 19 had caught Trudeau, his staff and the country by surprise. During his first days in office, his small, overworked campaign team tried to cope with the unexpected demands of governing. With so many positions to fill, they had issued a call for r\u00e9sum\u00e9s on social media and received 22,000.Trudeau, who is 43, was still working on getting his staff to call him \u2018\u2018Prime Minister.\u2019\u2019 For years, he was \u2018\u2018Justin,\u2019\u2019 and staff members often still referred to him that way. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like your really smart friend suddenly became prime minister,\u2019\u2019 Kate Purchase, his communications director, told me.\u2018\u2018People in the street will either call me \u2018Prime Minister\u2019 or \u2018Justin,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ll see how that goes. But when I\u2019m working, when I\u2019m with my staff in public, I\u2019m \u2018Prime Minister.\u2019 I say that if we\u2019re drinking beer out of a bottle, and you can see my tattoos, you should be comfortable calling me \u2018Justin.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019In person, Trudeau was as upbeat and friendly \u2014 as nice \u2014 as might be expected of a politician with a campaign mantra of \u2018\u2018Sunny Ways,\u2019\u2019 a reference to the optimistic adage of Wilfrid Laurier, a Liberal prime minister at the turn of the 20th century. Trudeau is 6-foot-2 and has an athletic build, his hair neatly trimmed after years experimenting with a variety of shaggy manes. There was little of the pomp of the powerful \u2014 just an aide named Tommy, who brought him half a tuna sandwich and a cup of chicken-noodle soup for lunch from the cafeteria downstairs. This was the first print interview Trudeau had granted since taking office, and in his presence there was a palpable sense that he was still figuring out exactly how to play this new role \u2014 how to talk, how to gesture, how to adopt the mien of a world leader. Despite his studied manner, he was prone to providing glimpses of his unguarded self.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s very, very cool to have the president call up, and I say, \u2018Hello, Mr. President.\u2019 I\u2019ve never met him,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. He dropped his voice an octave to imitate President Obama: \u2018\u2018Justin, I like to think of myself as a young politician. The gray hair caught up with me, and it\u2019ll catch up with you. But calling me \u2018Sir\u2019 makes me feel old. Call me \u2018Barack.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Trudeau shook his head, amazed. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s going to take some getting used to.\u2019\u2019One week later, a new geopolitical relationship between America and Canada would begin in a conference room in Manila at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, when Trudeau and Obama sat down for the first time to talk. In an age of a rising China, Middle Eastern chaos and Russian belligerence, it may sound strange to say, but the United States has no relationship more important than the one with Canada. The country is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners (on par with China), a peaceful neighbor and a crucial ally in global affairs \u2014 when the relationship is functional, as it hasn\u2019t been in recent years. Harper\u2019s hawkish foreign policy put him at odds with Obama on the Iran nuclear treaty, Israeli-Palestinian relations and Syrian refugees. In domestic affairs, Harper was strongly in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama resisted; the president killed the project two weeks after the Conservatives lost. The discord may largely have ended with Trudeau\u2019s election, though Canada will be less likely to participate in airstrikes against ISIS in the Middle East.The 45-minute session in Manila was casual and friendly; two of Obama\u2019s campaign aides worked for Trudeau\u2019s campaign, and the president followed the Canadian race and knew of the excitement the victory had generated around the world \u2014 much as his own triumph had in 2008.In a private conversation, the president advised Trudeau to be active early, but also to think about calibrating sky-high expectations with a long-term plan for governance. Obama shared his impressions of various world leaders, suggesting whom to build relationships with \u2014 and whom to steer clear of. Obama issued an invitation to Washington, and later to a state dinner to be held in the new year, the first honoring a Canadian prime minister in 19 years. The president went out of his way to make clear that he looked forward to spending personal time together, with their wives. \u2018\u2018There was an air of mentorship but not in a paternalistic way,\u2019\u2019 Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said. \u2018\u2018Trudeau\u2019s going to be on the stage for a long time. He\u2019s got a ton of talent.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018It was nice to confirm in person how like-minded we are on so many issues,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau told me. \u2018\u2018He said that seeing my family on TV on election night reminded him of his election in 2008 with his family. I\u2019m looking forward to having a beer with him.\u2019\u2019What the world knows as a progressive modern Canada was created largely under the rule of the Liberal leader Lester Pearson and then Pierre Trudeau in the \u201960s and \u201970s, when the country began to sever its ties with Britain and assert its own identity. The country created a new flag, replacing the Union Jack with the Maple Leaf, and adopted a national anthem. Quintessential Canadian characteristics \u2014 universal medical care, bilingualism, multiculturalism, a strong voice for peace and development at the United Nations \u2014 were born during that era. The earliest major political initiative of Pierre Trudeau in the late \u201960s was to decriminalize homosexuality. \u2018\u2018The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said. In rapid succession, Trudeau legalized abortion, funded the arts and promoted a race-blind immigration policy, which over time would transform the great cities of the country into polyglot metropolises.Defeating the son of Pierre Trudeau would have been a metaphysical vindication for Harper. For the past decade, Harper did all he could to undo the legacy of the older Trudeau, internationally, domestically and symbolically. In defense of \u2018\u2018old stock\u2019\u2019 white Canada, Harper denigrated the United Nations, made the modest attire of Muslim women a political issue and recast Canada\u2019s role in the world as part of a grand alliance to defend Western civilization. Harper freely admitted to loathing the older Trudeau, despite an adolescent fascination, writing ungraciously after his death in 2000 about meeting him for the first time in the streets of Montreal. \u2018\u2018There I came face to face with a living legend, someone who had provoked both the loves and hatreds of my political passion, all in the form of a tired-out, little old man.\u2019\u2019 Harper\u2019s greatest ambition was to destroy Trudeau\u2019s vision of the country: \u2018\u2018He continues to define the myths that guide the Canadian psyche, but myths they are.\u2019\u2019Pierre Trudeau at a party in Hull, Quebec, in 1968, the year he was first elected the leader of the Liberal Party.As a Canadian expat living in America, I became acutely aware of the election\u2019s symbolic importance in September, when the body of a little Syrian refugee boy washed up on the shores of Turkey. The child had relations in Canada who tried to help the family immigrate, but Harper had maintained a hard line on Syrian refugees, claiming national secur\u00adity was more important than the humanitarian crisis, and the family was forced to try to escape the war by sea. After the boy\u2019s death, Harper\u2019s government continued to inveigh against Muslim \u2018\u2018jihadi\u2019\u2019 immigration in a way that struck me and many others as astoundingly un-Canadian, at least in a historical sense. But the nation\u2019s self-image was precisely what the Conservatives were determined to remake.For a decade, Harper remained in office through a mix of artful politics, successful economic management and falling crime rates \u2014 as well as inept opposition. During that era\u2019s elections, the more progressive vote split between the Liberals and the New Democrats, a party to the left of the Liberals, allowing Harper to retain the prime ministry. During most of the recent campaign, Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party was running third behind the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party. But after the death of the Syrian boy and Trudeau\u2019s strong performance in five contentious debates, voters began to abandon the New Democrats, coalescing around Trudeau in the hope of defeating the prime minister.\u2018\u2018People decided to line up behind whoever was going to beat Stephen Harper,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau told me. \u2018\u2018I was of the mind that even if there was uncertainty about my own personal ability to run the economy, there was the feeling that the party had a team and history that meant we\u2019d get the compromises and balances you have to make. So I could take much bigger risks to challenge the orthodoxy.\u2019\u2019While campaigning, Harper portrayed Trudeau as the feckless, high-taxing son of the former prime minister, a novice whose surname was his sole qualification for high office. One of many areas of confrontation during televised debates was a law Harper proposed that would have allowed the government to revoke citizenship for Canadians with dual nationality if they were found guilty of terrorism \u2014 in effect making Canadians born in another country a separate class of citizen.\u2018\u2018Why would we not revoke the citizenship of people convicted of terrorist offenses against this country?\u2019\u2019 Harper asked Trudeau incredulously.Conservatives countered that Trudeau was na\u00efve, rejecting Canada\u2019s role in the war on terror and instead emphasizing soft-minded issues like global warming. \u2018\u2018The focus on climate change as the \u2018top threat,\u2019 while important, is also code for isolationism and an unwillingness to deal with the Islamic State and terrorism in general,\u2019\u2019 said Christopher Alexander, former minister for citizenship and immigration in the Harper government. Alexander remains convinced the country has made a large, potentially tragic mistake in electing Trudeau. \u2018\u2018There was a strong thread of nostalgia in the Liberal campaign for a simpler time, for a more peaceful world and the nostrums of Trudeau\u2019s father when Canada didn\u2019t have to deal with global terror threats,\u2019\u2019 he said.Harper\u2019s defeat at the hands of Pierre Trudeau\u2019s son had obvious dramatic dimensions of the classical Greek variety, redeeming not just the family name but also Pierre\u2019s view of the nation. The younger Trudeau has appointed a cabinet from a wide sweep of ethnic groups and made a point of choosing equal numbers of men and women. Virtually every Trudeau initiative, from tax policy to an embrace of the L.G.B.T.Q. community to relations with China, seemed a rebuke to the previous administration. Government scientists, who had been effectively prevented from talking to the press lest they contradict Harper\u2019s skeptical view of climate change, now shared their research with reporters in tones of relieved amazement. Even Trudeau\u2019s simple act of answering questions from journalists in Parliament\u2019s press theater \u2014 a space like the White House\u2019s briefing room \u2014 took on myriad meanings. Harper hadn\u2019t held such a news conference in six years.\u2018\u2018It\u2019s a whole new world,\u2019\u2019 a reporter muttered as Trudeau approached the lectern. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u2019\u2019During his time as prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984, the Montreal-born boulevardier was despised in western Canada for an energy policy that enriched the eastern provinces. He was also hated by separatists in Quebec, who saw him as a quisling for Anglo elitists. Yet in many ways he was a visionary. At the time, Canada\u2019s Constitution could be changed only with the approval of Britain\u2019s Parliament, a colonial vestige. In 1982, this provision was done away with, and Trudeau in effect became a Canadian founding father. An intellectual who approached issues with an analytical and a creative mind, he fashioned a constitutional legal landscape midway between America\u2019s rights-based rules and the unwritten and informal British approach.Trudeau gave his son a front seat to history. When he was a boy, Justin met Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan (who recited verses from the poem \u2018\u2018The Shooting of Dan McGrew\u2019\u2019); Richard Nixon toasted the toddler in Ottawa, predicting he would become prime minister someday. But the younger Trudeau told me he never discussed the subject with his father until the last year of his life. \u2018\u2018He was much more focused on having substantive conversations,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said. \u2018\u2018Politics didn\u2019t fit into that for him.\u2019\u2019The younger Trudeau has a bachelor\u2019s degree from McGill University and a teaching degree from the University of British Columbia, but despite his pedigree and inherited wealth, when he reached adulthood his life was remarkably unremarkable. He traveled the world and smoked marijuana and snowboarded and worked as a bouncer at bars, eventually ending up teaching high school in Vancouver.Justin Trudeau\u2019s lack of qualifications to be prime minister were obvious, as was his lack of his father\u2019s erudition \u2014 but he considers himself to have undergone his own peculiar kind of schooling. Trudeau points out that he has visited nearly 100 countries, many of them for international summit meetings with his father, which provided an intimate understanding of statecraft. Travel has also given him compassion for the less fortunate around the globe. In his memoir, \u2018\u2018Common Ground,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau described a moment from a boyhood trip to Bangladesh, recollecting it in the kind of mawkish language his opponents ridicule but that is plainly heartfelt. On state business with his father in Dhaka, the younger Trudeau saw a poor old man with a bicycle wait patiently while their motorcade swept by. He was suddenly seized with empathy for the man, realizing that there were billions of people on earth, each a unique individual, each with a story. \u2018\u2018I have never looked at my life and my circumstances in quite the same way since,\u2019\u2019 he wrote.The drama of the Trudeau family has long played out in the Canadian imagination, much like that of the Kennedys in America. Justin Trudeau\u2019s mother, Margaret, was 22 in 1971 when she married Pierre, then 51. He was the prime minister and a famous eligible bachelor; he was also a workaholic and a notorious skinflint. After giving birth to three boys in quick succession, the beauty dubbed \u2018\u2018Maggie T.\u2019\u2019 by the press smoked marijuana while under the watch of Mounties, ate peyote before giving a speech in Venezuela and left her husband to party at Studio 54 in New York. The Trudeaus eventually divorced. According to Margaret\u2019s own account, she had affairs with Teddy Kennedy, Ryan O\u2019Neal and at least one Rolling Stone.Despite the glamorous trappings, a central part of the Trudeau family story is rooted in tragedy, in the death of Justin\u2019s younger brother Michel at the age of 23, in an avalanche on a backcountry ski trip in British Columbia in 1998. His death seemed to touch off a downward spiral in Pierre. A deeply religious man with a Jesuitical cast of mind, he began to doubt his faith. Michel\u2019s death was also devastating for Margaret, and Justin tended to her. It was only later, after Margaret was committed to a mental institution, that she learned she had an undiagnosed case of bipolar disorder; she has turned the cause of mental health into her life\u2019s work.Justin Trudeau entered politics eight years later, running for Parliament in Papineau, a working-class, multiethnic district in Montreal. Trudeau distinguished himself with hard work and an appetite for retail politics; Trudeau\u2019s father never loved pressing the flesh, but his son\u2019s greatest talent might well be his common touch. When Trudeau won that year, in an upset, it was news \u2014 but of the celebrity and nostalgia variety.The younger Trudeau\u2019s road to victory as prime minister truly began on a Saturday night in 2012 in a boxing ring in Ottawa. At the time, the Liberal Party was leaderless and lost, after a devastating defeat in the election of 2011 reduced its seats in Parliament to only 34, roughly one-tenth of the total at the time. The sensible way forward seemed to be a merger with the larger New Democratic Party. Aiming to change the political dynamic, Trudeau literally picked a fight. In what looked like a publicity stunt, he challenged a 37-year-old Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, known as Brass Knuckles, to three rounds of boxing to raise money for cancer research.Everyone expected Trudeau to receive a royal beating, including his wife. Brazeau had a black belt in karate and a military background, and he grew up on hardscrabble First Nations reservations; his bar brawler\u2019s physique, tattoos and trash-talking bravado made him the three-to-one favorite by fight night.The commentator recognized the importance of the victory. \u2018\u2018I can hear it already,\u2019\u2019 he sighed. \u2018\u2018Trudeau for leader.\u2019\u2019I asked the prime minister if the fight with Brass Knuckles Brazeau had been part of a larger plan \u2014 a piece of agitprop aimed at turning around his political fortunes, and with them the nation\u2019s. Trudeau gazed out the window for a moment, contemplating, then turned to me and offered a clipped nod and a sly smile. He knew perfectly well the power of symbols and had intended to exploit that power.\u2018\u2018I saw it that way a little bit,\u2019\u2019 he said, his voice betraying a distinct note of guile. \u2018\u2018The fight was going to be a way of highlighting and surprising people with what I am. It wasn\u2019t about proving anything to myself \u2014 other than perhaps as a reminder that I\u2019m very good at sticking to and executing a plan. But it was a way of pointing out to people that you shouldn\u2019t underestimate me \u2014 which people have a tendency to do.\u2019\u2019Riding in a motorcade as he had as a boy, but never as the center of attention, Trudeau chose his words carefully. \u2018\u2018There was a perception that I\u2019d grown up with a silver spoon in my mouth,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d boxed for 20 years on and off, so I knew that the worst-case scenario was that I was going to take a brutal beating but stay standing until at least near the end. I was confident I could take a punch. I knew I had the stamina to last three rounds. People were saying that maybe he was still smoking while he was training. I was absolutely focused on my training. One thing people are starting to realize is that I work incredibly hard at everything I set my mind to.\u2019\u2019One year later, the Liberal Party elected him leader, and two years after that, the country elected him prime minister. The scale of Trudeau\u2019s underdog victory was stunning: With a comfortable majority of 184 seats in Parliament, and Liberals in seats spread across the country, he won an undeniable national mandate. As he has managed the transition from campaigning to governing, he has presented an ambitious agenda: funding infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy, supporting programs to reduce childhood poverty, investigating the disappearance and murder of more than 1,000 First Nations women, introducing a rigorous carbon-capture policy, legalizing marijuana. The Canadian system does not have the same checks and balances among branches that the American system does, so Trudeau can implement his policies without being stymied by right-wing opposition.As an example of his thinking, Trudeau noted his decision to raise taxes on the top 1 percent of earners while lowering middle-class taxes, even as his government funds infrastructure improvements. He knew that Canada would run a deficit, which was unusual for a country known for fiscal probity, but he believed it was the way forward. \u2018\u2018Confident countries are willing to invest in the future,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau said, \u2018\u2018not always follow the conservative orthodoxy of balanced budgets at all costs.\u2019\u2019In the face of the Syrian refugee crisis, Trudeau had pledged to bring 25,000 civilians fleeing war to Canada by the end of the year \u2014 a cry that rallied the nation in his honeymoon days. The shootings in Paris didn\u2019t change this policy, but he has decided to slow the process to ensure it is orderly and safe. (By Jan. 1, 10,000 will be admitted.) But if the Paris or San Bernardino attacks had happened in Montreal or Winnipeg before the election, he may well have lost, an illustration of the fragility of democratic institutions in the age of terror. Trudeau said he wants Canada to be free from the politics of fear and division.\u2018\u2018When a mosque was vandalized in a small rural community in Cold Lake, Alberta \u2014 which is as conservative as you can imagine in Canada, with the stereotypes around that \u2014 the entire town came out the next day to scrub the graffiti off the walls and help them fix the damage,\u2019\u2019 Trudeau told me. \u2018\u2018Countries with a strong national identity \u2014 linguistic, religious or cultural \u2014 are finding it a challenge to effectively integrate people from different backgrounds. In France, there is still a typical citizen and an atypical citizen. Canada doesn\u2019t have that dynamic.\u2019\u2019Terrorist groups have specifically said they are targeting Canada and Canadians. And on the subject of national security, Trudeau\u2019s critics say he\u2019s a lightweight and a dangerous one. Trudeau\u2019s most radical argument is that Canada is becoming a new kind of state, defined not by its European history but by the multiplicity of its identities from all over the world. His embrace of a pan-cultural heritage makes him an avatar of his father\u2019s vision. \u2018\u2018There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,\u2019\u2019 he claimed. \u2018\u2018There are shared values \u2014 openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first postnational state.\u2019\u2019Stepping out of the S.U.V., eager to plunge into the crowd, Trudeau seemed like a man at the beginning of a very big, and very uncertain, journey. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m excited to be on the world stage,\u2019\u2019 he said, with peculiar Canadian understatement mixed with dynastic confidence. \u2018\u2018I think people are starting to see that I\u2019m actually reasonably fit for this office.\u2019\u2019Guy Lawson is the author of \u2018\u2018Arms and the Dudes: How Three Stoners Became the Most Unlikely Gun Runners in History.\u2019\u2019 A feature film based on the book will be released in August.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba Buying South China Morning Post, Aiming to Influence Media", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group, the Chinese Internet giant, is making an ambitious play to reshape media coverage of its home country, taking aim at what company executives call the \u201cnegative\u201d portrayal of China in the Western media.As the backbone of this effort, Alibaba agreed on Friday to buy the media assets of the SCMP Group, including one of Hong Kong\u2019s most influential English language daily newspapers, The South China Morning Post. Alibaba is acquiring an award-winning newspaper that for decades has reported aggressively on subjects that China\u2019s state-run media outlets are forbidden to cover, like political scandals and human-rights cases.Alibaba said the deal was fueled by a desire to improve China\u2019s image and offer an alternative to what it calls the biased lens of Western news outlets. While Alibaba said the Chinese government had no role in its deal to buy the Hong Kong newspaper, the company\u2019s position aligns closely with that of the Communist Party, which has grown increasingly critical of the way Western news organizations cover China.This coverage, the company said, influences how investors and others outside China regard Alibaba. The company said its shares, which are listed in New York, were being affected by all the negative reports about China.\u201cOur business is so rooted in China, and touches so many aspects of the Chinese economy, that when people don\u2019t really understand China and have the wrong perception of China, they also have a lot of misconceptions about Alibaba,\u201d Joseph C. Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman, said in an interview.\u201cWhat\u2019s good for China is also good for Alibaba,\u201d Mr. Tsai added. He echoed a phrase often attributed to the former head of General Motors: What\u2019s good for G.M. is good for America. Although some critics say it has turned increasingly pro-Beijing in recent years, The South China Morning Post has taken aim at controversial topics in China in recent years.For Alibaba, the financial stakes are not significant. Estimated to be worth $100 million, the deal represents a relatively small amount for a company with more than $12 billion in annual revenue.The bigger risk is reputational, as Alibaba leaps into the realm of politics. In owning The South China Morning Post, Alibaba will control a news organization that operates along a border that separates two systems, one in Hong Kong with a relatively free press and another in mainland China with strict censorship controls.As speculation of a deal began in recent weeks, some critics in Hong Kong had already started to worry about whether Alibaba was seeking to tame the paper\u2019s coverage in order to curry favor with the Chinese leadership.The newspaper, which is not subject to China\u2019s strict censorship rules, has long jumped into controversial issues on the mainland like covering the anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and last year\u2019s Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong. The newspaper has delved into scandals among China\u2019s elite, including Ling Jihua, who served as an aide to the former Chinese president Hu Jintao.Willy Lam, a political commentator and former editor at the South China Morning Post, said an Alibaba takeover would most likely exacerbate a trend at the paper toward self-censorship on sensitive political issues.Alibaba, however, said it had no intention of interfering with the day-to-day operations of the paper and would not censor articles. The company said it would ensure the paper\u2019s journalistic independence and integrity.\u201cWe\u2019ll operate on principles,\u201d said Mr. Tsai of Alibaba. \u201cWe\u2019ll let the editors make their judgment on what to publish and not to publish. I can\u2019t think of anything being off-limits.\u201dBut Mr. Tsai did not offer details about how Alibaba would execute its vision for more positive coverage on China without sacrificing editorial independence, two agendas that are seemingly at odds. He said that more \u201cfair and accurate\u201d articles would translate, over time, into a more positive image of the country.With a print circulation of 100,000, The South China Morning Post is relatively small. But the newspaper, which is 112 years old, has outsize influence in the West because of its proximity to China and its English language format.Since 1993, the SCMP Group has been controlled by the family of the Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok, who has extensive business interests in China through its control of the Kerry Group. The South China Morning Post was once controlled by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation.In addition to The South China Morning Post, Alibaba is also buying the SCMP Group\u2019s other media assets, including a portfolio of fashion, travel and lifestyle publications. (Starting in February, copies of The International New York Times for Hong Kong and China will be printed by The South China Morning Post.)But the SCMP Group, like many media operations around the world, is facing financial pressure. The newspaper\u2019s print circulation has dipped, and its profit growth has been lackluster.Alibaba said it planned to invest in the business, by expanding the staff and developing more digital ventures. The company is also looking to remove the website\u2019s paywall, granting free access to its content. (In 2013, another e-commerce giant, Jeffrey Bezos, the founder of Amazon, purchased The Washington Post.) Shares of Alibaba were 5.4 percent lower in trading on Wall Street Friday.Some free press advocates worry that a mainland entrepreneur could face intense pressure from the Chinese government to restrict news coverage or to follow directives of the propaganda arm of the Communist Party. In recent years, there have been growing concerns in Hong Kong that the Chinese government has asked entrepreneurs and advertisers to withdraw support of any publication that is deemed to be hostile to the Communist Party.\u201cAlibaba and Jack Ma have done a good job\u201d in \u201cmaintaining good relations with the power structure and not getting involved in politics,\u201d said Orville Schell, a director at the Asia Society, referring to Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman.\u201cBut buying a newspaper, particularly in Hong Kong, could be hazardous,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cChina is always tempted when things go wrong to take control.\u201dAlibaba\u2019s move reflects a broader evolution in China, as some of the country\u2019s biggest companies look to project a different image to the world.A number of Chinese companies have been making investments in overseas media, film studios and sports broadcasting rights. For instance, the Wanda Group, a company led by the billionaire Wang Jianlin, now controls AMC Entertainment, one of the biggest cinema chains in the United States.The SCMP deal builds on the enormous ambitions of Mr. Ma, who co-founded the company in 1999 and built it into an e-commerce goliath that is now valued at more than $200 billion.In recent years, the company has expanded into finance, film, online video and social media. The company has also acquired stakes in several domestic media properties, including China Business News. Alibaba also recently completed a deal to fully acquire the online video site Youku.com. (Yahoo, the American online media company, owns a 15 percent stake in Alibaba.)Behind the scenes, Eric X. Li, the prominent Shanghai-based venture capitalist who was an early investor in Youku, helped advise Alibaba on its acquisition of SCMP Group\u2019s media assets. Mr. Li has gained notoriety in recent years as a political commentator known for aggressively critiquing American-style democracy and extolling the virtues of the Communist Party, like China\u2019s leadership system.\u201cChina\u2019s re-emergence is perhaps the most consequential development for the world in the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Li said in an interview. \u201cMedia coverage of China in the West has been too ideological and biased.\u201dHe said Alibaba\u2019s ownership would \u201cgive the paper a unique and powerful vantage point to offer global readers a more pluralistic and realistic view of China.\u201dBig Chinese companies have been investing in media properties at a time when the country\u2019s authorities have been exerting greater control over the state-run news and social networking sites, as well as blocking access to overseas sites like Google and Facebook. The websites of several major news organizations, including The New York Times, have been blocked in China, amid government criticism that the Western media portrays the country in a negative and unfair way.In an interview, Mr. Tsai, tempered his critique, saying the Western media has done some outstanding reporting in China in recent years. But he and others at Alibaba felt many outlets have placed undue emphasis on government incompetence and negative portrayals of China\u2019s development.He said Alibaba wanted to deepen the world\u2019s understanding of China, by turning The South China Morning Post into a global platform for news about China.\u201cThere\u2019s very little downside. Even if we lose money, it won\u2019t be material,\u201d Mr. Tsai said. \u201cBut the upside is quite interesting.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of The South China Morning Post. The newspaper, founded in 1903, is 112 years old, not 113.A earlier picture caption accompanying this article misstated Jack Ma\u2019s title at Alibaba Group.

{"Headline": "For New York\u2019s Best New Public Sculpture, Thank the Sanitation Department", "Date": "2015-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookBut, of course, it was a bunch of wealthy neighbors complaining.After years of noisy protests, the New York City Department of Sanitation\u2019s new garage-and-salt-shed complex has opened in Hudson Square, on the northern edge of TriBeCa. The project took nearly a decade and cost a king\u2019s ransom. Luxury apartment developers in the neighborhood predicted Armageddon. Instead, apartment prices went through the roof. The garage and shed have ended up being not just two of the best examples of new public architecture in the city but a boon to the neighborhood, whether the wealthy neighbors have come around to it or not. I can\u2019t think of a better public sculpture to land in New York than the shed.There are a couple of larger lessons here. They are not so much about Nimbyism, but about how residents of a neighborhood react when faced with development absent real planning, and about why it makes sense, economically and in terms of public health and social justice, for disparate communities to share burdens like parking for sanitation trucks.At issue was not a stinky garbage-processing plant. The garage, at West and Spring Streets, was always to be just a place to park, fuel, repair and clean sanitation trucks, more than 150 of them, with the shed, across Spring Street, used as a storehouse for some 5,000 tons of salt to clear roads after snowstorms. The site was hardly a charmer: It used to be divided between a United Parcel Service truck lot and an old, much smaller sanitation building. When there was not enough room to park, idling vehicles often spilled out, blocking traffic.Still, opponents imagined something worse arising, and rallied to cancel or at least shrink the project. They argued that the garage should not be housing trucks for three Manhattan districts. The fight became one of the toughest urban land-use battles of the Bloomberg era.These fins reduce heat and glare, block views of the trucks inside, as neighbors demanded \u2014 and calm the facade, unifying the garage\u2019s exterior. Decades ago, the Sanitation Department painted all its trucks white, conveying a message of cleanliness; the fins take a similar tack, giving the garage the appearance of a shiny machine. To create an impression that the building is not so massive, the architects have rested the upper glassed-in stories atop a dark-brick ground floor that is set slightly back, so that the garage seems almost to float on its base. Subtly angled, it opens up views to the Hudson River from the street. A green, sloped roof captures rainwater to clean the trucks. It\u2019s a pity the roof isn\u2019t open to the public. It\u2019s lovely.Then there was the rezoning of Hudson Square in general, which paved the way for even more luxury buildings.The situation brings to mind the protests underway in Brooklyn, where residents are up in arms about a range of proposed projects, including two residential towers that would rise at Pier 6 in Brooklyn Bridge Park, a hulking redevelopment on a former hospital site in Cobble Hill and the replacement of the low-rise Brooklyn Heights library branch with a market-rate condo tower where a smaller library is to be tucked into the ground floor.Individually, there may be economic logic behind each of these developments. But local residents fret about the overcrowding of public schools, strains on public transit, the loss of emergency medical services and more waves of gentrification even as City Hall lacks an effective master plan to coordinate growth. Instead, there are just piecemeal, opportunistic proposals.City leaders would be wise to guarantee that additional schools, parks and other sites and services that neighborhood residents actually want are provided in return for the increases in density or other changes the government seeks. But that\u2019s not how New York operates.So, no surprise, neighborhoods greet nearly all change with hostility, one of the larger lessons of the sanitation project.The other?No neighborhood welcomes a sanitation facility. That said, city residents depend on the Sanitation Department not just to keep streets and sidewalks clean and safe but to respond in crises like Hurricane Sandy and the 2001 terrorist attacks. On Sept. 11, 2001, sanitation trucks blocked incoming traffic on bridges and tunnels. Distributing sanitation projects equitably across the city also reduces the miles driven, which lowers carbon dioxide emissions and improves air quality.Environmental justice advocates agreed that the Spring Street site was a no-brainer.In retrospect, it was a kind of savior, too, ensuring that a valuable piece of property facing the river would not turn into another skyscraper blocking light and further upsetting the scale and historic character of the neighborhood. The community opposition, along with demands by the city\u2019s Public Design Commission for improvements, drove up construction costs for the salt shed but also helped keep the height of the garage to five stories, in line with neighboring warehouses, despite the Sanitation Department\u2019s plea for another story. And it helped keep the focus on good architecture.That\u2019s the other lesson here, about shared responsibility and quality design. Opponents of the sanitation project in Hudson Square may not have gotten exactly what they wanted. But they were fortunate.They got something better.An earlier version of the headline with this article referred imprecisely to the site of the complex. It is on the northern edge of TriBeCa, not in TriBeCa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Passes $1.8 Trillion Spending Measure", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After years of dysfunction and abysmal public approval ratings, a chastened, even beaten-down Congress on Friday passed a $1.8 trillion package of spending and tax cuts with remarkably little rancor.The relatively swift passage of the prodigious year-end package \u2014 by wide margins in the House and in the Senate \u2014 in many respects showed lawmakers bowing to the hard realities of a divided government.President Obama quickly signed the measure, praised Mr. Ryan for his work and acknowledged the sacrifice of his predecessor as speaker, John A. Boehner, for also making the accord possible.\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve gotten kind of used to last-minute crises and shutdown threats, and so forth,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference. \u201cAnd this is a messy process that doesn\u2019t satisfy everybody completely, but it\u2019s more typical of American democracy. And I think that Speaker Ryan deserves a role in that.\u201dThe agreement also showed just how easily a fractious legislature can seem functional again when there is agreement to spend more money, adding at least $2 trillion in debt over the next 20 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan group.For Republican leaders in Congress, there was particular motivation to show that they were capable of governing.Mr. McConnell also took credit for ending the threats of a government shutdown or default on the debt that some Republicans, particularly House conservatives, had embraced as a way to pressure the Obama administration. Democrats, however, were not readily willing to give credit.While Mr. Ryan succeeded in winning a majority of Republican votes for the huge spending and tax-break package, adding to his string of successes in recent weeks, the House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, insisted that Republicans came on board only because of a recently added provision to end a 40-year ban on crude oil exports.\u201cThey wanted big oil so much that they give away the store,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in an interview, adding: \u201cI feel almost jubilant about what is in this appropriations bill.\u201dAfter a period of belt-tightening in Washington \u2014 including automatic budget cuts imposed in 2013 \u2014 the spending measure for 2016 provides a notable $66 billion increase in federal outlays above previously agreed-upon limits, divided equally between military and nonmilitary programs.It also represents a return to a more traditional appropriations process, with lawmakers directing money to an array of their priorities, including a $1.4 billion increase for military construction projects and $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, as well as an array of individual items that some lawmakers were still discovering buried in the 2,009-page spending bill.In keeping with a bipartisan compromise, hashed out in an era of divided government and deep-rooted philosophical differences, all sides claimed victory.In concrete, and personal terms, the approval of the legislation capped several weeks of early successes for Mr. Ryan, perhaps the most notable being how he has calmed the restive caucus that ousted Mr. Boehner as the House speaker. After ushering through major highway and education bills that had lingered on the congressional agenda for months, Mr. Ryan, who is the former chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, pushed through the major tax-break package that many Democrats opposed.\u201cWe passed more major legislation in a few weeks than we have in a few years,\u201d Mr. Ryan said moments after the vote.In the House, which approved the tax breaks on Thursday, the vote Friday morning on the spending measure was 316 to 113, with 150 Republicans and 166 Democrats supporting the bill.The Senate followed with uncharacteristic alacrity. In expedited floor action, on the edge of the holiday recess, the Senate voted to end debate on the overall legislation, dispensed with several procedural steps, and approved the package. The vote was 65 to 33.The spending measure includes some major policy provisions, including the reauthorization and expansion of benefits from emergency workers suffering from health problems related to their work responding to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York.In response to concern raised partly by recent terrorist attacks, the spending measure requires more vigorous security checks as part of the visa-waiver program, used by millions of visitors to enter the United States under an expedited process. The package also incorporates legislation that expands the sharing of information between private firms and federal security agencies to prevent cyberattacks.Still, some Democrats warned that the tax package would have long-term consequences.\u201cThis bill is even referred to as a Christmas tree bill because special interests get special presents, all in ornaments on this tree,\u201d Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said in a speech on the House floor on Thursday.Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a member of the Appropriations Committee, managed much of the floor debate for Republicans and said that all lawmakers could find items to support or oppose in such a huge spending and tax-break package.\u201cThere is much to be proud of in this 2,000-page bill and accompanying explanatory statement,\u201d Mr. Cole said.In the Senate, leaders in each party expressed support for the deal.\u201cThis legislation helps our economy, helps our national security, and strikes more blows to a partisan health law that hurts the middle class,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor.At a news conference later, Mr. McConnell noted that immediately after winning the majority last November, he had promised there would be no shutdown or default. \u201cI wanted to end those kinds of rattling experiences that the American people don\u2019t like,\u201d he said, \u201cand never produces a positive result anyway.\u201dBut shortly after his remarks, Mr. McConnell went to the floor and secured an agreement for a fast-track series of votes on Friday morning \u2014 a process that Mr. Rubio could have blocked but did not, much to the relief of his Senate colleagues eager to begin their holiday recess.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Set to Devalue Its Currency", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlfonso Prat-Gay, the finance minister in Mr. Macri\u2019s center-right government, announced the immediate scrapping of currency controls on Wednesday night, the precursor to a probable plunge of the peso Thursday morning.\u201cLifting these barriers that have halted the economy for many years will kick it along the path to growth,\u201d Mr. Prat-Gay told reporters. The moves are aimed at bolstering an economy predicted to grow by 0.4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Yet the devaluation is likely to mean hardship in the short term for many Argentines as prices shoot up. It subsequently risks stirring social unrest in a nation where large street protests are commonplace and trade union leaders are influential.\u201cThis is going to affect me because my salary is not going to keep up,\u201d said Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez, 24, who earns about $715 a month for delivering cosmetics to stores here.\u201cMacri doesn\u2019t care about the middle class; he only aspires to favor the rich,\u201d he added, doubting whether the actions of the new president, who is from a wealthy family, would ever benefit him.Mr. Prat-Gay said that the policies were geared toward ending poverty, one of Mr. Macri\u2019s campaign promises.\u201cThe devaluation was inevitable,\u201d said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, a former deputy economy minister and director of LCG, a consultancy in Buenos Aires. \u201cThe economy wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201dMrs. Kirchner, who saw the gains of a devaluation nearly two years ago vitiated by inflation, left another devaluation to her successor because the political cost was too high, Mr. Rossi added. Some economists expect Mr. Macri\u2019s changes to result in a recession or anemic growth next year, followed by a rebound in 2017 of about 3 percent.Pointing to tensions between supporters of Mr. Macri and supporters of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s party, which proposed more gradual economic changes, Axel Kicillof, a lawmaker and Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s former economy minister, warned this week, \u201cBrusque devaluations bring great disarray.\u201dThe exchange rate is officially 9.8 pesos per dollar, but because of the unpopular controls that limit access to dollars, they sell in a black market for about 14.5 pesos.The devaluation will especially benefit Argentina\u2019s influential farmers, who have been hoarding stocks of grain harvests for export, like soy, as they speculated about the move. Mr. Prat-Gay said the government had agreed to a deal with them to liquidate billions of dollars in stocks over the next three weeks.An article on Thursday about a move by Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, to devalue the nation\u2019s currency misstated, in some editions, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s forecast for Argentina\u2019s economy and the name of the Buenos Aires consultancy where Gast\u00f3n Rossi, a former deputy economy minister who said the devaluation was inevitable, is a director. The economy is predicted to grow \u2014 not shrink \u2014 by 0.4 percent this year, and Mr. Rossi works at LCG, not LSG.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tourists, and Buyers, Roll Back Into Portuguese Coast", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new wave of optimism is surging along the Algarve, the southernmost stretch of the Portuguese coastline. The national economy is showing signs of recovery from the steep slump dating from the 2008 global financial crisis, and the unemployment rate is falling. An increase in visitors last year, of 11.9 percent over 2013, showed that tourists were returning, and so are property buyers. Though Portugal is still heavily burdened with debt, the government exited the International Monetary Fund bailout plan in 2014 and has put measures in place to encourage investment. Chief among these is the Golden Visa, introduced in 2012, which allows non-European Union citizens to obtain a five-year residency permit by investing at least 500,000 euros, or $560,000, in Portuguese property. To date, an estimated \u20ac1.46 billion has moved into the country as a result. In addition, the government introduced in 2009 a tax system for non-habitual residents, or non-Portuguese who have not lived in Portugal in the previous five years. Under certain criteria, this allows specified types of global income, including pensions, to be exempt from income tax for 10 years. Demand for property in popular locations, such as Lisbon and the Algarve, is now causing a shortage of stock. As a result, development projects on the south coast that have been set aside for years are emerging onto the market.\u201cIt took us by surprise,\u201d said Francisco Sottomayor, a local agent for CBRE, a property firm. \u201cTwo years ago we expected a recovery, but we didn\u2019t anticipate it would start improving this fast.\u201d Among the new projects is Phase 2 of the Vilamoura resort. At 700 hectares, or 1,730 acres, it is one of the largest purpose-built tourism complexes in Europe, with around 10,000 residents and 500,000 annual visitors. Previously the property of a Spanish bank, it has not undergone any significant expansion in a decade and was bought in April by the American private equity firm Lone Star Funds. Founded in the 1960s, the resort is well established, with residences, retailers, leisure facilities and a world-class marina. New plans include the construction of a cutting-edge yacht club and more upscale retail, restaurant and hotel projects. \u201cVilamoura is well known in Europe but less so elsewhere,\u201d said Paul Taylor, chief executive of the resort. \u201cWe want to increase its global prominence and that of the Algarve.\u201d Lone Star is making 18 build sites available to international developers at Vilamoura on 400 hectares of undeveloped land. The result will be a variety of mixed-use plans, with each featuring a specified number of residential products and amenities, built around a central focal point, such as a fitness zone, golf course or lake. Properties will take the form of villa and condominium developments, aimed at different international markets. The expansion of Vilamoura is accompanied by the release of further development elsewhere in the region. \u201cThere is a real buzz here now,\u201d said Tim Robinson, a local businessman and owner of a boutique hotel, Fazenda Nova, 24 kilometers, or 15 miles, east of the town of Faro. \u201cThere are more houses being built or renovated, and an increase in non-Portuguese, particularly French but also British and Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cHousing stock is depleted, and prices are rising. Every week we receive hotel guests interested in buying property locally.\u201dIn the nearby resort of Quinta do Lago, a prime golf destination with a global reputation, development has also picked up significantly. The resort management sells residential sites and resale villas and apartments. \u201cThere is currently an unprecedented level of development in the resort,\u201d said Jamie Robinson, Quinta do Lago\u2019s property sales director.\u201cUntil this year, properties were sitting on the market for months. By the end of 2015 we predict sales will be 40 percent up on where we\u2019d budgeted,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter dipping 20 percent post the 2008 crash, values are now only 5 percent off their 2006 peak.\u201dQuinta do Lago is regarded as a benchmark resort in the region. It attracts an older, wealthier demographic that can pay from \u20ac300,000 for an apartment to \u20ac8 million for a substantial villa. Selling prices are at least 30 percent higher than those in nearby resorts. Quinta do Lago\u2019s most recent initiative is San Lorenzo North, which came to market in late 2014 and is the first new release since 2000. The development site has 26 plots, of which 20 remain. Prices start at \u20ac2.3 million for a plot of 2,200 square meters, or 23,600 square feet, rising to \u20ac3.3 million for 3,000 square meters. Owners must build their villas within two years, as speculative ownership is not allowed. Several plots have been bought by developers to complete and sell on. Further land releases include Ria Formosa, named after the national park on the Algarve coast, which will have 13 plots averaging 1,300 square meters. This represents the last of the available land for new construction and will come to market once San Lorenzo North is completed, in around four years.The resort, which is rumored to be on the market with a price tag of \u20ac220 million, has had significant upgrades. These include the remodeling of its north golf course and introducing a new sports center and quality restaurants and retail outlets. According to Mark Lenherr, managing director of local development firm E3 Property, Faro airport, which serves the Algarve, does not yet have the required international routes to encourage non-European Union investment. \u201cFaro is great for traveling across Europe but not for markets such as the Middle East or Asia,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get a wider international base, there needs to be improved air access.\u201d Plans to remodel and expand the airport terminal were announced in September. The government has also instigated a program of road building, which has reduced journey times along the coast.Mr. Lenherr\u2019s firm is behind The Keys, a development of prime properties on land acquired from Quinta Do Lago. Phases 2 and 3 were on hold through the economic downturn, while Phase 1, Key Largo, which was already in development, began selling in early September. Key Largo has 48 villas and 24 apartments, priced from \u20ac2.5 million for apartments and from \u20ac4.2 million for villas of 560 square meters. \u201cThe Algarve isn\u2019t considered as glamorous as the South of France or Marbella, in Spain, but it has equally good fundamentals,\u201d Mr. Lenherr said. \u201cYear-round good weather, great infrastructure, stability and security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Fed\u2019s Interest Rate Move, a Test of the Stock Markets", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe extraordinarily low interest rates of the last seven years have stoked a bull market in stocks, fueled a global boom in commodities, prompted a wave of corporate mergers and led companies to borrow trillions of dollars in the markets.Longtime Wall Street analysts and traders said that they could never remember a time when an increase in interest rates had gotten so much attention.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the Fed get a bigger spotlight than today,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of his own investment firm.Some analysts said the scrutiny was warranted, because, they contended, the Fed may be raising the cost of borrowing too soon.\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting point in history; the Fed has never had to make a decision like this,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, who was working on Wall Street in the early 1980s, when the Fed drove interest rates sharply higher under very different economic conditions.Investors widely expected the Fed to increase interest rates on Wednesday, and they piled into the market after digesting the comments of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, at a news conference.Stocks rose broadly Wednesday afternoon. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a benchmark favored by investment professionals, rose 29.66 points, or 1.45 percent, to 2,073.07, giving it a slight gain for the year. Every sector in the index, but one, energy, advanced. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 224.18 points, to 17,749.09, and the Nasdaq composite closed up 75.78 points, at 5,071.13.The stock market slumped in the summer in response to fears of a slowdown in global growth. If the S.&P. 500 ends ahead for 2015, it would be its seventh consecutive year of gains, an astonishing run in a time of subpar economic growth.There was a muted response in bond markets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, rose slightly, to 2.30 percent from 2.27 percent on Tuesday, still low by historical standards.The belief that the Fed was doing much to stimulate the economy instilled confidence among investors in the difficult years after the financial crisis of 2008. The Fed\u2019s support helped mute the volatility of United States markets for long periods. Markets kept rising, and Wall Street kept selling debt and doing deals.Yet even as markets climbed, investors fretted over the impact of higher interest rates.Such nervousness first hit stock and bond markets in developing countries, which exploited the low interest rates to borrow heavily. The worries surfaced closer to home in recent weeks, in the market for junk bonds, which has been rocked by a wave of selling. Last week, a mutual fund that invested in risky debt decided to bar investors from withdrawing their money.Investors are now debating whether rising interest rates \u2014 the Fed is expected to increase them at least a couple more times next year \u2014 will cause turbulence in other markets. A broad pullback on Wall Street could restrict the flow of credit into the economy, potentially slowing hiring and wage growth. A decline in stocks could damage the financial standing of households, whose holdings of stocks have increased in value by over $5 trillion since 2009.The Fed itself closely watches for signs that disruptions in the markets are spilling into the economy, something Ms. Yellen underscored on Wednesday. If changes in financial conditions affected the Fed\u2019s outlook for the economy, she said that \u201cwe would, of course, take them into account.\u201dAnd the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, which raised the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, said in its statement that it would raise rates further only if it were justified by economic conditions, a message that will soothe Wall Street.\u201cThe committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\u201d the statement said.Some critics of the Fed\u2019s monetary largess have asserted that it stirred up a huge amount of financial activity that may fall off sharply as soon as borrowing costs go up.Since 2008, United States mergers and acquisitions have totaled over $8 trillion, while United States companies have sold over $11 trillion of debt to investors, according to data from Thomson Reuters. United States stocks, measured by the S.&P. 500 index, have been in a bull market for 81 months, the third-longest since at least the 1930s.One school of bearish investors says stock valuations are expensive and there is evidence of unsustainable speculation, particularly in Silicon Valley. Such conditions, they say, can leave markets vulnerable to even small increases in the cost of borrowing. The Fed, for instance, increased interest rates steadily in 1999 and 2000, when there was also fervor for technology investments. The stock market then lost nearly half its value.Other analysts say the conditions that the Fed must now grapple with are in many ways unique.Inflation shows no signs of reaching levels that would force the Fed to slam on the brakes, a reaction that nearly always roils markets. Yet at the same time, the analysts contend that the economy and corporations appear to lack fundamental strengths that are needed to keep stocks moving higher.\u201cYellen is doing this interest-rate hike without any buffer,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so different from other cycles.\u201d The concern is that companies will now struggle to meet expected earnings targets, and investors will dump stocks in response.But Ms. Yellen expressed doubt about the notion that the current expansion is destined to slow the older it gets.\u201cI think it\u2019s a myth that expansions die of old age,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Paris Climate Talks, Top French Envoy Tries to Avoid Mistakes of Past Hosts", "Date": "2015-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe lighting must be soft, it must make people feel comfortable,\u201d she said in an interview before the meeting. Sure enough, each work space at the gathering \u2014 which is taking place in a complex of temporarily converted airplane hangars and tents \u2014 is illuminated by a gracefully curved table lamp, casting a gentle glow.Ms. Tubiana\u2019s attention to such details comes on top of 18 months of near-constant world travel and hundreds of hours of official meetings, as she has sought to build behind-the-scenes support for what the French government hopes will be a historic new global accord to curb climate change.Ultimately, the negotiations here, which are scheduled to conclude Friday, will succeed or fail on the substance of the agreement among 195 countries and the European Union. But it is widely acknowledged that the host government plays a crucial role in the outcome.As France\u2019s climate change ambassador to the United Nations, it is Ms. Tubiana\u2019s charge to structure the talks, and to act as a go-between, mediator and broker of deals. A successful deal could commit nearly every country on earth to enacting plans to cut its planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution, and could trigger a fundamental shift from fossil fuels to clean energy sources throughout the global economy.Privately, Ms. Tubiana has told colleagues that she feels as if she is holding the weight of the entire negotiations on her shoulders.She knows what failure looks like. The Paris talks are essentially a do-over of a much-hyped 2009 summit meeting in Copenhagen, where world leaders personally tried to hammer out a similar treaty. But the meeting collapsed in acrimony as countries failed to reach a deal with any legal force.While multiple factors contributed to the Copenhagen meltdown, many participants said part of the blame went to the Danish government. The Danish hosts were excoriated as rigid, secretive and uncreative in running the talks. The hourslong security lines, bad convention center food and mood of confrontational brinkmanship did not help deal-making. Indeed, at least two major academic papers have concluded that poor diplomacy by the Danes was a major contributor to the failure of the Copenhagen talks. Ms. Tubiana says she wants to avoid what she calls a Copenhagen-style \u201cpsychodrama\u201d in Paris. To do that, she has deployed every tool available to a French diplomat, including a nearly unparalleled global network of embassies and consulates, her longstanding personal friendships in government and academia and the lure of French food and wine.In many ways, Ms. Tubiana, 64, is a classic Parisienne intellectual. A political scientist who has taught for years at the prestigious French university Sciences Po in Paris, and at Columbia University in New York, her academic background spans economics, environmental policy and international development. She has worked on government, financial and academic boards in places like India and China and at institutions like the World Bank.But her personal background informs her diplomacy on climate change, for which perhaps the toughest question is how to bridge the gap between the developed and the developing worlds. Born in Algeria to a Jewish Berber father and a Catholic Greek-French mother, Ms. Tubiana moved with her family to France when she was 11.Seven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.\u201cI grew up with a very international background,\u201d she said in an interview during the United Nations General Assembly in New York in October. \u201c Not being from one sector of society gives me perspective. I feel a link to developing nations, to all sides of this debate.\u201dIn person, Ms. Tubiana is chic and charming, with a touch of bohemian to her personal style, which runs from perfectly cut diplomats\u2019 suits to designer jeans, high-heeled blue suede boots and chunky silver necklaces collected from her travels to places like North Africa and New Delhi.Ms. Tubiana was appointed her government\u2019s senior climate envoy in 2014 by the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, who is serving as the president of the conference, with the directive to do everything necessary to yield a successful outcome here. She sought to engage other countries on the talks early and often, and reached out to her international network of academics, many of whom are influential in shaping their governments\u2019 positions in the talks.And she deployed a powerful diplomatic tool: the legion of elegant French embassies around the world, whose origins go back to the days when France was one of the most powerful forces in international relations. She had the embassies hold regular dinners and salons with key players in each country \u2014 lawmakers, but also business leaders, journalists and even opponents of climate policy.Ms. Tubiana and her friend Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, who stand out as the two most prominent women in the talks, have a shared joke about how to navigate the process of building consensus among nearly 200 governments.\u201cClimate change is about ecosystems,\u201d Ms. Tubiana said. \u201cClimate change negotiations are about ego-systems.\u201d The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Her diplomatic strategy appears to be working. \u201cShe\u2019s quite extraordinary,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, an expert on international climate change negotiations with the World Resources Institute, a research organization. \u201cShe\u2019s a subject expert with long, deep relationships with people in the developed and developing world. The mix of deep, substantive knowledge combined with the machine of French diplomacy behind her has helped the process tremendously.\u201dShe added, \u201cFrench diplomacy is about nuance and cooperation, rather than blunt, direct confrontation.\u201dTodd Stern, the senior climate change envoy for the United States, said Ms. Tubiana had been instrumental in moving the process and people toward a deal. \u201cThis is an incredibly hard job, and she doesn\u2019t come to the job as a deeply seasoned professional diplomat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut using her think tank background, and the signature French Embassy events \u2014 it all affects the larger buy-in to Paris.\u201dNow, as the Paris talks go into their second week and move more rapidly toward the adoption or rejection of a global agreement, Ms. Tubiana is constantly navigating, negotiating and trying to broker deals. To move quickly between meetings with parties, she rides a small electric golf cart, labeled the \u201cTubiana-mobile.\u201dAll that outreach is building good will, said Ajay Mathur, a climate negotiator from India, a country that will be important to the success or failure of the talks.India, the world\u2019s third-largest greenhouse gas polluter, is pushing for the accord to legally require rich countries like the United States to write checks to help poor countries adapt to climate change. Mr. Stern firmly rejects that proposal.As Ms. Tubiana tries to create a bridge across that divide, Mr. Mathur said he gave \u201cfull marks\u201d to the French for their efforts. \u201cThe French understand that success to a very large extent depends on how the presidency deals with the parties.\u201dStill, at the end of this week, each country will push for what it wants, Mr. Mathur said. \u201cWe, the parties, are a cussed group,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have crossed the first hump, but getting to the end will be difficult.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Deal Is Signal to Industry: The Era of Carbon Reduction Is Here", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf nothing else, analysts and experts say, the accord is a signal to businesses and investors that the era of carbon reduction has arrived.\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to go backward from something like this,\u201d said Nancy Pfund, managing partner of DBL Partners, a venture capital firm that focuses on social, environmental and economic development. \u201cPeople are boarding this train, and it\u2019s time to hop on if you want to have a thriving, 21st-century economy.\u201dWall Street is clearly paying attention.Top executives from Bank of America, Citibank and Goldman Sachs dropped by the Paris talks or related side events, as did philanthropist business leaders like Bill Gates and Richard Branson. Chief executives of blue-chip companies like Coca-Cola, DuPont, General Mills, HP and Unilever all expressed support for an ambitious deal.\u201cThe policy developed from these commitments will bring better market certainty to investors and open up significant opportunities,\u201d Jack Ehnes, chief executive of the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said last week.But not all business representatives embraced the accord and resistance to new policies appears inevitable. \u201cThe Paris climate conference delivered more of the same \u2014 lots of promises and lots of issues still left unresolved,\u201d Stephen D. Eule of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement, noting that the agreement is not legally binding.Some energy experts said that without a multinational carbon tax or other pricing of carbon, which was not specified in the agreement, the hopes of environmentalists for a true sea change that will curb climate change remain challenged.Still, there are examples of industries changing their practices.Automakers, under intense pressure to meet strict American fuel economy standards, have hastened the trend toward smaller engines, and have increased investments in hybrid and electric vehicles.Last week, Ford Motor said it would invest $4.5 billion on 13 new electric vehicle models by 2020 \u2014 even though sales of alternative-fuel models are still a fraction of the market.\u201cWe\u2019re doing it for two reasons,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday. \u201cOne is that people love electric vehicles when they try them, and secondly the regulatory requirements are hard to meet.\u201d\u201cCapital markets react to logic,\u201d said Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, which seeks to focus investor attention on the financial risks of climate change.Looming over the carbon pollution issue, though, is China. Just as it became the world\u2019s biggest carbon emitter as its economy surged, it is moving aggressively to implement climate control measures, including plans for a national carbon trading market in 2017.\u201cThe policy makers have given a very clear sign to the companies,\u201d that have already begun expanding investment in clean energy and energy efficiency, said Yu Qingchan, the climate change program coordinator at the Global Environmental Institute, a nonprofit in Beijing.Two provinces, Hubei and Guangdong, and five metropolitan areas \u2014 Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin and Shenzhen \u2014 already have their own pilot programs for carbon trading by large enterprises. Big companies in these areas have tended to be more positive about national limits on greenhouse gas emissions.One corporate leader in curbing emissions has been the Hubei Yihua Group, a large fertilizer producer in Hubei province, where a provincial carbon trading program has developed rapidly. Cai Zhong, the company\u2019s assistant general manager, welcomed the Paris accord.\u201cThe fact that the Paris agreement on climate change was eventually agreed upon,\u201d Mr. Cai said, \u201cwe believe is good news for the world and for China.\u201dNot surprisingly, among the most enthusiastic supporters have been executives of the renewable companies.Tom Werner, chief executive of SunPower, the large solar manufacturer and developer based in California, said the agreement would help open the investment taps for Africa and countries like India, where access to capital for large projects has been limited.\u201cThere are so many countries participating that it opens up new markets to solar that weren\u2019t that aggressive,\u201d he said. Michael Skelly, president of Clean Line Energy Partners, a Houston-based company that develops long-haul transmission lines for renewable energy, saw the accord as a pivot point for a changing industry.He pointed to the investments that the United States made during the last century in its power grid and hydroelectric power. \u201cBoth have provided low-cost electricity in the ensuing decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2050, we will look back at the investments prompted by the Paris accords and see exactly the same phenomena.\u201dStanley Reed, Diane Cardwell, Melissa Eddy, Sewell Chan, Bill Vlasic and Jad Mouawad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghans See Taliban as a Key to U.S. Aid Projects, Study Finds", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWorryingly, stabilization programming actually had the perverse effect of increasing support for the Taliban in Taliban-controlled villages,\u201d said the study, carried out for U.S.A.I.D. by Management Systems International, an agency contractor. Qala Nazir Bab and Zoya were among 13 villages where support for the Taliban increased, according to the study, which was released in April.Senior officials from the aid agency, defending their projects, said the Afghan villages mentioned in the study represented a small proportion of those that have received American assistance.\u201cWe worked in 5,000 villages over five years, and in the vast majority we saw an increased support for the government,\u201d said Jason Foley, the deputy assistant to the administrator in the agency\u2019s office of Afghanistan and Pakistan affairs.The programs provide a case study of the kind of problems that have plagued the effort to aid Afghanistan in what is now America\u2019s longest war. Since the United States\u2019 invasion of the country after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it has spent nearly $110 billion on assistance programs there, for military training and equipment for the Afghan Army as well as for other security services and civilian aid projects like the construction of schools, hospitals and highways, according to a recent report by John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.At least one-fifth of the country is controlled or contested by the Taliban.Critics say that the United States has poured so much money into Afghanistan with so little supervision that the assistance programs have distorted the Afghan economy and have had unintended consequences. Corruption has been rampant.\u201cWe spent too much money too fast in too small a country with too little oversight,\u201d said Mr. Sopko, who has issued a series of scathing reports about waste, fraud and abuse in aid projects.Like many other aid programs in Afghanistan, the stabilization programs suffered from basic problems. Many current and former aid officials and contractors had examples of those problems, but agreed to describe them only if they could remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak about them.For instance, several said, U.S.A.I.D. officials, who could not visit the project sites for security reasons, sometimes did not know whether the projects had even been completed.\u201cU.S.A.I.D. came to us and said, \u2018We can\u2019t find our projects,\u2019\u201d said one person involved with the study evaluating the two stabilization programs. \u201cAnd they asked us to help find them. We realized that there was a lot of ghosting in the data. We would go through the data they would give us on the location of a project and try to find where there really was a project, whether it was in a nearby village. And sometimes we couldn\u2019t find anything.\u201dAnother American official who was involved with the evaluation of the aid agency\u2019s programs said, \u201cOversight is really tough when you can\u2019t get out to the project sites.\u201dThe official added: \u201cThe money is going out, but it\u2019s hard to track. A lot of projects got captured by Afghans who steered aid to where they wanted it to go, to their villages.\u201dManagement of the stabilization programs has sometimes been so loose, said one former official at the aid agency, that local Taliban leaders have been able to submit requests, through local Afghan intermediaries, for American aid projects for Taliban-controlled villages, and have had their requests approved.In order to reduce the waste and corruption that had tainted previous Afghan aid programs, the agency funded the stabilization projects directly, without going through the Afghan government. Some Afghan government officials were angry that they were cut out, and they sometimes forced delays in the projects, according to several current and former United States officials and Afghans who were involved in the program.\u201cThe Afghan government did not want this program,\u201d another official said. \u201cThey would often not cooperate with us in getting basic services for villagers.\u201dBut even the critics acknowledge that when the U.S.A.I.D.-funded projects were concentrated in the same place, they had some success, current and former officials said. \u201cI do believe that we were able to accomplish some degree of stabilization in certain areas where we took a clustered approach, and where we had a sustained presence,\u201d said W. Douglas Smith, a former official with the agency in Afghanistan.More often, however, the stabilization projects have been thinly scattered among villages still contested by the Taliban. Development projects should be concentrated in relatively secure areas where they can gain permanence and solidify support for the government over the long term, critics charge.\u201cWe got confused,\u201d said Andrew Wilder, an analyst at the United States Institute for Peace, who has conducted studies of the effectiveness of reconstruction projects in Afghanistan. \u201cWe fooled ourselves into thinking that money could stabilize the situation, rather than create instability.\u201d\u201cTrying to redirect a lot of development assistance to achieve security objectives instead of development objectives was a major cause of waste,\u201d Mr. Wilder added.Far from providing security, stabilization aid projects in villages that were not under Taliban control often led to increased violence from the Taliban, the study found.In the face of the internal evaluation and a chorus of outside criticism, the future of the stabilization aid program is in doubt. Even as top administration officials continue to publicly defend it, the aid agency, according to sources who did not want to be identified, plans on redirecting funds to development projects in more secure areas of Afghanistan.\u201cU.S.A.I.D. has gradually shifted away from a focus on stabilization towards long-term capacity building,\u201d said Ben Edwards, a spokesman for the agency. \u201cThroughout the course of U.S.A.I.D.\u2019s stabilization programs in Afghanistan,\u201d he added, \u201cwe monitored our programs regularly and conducted midterm evaluations which led to changes in programming and improved our impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW Says Emissions Cheating Was Not a One-Time Error", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHans-Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the chairman of Volkswagen\u2019s supervisory board, said the cheating took place in a climate of lax ethical standards.\u201cThere was a tolerance for breaking the rules,\u201d Mr. P\u00f6tsch said here on Thursday during his first lengthy news conference since the company admitted in September that 11 million cars with diesel engines were rigged to fool emissions tests. The fallout from that decision has confronted Volkswagen with \u201cthe biggest test\u201d in its history, Mr. P\u00f6tsch said.Mr. P\u00f6tsch and Matthias M\u00fcller, the chief executive of Volkswagen, presented the results so far of an internal inquiry that is still underway. Although the company is not ready to identify culprits, the preliminary findings confirmed widespread suspicion that the scandal occurred because the company\u2019s ambitions in the United States collided with air quality rules that were, and still are, more stringent than Europe\u2019s.\u201cIt proves not to have been a one-time error, but rather a chain of errors that were allowed to happen,\u201d Mr. P\u00f6tsch said on Thursday.The wrongdoing began in 2005, Volkswagen said, when the company decided to make diesel cars the focus of its United States marketing. Volkswagen saw diesel, which it promoted as delivering superior fuel economy and acceleration, as a way to set itself apart from competitors.In the years that preceded a marketing push that began with the 2009 model year, there was an intense internal debate about what kind of emissions technology to use, according to a former executive who was involved and asked not to be identified because he did not want to offend Volkswagen.Some Volkswagen managers argued in favor of using a technology called selective catalytic reduction, or S.C.R. That method uses a urea chemical solution, sold commercially as AdBlue, which neutralizes nitrogen oxide emissions without a penalty in fuel economy or performance.Those managers argued that only S.C.R. technology would allow Volkswagen to keep pace with ever stricter limits on emissions of nitrogen oxide, which have been linked to lung ailments.Some other carmakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, use S.C.R., which experts say is effective. But it costs more, adds weight to the car and takes up more space than other methods. It is particularly difficult to squeeze such systems into compact cars like the Golf or Jetta, which are among Volkswagen\u2019s best-selling models in the United States.In addition, the tank that holds the chemical must be refilled periodically. That creates an inconvenience and expense for customers, especially in the United States. Until this year, regulations in the United States prohibited drivers from refilling the tanks themselves. They had to go to a dealer or service station.\u201cIt\u2019s a small chemical factory,\u201d Thomas Schlick, a partner at the German management consultancy Roland Berger, who specializes in the automotive industry, said of S.C.R. systems. \u201cIt\u2019s an additional system with no value for the customer.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Some of the Volkswagen executives who advocated an S.C.R. system were sidelined or pushed out of the company. Instead, beginning with the 2009 model year, Volkswagen sold cars in the United States that had 2-liter diesel motors equipped with so-called lean NOX traps. (NOX is shorthand for nitrogen oxide.) The device sponges up nitrogen oxide particles and typically costs several hundred dollars less than an S.C.R. system.The NOX traps do not require a chemical that must be refilled. But they tend to be less reliable at controlling emissions, according to a study published in October by the International Council on Clean Transportation, an environmental group that played a pivotal role in uncovering Volkswagen\u2019s cheating.In addition, the NOX traps cut fuel economy by as much as 4 percent. The penalty in fuel economy suggests another reason Volkswagen employees may have programmed cars to have the emissions controls fully engaged during emissions tests, but dialed back during normal driving. On the open road, some spot checks have found, the Volkswagen diesels could spew more than 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide.In 2007, Volkswagen executives declared their determination to overtake Toyota as the largest carmaker in the world and were eager for any competitive edge.Vehicles with the chemical systems should have been able to pass emission tests without a penalty in fuel economy. Yet, Volkswagen continued to equip those cars with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d designed to detect when the cars were being tested and to turn up emissions controls. Apparently, people inside the company were trying to avoid the need to refill the cars with the urea chemical solutions in between regular service checks. And so, the company programmed the cars to use less urea than needed to contain nitrogen oxide emissions, except when the car was undergoing testing.Volkswagen is in talks with regulators in the United States about how to make about 500,000 diesel cars it sold there comply with clean air rules. Mr. M\u00fcller said on Thursday that he was optimistic that a technical solution would be announced in the coming days.While Volkswagen has figured a way to resolve the emissions problem in Europe at relatively low cost, the United States\u2019 stricter limits on nitrogen oxide emissions has made a solution harder to devise.One of the complications is that 320,000 of the cars in the United States are equipped with the first generation of the engine, known as the EA 189, that is at the heart of the scandal. Those early EA 189 motors have the less sophisticated NOX traps, and it would be difficult to fit them with the S.C.R. systems.The solution, Volkswagen executives suggested on Thursday, may be a more effective NOX trap, taking advantage of recent advances in technology.Volkswagen on Thursday continued to maintain the company\u2019s account that the cheating was the work of a relatively small number of people. It said that nine people had been suspended as a result of the scandal, one more than had previously been disclosed. But the company said it could not disclose any names until the evidence was \u201cwatertight.\u201dMr. M\u00fcller and Mr. P\u00f6tsch conceded that the deception reflected organizational shortcomings.For example, the people who developed the software were the same ones who approved it for use in vehicles. At other companies, it is standard practice for one team to develop components and another to check them for quality. Volkswagen said it would correct those procedures.Mr. M\u00fcller also said he wanted to change the company\u2019s culture so that there was better communication among employees and more willingness to discuss problems. His predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned after the scandal, was criticized for creating a climate of fear that made managers afraid to admit mistakes.\u201cWe don\u2019t need yes men,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said, \u201cbut managers and engineers who make good arguments.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Smog So Thick, Beijing Comes to a Standstill", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Residents across this city awoke to an environmental state of emergency on Tuesday as poisonous air quality prompted the government to close schools, force motorists off the road and shut down factories.The government, which for the first time declared a \u201cred alert\u201d over air pollution late Monday, even broadcast what sounded like bombing raid alerts in the subways \u2014 warnings telling people to take precautions with their health. Yet even with those extraordinary measures, the toxic air grew worse, shrouding this capital city of more than 20 million in a soupy, metallic haze.For many residents, the red alert \u2014 used for the first time since an emergency plan for pollution was unveiled two years ago \u2014 underscored the devil\u2019s handshake that China has made in recent years: the trading of a healthy living environment for breakneck economic growth. Now, as Communist Party leaders try to transform this dystopian scenario, many Chinese are realizing lasting change could take years, maybe decades.Beijing officials issued the alert on Monday night to stem the smog and to show residents that the government was taking action. But the inconvenience it caused for most residents also seared the scope of China\u2019s environmental crisis into the public\u2019s consciousness, just as recent bouts of severe, multiday pollution \u2014 the dreaded rounds of \u201cairpocalypse\u201d \u2014 have done.\u201cI have to watch my child because there is no kindergarten today,\u201d said Kan Tingting, 35, a manager of a cafe who stayed indoors with her 3-year-old daughter \u2014 one of some two million schoolchildren to remain at home Tuesday. \u201cWhat bothers me the most is that my child may have a very negative view of nature. She loves nature much less than she would in a normal environment. I don\u2019t want her to grow up thinking nature is ugly.\u201dIn another corner of Beijing, a university lecturer, Wang Bei, was bunkered down at home with her 10-year-old son. \u201cAir pollution is a huge problem that we ignored early on, while we concentrated on economic development,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we are paying the price for that. It only takes a second for someone to fall gravely ill, but it takes a long time to recover. Now China is that ill person trying to recover from air pollution.\u201dThe current spell of bad air began Sunday. By Monday morning, the quality had deteriorated to what the United States labels a \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d level. Still, it was not nearly as bad as the toxic cloud that afflicted the city in the final weekend of November, when the concentration of fine, deadly particulate matter in southern Beijing hit 40 times the exposure limit recommended by the World Health Organization.That was the worst stretch of pollution this year, and municipal officials were roundly criticized for declaring only an orange alert \u2014 under which people are asked to minimize outdoor activities \u2014 rather than going to code red. The sudden announcement Monday night appeared to be an attempt by officials to make up for the oversight.On Tuesday, the Beijing government\u2019s official online news portal reported that the mayor, Wang Anshun, said the government must win the understanding and support of the people so both can work together to fight smog. The report said the mayor checked construction sites; inspected a government building\u2019s parking lot to ensure 30 percent of official cars were not in use, as required by the red alert; and visited traffic police checkpoints.A similar use of broad traffic restrictions in late 2014 resulted in 1.7 million cars being kept off the roads daily, the Beijing government said.Some international organizations applauded the decision to issue the alert, which is supposed to be done every time there is a prediction of heavy pollution for more than three days.Greenpeace East Asia also praised Beijing, after criticizing it a week earlier for inaction. \u201cThe red alert is a welcome sign of a different attitude from the Beijing government,\u201d said Dong Liansai, a climate and energy campaigner. \u201cHowever, this, the latest of a series of airpocalypses to hit Beijing, is also a firm reminder of just how much more needs to be done to ensure safe air for all.\u201dAt the climate talks in Paris, Chinese officials are discussing their government\u2019s plans to tamp down coal use. Many residents said on Tuesday that the issuing of the alert in the middle of those talks, and the astronomical air pollution levels in late November, should signal added urgency to those officials.Monday\u2019s announcement took most residents by surprise. Parents had to check with chat groups on their WeChat phone apps to see if schools were indeed shutting down. On Tuesday, Beijing\u2019s more than 3,200 schools generally obeyed the orders to close.But by the afternoon, at least two international schools told parents they planned to reopen on Wednesday, even though city officials had imposed the red alert until noon on Thursday. Some workers said they would have no option but to drive daily to the office, in defiance of the regulation aimed at limiting car use to every other day.\u201cThere is no other way for me to go to work besides driving,\u201d said Zhao Lin, 36, a technology salesman. \u201cI have to drive for more than an hour each way to commute to work every day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to drive tomorrow because my car has an even number license plate, but I have to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can fine me or dock me points. I have no choice. I think they can\u2019t see my license plate in this smog, anyway.\u201dSince 2013, when an intense round of pollution hit northern China in January, Beijing has had a color-coded emergency response plan to smog. That plan was strengthened with new measures this March. Despite all that, Beijing had never sounded a red alert, and residents wondered why. Did city officials or the top Communist Party leaders worry they would lose face? Did they fear the economic losses that might result?\u201cThey probably didn\u2019t declare a red alert last week because they didn\u2019t want to slow down the economy,\u201d said Ms. Wang, the university lecturer. \u201cShutting down factories is not ideal for the economy, but health should come first.\u201dMs. Wang said she regularly checked a phone app to monitor air quality, and she and her son wore masks outdoors and turned on purifiers at home. But she said she was worried about the invisible effects on her son\u2019s health.Ms. Kan, the cafe manager, said she and her daughter were staying in Beijing, but \u201cif not for my work, I\u2019d move away in a heartbeat.\u201dShe added: \u201cI used to live in Australia, so I could move there. Or anywhere in southern China is better than the north.\u201dOn one street in the city center, a young salesman, Liu Jia, sat on a bench, puffing away on a cigarette. Half the pedestrians around him were wearing masks.\u201cI can choose to smoke a cigarette,\u201d he said, then looked up. \u201cBut there\u2019s no choice in this.\u201dAbove him, the sky was the color of ash.An article on Wednesday about the issuance of a \u201cred alert\u201d in Beijing over air pollution quoted incorrectly from comments by one city resident, Kan Tingting, about the closing of schools. Ms. Kan, who stayed indoors with her 3-year-old, said, \u201cI have to watch my child\u201d \u2014 not \u201cmy son\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause there is no kindergarten today.\u201d She subsequently used female pronouns, not male ones, to refer to her child, who is a girl. (The pronouns are homophones in Chinese.)Chris Buckley contributed reporting, and Mia Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aishti Foundation Puts Shimmering Works Amid the Turmoil of Beirut", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT \u2014 On a warm evening this fall, the cultural scene here was in full bloom. Members of the international art world, Lebanese government ministers and fashion executives had gathered to celebrate the grand opening of the Aishti Foundation, a private museum showcasing the growing contemporary art collection of Tony Salam\u00e9, the founder of Aishti, a Lebanese luxury retailer.Rayyane Tabet said he loved how the show juxtaposed Lebanese artists like himself with international artists rather than confining them to the category of \u201cart from the Arab world.\u201d \u201cThis is the closest to a contemporary art museum that we\u2019re going to have for the near future,\u201d he said.\u201cHe\u2019s a real Phoenician,\u201d Mr. Gioni said, referring to the ancient civilization of Mediterranean traders. \u201cI told him, \u2018That\u2019s where he makes the money,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to the mall, \u201cand here\u2019s where he spends it,\u201d he added, pointing to the gallery.Mr. Salam\u00e9 got his start importing Italian jeans and clothing to Lebanon during the civil war, when he was still a student. In 1990, he founded the retail store Aishti, Japanese for \u201cI love you,\u201d which has the Lebanese franchise for 150 luxury clothing brands, many of them Italian. After 2000, Mr. Salam\u00e9 who had been collecting carpets and antiques, shifted to art, encouraged by a business associate, Dino Facchini, the founder of the Italian label Byblos.Through Mr. Facchini, Mr. Salam\u00e9 met Mr. Deitch, who became an informal adviser and who now has a formal arrangement. He steered Mr. Salam\u00e9 toward what Mr. Deitch calls \u201cpopstraction,\u201d a mix of Pop Art and abstract art.\u201cIn the past five or six years, Tony has been the most active collector of emerging art in the world,\u201d Mr. Deitch said at the Metropolitan Art Society, a private club in an upscale Beirut neighborhood where Mr. Salam\u00e9 invites foreign gallerists to host temporary shows with works for sale. (Mr. Salam\u00e9 pays the shipping costs and takes a cut of the proceeds.) For the foundation\u2019s opening weekend, the space was dedicated to a show of art from the Aishti collection curated by Mr. Deitch. Called \u201cThe Extreme Present,\u201d it included works by Ian Cheng, Korakrit Arunanondchai and Alex Israel.Some international art world figures, including Marc Spiegler, the director of Art Basel, who attended the opening weekend, laud Mr. Salam\u00e9 for helping drum up local interest in art buying. Yet a few Beirut gallerists counter that Mr. Salam\u00e9 has helped encourage novice collectors to spend six figures on foreign art at auction in Dubai rather than investing in less costly work by Lebanese artists, who struggle to find enlightened collectors.Mr. Salam\u00e9 said that at first, some gallerists were reluctant to sell to him out of concern that he was a speculator who would buy works to resell at auction, inflating prices. Eventually, he was able to buy works by painters like Christopher Wool, whose gallerists carefully control his market.Art dealers cite Mr. Salam\u00e9\u2019s enthusiasm and warmth and his willingness to take risks on young artists, adding that he likes to buy at lower prices and invest in an artist\u2019s career. He is known for buying a work sight unseen. When the art was being installed ahead of the opening, Mr. Salam\u00e9 was excited to see some of his purchases for the first time.\u201cI think he\u2019s the fastest collector in history,\u201d said Miguel Abreu, the New York dealer, from whom Mr. Salam\u00e9 has bought work by the artist Pamela Rosenkranz. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk through the gallery and just talk, and then he\u2019ll walk out and you realize he\u2019s just bought everything.\u201dThe main exhibition at the foundation is called \u201cNew Skin,\u201d after a work by the British artist Alice Channer: a cascade of blue, printed by ink-jet onto a swath of white crepe de Chine, hung from the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m at a very early stage in my career,\u201d Ms. Channer said. \u201cHe\u2019s extraordinarily confident about what he chooses and buys.\u201dIt was in 2010 when Mr. Salam\u00e9 decided he needed a building to showcase his collection. He began with a Beirut architect but was persuaded to aim bigger. Mutual collector friends put him in touch with Mr. Adjaye, who had lived in Beirut for several years as a child of diplomats. After a weekend touring Gio Ponti architecture with Mr. Salam\u00e9 in Italy, Mr. Adjaye put together a proposal in 10 days.He said Mr. Salam\u00e9 never gave him a budget.Mr. Salam\u00e9 said the building cost $100 million, for which he had borrowed from banks. He estimated that he had spent around $170 million on art in the past 15 years, although some gallerists placed the figure higher. Mr. Salam\u00e9 said that Aishti\u2019s annual revenue had been $250 million a year in recent years, up from $100 million in 2006. Aishti, which also handles distribution for many brands in the Middle East, is a private company, and its finances could not be independently verified.In Beirut, economists have questioned for years how Aishti can generate such high revenues in a country of 4.4 million people with an average annual income of $12,000. Lebanon has a pronounced luxury market and is awash in cash \u2014 its underground economy is estimated at 30 percent of its gross domestic product of $49 billion.Nassib Ghobril, the chief economist of Byblos Bank Group in Beirut, said he thought that annual revenue of $250 million was \u201can impressive figure for one department store, especially if you\u2019re talking about the past four years in Lebanon.\u201d\u201cWho comes and buys from the store?\u201d Mr. Ghobril asked, adding that economic growth in the country had plummeted since 2011. \u201cDemand for luxury goods definitely has declined in Lebanon,\u201d he said.Local newspapers have raised questions about whether Aishti is laundering money.Mr. Salam\u00e9 says his detractors are jealous of his success. \u201cI\u2019m not laundering money,\u201d he said.In addition to the new foundation building with its retail space, Aishti also has a flagship store in downtown Beirut and construction is underway for a new luxury mall on the waterfront, designed by Zaha Hadid.While artists and arts organizations in Beirut generally welcomed the Aishti Foundation, they also wondered how it would fit into the city\u2019s rich cultural ecosystem. Some said they were concerned that Mr. Salam\u00e9 would stop funding local arts organizations now that he had his own museum. (Mr. Salam\u00e9 concedes that his philanthropy is now focused on the foundation.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to Open Own Plant in China", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs many of its competitors in the chip industry form partnerships in China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said on Monday that it was taking a different route: setting up a new manufacturing plant without help from a local partner.The move is designed to protect its technology while playing to a China market brimming with makers of inexpensive smartphones. It is charting a course between keeping complex chip production facilities outside China and licensing technology to Chinese partners.In a nod to concerns about advanced chip protection technology being leaked to Chinese competitors, Taiwan Semiconductor said in a separate statement that by the time the facility in China is up and running, an advanced operation in Taiwan would be churning out chips a generation more sophisticated.The company added that it \u201ccomprehensively protects its proprietary information\u201d and, in referring to its fabrication plant, emphasized that it would \u201chave whole ownership of the fab in China, which will help protect our intellectual property rights.\u201dTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s approach stands in contrast to some of its rivals and partners in chip making. With the Chinese government set to spend tens of billions of dollars to build its chip industry, many foreign companies have been setting up partnerships and licensing technology in China.With an economy still based heavily on the chip supply chain, Taiwan\u2019s government has also been particularly careful about allowing its most advanced semiconductor firms, like Taiwan Semiconductor, to cooperate closely with China.Still, the recent spending spree by the Chinese government and chip companies has made a major impression on the island, and people in the industry in Taiwan acknowledge that the Chinese market is critical. For example, in its statement Taiwan Semiconductor said more than 50 percent of its revenue over the past five years had come from Chinese customers.Advertisement"}

Starting with Abraham Lincoln in 1861, beards were popular with presidents for a half-century. But no president since William Howard Taft (1909-1913), with his extravagant handlebar, has padded through the White House garden with visible whiskers (unless you count Richard Nixon\u2019s Flintstone-esque five o\u2019clock shadow).Indeed, for much of the 20th century, beards were the stuff mostly of Marxist guerrillas (Fidel Castro, Ho Chi Minh), campus radicals and, later, sensitive \u201970s types.Sure, there have been exceptions. The Former New Jersey Senator Jon Corzine wore a beard in the 2000s, but as a onetime Goldman Sachs chief executive, his Washington image always read more \u201cslumming rich guy\u201d than \u201cpolitical lifer.\u201dGiven these politically sensitive times, it\u2019s safe to assume that Mr. Ryan considered the implications of his style experiment.Indeed, the official explanation seemed carefully crafted: This was a \u201chunting beard,\u201d the product of weekend at a \u201cdeer camp,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the speaker. (Subtext: I hunt. I am an alpha male).That message is politically expedient, said Mr. Oldstone-Moore, the beard book author. \u201cAs leader of a fractious party, a lot of people would like a piece of him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is signaling with his face what he has been saying in so many words: I will lead on my own terms, I am my own man, and will not take guff from anyone.\u201dThat message has populist appeal, according to Bernard Whitman, a pollster who has worked for Bill Clinton and Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cThe beard makes him look cool and contemporary,\u201d Mr. Whitman said, \u201cwhich makes him more appealing to women, gays and millennials.\u201dThe debate echoes one in the social sciences, between Darwin\u2019s ornament theory (the beard as plumage, to attract mates) and weapon theory (the beard as symbol of power, to intimidate rivals).Both could be useful for the speaker. Or perhaps, neither.\u201cHe is experimenting,\u201d Mr. Oldstone-Moore said. \u201cHe is seeing what the reaction is. If people are impressed, he may stick with it. If not, he can say it was a hunting beard, and away it goes.\u201dIf nothing else, it gives us something to talk about other than Donald Trump\u2019s hair.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Assume a Fed Action Will Move the Market", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewHumans don\u2019t behave like computers. That makes life interesting, but it has a serious downside for economists: It is exceedingly difficult to predict the short-term directions of major markets, even when events seem to be entirely predictable.The forthcoming decision of the Federal Reserve on interest rates is a humbling example. Consider that after seven years of virtually zero percent short-term interest rates, the Federal Open Market Committee is almost universally expected to raise rates slightly at its Dec. 15-16 meeting.What this means for the markets isn\u2019t clear, however. We can\u2019t rely on historical precedent. The last time rates rose after remaining very low for so long was in 1941. That was a long time ago, and when there has been only one previous example, in very different circumstances, historical statistics won\u2019t prove much of anything.There are other ways of analyzing the likely effects of the Fed actions, but all have severe limitations.First, logic tells us that if short-term Treasury rates rise, low-risk Treasury bills may become more attractive in comparison with riskier alternatives like stocks. That suggests that the stock market should weaken because people will become even more wary than they may be right now about share prices, which have tripled since 2009. Home prices should weaken too, because rising interest rates can be expected to make mortgages more expensive. In other words, this line of thinking is quite negative about the general effect of a rate increase on market prices.There is another way to look at this, though. If the Fed raises rates in December it could be seen as good news because the Fed wouldn\u2019t take that action unless it viewed the economy as relatively strong. That could buoy market prices.This approach immediately leads to further complications. Good news about the economy might be bad news about inflation, which tends to rise when economic growth picks up. On the other hand, if inflation rises, even if the Fed raises rates slightly, the real, or inflation-corrected, interest rate might actually be lower, not higher. Confused? That is understandable: This line of thinking might lead us into a muddle very quickly. But don\u2019t be surprised if you hear circuitous commentary like this in the weeks ahead.Then again, the prevailing wisdom might be reflected in yet another common argument, which may be summarized in one word: boring. The markets already know everything there is to know about rates, or so this line of thinking goes, and because a rate increase is expected it should already be \u201cdiscounted into\u201d current share prices. This is a very simple version of the efficient markets theory, which holds that all available information is already fully reflected in market prices, so only true surprises really matter.All of which is to say that we don\u2019t know what will happen if and when the Fed raises rates. And the problem becomes much more complicated when you include human psychology in your economic analysis, as we try to do in the emerging field of behavioral finance. In fact, from a psychological perspective, the whole efficient markets idea that only real surprises matter and there should be no reaction to \u201cnews\u201d that is well known in advance is a little off base. People often don\u2019t know in advance how they will react until news becomes real.In the near zero-interest-rate environment of recent years, people have naturally searched for alternative investments, and that may have led them into wishful thinking. People might be viewing high prices in the stock and housing markets as evidence of the inherent worth of these assets, disregarding the role that low interest rates have played in bolstering those prices. Some people have undoubtedly taken personal pleasure in their investing success, interpreting it as proof of their own self-worth. Identity and ego may be an issue, and that can be very dangerous.People may have strong reactions when their identity is connected to things that turn out to be disappointing, after the initial reason for their excitement is gone. After the financial crisis in 2008, for example, many highfliers found that their identities as smart stock pickers or home buyers were severely challenged. It could happen again.

So the only thing we can do is wait.\u201dResidents in Beijing and other northern cities waited for the smog to come and go.The uncertainties for China surpass the usual unknowns for a country so big and complicated.Mr. Xi has set out a bold yet paradoxical agenda that involves restoring Communist and Confucian tradition and more centralized control to propel China into the future. For China to achieve drastic changes, it must also restore its past, Mr. Xi appears to believe. But three years into what is likely to be a decade in power for Mr. Xi, that agenda has left many citizens unsettled about where Mr. Xi is taking them.For China, it was \u201ca year of mixed signals or, perhaps, sharpening contradictions,\u201d Professor Wasserstrom said. Mr. Xi seemed to waver between turning inward and reaching outward, he said.\u201cOn the one hand, we saw Xi Jinping doubling down on presenting China as capable of being able to go its own way, invoking the Chinese classics \u2014 of both the pre-Communist and Communist varieties,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other, he traveled abroad further and more often than any Chinese leader in decades.\u201dThe insecurity has seeped into the Chinese bureaucracy and into the economy, said several businesspeople and officials, who asked not to identified. Even officials who are free of corruption have become more reluctant to make major decisions, for fear of accusations of favoritism, they said. And the disappearance of \u201cgray income\u201d because of the crackdown on graft has sapped the morale of grass-roots administrators.\u201cOfficials don\u2019t know when the anticorruption campaign, the study sessions, all that, will end, and until then you don\u2019t know who might be next to fall,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a historian at Renmin University in Beijing who often writes about current events.\u201cOn high and below, there\u2019s no clear sense of direction,\u201d he said. \u201cPreviously, in the 1980s and 1990s, it was much simpler \u2014 reform, build a market economy. But now, the policies are harder to read, for officials and for ordinary people.\u201dCommunist Party leaders have scoffed at the idea that their own policies, including the scorching drive against corruption and political liberalism, have sapped official morale and contributed to uncertainty about the economy. Reaping the fruits of an economic restructuring will take time and patience, they argue.The mood at the end of 2015, he said, could be summed up in one word: \u201cBewilderment.\u201d\u201cThis time feels a bit like driving in the desert, the Gobi,\u201d Professor Sun said.\u201cThe road ahead is very clear, but as you go along, the road disappears, and ahead lie sand dunes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat road can finally lead us out? Perhaps now we don\u2019t know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trust and Money at Core of Crucial Paris Talks on Climate Change", "Date": "2015-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn this global forum, no one questions the established science that greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels are warming the planet \u2014 or that both developed and developing economies must all eventually lower their greenhouse emissions to stave off a future that could wreak havoc on the world\u2019s safety and economic stability.In a major breakthrough, 184 governments have already submitted plans detailing how they will cut their domestic emissions after 2020. Those pledges are expected to make up the core of a new accord, which could be signed next weekend. The agreement is also expected to require countries to return to the table at least once every 10 years with even more stringent emissions reduction pledges.But can those governments be trusted to do what they say they will do?That is the crucial question that will determine whether a Paris climate change accord has teeth, or whether it is little more than an expression of good will.The United States is pushing for aggressive, legally binding provisions that would require governments to monitor, verify and report their emissions reductions to an international body. But many developing nations have balked at such provisions, calling them intrusive and a potential violation of sovereignty.\u201cTransparency is an enormously important part of this,\u201d said Todd Stern, the American climate change negotiator. \u201cOne hundred and eighty-four countries have put forth targets. The transparency regime is the thing that will allow everyone to have confidence and trust that other countries are acting. It is at the core of this deal.\u201dAsked about the issue at a news briefing, the Chinese negotiator Su Wei said simply, \u201cTransparency would be very important to build mutual confidence and trust,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is one of the key issues to be resolved.\u201dAnother method to verify changes in global emissions could be the use of satellites to monitor tree coverage in countries like Brazil and Indonesia, which have pledged to reduce mass deforestation, a major source of greenhouse gas pollution.\u201cWe have been defending transparency mechanisms provided they are nonintrusive, that the work is done on a cooperative way, and that the required support for the countries to undertake the work is there,\u201d said Antonio Marcondes, the Brazilian climate change envoy. \u201cBut intrusiveness is not welcome.\u201dOne difficulty for many countries is that they do not have the basic government accounting resources to track and monitor their industrial carbon pollution.\u201cWe agree in principle,\u201d with the idea of a strong verification regime, said the chief climate negotiator for Indonesia, Rachmat Witoelar. \u201cBut there are some prerequisites to that. Some of the countries need technical assistance and capacity assistance to do what is asked.\u201dSeven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.Mr. Stern has also supported proposals in which developed nations with strong monitoring and data-crunching agencies would supply expertise to help poor countries create new institutions to measure and track their emissions. It is unclear whether that support would include a fresh allocation of United States taxpayer dollars.That would be an intensely contentious proposal, coming in the context of the already explosive fight over money. At the heart of the financial fight is a pledge made in 2009 by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that developed countries would mobilize $100 billion annually to help poor countries transform their energy systems from fossil fuel dependency to reliance on clean energy sources, and to adapt to the ravages of climate change.But rich countries such as the United States have insisted that most of that money come from private investments, rather than taxpayer dollars.President Obama\u2019s initial pledge of $3 billion in climate finance over three years is already meeting with fierce objections from Congress.\u201cWe will push for an increase in public spending,\u201d said Ajay Mathur, an Indian climate change negotiator. \u201cWe want developed countries to provide resources that can help mobilize capital. The amounts that have been pledged are not enough.\u201dHe added: \u201cFinance is the easiest thing. All you have to do is write a check.\u201dDespite the standoffs, many negotiators and observers here say they are confident that a deal is in sight.That is in part, they say, because of an optimistic and collegial mood created by the fact that, with the submission of the individual climate pledges, negotiations are further along than they have ever been in the unsuccessful two-decade process to form a climate pact.There is also a sense of good will toward the French hosts of the summit meeting, in the wake of the terrorist attacks that killed 130 people in Paris last month. Top French officials have demonstrated an intense emotional commitment toward forging a deal.In a speech Saturday night to the plenary session, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, clearly emotional, spoke of the urgent need to reach a deal.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about life itself,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI intend to muster the experience of my entire life to the service of success for next Friday.\u201dGiven the emotional sensitivity of the moment, and the sympathy toward France, it is unlikely, say experts, that any one country would take action to block a deal entirely.\u201cI think if a country were to go up against France right now, it would be looked at so badly in the broader global context,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, an expert in climate change negotiations at the World Resources Institute, a research organization.However, she added, in their efforts to forge a deal no matter what, it is possible that negotiators may water down demands or simply remove crucial elements from the text \u2014 weakening the policy outcome in order to end up with a positive political moment.\u201cInstead of spoilers,\u201d she said, \u201cthey could push to make the deal as weak as possible.\u201dJustin Gillis contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Toxic Cocktail of Crises in Turkey", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyTurkey\u2019s economy is threatened on many fronts. A dispute with Russia and the prospect of the Federal Reserve\u2019s raising rates have coincided with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s increasing politicization of the economy and bad governance. This could prove a toxic cocktail given the private sector\u2019s high debts.Turkey\u2019s cost of capital is rising. The yield on the government\u2019s 10-year dollar bond was 5 percent on Friday, up from 4.7 percent a year ago and 4.1 percent just before Turkey shot down a Russian jet last month.The government isn\u2019t to blame for global investors\u2019 falling out of love with emerging markets in general or, indeed, for what Turkey claims was a Russian invasion of its airspace. But many of the risks Turkey is facing are self-inflicted.Russia\u2019s muscular response to the shooting down of a Russian bomber jet in November threatens to be costly for Turkey. Among the raft of economic sanctions announced, the banning of charter flights to Turkey and other moves to dissuade tourism will be especially damaging. About 3.3 million Russian tourists visited Turkey last year. What\u2019s more, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seems intent on finding other ways of exacting vengeance.Mr. Putin may increase support for Kurdish militia fighting inside Syria, something Ankara has warned against. This would infuriate Mr. Erdogan, whose main goal in Syria is to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish enclave on Turkey\u2019s border. The Turkish president\u2019s Syria strategy is already looking sick, as the West is focusing on fighting the Islamic State and not giving priority to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s other goal \u2014 bringing down Syria\u2019s leader, Bashar al-Assad.Meanwhile, Mr. Erdogan has failed to prevent renewed fighting with the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the P.K.K., inside Turkey, though the Kurdish militia group is also responsible. He abandoned peace talks with the group this year, after which violence flared up.The Turkish president benefited from the breakdown in the peace talks because the instability helped his party win a majority in November\u2019s election after it failed to secure one in an earlier vote in June. But the renewed violence creates a strong sense that the country is fighting on multiple fronts, diminishing its appeal to investors.Mr. Erdogan also has increasingly politicized the economy. After taking power in 2002, he followed prescriptions laid down by the International Monetary Fund in the wake of Turkey\u2019s last financial crisis.But in recent years, Mr. Erdogan has undermined the independence of the Turkish central bank by opposing higher interest rates, so much so that the country has little credibility for fighting inflation, which hit 8.1 percent last month. Meanwhile, the Turkish lira has dropped more than a fifth against the dollar in the past year, putting pressure on companies that have borrowed in hard currency.Since the November election, there have been further worrying signs. Ali Babacan, who had been deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and was seen by investors as a safe pair of hands, wasn\u2019t reappointed. His replacement, Mehmet Simsek, is well regarded but not considered a heavyweight. What\u2019s more, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, Berat Albayrak, was made energy minister.The Turkish president is also becoming increasingly authoritarian. The editor of a leading newspaper was put in jail last month for publishing an article that Mr. Erdogan deemed espionage, even though there has yet to be a trial to test the claim. It\u2019s not just freedom of the press that has been curtailed. So has the independence of the judiciary, while corruption is widespread, according to the European Commission.Instability and weak rule of law are bad for business. There has also been capital flight. Turkey is vulnerable because it has been consistently running a big current account deficit \u2014 forecast by the I.M.F. to be 4.5 percent of gross domestic product this year \u2014 and needs foreign funds to plug the gap.The economy is still expected to grow at about 3 percent, largely because construction and domestic consumption have held up. However, this depends on credit, with households borrowing to buy homes and developers borrowing to build them.Housing investment is fueled by rising property prices, and pushes them still higher. But if prices stop going up, the debt that has backed the purchases could weigh heavily on the economy.The only good piece of news recently is that the European Union has agreed to re-energize talks about Turkey joining the bloc. In theory, that could lead to a series of political and economic reforms that put the country onto a positive new trajectory, as Ankara strived to meet the conditions of membership.Unfortunately, European Union leaders would struggle to persuade their own voters to welcome Turkey as a member; and Mr. Erdogan doesn\u2019t seem to have any intention of making the required reforms. Turkey may need to suffer a deeper crisis before this changes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draft of Climate Pact Is Ready, U.N. Officials Say", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLE BOURGET, France \u2014 After almost two weeks of marathon negotiations, the lines for food and coffee on Friday night snaked through the temporary tent city here that has been home to the global climate talks. People made final bets in a five-euro pool on the precise hour the talks might conclude.Others, needing to recharge for the final stretch of negotiations, jockeyed for spots on couches in the lounges.Early Saturday morning, United Nations officials said they had reached agreement overnight on new language for the final draft of the pact, which would be released publicly at 11:30 a.m. Paris time. The officials also said that the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, hoped to bring that text up for a final approval by Saturday afternoon.The diplomats were working through sharp divides between rich and poor countries, including the idea that only rich, developed economies such as the United States should take action to cut emissions, while developing economies, such as India and China, should be exempt.One crucial question is how emissions cuts will be monitored and verified. The United States, the European Union and wealthy countries have pushed for an aggressive system that would apply to all countries. Developing countries like India have insisted on a less stringent system.Developing nations were also pushing for language that would require rich countries to ramp up spending to help poor countries adapt to the ravages of climate change, including increased floods, droughts and devastating storms.\u201cWhat we are striving for is a just and equitable accord from Paris,\u201d said Prakash Javadekar, the Indian environment minister, who has been a vocal opponent of the United States\u2019 push for aggressive transparency measures.\u201cBut unfortunately, the developed world is not accommodating and is not showing flexibility,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is need that they should show more flexibility and that they should be more accommodating to the concerns of the developing world and poor countries.\u201dEnvironmental groups praised that provision, which is seen by many as the core of the document, since it would create a permanent system for reducing emissions over coming decades. It represents a crucial compromise, since many developing nations had pushed for a longer, 10-year cycle.But after diplomats worked through Thursday night and early Friday morning until about 5:45, Mr. Fabius said the group could not meet a Friday afternoon deadline to complete the pact.He said he would release a proposed final text on Saturday morning, which was likely to mean an all-night negotiating session on Friday to complete the text.Diplomats \u2014 many of whom were operating on about three hours of sleep after Thursday\u2019s negotiations \u2014 shuttled between temporary delegation offices for bilateral meetings.Mr. Fabius was meeting with dozens of diplomats personally, and was brokering one-on-one meetings between adversaries, such as oil states like Saudi Arabia and vulnerable nations like the Marshall Islands.While home in Washington and focused on the deadly terrorist attack in California, Mr. Obama has nonetheless tracked the talks closely.He spoke by phone with President Xi Jinping of China on Friday, and the leaders, whose countries have the two most polluting economies, committed to pushing their negotiating teams to work closely together, according to White House officials. Mr. Obama also talked by phone this week with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil.But late this week some negotiators expressed concern about the pact as drafted. At a packed news conference with ministers from Germany, Guatemala, Luxembourg, Norway and other countries, Tony de Brum, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands and the leader of an informal \u201chigh-ambition coalition\u201d that includes the United States and the European Union, announced that certain countries \u2014 he would not specify which \u2014 were trying to water down provisions on monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions targets.Mr. de Brum said: \u201cWe come again to sound a clarion call to the world, to raise our voices and say: We will not accept deletions. We are not here to accept a minimalist agreement. This is our red line.\u201dThe support of every nation, no matter how small or poor, is required for approval of the pact.When a final text of the proposed accord is brought before the plenary session, now called for Saturday afternoon, the presiding official will present it to the delegates for consent. If a single country objects, the deal will die.Despite the current disagreements, negotiators say they are hopeful these climate talks will be the first to end in success.\u201cThere are many challenges. There are things I don\u2019t think are wise to put in the text. But there can still be flexibility,\u201d said Zou Ji, a Chinese negotiator. \u201cBut I am optimistic \u2014 more optimistic than I have been in the past. We will reach a deal.\u201dBan Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, has organized climate talks each year and sees this session as by far the most important.\u201cI am urging and appealing to all the state parties to take the final decision for humanity,\u201d he said.Sewell Chan and Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Bill O\u2019Reilly Gets Wrong About Ronald Reagan", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHAVING served for almost seven years as Ronald Reagan\u2019s secretary of state, I reacted to Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s and Martin Dugard\u2019s latest book, \u201cKilling Reagan: The Violent Assault That Changed a Presidency,\u201d with surprise and dismay, and some alarm. The book, which currently occupies the No. 1 spot on The Times\u2019s nonfiction best-seller list, portrays the president as a weakened man who struggled through almost eight years in office with physical and intellectual limitations brought on by the brutal assassination attempt of March 30, 1981.I am surprised, because the Reagan depicted by Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Dugard bears no resemblance to the man I knew and worked so closely with for years. I am dismayed, because the book was co-written by one of the country\u2019s leading TV personalities. And I am alarmed, because such a popular book may significantly damage the public\u2019s memory of one of our greatest presidents.I was as close to President Reagan as anyone in his administration. Before I became secretary of state, in July 1982, I was chairman of his Economic Policy Advisory Board; we met six times in his first year in office. As secretary of state I attended nearly every National Security Council meeting with President Reagan, missing only a few when I was out of the country. I also met with the president twice a week, just the two of us, to review our strategy, our progress and our next moves.I would defer to no one on my understanding of Reagan\u2019s abilities during his presidency, whether it involved his policies, the changes he formulated for the American economy, the skills in strategy and negotiations he used to bring the Soviets to the bargaining table, or his understanding of complex political situations, at home and abroad.Which is why the idea that the assassination attempt \u201ckilled\u201d him, even metaphorically, rings so false. To claim that President Reagan suffered debilitating mental or physical damage, as the authors of \u201cKilling Reagan\u201d would have one believe, belies the medical facts and everything we know about his acumen and physical vigor. That\u2019s not to say the assassination attempt didn\u2019t set him back for a time; of course it did. But despite being shot in the chest, he bounced back quickly.If anything, the attempt gave him renewed confidence and strength in his dual purposes \u2014 to rebuild America\u2019s economy and its military, so that the United States could bring the Soviets to the bargaining table and negotiate from a position of strength on the wide range of issues between our two nations, from nuclear weapons to the future of Europe.I could go on at length over what \u201cKilling Reagan\u201d leaves out in order to make its historically inaccurate point. The book does the president and his achievements a great disservice in reporting virtually nothing of his accomplishments during his second term, such as the sweeping 1986 Tax Reform Act or the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement. And it attributes what he did accomplish to the inspiration of the Soviet challenge \u2014 as if he were merely reacting to events, instead of driving them.But the biggest historical fault committed by \u201cKilling Reagan\u201d is its slighting of his efforts on disarmament. By 1988, when we met with Soviet leaders in Moscow to put the finishing touches on the Start treaty, which was to bring about a 50 percent reduction in strategic ballistic missiles on both sides, we had already held three major summit meetings with the Soviets. (We didn\u2019t quite finish the Start treaty, though it was signed three years later by Reagan\u2019s successor, George H.W. Bush.) In Washington in December 1987, we signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons on both sides. President Reagan was fully engaged in every detail of the planning and execution of these complex undertakings. And yet very little of this appears in \u201cKilling Reagan.\u201dEarly in his presidency, Reagan presented the world with a challenge \u2014 what he often called a \u201cdream\u201d: the prospect of eliminating nuclear weapons. He committed his entire presidency to it, and his achievements speak for themselves. Among the many measurements of his success, the number of nuclear weapons in existence today is about one-third the number at the time of the 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, where the two leaders agreed on the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.To ignore the progress President Reagan made in achieving major arms control treaties by patient negotiation \u2014 not in spite of, but perhaps even because of, his early near-death experience \u2014 distorts history. But even more, it distorts the gratitude that the world owes to our 40th president.George P. Shultz was the secretary of state from 1982 to 1989.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s President, Dilma Rousseff, Faces Prospect of Impeachment", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The speaker of Brazil\u2019s lower house of Congress agreed Wednesday to start impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff, raising pressure on the beleaguered leader at a time when she is grappling with a severe economic downturn and a colossal graft scandal in her government.The move by Eduardo Cunha, the House speaker, who is himself battling charges in a bribery scheme, opens a new phase of uncertainty in Brazil. A vote in Congress on whether to impeach Ms. Rousseff is expected to involve weeks of delicate political negotiations, making it challenging for proceedings to culminate before a holiday recess expected to start later this month. In the meantime, however, the legal battle over impeachment could contribute to a sense of paralysis in Bras\u00edlia, the capital, thwarting Ms. Rousseff\u2019s efforts to win approval in Congress for austerity measures. Either way, her adversaries are pushing her into a corner at a time when the economy is hemorrhaging jobs and powerful allies are under arrest on corruption charges.The effort to begin impeachment proceedings could still be thwarted in the end, as it would require approval by two-thirds of the legislators in the lower house. \u201cRight now, the government has the votes in Congress that it needs to prevent impeachment from materializing,\u201d said Bras\u00edlio Sallum, a sociologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who is an authority on impeachment proceedings in Brazil.\u201cBut the political situation is so volatile that things could easily change a few weeks from now,\u201d Mr. Sallum added.Before Congress goes into recess, a committee in the lower house would need to be formed to examine the impeachment request and decide whether it should advance. Then legislators would be expected to go through various procedural hurdles.Given the narrow time window, political analysts say it is unlikely that the lower house of Congress could act decisively on impeachment proceedings before its recess unless special sessions are convened. And before an impeachment vote could take place, legislators in Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers Party have vowed to seek a Supreme Court injunction blocking the entire process.Still, the impasse reflects a level of political infighting in Brazil that is making it increasingly difficult for Ms. Rousseff to govern effectively, drawing comparisons with the turmoil around the impeachment in 1992 of President Fernando Collor, who resigned in the face of an influence-peddling scandal. (Mr. Collor has resurrected his political career as a senator, though he is now also under investigation in the bribery scandal involving the national oil company, Petrobras.)Mr. Cunha, a conservative congressman from Rio de Janeiro, said he based his decision on an October ruling by an audit court tied to Congress that said that Ms. Rousseff improperly used funds from state banks to cover budget shortfalls.But unlike with an array of other political figures in Brazil, no testimony has surfaced indicating that Ms. Rousseff personally benefited from a bribery scheme that flourished in connection with deals pursued by Petrobras, even though she oversaw the company\u2019s board when the corruption was ramping up.In that way, Ms. Rousseff stands in stark contrast to Mr. Cunha, whom prosecutors have charged with taking as much as $40 million in bribes for himself and his allies. Mr. Cunha has also come under scrutiny over revelations of undeclared Swiss bank accounts.Mr. Cunha\u2019s opponents claim that he accepted the impeachment request as a form of retaliation against Ms. Rousseff after legislators in her party sought Wednesday to remove him from his post while he remained under the cloud of investigation.Just hours later on Wednesday, Mr. Cunha, an evangelical Christian radio commentator, told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t have any happiness in doing this,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m not doing it for political reasons.\u201d For Ms. Rousseff, the challenges in Congress point to yet another low point in her presidency after she narrowly won re-election a year ago to a second term. Since then, she has grappled with large street protests seeking her ouster, single-digit approval ratings and Brazil\u2019s worst economic crisis in decades.Reacting to the impeachment request, Ms. Rousseff appeared Wednesday\u00a0night on national television\u00a0and drew comparisons between herself and Mr. Cunha, emphasizing that she had no undeclared foreign bank accounts and had not been accused of illicit enrichment. \u201cI am absolutely calm regarding the inadmissibility of this request,\u201d she said.Her leftist supporters have likened the push for impeachment to a coup, contending that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s opponents are manipulating political institutions in an attempt to oust her. \u201cThis announcement is the result of the abuse of power,\u201d said Wadih Damous, a legislator with the Workers Party. \u201cTheir reasoning does not stand up to scrutiny.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paris Climate Accord Is a Big, Big Deal", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 I had low expectations for the U.N. climate meeting here and it met all of them \u2014 beautifully. I say that without cynicism.Any global conference that includes so many countries can\u2019t be expected to agree on much more than the lowest common denominator. But the fact that the lowest common denominator is now so high \u2014 a willingness by 188 countries to offer plans to steadily and verifiably reduce their carbon emissions \u2014 means we still have a chance to meet what scientists say is our key challenge: to avoid the worst impacts of global warming that we cannot possibly manage and to manage those impacts that we can no longer avoid. That is a big, big deal.Many leaders had a hand in it, but it would not have happened without the diplomacy of President Obama and John Kerry.Hat\u2019s off, because this keeps alive the hope of capping the earth\u2019s warming to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, above the level that existed at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution \u2014 the rough redline scientists have drawn beyond which \u201cglobal weirding\u201d will set in and the weather will most likely get really weird and unstable. We\u2019re already almost halfway to passing that redline.The only important holdout in the world to this deal is the U.S. Republican Party. I wouldn\u2019t care about such cave men \u2014 as one sign borne by a Paris demonstrator said, \u201cDinosaurs didn\u2019t believe in climate change either,\u201d and it didn\u2019t end well for them \u2014 except that one of these knuckleheads could be our next president and mess this up.The G.O.P. should take the wise counsel of Andy Karsner, who was George W. Bush\u2019s assistant energy secretary and one of his climate negotiators, and use the Paris deal to build a bridge back to constructive engagement on the subject. The G.O.P. can plausibly argue, said Karsner, that it was Bush who, in 2007, created the \u201cmajor economies\u201d strategy to address climate change through precisely the kind of market-enabled, voluntary national targets adopted in Paris.\u201cThe price of getting this issue behind us may never again be this cheap,\u201d Karsner said of the G.O.P. \u201cCongressional leaders need to evaluate the opportunity they have to reconnect with mainstream voters, scientific, civic and business leaders, geopolitical strategists and most anyone under 35 years old who\u2019s completed eighth-grade science.\u201dWith the earth on pace to add two billion more people by 2050, who will all want cars and homes, and with scientists saying the only way to stay below the 2 degrees C redline is to phase out all fossil fuels by roughly the same date, there is only one force big enough to do that \u2014 to take on Mother Nature at scale \u2014 and that\u2019s Father Greed, a.k.a., the market.What will make this deal epochal is if the U.S. and China now lead the world in imposing a price on carbon, because only that will take to scale the already significant technology breakthroughs that have happened with wind, solar, batteries, energy efficiency and nuclear power.\u201cIn the last six years,\u201d said Hal Harvey, C.E.O. of Energy Innovation, a policy research group, \u201csolar prices have dropped by more than 80 percent, and now cost less than a new coal plant. Wind is down 60 percent, and LED lights more than 90 percent.\u201d With other new technologies near at hand \u201cit becomes clear that a clean future costs no more than a dirty one,\u201d he said. \u201cTexas now has the most wind installed of any U.S. state. Texas!\u201dThe point, said Harvey, is that today\u2019s chief executive doesn\u2019t \u201chave to be a hero anymore\u201d to invest in clean power.Indeed, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Entrecanales, chairman of Acciona, the giant Spanish renewables company, told me that he used to be sprinting alone in the race to install renewables \u201cwith the wind in my face.\u201d But now he finds the wind is at his back, and some of the biggest oil companies are trying to muscle into the race. That is not an accident, he said, considering that recent deals from Morocco to South Africa to Chile were struck for around 2.8 cents a kilowatt-hour of wind and 4.2 cents a kW-h for solar, making them highly competitive with fossil fuel.\u201cIn Chile,\u201d said Entrecanales, \u201cthere was [just] an auction which was technology agnostic, so the government was offering big bunches of energy to be supplied over the next 10 years, 20 years, and all the energy awarded was renewable. Not one single megawatt hour of conventional energy was supplied.\u201dBut, he stressed, leveraging the Paris consensus to get a price on carbon in the big emitting countries is the \u201cHoly Grail,\u201d the thing that tips everything. Because while renewables can win against new fossil fuel plants, old fossil fuel plants built without any pollution control, and with all their capital expense amortized and still enjoying subsidies, can still run very cheaply \u2014 if you don\u2019t count their massive carbon impacts.A price on carbon, said Entrecanales, \u201cwould drive technology, it would drive R&D, it would drive investment, it would drive consumer habits.\u201d So Paris was necessary. A price on carbon will make it sufficient.Advertisement"}

Robinson defines the \u201cgiven\u201d as something \u201cthat presents itself, reveals itself, always partially and circumstantially, accessible to only tentative apprehension, which means that it is always newly meaningful.\u201d Calvin insisted that divine wisdom was one such \u201cgiven,\u201d perceived only \u201cwithin radical limits.\u201d Robinson does not say so, but here Calvin was deeply in tune with the great sages of the past, who all maintained that the transcendence we call God, Brahman, Nirvana or Dao must always ultimately elude us.Calvin has had so profound an influence on Robinson\u2019s religious heritage that when she reads him it seems \u201clike the awakening of submerged memory.\u201d Perhaps one reason for this is that the Protestant Reformation gave sacred sanction to ideals that were becoming essential to the new commercial economy in 16th-century Europe: independence, a strong work ethic, innovation and the enfranchisement of the lower classes. It had never been possible to implement these fully in premodern agrarian civilization, but their value would become self-evident in the modern West.Yet Calvinism has declined in America, Robinson argues, and seems to have lost all sense of the \u201cgiven.\u201d A falsely confident omniscience has instead become widespread in the Age of Information, and not only in the United States. Once we forget that our knowledge of anything can only be partial, we can, like the positivists, become arrogantly disdainful of anyone who does not share our views. In American religion, Robinson believes, moral rigor has become an obligation \u201cto turn and judge that great sinful world the redeemed have left behind,\u201d and self-righteous Christians can be \u201coutrageously forgiving of one another and themselves, and very cruel in their denunciation of anyone else.\u201d Christianity has become a mere marker of identity, even a sign of electoral eligibility, and Calvin\u2019s cosmic Christ has degenerated into an \u201cimaginary friend\u201d in a faith that focuses solely on \u201cpersonal salvation\u201d and \u201caccepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior.\u201dChristianity in her view has thus become the opposite of itself, and Christians seem preoccupied with \u201csins\u201d Jesus never mentioned. For the prophets the great sin was always social injustice, but too many American Christians seem comfortable in a world in which 1 percent of the population controls 40 percent of the wealth, and are not perturbed to hear the Gospels cited to legitimize for-profit prisons or to sanctify the use of guns. Jesus said, \u201cBlessed are you who are poor,\u201d but we now hear talk of the \u201cunworthy poor\u201d and of schemes that will humiliate and dispossess them.Robinson\u2019s heroic lamentation is magnificent. Yet for me something crucial was missing: There is no sustained discussion of America\u2019s relationship with other nations. Robinson admits that the United States often seems like \u201ca blundering giant, invading countries of which we know nothing,\u201d but there is no particular meditation on foreign policy or the Iraq war and its tragic aftermath. Robinson recalls Lincoln telling Americans during the Civil War that they must love their enemies because God loves them, but she does not wonder what that great president would have said about Guant\u00e1namo Bay or Abu Ghraib. Similarly, she mentions Martin Luther King and notes with sorrow that America unfairly privileges the values of those who are white, but we hear nothing specific about the current plight of \u00adAfrican-Americans.In Britain, we still see ourselves as Shakespeare\u2019s \u201csceptred isle,\u201d but in the interdependent global economy no nation is an island. Like Robinson, I am in my early 70s, and in this last phase of my life I too find myself reflecting painfully on the failings of my country, especially on its colonial behavior, which has contributed to so many of our current problems. Actions always have consequences. Every night on the news we see traumatized migrants from the Middle East and Africa literally dying to get into Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans invaded and exploited these regions for their own benefit; now, in a karmic reversal, their peoples are invading us. Yet we talk only of how to keep them out.Robinson\u2019s insistence, throughout these essays, that we recognize the limitations of our knowledge is timely and important. She is acutely aware that the \u201cus and them\u201d mentality, so prevalent in modern political discourse, is dangerous, false and unsustainable, and that it is essential that we cultivate \u201ca respectful awareness of lives lived otherwise.\u201d Yet sometimes she herself pulls back from the \u201cgiven,\u201d as when she wonders, with some trepidation, if those who do not know Christ can enjoy the ultimate good promised to the Christian. She concludes, tentatively, that because they participate in God\u2019s world, they must somehow be included in God\u2019s providence. This solution may have been acceptable in Calvin\u2019s time. But after studying the profundity and richness of world religions for over 20 years, I can no longer believe that any one faith has a monopoly on truth or wisdom.Robinson rarely mentions other religious traditions specifically; when she does, however, she is seldom complimentary. She seems to have inherited from Calvin an anti-Catholic bias \u2014 her discussion of the Huguenot tragedy, for example, is one-\u00adsided and fails to take into account the recent scholarship clarifying that in this complex struggle there was bigotry on both sides and that it is impossible to divide 16th-\u00adcentury France into neat communities of Catholics and Protestants. She is extremely (and in my view inappropriately) scathing about ancient Near Eastern mythology. Yet she approvingly cites William James\u2019s warning that \u201cwe should never assume that our knowledge of anything is more than partial.\u201d This must \u2014 surely? \u2014 mean that no tradition can have the last word on the ineffable. Protestant Christianity had admirable, indeed indispensable insights, but like any ideology, its vision too was partial. John Locke, who, after Calvin, is Robinson\u2019s favorite theologian, suggested that the liberal state could tolerate neither Catholics nor Muslims, claimed that Native Americans had no property rights to their land, and showed some robust support for the institution of slavery.In the West, we often speak of \u201cthe Reformation\u201d as if it were a unique event. Robinson is not only convinced of this but seems to regard the Protestant Reformation as God\u2019s last word to humanity, something that cannot be bettered. Yet almost every single one of what we now call the \u201cgreat world religions\u201d began as a reformation of existing spirituality during a period of social, political or economic transformation, when old pieties no longer sufficed. This is true of the myriad religions of the Indian subcontinent (including Buddhism and Jainism), the Chinese traditions, Rabbinic Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Over the centuries, all of these faiths continued to re-form themselves during times of disturbance and change. Perhaps in the global village that we have created, it is time for another reformation that will help us to achieve and to act upon the apparently difficult recognition that we share the planet with equals.THE GIVENNESS OF THINGSEssaysBy Marilynne Robinson292 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26.Karen Armstrong\u2019s \u201cFields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence\u201d has recently been published in paperback.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Negotiators Face Hurdles on Key Issues as Deadline Looms", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLE BOURGET, France \u2014 Less than two days before their deadline to conclude a sweeping new climate accord, negotiators from nearly 200 countries have yet to resolve major issues, such as how and when pledged cuts to carbon emissions would be verified.Lead negotiators said they were confident that a deal could still be reached \u2014 and perhaps in time to meet the Friday deadline. But some outside observers who have been monitoring the talks said that the compromises necessary to bring it across the finish line could weaken the deal so much as to make it nearly toothless.At the heart of the proposed deal are a set of pledges from 186 countries, representing over 90 percent of the global economy, to cut their emissions. But a draft text published on Wednesday did not include any details on how those emissions cuts would be monitored and verified.Meanwhile, even if enacted, those pledges would cut emissions about only half as much as necessary to curb greenhouse gases to the level needed to prevent the atmosphere warming by 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. At that point, scientists say, catastrophic effects would kick in, such as devastating floods, droughts, food shortages and intense storms.A group of countries led by the United States, Europe and small island nations, known as the \u201cHigh Ambition\u201d coalition, have pushed for provisions that would require countries to submit to verification of their cuts by an outside body, and to return to the table every five years with more stringent pledges.Developing nations like China and India have strongly resisted such provisions \u2014 particularly the demand to ratchet up their emissions commitment. Some nations have expressed concerns that the verification demand would infringe on their sovereignty and lock them into actions that could become untenable.While the draft released on Wednesday discussed all those issues, it left blank the key details.\u201cWe need to press forward for ambition,\u201d said Todd Stern, the lead negotiator for the United States. \u201cThe text that came out is a step forward. We need clear, strong cycles for countries to communicate either an update or revision of their targets, and we need that to start early.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe need a strong transparency article so we know what\u2019s going on with those 186 pledges.\u201dIndia, the world\u2019s third largest carbon polluter, has resisted the demand that it return to the table in five years with more ambitious plans for cutting emissions.\u201cThere needs to be flexibility,\u201d said Ashok Lavasa, secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. \u201cCountries that can put forth every five years can do so. But without a technology breakthrough, other countries will need 10 years.\u201dTony deBrum, the climate change envoy for the low-lying Marshall Islands, a country that is vulnerable to the devastation of sea level rise due to climate change, said, \u201cWe will not accept a minimalist or low-ambition package.\u201d However, he added, \u201cI\u2019m encouraged to see many of the elements we have argued for are there but we have a long way to go.\u201dIn an effort to help smooth the passage of an accord, Secretary of State John Kerry threw more money into the fund to help poor countries adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate. He announced on Wednesday a proposal to double the amount of pledged grants by 2020 to $860 million, from $430 million.The issue of money has been a crucial sticking point in the talks, as developing countries demand that richer countries open their wallets to help pay for them to adapt to the ravages of climate change, such as increased floods and droughts.Secretary Kerry, who has been attending the international climate change talks since the first summit meeting in Rio de Janiero in 1992, plans to remain here all week to help facilitate the deal.Observers said the announcement appeared explicitly intended to give a boost to the stalled climate talks.China and India are resisting a push by the United States to create an aggressive outside monitoring system for emissions, and to require countries to come back to the table every five years with more stringent pollution reduction plans.\u201cThis impasse has slowed progress to a crawl, with the U.S. lacking leverage and China and India seemingly content to wait out the process,\u201d Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the Clinton administration who is attending the talks, said by email. \u201cThe decision to double U.S. adaptation funding itself is a strategic play to head off loss and damage calls by developing nations. This is why Kerry is pushing these lines right now.\u201dOthers agreed that the pledge could help move things along. \u201cThe doubling of public commitments for adaptation is a very helpful development as we head into the final days in Paris,\u201d said Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, a research organization. \u201cWe are entering crunch time.\u201dNo matter the shape of the deal that emerges, it is certain to require governments which have already committed to substantial emissions cuts to begin looking at how they can do still more.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get a deal,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainability, a research organization. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good enough to drink the champagne. And the next day we\u2019ll wake up with hangovers and realize we have a lot more work to do.\u2019Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Qualcomm Concludes a Split Would Be Detrimental", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, the chip maker, which was an early leader in advanced semiconductors for smartphones, released the results of a monthslong review that it undertook partly under pressure from activists. The study evaluated whether Qualcomm should split into two separate companies, with one focused on making research advances and selling intellectual property, and the other on making chips. The conclusion: no split necessary.\u201cThe strategic benefits and synergies of our model are not replicable through alternative structures,\u201d Steven Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe therefore believe the current structure is the best way to execute on our strategy.\u201dIn particular, the company argued that its research into chip designs is aided by making chips, since the chip business enables Qualcomm to gain rapid adoption of its designs and helps it participate in establishing industry standards. The less profitable chip business, in the meantime, benefits from lower research and development costs, Qualcomm said.Qualcomm\u2019s woes are both common to the semiconductor business and unique to its own story. While chips are generally in greater demand than ever, since computing has become a facet of everything from cars to toys, competition has become cutthroat, particularly in the once-hot China market.One result has been a record year for semiconductor company mergers. Through September 2015, the industry experienced more than $77 billion in mergers, about six times the average amount, according to IC Insights, a market research firm.Some of Qualcomm\u2019s issues are part of a larger trend of older tech companies struggling to raise their flagging stock prices. Many have faced activist pressure and have made changes to pacify the shareholders.On Nov. 2, the former Hewlett-Packard began life as two separate companies, one focused on personal computers and printers and the other selling hardware and software for corporations. And earlier this year, eBay split from the electronic payments business PayPal; eBay had earlier been a target of the activist investor Carl C. Icahn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Foreign Arms Deals Increased Nearly $10 Billion in 2014", "Date": "2015-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Foreign arms sales by the United States jumped by almost $10 billion in 2014, about 35 percent, even as the global weapons market remained flat and competition among suppliers increased, a new congressional study has found.Iraq followed South Korea, with $7.3 billion in purchases intended to build up its military in the wake of the American troop withdrawal there.Brazil, another developing nation building its military force, was third with $6.5 billion worth of purchase agreements, primarily for Swedish aircraft.The report to Congress found that total global arms sales rose slightly in 2014 to $71.8 billion, from $70.1 billion in 2013. Despite that increase, the report concluded that \u201cthe international arms market is not likely growing over all,\u201d because of \u201cthe weakened state of the global economy.\u201dIt was the second successive year that global sales remained steady, suggesting that the market has begun to level off after several years of extreme fluctuation.The lack of market expansion has led to greater competition among suppliers. Some arms producers have adopted measures like flexible financing, counter-trade guarantees and coproduction and co-assembly agreements to try to secure sales, according to the report.\u201cA number of weapons-exporting nations are focusing not only on the clients with which they have held historic competitive advantages due to well-established military-support relationships, but also on potential new clients in countries and regions where they have not been traditional arms suppliers,\u201d the author of the report, Catherine A. Theohary, wrote.Despite the competition, the report concluded that, given its positioning, the United States was likely to remain the dominant supplier of arms to developing nations in coming years.The annual report by the Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress, was delivered to Congress this week and analyzes trends in arms sales between 2007 and 2014.As in previous years, the vast majority of arms were supplied by large, established countries to developing ones, which made $61.8 billion in total purchases in 2014.The report is considered among the most detailed nonclassified international arms sales data available to the public. To ensure that information is comparable to 2014 dollars, the report adjusts figures from previous years for inflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Refuge for Salmon, Cold Water Preferred", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 When Lewis and Clark first encountered the Columbia River in 1805, they wrote about nearby streams so thick with salmon that you could all but walk across on their backs.Last summer, those streams looked very different. As a torrid heat wave settled over the Pacific Northwest, the salmon heading up the Columbia River from the ocean in their ancient reproduction ritual started dying en masse, cooked in place by freakishly hot water that killed them or made them vulnerable to predators. Sockeye died by the hundreds of thousands.\u201cIt was a peek at the future,\u201d said Jim Martin, a former chief of fisheries for Oregon, who now works on conservation issues for a fishing tackle company, Pure Fishing. \u201cThis is exactly what is predicted by climate-change models.\u201dOther salmon experts, though, said the future was not that clear. Even as the sockeye here were dying, they said, pink salmon were exploding in number, especially in the Puget Sound area around Seattle. Alaska, which actually supplies most of the wild-caught salmon eaten in Portland, Seattle and other coastal cities that have their identities tied to fish, had its own good-news story this year, with a near-record harvest.\u201cHedge your bets, spread your bets,\u201d said William Stelle, the West Coast regional administrator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s fisheries department, summing up the new philosophy. If it looks as if the water in certain parts of the salmon\u2019s range is going to be too hot for them to withstand, Mr. Stelle said, then the new approach is to find or restore places with cooler water. \u201cYou have to bring it down to the local conditions \u2014 what can you do in that place?\u201dThe new thinking also points the spotlight on Portland and other places that have pioneered or advanced the idea, and where fishery managers say that cold-water refuges are showing signs of early \u2014 if tentative \u2014 success. Last fall, for example, scientists documented salmon spawning in Crystal Springs Creek, five miles from the downtown high-rises of Portland, Oregon\u2019s largest city, for the first time in a half-century.The 2.7-mile-long creek starts from a spring on the campus of Reed College. School officials worked with the city for more than decade to tear out culverts and other blockades that had kept the fish from the watershed, known as Reed Canyon.A couple dozen fish are by no means a major salmon recovery \u2014 and at a cost of about $15 million, some people might question the cost-benefit ratio as well. But in salmon micromanagement circles, fishery experts said, small successes can resonate: More federally protected fish species transit through Portland, or spend a portion of their lives there, than through any other major metropolitan area in the nation, according to the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group. And because Crystal Springs Creek connects through another stream with the Willamette River, its cold-water refuge can make an important difference as part of a 300-mile salmon habitat.Even though much of the salmon in American supermarkets and restaurants is farmed or caught elsewhere, the industry is still vital to the Pacific Northwest economy, injecting billions of dollars through sport fishing, tourism and the Alaskan fishing fleet, much of which is based in Washington and Oregon.\u201cWhat happens in Portland matters for salmon,\u201d said Noah Greenwald, the endangered-species director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIf there are places the salmon can hold out, then identifying those areas and making sure they\u2019re protected is certainly going to be important.\u201dCritics of the cold-water refuge effort said that although it might help in the short term, it sidestepped bigger and vastly more expensive problems. A reliance on hatcheries, which began early in the 20th century after salmon were almost fished to extinction, has made the fish more genetically uniform and less adaptable to a changing climate, they said. Dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers raised water temperatures by making the rivers slacker and slower moving, long before climate change emerged as an important factor.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of the easy things, and they\u2019re great, but they\u2019re not enough,\u201d said Guido Rahr, the president and chief executive of the Wild Salmon Center, a Portland-based conservation group. As the climate continues to change, Mr. Rahr said, salmon will need every bit of their ancient, wild genetic diversity because evolution will select the traits best suited to survival.What traits might be needed, exactly, is anybody\u2019s guess. The coho run that came in Portland last year with those pioneering pairs on Crystal Springs, for example, did not materialize this fall, with only a few return sightings. No one knows exactly why, though coho numbers did plummet last summer in the Pacific.\u201cWhat scares me is that we do not have control over what happens in the ocean,\u201d said Kaitlin Lovell, the manager of the Science, Fish and Wildlife Division for the City of Portland. \u201cProjects like Crystal Springs buy you time to make the bigger decisions you have to make.\u201dAnd those decisions do not get easier. \u201cIn an urban environment, can we do enough to overcome or stay ahead of climate change?\u201d Ms. Lovell said on the stream\u2019s bank on a recent afternoon. \u201cHow far can you go?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Has Europe Reached the Breaking Point?", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeature\u2018\u2018Hungary is a bad choice,\u2019\u2019 Toroczkai says, staring into the camera. \u2018\u2018Asotthalom is the worst.\u2019\u2019It might seem odd that a chain-link fence could threaten the order of the European Union, but one of modern Europe\u2019s singular accomplishments is its open internal borders. The treaty that made this possible, known as the Schengen Agreement, began going into effect in 1995 and expanded to include 26 countries in and around the European Union. It immediately provided a potent symbol of both the ideals and the real benefits of European integration. Elites believed unity would guarantee peace and prosperity and dispel the demons of nationalism. Over time, the European Union built a rich and diverse economy, exerting global influence through the clout of its scale and the soft power of its liberal, democratic values \u2014 a Western superpower without the bellicosity or the laissez-faire hardheartedness of the United States. Workers\u2019 rights were protected. Generous social-welfare programs flourished. The open borders bound the member nations together in subtler ways, too: Italians could soon go skiing in Austria with ease and without a passport, or head to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur for a swim as if Europe were all one country. Workers could commute between Brussels and Paris without hassle.Hungary\u2019s southern fence was erected along its external borders with Serbia and Croatia, which are not Schengen countries. But it caused a chain reaction that shook European politics to the core, as the distinctions between internal and external borders blurred. First, it led to more fences. Neither Slovenia (which is a Schengen country) nor Croatia was fully prepared for the surge of frantic migrants and refugees suddenly diverted toward them. Slovenia quickly constructed its own fence on the Croatian border. Austria later began building a fence on its boundary with Slovenia and established other border controls, as did other countries. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said he was defending the Schengen area, while other leaders said these new barriers were intended to provide an orderly route north for refugees, not to block them. Nonetheless, the rapid proliferation of fences across a region defined by free movement was an unmistakable sign that the external Schengen borders had broken down and the founding values of the system were under terrible strain.By the time of my visit, the broader question in Hungary and throughout the member nations was whether the European Union itself was falling apart. Twice in 11 months, Paris had been hit by vicious terrorist attacks, raising fears about European security and stirring anti-Muslim xenophobia. Europe\u2019s far right was gaining strength, including the National Front in France. Europe\u2019s undisputed leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, was in political trouble. Greece was still a financial mess. A demographic crisis loomed, given the rapid aging of many European countries. Out on the European periphery, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, was making bloody mischief in Syria and Ukraine. And the United Kingdom was contemplating withdrawing from the union altogether.The European Union was supposed to be an economic superpower, but after seven years it is still struggling to recover from the global economic crisis. Economic growth is sluggish at best (and uneven, given the divide between a more prosperous north and a debt-burdened south). Adjusting for inflation, the gross domestic product of the 19 countries now sharing Europe\u2019s common currency, the euro, was less in 2014 than it was in 2007. Widespread joblessness and diminishing opportunities confront an entire generation of young Europeans, especially in Spain, Italy, France and Greece. The economic malaise tinges everything: Young people resist marriage for lack of economic opportunity. Poorer European countries are experiencing brain drains as many of their best young professionals and college graduates move abroad. Numerous Greek doctors, for instance, now work in more prosperous Germany while Greece\u2019s health system is in crisis. Even as Toroczkai pushed back against migrants, he complained to me that too many young Hungarians had to leave for London or elsewhere to find work.The migrants only accentuate the European paradox: A place of deepening pessimism for many of its own young people has become a beacon of hope and safety for migrants, many of them Syrian refugees who have been through the horrors of civil war. Many are young and educated, seemingly a timely fit for a region with an aging population. Except Muslim immigrants present a challenge to European ideals of tolerance, especially in a year of terror attacks, as far-right extremists and conservative political leaders like Orban warn that Europe\u2019s security and \u2018\u2018Christian values\u2019\u2019 are threatened \u2014 a reminder of just how fragile the European system has become.Modern Europe was put together incrementally, beginning with an industrial agreement in the early 1950s among six countries, with France and Germany at the center. Next came the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which created the European Economic Community, the European Union\u2019s forerunner, at that point encompassing only Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 introduced requirements and a timetable to establish the common currency. Other treaties gradually brought in more member states, drawn to European prosperity and security, including the Baltics and parts of Eastern Europe in 2004 and 2007, in a final triumph over the Cold War.But then came the 2008 economic crisis, followed by the convulsive aftermath of the Arab Spring, followed by the aggression of a revanchist Russia. Europe\u2019s collaborative, consultative political style began to resemble indecisiveness. The inadequacy and weakness of the European Union\u2019s institutions were glaringly exposed. Washington was mostly focused elsewhere, and European leaders continued to practice the high art of muddling through, in hopes that the broader European economy would revive soon and bring brighter political prospects. Instead, 2015 became the year that pushed Europe to the brink.The Greek crisis was about an inward-looking Europe grappling with its own internal contradictions. But by summer and early autumn, Europe\u2019s external contradictions had become even more acute. Two pillars of foreign policy \u2014 engagement with Russia and the maintenance of stability on the European periphery \u2014 were trembling. Ukraine was in crisis and at the center of a confrontation between the European Union and Putin. Dealing with him became even more complicated when Russia began bombings in Syria, aggravating a refugee crisis that already dominated the European agenda.By midsummer, Syrian refugees discovered a shortcut to Europe through Lesbos, the Greek resort island. From January through October, according to Europe\u2019s border-security agency, 1.2 million migrants illegally entered the European Union, a fourfold increase from a year earlier, many arriving on inflatable rubber dinghies or rickety boats. Europeans could have seen this as an affirmation of their exceptionalism \u2014 Syrians, Afghans, Eritreans, Gambians and others escaping war and poverty for the European dream. But Europe was overwhelmed and fearful, and largely unprepared.On a gray day in November, I went to discuss this growing sentiment with Khalil Merroun, rector of the Grand Mosque of \u00c9vry-Courcouronnes in a suburb of Paris, one of the largest mosques in France. Big-bellied and jovial, Merroun, 69, is establishment Islam. He is a founding board member of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, the quasi-governmental body that regulates Muslim activities. His friend Manuel Valls, now France\u2019s prime minister, personally awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country\u2019s highest prize, and wrote the foreword to Merroun\u2019s 2010 book, \u2018\u2018French and Muslim: Is It Possible?\u2019\u2019Merroun slipped out of his white burnoose and into his suit jacket, smiling as he settled into a chair. He had just finished Friday\u2019s lunchtime prayers. \u2018\u2018Five thousand people,\u2019\u2019 he said, gazing out his office window as a throng of Muslim worshipers streamed out of the prayer hall. Outside his office, two black-jacketed bodyguards assigned by French officials sat in the hallway. The security detail had been with Merroun since the January attacks in Paris, which had a profound impact on France. Flaws were exposed in French security and intelligence gathering. Debates erupted over French secularism and freedom of expression. Distrust of French Muslims deepened. In response, Merroun and other religious leaders held interfaith gatherings to promote tolerance.Merroun leaned forward in his chair. Terrorism is \u2018\u2018not jihad,\u2019\u2019 he said. The jihad of one\u2019s self is about personal betterment and seeking greater understanding.\u2018\u2018Today, you did a great jihad by coming to see me,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You called yesterday, you took the Metro, it was raining and you came here for a noble cause, to inform people. And I also made an effort, a jihad: I listened to you, I welcomed you and tried to transmit a message to better inform people, to try and dispel misconceptions and spread our true message, thousands of kilometers away, in the United States.\u2019\u2019Merroun didn\u2019t discount the venom directed at Muslims or refugees \u2014 this explained his security detail \u2014 but he thought the sour public mood was rooted in broader frustrations, like the lack of jobs. \u2018\u2018So far, things have managed to remain relatively stable,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018They want more Britain and less Europe,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Reilly said, distilling the essence of the British revolt.O\u2019Reilly\u2019s job is to shine a light on the European system and redress a widely perceived lack of bureaucratic accountability. It is not a simple task, given the immensity and confusing powers of the European Union. She recently tried, and failed, to clearly explain to her husband the differences between the European Council, the Council of the European Union (sometimes called the Council of Ministers) and the Council of Europe. I mentioned that I was trying to figure the system out. \u2018\u2018If you do that, come back,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018Tell us all and make your fortune here.\u2019\u2019O\u2019Reilly is not naturally cynical about the European Union. She left school in 1975, two years after Ireland joined the European Economic Community. As a condition of membership, Irish lawmakers passed a new labor law that helped eliminate gender discrimination in the workplace. Those laws enabled O\u2019Reilly to become a journalist before moving into her government career. European governance literally changed her life for the better. Now, though, young women and men in Europe are staring at joblessness, and the European Union is regarded as part of the problem.\u2018\u2018What has to happen is that the experience I had as a young woman, as a young girl back in the \u201970s, has to be replicated for the young girls in Greece and Italy and in Eastern Europe,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018That hope and that potential that the E.U. held out for my generation has to be given to others.\u2019\u2019Critics often use \u2018\u2018Brussels\u2019\u2019 as shorthand for the whole sprawling European project, hence the \u2018\u2018Brussels Bubble.\u2019\u2019 There is a basic institutional structure, with a certain degree of checks and balances. The European Commission is roughly equivalent to an executive branch. Then there is an elected legislative branch, the European Parliament. A third branch, the European Council, consists of the elected leaders of the 28 member states (and shares a building with the Council of the European Union, a forum for national ministers to hash out various shared policies). Beneath those main branches is a labyrinthine bureaucracy that in flowchart form would resemble an M.C. Escher print. The overall processes of lawmaking and governing can be elusively fluid and deliberately opaque, which is one reason the credibility of European governance is so easily attacked. Many ordinary people have little idea how it works.The European Union has no equivalent to the United States Constitution but is a product of the succession of treaties ratified by member states, a process closer to that of the Articles of Confederation, America\u2019s original governing document, which ultimately failed. If these treaties have steadily pushed Europe toward greater integration, the job is far from complete.European Union institutions have vast regulatory powers over everything from data roaming to environmental standards to trade deals to antitrust rules. But power is not shared equally. The European Commission, for example, is supposed to enforce the bloc\u2019s treaties \u2014 yet it must sometimes tiptoe around big member states like France and Germany. And as a whole, the institutions often lack the structural power, political decisiveness and bureaucratic efficiency to act collectively when faced with big, unforeseen problems like the Greek crisis, the surge of migrants or the standoff with Putin over Ukraine. National leaders are often forced to decide these issues in marathon emergency meetings in Brussels at the European Council, and even then, only incremental progress is made. It is a perfect recipe for public cynicism: a system of intrusive regulators whose tentacles can spread into your personal life, even as leaders appear indecisive in the face of genuine crises.Because the system is incomplete, workarounds are often needed to get things done. O\u2019Reilly explained one element of the ad hoc system of power sharing that has grown up in Brussels with a term of art: \u2018\u2018trilogue.\u2019\u2019 Trilogues are semiofficial meetings, often conducted with minimal transparency, of lawmakers from the European Parliament, representatives from national governments and bureaucrats from the European Commission. Together they hammer out legislation that is later put to a vote in the European Parliament and other Euro\u00adpean Union institutions. It is back-room politics, Brussels-style. O\u2019Reilly, who is investigating the practice, said many people think trilogues help cut through bureaucracy to get things done, but they also raise questions about transparency and a broader lack of checks and balances.\u2018\u2018Ever since then, we\u2019ve been on a slippery slope,\u2019\u2019 Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels, told me. \u2018\u2018Every elected national leader knows there is no political mileage to try to lead on European issues or push for more integration. The European idea is now a rapidly declining trend.\u2019\u2019It was the sort of overtly bigoted remark that has become more common in Hungary and elsewhere in Europe (and not so unfamiliar in the United States too). Many Hungarians mocked his anti-\u00adillegal-immigrant video, but Toroczkai\u2019s stature rose within Europe\u2019s far right. Earlier in November, he was invited to speak at a Polish Independence Day rally in Warsaw, where thousands of far-right supporters waved flags and displayed banners with messages like \u2018\u2018Stop Islamization.\u2019\u2019 Toroczkai told me that the Paris attacks \u2014 two of whose perpetrators apparently passed through Greece posing as refugees \u2014 had proved him correct.If the migrant crisis had exposed fault lines in the Schengen system, this second Paris attack threatened to demolish it. Some suspected terrorists had traveled to and from Syria. Others had seemingly moved freely back and forth between Brussels and Paris. Open borders now meant Europe was more open to terror.\u2018\u2018Migration is just going to lead to bloody conflict,\u2019\u2019 Toroczkai said. \u2018\u2018European politicians will have to listen to public opinion, which is radicalizing all over Europe as a result of this migration crisis.\u2019\u2019Above all, the crisis, like the Hungarian fence, had underscored the fact that erasing borders never quite erased divisions among countries with different languages, customs and histories. The European Union expansion in 2004, which took in parts of Eastern Europe, stirred deep economic anxiety in France and contributed to the defeat the next year of the French effort to approve a European Union Constitution. Its opponents invoked the \u2018\u2018Polish plumber\u2019\u2019 as a symbol of cheap outside labor that threatened the French working class. Now the arrival of migrants is again challenging European ideals.Europe is not usually considered a continent of immigrants. When countries like France and West Germany recruited workers from Algeria and Turkey in the 1960s to fill labor shortages, the common expectation was that many of them would eventually return home. Anyone riding the subway in Paris can see that the French capital is one of the most diverse places in the world, yet France has struggled to absorb even second- and third-\u00adgeneration French Muslims, often because of difficulty balancing Islam with French secularism. In Germany, Islam is managed in part through diplomacy; many imams are provided, by agreement, by a religious ministry of the Turkish government. France has a similar setup with Morocco, Algeria and other majority-Muslim countries.On Nov. 2, I traveled to Darmstadt, in south-\u00adcentral Germany, to watch her conduct a meeting with hundreds of rank-and-file members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union party. An outpouring of German volunteers had helped migrants, but many here were concerned. A software engineer worried that the migrants would be an extra burden at a time when, he feared, Germany was losing its competitive edge. Another man bemoaned that Germany was losing its Christian values. Others lamented that there were not enough jobs or warned that towns and villages were already overwhelmed.Since the Paris attacks, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France has stood by the country\u2019s commitment to receive a modest number of refugees. Yet he has instituted border controls and warned that Europe must secure external borders or risk member countries sealing themselves off. And this, he added, would amount to a \u2018\u2018dismantling of the European Union.\u2019\u2019 In early December, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, scored major victories in regional elections, raising the once-unthinkable possibility that the far right has a chance at the presidency in 2017.On the day I visited the Hungarian fence, I noticed a black van parked outside the town hall in Asotthalom. Inside was a small delegation of politicians from Belgium, led by Filip Dewinter, the leader of the far-right Vlaams Belang party. Belgium was reeling after investigators discovered that some of the suspected organizers of the Paris attacks lived only a few miles from the European Parliament. For days, the police locked down the city searching for suspects.Today was the anniversary. It rained on this day two years ago, and it was raining now, but otherwise everything felt different. Ukraine had endured two years of war, economic collapse and political upheaval, with thousands dead and more than a million displaced. Europe had stumbled into a new Cold War and learned the costs of misjudging Russia. Ukraine was never supposed to be a problem for Europe; in fact, it was thought to be the opposite of that, a chance to expand Europe\u2019s orbit and stabilize its periphery \u2014 on its own terms and on the strength of its soft power.For centuries, power politics in Europe meant guns and wars (and the influence of the Vatican, given the sometimes belligerent role of past popes). But the European Union has been a relatively pacifist body, most prominently when France and Germany strongly opposed the George W. Bush administration\u2019s invasion of Iraq. Britain and France are still military powers, and the Italian Navy remains active in the Mediterranean, but the European Union has sought to exercise global influence through its economic strength and democratic values. Leaders saw trade and closer ties as enough to maintain stability on the European borders.But Ukrainian reformers want more European involvement, money and commitment, even a path to eventual European Union membership, as they try to rebuild a country still hobbled by corruption, dominated by oligarchical interests, divided ethnically and locked in a confrontation with Russia. Their argument is that Ukraine can never become secure or democratic without Europe, and that Europe can never be secure, or truly fulfill its ideals, without a stable, democratic Ukraine.\u2018\u2018Ukraine needs this success,\u2019\u2019 Ostap Semerak, a pro-\u00adreform lawmaker, told me. \u2018\u2018And the European Union needs this success.\u2019\u2019Europe itself, though, is increasingly ambivalent. Russia, not Ukraine, has long been the greater concern. Led by the Germans, Europe long pursued a foreign policy rooted in the belief that economic interdependence with Russia would ensure political stability, just as it had between once-mortal enemies like France and Germany. Russia sold natural gas to Europe. Europe sold machinery and luxury goods to Russia. Europe\u2019s east, meanwhile, inevitably became a place of geopolitical competition, as new member states like Lithuania and Poland regarded the integration of Ukraine in some fashion as a security priority.Europe\u2019s internal crises are now dominating its agenda, with some leaders eager to normalize relations with Russia and effectively return to business as usual. Merkel and Hollande are trying to secure a lasting peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but European attention has shifted to Syria, refugees and terrorism. Hollande is focused on trying to put together a coalition against the Islamic State \u2014 one that would include Russia. Merkel traveled to Istanbul to woo President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey \u2014 despite her prior criticism of his authoritarian impulses \u2014 and in November, the European Union agreed to pay three billion euros to Turkey to help stanch the flow of migrants pouring across Turkish borders. It even reopened talks about Turkey\u2019s long-stalled bid to join the European Union. Europe had dumped soft-power diplomacy for a scrambling, even desperate, embrace of realpolitik.I visited a handful of reformers and analysts in Kiev during the Maidan anniversary weekend, and Europe\u2019s sudden overtures to Russia had not gone unnoticed. Anxious scenarios circulated: A Europe desperate to strike at terrorists might cut a deal for Putin\u2019s help (because his military was also now involved in Syria), possibly ending the economic sanctions put on Russia in response to its aggression in Ukraine or making concessions in the peace talks.During the anniversary on the Maidan, people walked slowly in the rain, stopping at different memorials. Two teenage girls huddled under an umbrella, crying as they stood beside rows of photographs of people who died. \u2018\u2018Mostly, Europe doesn\u2019t care what is happening in Ukraine,\u2019\u2019 Anne Levchuk, who said she was 17, told me. \u2018\u2018They can\u2019t really feel what we feel.\u2019\u2019European countries once managed to have strong economies and generous social safety nets, as social democracy became Europe\u2019s political mainstream. That formula collapsed in the 2008 economic crisis, though even today Europe is divided on where to place the blame \u2014 a bloated welfare state or decades of corrupt governance, or both. Europe\u2019s left defended the old socialistic model even as the consensus in Berlin and Brussels had long since shifted to pro-market, \u2018\u2018neo-liberal\u2019\u2019 policies. Greece became a battleground for different economic visions but also a test case of how Europe handles an effectively bankrupt state in its midst, with a legacy of political corruption.Ten days after the Paris attacks, I went to Greece to visit Alexis Tsipras. He adjusted the two wing chairs in his office, catching the light through the window, and invited me to sit down. Tsipras wore a blazer and khakis, still tieless, still prime minister. He seemed weary, even a touch forlorn, staring down at his lap. Can an entire country seem exhausted?\u2018\u2018I think it\u2019s not so easy to change Europe when you are alone,\u2019\u2019 Tsipras said, speaking in practiced English.Tsipras is beaten, but he still thinks he is right. The euro crisis is not solved. Europe has a common currency but not a common financial system. Greek debt is still unsustainable. The \u2018\u2018recipe,\u2019\u2019 as he calls austerity, has been proved wrong. Why, he asks, has economic growth and employment recovered so much faster in the United States than in Europe? He still attacks the consensus in Berlin and Brussels as straitjacketed economics enforced by creditors, in defiance of logic, unable to produce real growth. Many economists agree. But Tsipras\u2019s critics argue that he offered no real alternative other than old-style Greek clientelism. He misplayed his confrontation with Berlin and Brussels. (They did, too.) His job now is to administer what he regards as the wrong medicine, hope his country doesn\u2019t implode while he makes it attractive to private investors and then try to recover and \u2018\u2018regain our sovereignty.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018We saw that there is no other way,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Our European partners and Germany were very, very tough.\u2019\u2019The Greek crisis was never only about the country\u2019s problems; it was also about Europe\u2019s power equations, as well as volatility in the financial markets. To renegotiate Greece\u2019s debt and make real concessions meant possibly opening the door to renegotiations with debtor countries like Italy, Portugal and Spain. Other creditors would be staring at new liabilities and infuriated voters. Even the Baltic countries and the Eastern Europeans had more contempt than sympathy for Greece, because of Greece\u2019s higher standard of living. A crisis rooted in economics was fought in the realm of politics, infused by moralism (Lazy Greeks versus Mean Germans) and national self-interests. A common currency intended to bring nations together had done the opposite.It might never have been realistic to envision a United States of Europe. Yet the prospect of a weaker Continent is something that should alarm Washington; Europe and America are trade partners, are bound together militarily by NATO and share a commitment to democracy. Many European bureaucrats and officials cling to the belief that crisis has always made Europe stronger and more integrated. Yet the optimism that carried the project forward to stop wars and create prosperity is dwindling. Now the challenge of the Euro\u00adpean Union is whether it can succeed in continuing to bring a better and more secure life to a larger and more diverse group of citizens. Has the European Union reached the practical limits of the ideal of an ever-closer union? Europe\u2019s binding glue now might well be fear \u2014 fear of the unknown, of what will happen if Greece does tumble out of the eurozone, or if Britain chooses to leave the European Union.Tsipras said he still considers himself pro-\u00adEurope, as most Greeks are, and took heart from rising leftist parties in Portugal and Spain. \u2018\u2018Greece is not alone anymore,\u2019\u2019 he noted. But he described Brussels as \u2018\u2018the kingdom of bureaucracy,\u2019\u2019 a place where \u2018\u2018there is a lack of democracy \u2014 the most important decisions are taken behind closed doors.\u2019\u2019 It might have sounded like resentment from someone who tried and failed to knock down the palace gate. But it was what I heard everywhere I went. Indeed, Tsipras seemed to capture the European moment.\u2018\u2018I am very, very skeptical for the future,\u2019\u2019 he said.Advertisement"}

At the time, during the depth of the recession, they dropped as low as $32.40 a barrel.The drop on Friday pushed down the stocks of energy companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Baker Hughes, the rig and oil services company. But the sell-off was broad, with all 10 sectors of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ending down.By the end of the day, the S.&P. 500 had lost 39.86 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,012.37. That put it down 3.8 percent for the week, its worst showing since August.The Dow industrial average was down 310 points, or 1.8 percent, to 17,265.21. The Nasdaq declined 111.71 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,933.47.Investors shifted money into government bonds, especially Treasuries. The yield on the 10-year note skidded to 2.13 percent from 2.23 percent late Thursday, a big move. The reasons for the sustained decline in oil this week \u2014 and through much of the year \u2014 differ from seven years ago, when economies around the world screeched to a halt. Now, demand is growing but energy markets are reacting to a glut of oil, driven in part by the strategy of Saudi Arabia and other major producers to pump flat out.\u201cThere is incredible bearishness about the short-run prospects for oil as well as for the long-run prospects for oil,\u201d said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse. \u201cWhat\u2019s the old saying \u2014 there are more sellers than buyers.\u201dOil prices have dropped by nearly two-thirds in the past 16 months, but there were fresh developments behind this week\u2019s decline. Talk that a ban on oil exports from the United States might be lifted and the victory of the opposition party in Venezuela were both interpreted as events that would encourage more production in the next few years.But the biggest fundamental change in the oil market remains the decision by Saudi Arabia to force high-cost energy producers, particularly shale producers in the United States, out of the market by driving down prices.Instead of acting as a swing producer and curtailing its output to keep prices from dropping, Saudi Arabia has focused instead on preserving its market share. The predictable result is a glut of oil that has filled up inventories.Meeting in Vienna with other producers of the OPEC cartel last week, Saudi Arabia signaled once again that its full-tilt strategy would remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.\u201cWhat happened last week gave a green light to sell,\u201d Mr. Stuart said.The sustained drop in prices is starting to be felt among United States producers. For instance, the number of active rigs fell by the most in two months this week, according to Baker Hughes. The International Energy Agency also said on Friday that low prices were starting to take a toll on high-cost producers.But the agency also said oil supplies were still expected to grow next year, which provided more incentive for sellers Friday.\u201cThere is evidence the Saudi-led strategy is starting to work,\u201d the agency said in its monthly energy report. Still, it concluded \u201cthere will still be a lot of oil weighing on the market\u201d in 2016.For consumers, the drop in oil has been a boon. Still, the energy agency warned of the long-term consequences of low energy prices. \u201cSustained low prices will not necessarily create benefits for importing countries in the longer run as it could complicate the transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}

Sixty-three percent of Americans \u2014 including a bare majority of Republicans \u2014 said they would support domestic policy limiting carbon emissions from power plants.Two-thirds of Americans think the United States should join a binding international agreement to curb growth of greenhouse gas emissions, but a slim majority of Republicans remains opposed, the poll found.Republicans in Congress and many Republican governors oppose Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal to limit emissions from power plants, for example, complicating his ability to meet targets he has set to comply with United Nations climate goals. And the Obama administration has made it clear that any agreement it would sign in Paris would not take the form of an internationally enforced treaty that would require Senate ratification.Still, the shift in public opinion has many advocates of strong climate change measures hopeful that the Paris talks could provide a turning point.Seventy-five percent of Americans polled said that global warming was already having a serious environmental impact or would in the future. Nine in 10 Democrats agreed, compared with 58 percent of Republicans. One-third of Republicans said they believed it would never have much of an impact on the environment.Thinking about policies to reduce carbon emissions, Americans generally favor regulating business activity more than taxing consumers. The poll found broad support for capping power plant emissions. Half of all Americans said they thought the government should take steps to restrict drilling, logging and mining on public lands, compared with 45 percent who opposed such restrictions. Support for limiting mineral extraction on public lands rose to 58 percent among Democrats.But just one in five Americans favored increasing taxes on electricity as a way to fight global warming; six in 10 were strongly opposed, including 49 percent of Democrats. And support was not much higher for increasing gasoline taxes, at 36 percent over all.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.In advance of this week\u2019s summit meeting, Mr. Obama made the case that addressing climate change is an economic imperative.While it is true that young Americans tend to be slightly more concerned about global warming than their elders, their views are not as environmentally proactive as those of some other demographic groups. Fifty-one percent of respondents to the new poll said they worried about global warming a great deal or a fair amount. Among adults under 30, the number was 54 percent; for Democrats, it climbed to 60 percent.And while 68 percent of respondents under 30 supported taxing companies\u2019 carbon emissions, that was just five points higher than the overall number \u2014 and lower than the nearly three-quarters of Democrats who professed support.During the darkest days of the recent recession, concern about climate change became subsumed by economic anxieties. But concern about the environment is now back to pre-recession levels. Most respondents to the recent poll said that in situations where a sacrifice must be made, protecting the environment was more important than stimulating the economy \u2014 by 54 percent to 34 percent.This is nearly identical to the national numbers in spring 2007, just before the Great Recession, when 52 percent took the side of protecting the environment and 34 percent said the economy was more important. In 2009, at the depths of the recession, people favored stimulating the economy by more than two to one.The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Nov. 18 to 22 among 1,030 adults.

{"Headline": "California Wants to Store Water for Farmers, but Struggles Over How to Do It", "Date": "2015-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Parched WestThis state, forward-looking on other environmental issues, has been stymied for decades over how to upgrade its plumbing system, an immense but aging network of reservoirs and canals that move water from the mountainous north to the drier south.But the prolonged drought of recent years has prodded California into action, with new laws and a willingness to spend public money to better prepare for a future that is likely to be more difficult because of climate change. The state must decide how best to save the water that arrives between the drought years, weighing the value of billion-dollar construction projects against smaller and less expensive measures.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a level of attention and commitment that we haven\u2019t seen in decades, a desire to move forward,\u201d said Lester A. Snow, a former head of water resources for California and veteran of the state\u2019s water battles.Big decisions loom. What parts of California\u2019s water system, the most elaborate in the world, need fixing the most? And how can it be done in a way that helps the state\u2019s enormous farm economy, which uses huge amounts of water, without sacrificing the needs of its cities or the environment?11 PhotosThe path California chooses will affect people across the United States and even around the world.In the 20th century, cheap and plentiful water for irrigation, coupled with rich soils and a special climate, turned the state into a cornucopia that has stocked the nation\u2019s refrigerators and cupboards for generations. These days, farmers are also helping to supply developing countries like China with fruit and nuts.But keeping California\u2019s agricultural land in production depends on fixing its growing water problems.As the state considers its options, many farmers want to revive the approach that worked for them in the last century: building dams. Not far from this tiny hamlet northeast of Fresno, for instance, the government is thinking of building a new artificial lake just above an existing one.Yet, as agricultural interests prepare a major push to get water projects built, doubts are growing about whether spending huge sums to pour high walls of concrete are the best way to solve California\u2019s water problems.Many independent experts, and almost all environmental groups, argue that dams would supply relatively little water for the money. They contend that Californians need to move aggressively to more modern methods of water management, reducing waste to a minimum and learning to live within the limits imposed by an arid environment.\u201cWe are living with a legacy of decades of overallocating our water, and refusing to say \u2018no\u2019 when people want more,\u201d said Doug Obegi, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. \u201cWhen people think they are entitled to more water than exists in the system, that\u2019s a recipe for failure.\u201dCalifornia is able to supply a third of America\u2019s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts because it is one of only five major growing regions of the world with what is known as a Mediterranean climate. That means it is cold and wet in the winter, then dry and sunny in the summer. The bright, clear days create ideal growing conditions.The hitch is water. Precipitation is erratic, and when it comes, it tends to fall in the mountainous northern and eastern parts of the state, while much of the population and farming are in the south and west. Winter snows in the Sierra Nevada are crucial, sending billions of gallons of water racing down the state\u2019s rivers with the spring snowmelt.The extended drought has compounded the problems. Across large parts of the Central Valley, farmers have survived by pumping groundwater at a furious rate, causing water tables to drop precipitously and thousands of shallow wells to run dry.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a free-for-all for the next 25 years,\u201d said John D. Bredehoeft, a retired federal hydrologist in Sausalito who spent decades studying water in California. \u201cI don\u2019t think the water\u2019s going to last for 25 years.\u201dAs water problems have worsened in the Central Valley, many farmers have blamed the environmentalists who, the farmers argue, are choosing to waste water on fish at the expense of people.For people who share this view, one proposed solution is to overcome the political power of the environmentalists and build more dams. When California voters, frightened by the drought, approved $7.12 billion in new bonds last year to improve the water infrastructure, agricultural interests pushed to include $2.7 billion for new water storage.Yet, in part because California already has so many dams and the best sites were used up long ago, all that money would buy relatively little extra water, according to experts who have studied the proposals.\u201cWilliam Mulholland is in the grave, and so should his ideas be,\u201d Ms. Swenson said. \u201cThe days when you could come up here and stick your straw in to satisfy your insatiable demands \u2014 those days are over.\u201dElsewhere in the state, many farm groups support the tunnel plan, but others are wary, fearing they will be stuck with a large bill in exchange for minimal benefits. Mr. Brown has pledged to make water users, not taxpayers, pay for the tunnels, but it is not clear whether he will be able to pull together the financing.The economics of the proposed dams are just as difficult. Farmers are not willing to pay the full costs, and a huge battle is expected over how to spend the $2.7 billion approved by California voters for water-storage projects.For Don Cameron, a farmer south of Fresno, a wet winter 33 years ago led to an idea about how to take advantage of the vast natural water storage system underground. He noticed that some grapevines along the San Joaquin River were flooded for months in the winter, but that those same vines produced a lush crop of grapes in the summer.The average American consumes more than 300 gallons of California water each week by eating food that was produced there.He had to wait until 2011, the last wet year before the current drought, to act on his idea. With a small government grant and help from scientists and an environmental group, Mr. Cameron diverted water to a thousand acres of the farm he manages, Terranova Ranch, deliberately flooding fields of grapes, pistachio trees and hay.Conventional wisdom among farmers held that the roots of the crops, standing in floodwater for weeks on end, were likely to rot. \u201cI think our neighbors thought we were crazy, to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. Cameron recalled.But Mr. Cameron\u2019s fields suffered little damage. And the water soaked deep into the ground, helping to recharge the underground supply. Nowadays, Mr. Cameron is a man in demand, fielding telephone calls and interviews from around the state.It turns out that California already has a place to store immense amounts of water, without necessarily building new dams.Decades of overpumping have left the state\u2019s water-bearing formations, known as aquifers, with enormous spare capacity. By some estimates, California could pump 10 times as much water into the aquifers as could be held by the new dams on the drawing board.Such groundwater storage is already occurring in parts of the state, mainly in urban areas. It is not a perfect solution for agriculture: Water pumped into the ground and then pulled back out can pick up salts and other pollutants.But no option confronting California farmers is perfect. Experts say this one has the potential to be far cheaper than dams. And if a new dam is built \u2014 at Temperance Flat, say \u2014 it could potentially help supply water for the aquifer-recharging projects.The new groundwater law that the Legislature passed last year would give farmers stronger incentive to cooperate in such plans. In wet years, they might allow their fields to be flooded in the winter or early spring to recharge the groundwater, and they would then be entitled to pump a certain amount out in dry years.If floods come this winter, Mr. Cameron will wish he were in a position to go beyond his 2011 experiment, capturing more water. But, like many farmers, he does not yet have the canals and gear in place to make that work, a big reason the farmers could be forced to watch millions of gallons of floodwater escape to the sea this winter.Over the long term, Dr. Hanak believes, the state should not only encourage farmers to store water in the ground, but also consider creating a market to allow them to buy and sell their allotments.\u201cThese aquifers need to be seen as strategic national reserves that can help us weather more climate variability in the future,\u201d Dr. Konar said. \u201cRight now, we have pretty much the opposite situation \u2014 we\u2019re just seeing rapid overexploitation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "14 Airports in Greece to Be Privatized in $1.3 Billion Deal", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greece\u2019s leftist-led government on Monday signed its first major privatization deal, granting a German company the right to lease and manage more than a dozen regional airports.The contract, worth 1.2 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, is part of an effort to privatize state assets and adopt economic changes demanded by international creditors under Greece\u2019s \u20ac86 billion bailout program. Some other measures are under debate in the Greek Parliament and are scheduled for a vote Tuesday night.The airport contract talks were revived only after Mr. Tsipras capitulated to creditors during the summer as Greece teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, accepting the country\u2019s third bailout since 2010.The government\u2019s debt problems have for years deprived many Greek airports of sufficient money for maintenance and modernization. One exception is the Athens airport, which has already been partly privatized and generally lives up to its role as a modern international hub.Under the accord, Fraport and its Greek partner, the energy firm Copelouzos, have secured a 40-year lease on 14 provincial airports, including those on the popular tourist islands of Corfu, Mykonos, Rhodes and Santorini.The consortium, which is to assume management of the airports in the fall of 2016, has agreed to pay annual rental fees of \u20ac23 million and to spend \u20ac330 million over the next four years to revamp the facilities, which in many cases are dilapidated and substandard. The consortium said it planned to invest \u20ac1.4 billion over the life of the lease.Commenting after the signing, Stergios Pitsiorlas, the head of Greece\u2019s privatization agency, described the deal as \u201ca very significant development and a strong message, in all directions, that the Greek economy is winning the trust of markets and entering the road toward growth.\u201dSince 2010, when Greece signed its first international bailout, its creditors have pushed it to privatize state assets as a way of raising much-needed revenue and spurring growth. However, several governments displayed little appetite for selling assets, and only around \u20ac3 billion in revenue has been raised so far through privatizations.The current bailout program calls for the government to raise an additional \u20ac6.2 billion from selling or awarding management contracts for state-owned assets over the next three years, money that is to go toward reducing national debt and increasing sorely needed investment.The latest package of economic measures now under debate by Parliament includes the creation of a new privatization fund that would be jointly supervised by Greek and foreign officials. Other actions on the list include overhauling the Greek energy sector and allowing the sale of delinquent loans held by Greek banks to so-called distressed debt funds. (Greece\u2019s creditors are particularly concerned about an estimated \u20ac107 billion of nonperforming loans that are sapping the country\u2019s banks.)The new measures are widely expected to pass in Tuesday night\u2019s vote because the government\u2019s Syriza-led coalition has a majority, albeit by three seats, in the 300-member Parliament. The package must be approved if Greece is to receive its next allotment of \u20ac1 billion in bailout money.A series of austerity measures and economic overhauls adopted over the last two months has fueled public anger and prompted two general strikes. Mr. Tsipras, who once railed against austerity, has insisted that Syriza has not forgotten its pledges to restore social justice.The government will face a much tougher test next month when it tries to overhaul Greece\u2019s costly and dysfunctional pension system. Greek officials are resisting calls for more cuts to pensions, noting that payments have been cut more than 10 times in the last six years. They are seeking other ways of bolstering the system, notably by imposing higher social security contributions for employers and workers.The idea is said to have been greeted with skepticism by creditors, though, as unemployment remains high and thousands of businesses are struggling to remain afloat.Securing support for an overhaul of the pension system is likely to be the biggest challenge yet for Mr. Tsipras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "By Buying Hong Kong Paper, Alibaba Seeks to Polish China\u2019s Image", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s propaganda boss, Liu Qibao, has extolled the success of Alibaba, the giant Internet company, as the kind of uplifting story that offsets the country\u2019s reputation abroad as corrupt and authoritarian.In Beijing, those who worry about China\u2019s reputation abroad were elated by Alibaba taking the helm of a storied newspaper fallen on hard times and pledging to use it to enhance China\u2019s reputation.\u201cThis is a good thing,\u201d said Wang Wen, a researcher at Renmin University in Beijing and a former editor at Global Times, a popular Chinese tabloid that often criticizes the Western media. \u201cThis is an attempt by the country\u2019s social power to alter the country\u2019s image,\u201d he added, referring to private corporations and others outside the direct control of the state.Alibaba has agreed to pay $266 million in the deal, a small outlay for the company, which has annual revenue of $12 billion. But the political reverberations could range far beyond the sale price. The questions are how much pressure the Chinese government will place on Alibaba to pursue the party\u2019s longstanding quest for more sympathetic coverage overseas, how Alibaba will respond, and what it might get in return.Winning a much larger global readership online for The South China Morning Post will entail attracting readers with scoops and protecting its credibility as more than a government-blessed public relations vehicle, several news industry insiders said. But party censors under President Xi Jinping have been increasingly intolerant of critical reports in the domestic news media.Alibaba says it wants its latest acquisition to offer \u201cfair and accurate\u201d reporting that will improve global understanding of China. That, it argues, will bring value for Alibaba\u2019s investors, because negative reports about China in the Western news media are hurting the company\u2019s shares, which are listed in New York.But businesses such as Alibaba that throw their spending power behind the government\u2019s message can also win points with policy makers, said Chen Ping, a mainland-born media investor and businessman in Hong Kong. \u201cDoing this will enhance his standing in the eyes of the Communist Party,\u201d Mr. Chen said of Jack Ma, the shrewd founder of Alibaba, who is the chairman of the company.China\u2019s government has long been testy about its image in the West. In recent years, it has tried to influence coverage by blocking websites and restricting visas for journalists of news outlets deemed too negative, and also by spending heavily on the international expansion of state-run outlets like China Central Television and China Daily.Alibaba\u2019s purchase comes as the Chinese government has staked out more ambitious positions abroad, from hosting the summit meeting of the Group of 20 leading economies next year, to establishing a new international development bank, to extending its military power, all subjects for which the government covets positive spin.Supporters of the Chinese government said Mr. Ma could attract foreign readers by offering a counterweight to Western news media. Alibaba plans to drop the paper\u2019s online paywall, allowing the world to read its stories for free.Unlike many Western media outlets, it would provide news from China that was \u201cnot written from an ideological point of view of what China should be,\u201d said George Yeo, a senior executive under Robert Kuok, the Malaysian billionaire who has sold the paper to Alibaba.The South China Morning Post still carries cachet in Hong Kong, where it has long been the leading homegrown English-language newspaper. It is read by investors in the city interested in China, and it has produced scoops on corruption scandals and policy shifts.But it is a frayed institution with a depleted newsroom and a tendency toward anemic, uncontroversial articles on China. In the first half of 2015, it had an average circulation of about 102,000 print and digital copies, according to the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations, and visits to its website have fallen, putting out of reach its goal of 30 million page views a month, said a former editor at the newspaper who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his ties in the media industry.\u201cJack Ma is saying we\u2019re going to tell China\u2019s story more positively, and the stories we won\u2019t see is what is critical \u2014 stories questioning government policy, inquiring into the powerful, and in Hong Kong examining business,\u201d said Ken Doctor, an American news industry analyst, adding that it was unclear whether Mr. Ma understood that the power of a news outlet resided in its newsroom.Since it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong has preserved its own legal system and freedoms of expression that are unthinkable in mainland China. But many journalists say the exercise of those freedoms has become increasingly compromised, often by self-censorship.A journalist at The South China Morning Post, who requested anonymity in fear of being punished for speaking out, said that even before the sale to Alibaba there was a pattern of editors at the paper rejecting, shrinking or underplaying stories that might irk Beijing.\u201cI think this is really the last straw on the camel\u2019s back,\u201d the journalist said about the sale to Alibaba.\u201cOn the one hand, they want to have this facade of this credible, independent newspaper, but on the other hand they\u2019ve got this agenda of pleasing the Communist Party,\u201d the journalist said. \u201cThe two simply cannot go hand in hand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Anne Boyer has not forgotten this. She has written a sad, beautiful, passionate book that registers the political economy of literature and of life itself. This sounds dry, abstract: It\u2019s not. Boyer\u2019s book moves as if the contents of a \u00adbrokenhearted country song were mediated through the ferocious mind of a Hannah Arendt. Boyer offers a self-portrait of the artist in a time of \u201cindentured moods,\u201d debt collection, chemical spills, amid her attempts at and refusals of writing, sewing and the daily care of herself and her small daughter.Does one have to be a \u201cproperty owner\u201d to make \u201cliterature\u201d?

Accounting \u201cgives the wrong forms to desire,\u201d Boyer suggests. This is a book of poetry (or is it lyric prose? Essay? Must one decide?) that also turns away from poetry: It has no interest in meter or prosody per se \u2014 rather, it is interested in the measuring of thought and feeling, in a slow amazing and amazed rendering of the negative space of official life.Boyer is fond of short forms and compressed forays \u2014 aphorism, epigram, vignette, list, fable, allegory: \u201cPoetry was the wrong art for people who love justice. It was not like dance music. Painting is the wrong art for people who love justice .\u2008.\u2008.

{"Headline": "Streaming Royalties Rise, but Not as High as Music Industry Wanted", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe decision, which takes effect next year, means that Pandora \u2014 the largest Internet radio service, and the music industry\u2019s primary antagonist over two years of litigation \u2014 will pay millions more in royalties to record labels and performing artists to use their songs. Last year Pandora paid 44 percent of its revenue, more than $400 million, in royalties for recordings.But the rate set by the judges on Wednesday was also much lower than what the music industry wanted. In filings in the case, SoundExchange, a nonprofit licensing agency that represented the record companies, had asked the judges to set a rate of 25 cents per 100 plays.In a statement, Brian P. McAndrews, Pandora Media\u2019s chief executive, called the decision \u201ca balanced rate that we can work with and grow from.\u201d\u201cThe new rate structure will enable continued investment by Pandora to drive forward a thriving and vibrant future for music,\u201d added Mr. McAndrews, who is also a director of The New York Times Company.Investors reacted positively to the news, which was announced after the close of the market. In after-hours trading, Pandora\u2019s stock rose more than 20 percent. \u201cCertainty is positive for any share price,\u201d said Laura Martin, an Internet and media analyst for Needham & Company. \u201cWe now know what the costs of content are going to be for the next five years. That allows Pandora to run their business.\u201dSoundExchange expressed disappointment.\u201cIt\u2019s only fair that artists and record labels receive a market price when their music is used,\u201d the group\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe believe the rates set by the C.R.B. do not reflect a market price for music and will erode the value of music in our economy. We will review the decision closely and consider all of our options.\u201dThe decision applies only to Internet radio services, which let people hear a set of songs tailored to their tastes, but not so-called on-demand services like Spotify, which let people choose exactly which song to listen to. The judges\u2019 decision also does not cover songwriting rights, which are set separately.For years, Internet radio services have operated under two different rate systems: one for so-called pureplays like Pandora \u2014 businesses that operate mainly on the Internet \u2014 and another for traditional broadcasters like the radio giant iHeartMedia that also have web streams. As a result of a settlement with the music industry in 2009, the pureplay companies paid record labels a lower royalty rate for web streams than the broadcasters did.The rates announced by the copyright judges on Wednesday eliminate that distinction, aligning the web rates of companies like Pandora with those of commercial broadcasters. So while Pandora\u2019s rate for its free version \u2014 which has advertising \u2014 will increase to 17 cents from 14, for outlets like iHeartRadio, the rate will decline from 25 cents.For their paid subscriptions, webcasters will pay 22 cents per 100 performances, which is also down from the current rate of 25 cents.The judges\u2019 full decision is still confidential while it is being reviewed by the parties in the case, and is expected to be released in full in the coming days.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Aging Society Changes the Story on Poverty for Retirees", "Date": "2015-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOne of the great success stories of the 20th century was the decline in poverty among the elderly. That story, however, is starting to change.Though there are big differences among nations, according to Stefano Scarpetta, director of employment labor and social affairs at the O.E.C.D., \u201cin a majority of countries, the replacement rate probably will be lower than the one people have experienced so far.\u201dIt is a consequence, of course, of a broad, inexorable trend: aging. That has raised the dependency rate across industrial societies. In 1950 there were 14 people aged 65 and over in O.E.C.D. countries for every 100 people of working age. Today there are 28. The trend is expected to continue for at least the next 50 years.On average, men and women are spending seven more years in retirement than they did in 1970.Much as this represents yet another great social achievement, it has also strained the finances of public pension systems, which largely rely on current taxes to pay for retirement benefits.Public spending on old-age pensions and survivors\u2019 benefits in the O.E.C.D. rose from 6.2 to 7.9 percent of overall economic output, on average, between 1990 and 2011.As governments of most industrial nations try to restore long-term financial stability to their pension systems \u2014 raising the retirement age, linking benefits more closely to workers\u2019 contributions and the like \u2014 there is a growing risk, as the O.E.C.D.\u2019s secretary general, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, put it, \u201cthat future pensions will not be sufficient.\u201dThis is hardly a shock: Demographics, like ocean liners, move slowly and can be spotted from afar. On top of that, the lackluster growth and high unemployment experienced across much of the Western world in the last few years is going to make it much harder for young workers who expect to retire around midcentury from accumulating enough money to sustain a decent living standard in old age.That all raises a question that seems to be studiously avoided in polite policy conversations: Is old-age poverty going to pick up again?While the prescription may seem obvious \u2014 policies that delay retirement and encourage working until later ages \u2014 it is far from infallible. Indeed, it is hardly certain that elderly workers could stay longer in the work force even if they wanted to.A low-wage worker entering the job market today at age 20, earning half the average wage over her career, can expect a public pension equivalent to 53 percent of her wages upon retirement \u2014 if, and this is a big if, she stays in the labor market uninterruptedly until the normal retirement age.That is (a) not a lot of money \u2014 a quarter of the average wage\u2014 and (b) somewhat unrealistic, given the odds of parenthood, unemployment and so many other things that might temporarily knock anyone out of a job.According to the analysis, it gets even worse if a worker enters the labor market at age 25 rather than 20. For the record, people in the O.E.C.D. today start working, on average, at 23.Fortunately, public pensions are not retirees\u2019 only source of support. Social Security, for example, is still understood as one leg in a three-legged stool supported by a private pension and retirement savings, too. Adding up these other bits would lift the retirement income of a typical low-wage American retiree to 88 percent of her average lifetime wage, or 90 percent after accounting for her lower tax rate on retirement. This is a big improvement on the 44 percent of her lifetime wage, 54 percent after taxes, that she would get from Social Security alone.What are the options to combat elderly poverty in the future? The challenge is particularly dire in the United States, despite a large young immigrant population, which reduces the demographic pressure: 21.5 percent of Americans 65 and older make less than half the nation\u2019s median income, almost double the O.E.C.D. average.A plausible strategy would be to increase the resources of public pension systems. In the United States, in fact, modest increases in payroll taxes, targeted on higher-income workers, could prevent the depletion of Social Security\u2019s trust funds.That poses challenges for most European countries, where taxes are relatively high, and seems politically dead on arrival in Washington \u2014 even though the tax burden is much lower in the United States \u2014 as long as tax-averse Republicans control Congress.The other alternative \u2014 which most industrialized countries see as the key to overcome their demographic stress \u2014 amounts to more work. While this is not an unreasonable proposition, it may not amount to the fix everyone is hoping for.There are two problems with the approach. One is distributional: Poorer workers in tough jobs may be unable to add years to their working life. They tend to die younger. Forcing them to shoulder the burden of increased longevity seems unfair and impractical.The other, potentially more complex problem, is that the job market has not adapted very well to this challenge.Consider a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute cited in the G.A.O. study, which asked workers 55 and older when they planned to retire. Almost half said 66 or older. More than 1 in 10 said never.Their aspirations do not fit reality: While there has been an increase in work among older Americans, only 14 percent retired after 66. Workers, the G.A.O. pointed out, \u201cmay have fewer years to work and save for retirement than they are planning.\u201dEmail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

Mitt Romney, of all people, now complains that \u201cincome inequality has gotten worse.\u201d Economic inequality is bad. Everybody thinks so.This simplifies somewhat. Some poll data suggest there exists a class of people who are not overly concerned about economic inequality, or at least not particularly interested in having the government do anything about it. (They are known, in statistical parlance, as \u201cmost Americans.\u201d) Furthermore, the undesirability of economic inequality, as opposed to that of poverty, is not self-evident. Even Piketty concedes that inequality \u201cis not necessarily bad in itself.\u201d The question is whether it is justified.Today\u2019s preoccupation with economic inequality, Watson writes, breeds an unhealthy skepticism about capitalism and shifts our focus away from the issue of poverty and toward the wealth of the so-called 1 percent. Though he doesn\u2019t blaze any new scholarly ground, anyone looking to play devil\u2019s advocate with Piketty-purchasing friends would be well served by his book.In this way, Frankfurt\u2019s anti-egalitarianism is more of a philosophical challenge than a libertarian crusade. If your focus is on how your income stacks up against that of everyone else, you are allowing other people\u2019s possessions to shape your sense of what you need and want. You are, in effect, alienated from yourself. Frankfurt also suggests that intellectuals, in devoting their attention to ratios of wealth, neglect a less precise but more pressing investigation: What is enough for a good life? What, for that matter, is a good life?Most explanations of the 2008 crash, seeking the causes of an overly indebted economy, emphasize factors like low interest rates, relaxed borrowing standards, mortgage securitization \u2014 anything that increased the availability of credit. Drennan is interested in why people were moved to take advantage of this easy money. Purchasing homes, he argues, was only part of it. Something else was a significant driver of debt. He finds that lower- and middle-class families, struggling with declining or stagnant incomes, made use of second mortgages, home equity loans and other such instruments to support their spending, notably on necessities like medical care and education.Why blame unequal incomes (as opposed to low ones) for this debt-fueled consumption? Drennan\u2019s answer is that prices for certain necessities like medical care and education, which rose much faster than inflation in the years leading up to the crash, appear to have been driven up by heightened demand among the wealthiest 10 percent, whose share of income grew. In other words, it was an attempt by those with less money to compensate for costs created by others with increasingly more money that contributed to the instability of the economy.Democrats, as we know, use higher taxes to fund programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which serve society\u2019s poor and vulnerable. That is the public welfare state. But Republicans do much the same thing in the service of a private welfare state: They use tax breaks to subsidize employer-sponsored 401(k) plans and employer-sponsored health insurance, which serve the better-off. Faricy observes that tax breaks, logically speaking, are just government spending in another guise (both cost the government money), and that programs like the 529 college savings account, which is supported by such a tax break, are welfare programs for rich families. (About 70 percent of that program\u2019s benefits go to households making more than $200,000 a year, costing the government $1 billion over the next decade.)For Faricy, the real question is not some fanciful speculation about whether you can tolerate a welfare state that hampers your freedom, but rather a matter of which of these two welfare states you want: the one that spends public money to increase economic inequality, or the one that spends public money to reduce it.James Ryerson is a senior staff editor in The Times\u2019s Op-Ed section.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Crimea\u2019s Isolation", "Date": "2015-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOnce a peninsula, Crimea has become an island. For nearly two years, the territory has been unrecognized, cut off from the mainland by a militarized border, embargoed and mostly forgotten by the international community and the media. The early optimism of some Crimeans that Russia would quickly integrate the peninsula and turn it into a showcase territory has evaporated.Last year, the Russian writer Leonid Kaganov said that the annexation of Crimea was like stealing an expensive cellphone without its charger. He was proved right. The full scale of Crimea\u2019s isolation became apparent recently: On Nov. 22, Ukrainian nationalists and Crimean Tatar activists sabotaged four power lines feeding Crimea with electricity from Ukraine, plunging the peninsula \u2014 and its two million residents \u2014 into darkness. This untenable situation has dragged on for over a month and even though power has been mostly restored, the overall state of affairs is still precarious.Emboldened by the havoc of the electricity crisis, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, announced on Dec. 16 that his country would halt trade with Crimea by mid-January and leave future electricity supply an open question.Crimea\u2019s economy can hardly afford any more isolation. Although Russia raised pensions and salaries in the local government and state-run companies after annexation, these gains have been erased by high inflation, a weak ruble and soaring costs of basic commodities because of the disruption of regular supply routes. Many private businesses are in shambles and the sun-drenched tourist season along the coastline \u2014 a mainstay of the Crimean economy since Soviet times \u2014 has become a pale shadow of its former self.The few foreign visitors these days seem to be hapless representatives of European fringe parties seeking publicity, old pals of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, like Silvio Berlusconi, and dazed-and-confused celebrities like the veteran American boxer Roy Jones Jr. At the same time, Crimea has experienced an exodus of young professionals. Sick and tired of the island life, they have decided to seek better fortunes in Ukrainian cities like Kiev and Lviv or the big cities of Western Europe.Geographically and politically secluded, blithely unaccountable to the outside world and sometimes even to Moscow, Crimea has become the perfect breeding ground for large-scale corruption, profiteering and human rights violations \u2014 a kind of black site, inaccessible to international monitoring organizations and beyond the reach of law. Crimea was run as a fief of local oligarchs and Mafia bosses for decades before the 2014 crisis, but the situation today is even bleaker, a result of rabid nationalism and divisive politics.The Crimean Tatars, the indigenous minority that has consistently opposed Russian rule, have been especially hard hit. Russian authorities have seized the headquarters of their governing body, the Mejlis, banned two Tatar leaders from visiting the peninsula and refused to renew the license of the Crimean Tatar television channel. At the same time, prominent members of the community have been subjected to harassment and intimidation. The Crimean Tatar activists who blew up the power lines last month did so while calling for the release of political prisoners and the end of political repression.What is the solution to the Crimean crisis? The authorities in Kiev, as well as many foreign governments, refuse to recognize the annexation of Crimea and insist that the peninsula return to within Ukraine\u2019s borders. At the same time that Prime Minister Yatsenyuk promises to cut off trade, President Petro O. Poroshenko is suggesting that the prospect of Ukrainian visa-free travel to the European Union will lure Crimeans back into Kiev\u2019s arms. It\u2019s a carrot-and-stick strategy that aims to make the living situation in Crimea as bleak as possible, while presenting Kiev as a future beacon of light. These tactics have little chance of success.On a visit to Kiev earlier this month, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced: \u201cThe United States does not, has not, never will recognize Russia\u2019s attempt to annex Crimea.\u201dBut Russia has already annexed Crimea. The takeover of the peninsula was duplicitous, and the March 2014 referendum was hardly fair, but there is no turning back. Had Russia unofficially occupied Crimea, as it did with Moldova\u2019s Transnistria and Georgia\u2019s Abkhazia and South Ossetia, there might still have been hope. But anyone who believes the Kremlin will relinquish its claim on Crimea because of a blockade, or that a majority of Crimeans will peacefully agree to return to being Ukrainian citizens is delusional or a demagogue. Crimea may be a millstone around Russia\u2019s neck, but it is also a crown jewel that it will guard at all costs. The peninsula will leave Moscow\u2019s control only if the Russian Federation itself falls apart.Many politicians recognize this in private yet do not dare say it out loud. Sooner or later, however, Ukraine and the international community need to come to terms with the facts. Keeping the peninsula in darkness and isolation, slowly strangling it, will certainly not deter Mr. Putin. It will only create another frozen conflict zone in the Black Sea region, allow criminal networks to flourish with impunity and provide convenient cover for continuing human rights violations.Settling the fait accompli status of Crimea is still a political taboo. Kiev cannot easily forgive the violence that Russia has committed against eastern Ukraine. There are fears that recognizing Russia\u2019s claim to Crimea would be construed as appeasement and could green-light the invasion of other regions in Russia\u2019s \u201cnear abroad.\u201dBut Crimea is a special case historically, geographically and politically. It is more than just a territory for Russia. It is part of a myth, a source of identity, a place that was once known as \u201cthe garden of the empire.\u201d Understanding that Crimea\u2019s return is the only nonnegotiable issue for Moscow, and accepting that politics is the art of the possible, opening international talks on the recognition of Crimea\u2019s de facto Russian status may be the only realistic solution.This may prove the most productive way to compel Moscow to fully cooperate on much thornier issues, like eastern Ukraine, and free Kiev to focus more fully on internal reforms. It could also lead to improvement of the human rights situation in Crimea itself by opening up the peninsula to the world (including monitoring organizations) and negotiating with the Russian government toward a strict and detailed road map for safeguarding the cultural and political rights of local minorities. Leaving the situation to fester in the darkness for another 10 or 20 years, turning Crimea into another Cuba, would not benefit anyone, Ukrainians, Russians, or least of all, Crimeans themselves.Dimiter Kenarov is a freelance journalist covering the Balkans and the Black Sea region.

{"Headline": "Republicans on Campaign Trail Largely Ignore the Climate Deal", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe near-silence among Republicans is a striking illustration of the vastly different roles that climate change is playing in the presidential primaries for the two major parties. In some ways, the ardor among Democrats to address it \u2014 and the lack of interest among Republicans in discussing it \u2014 makes it seem as if the parties are on different planets.The gulf between the parties also raises questions about what will happen once Mr. Obama leaves office. The climate accord requires countries to come back in 2020 with stronger climate plans than they already have.History suggests that each party\u2019s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.The Democratic candidates have vowed to follow Mr. Obama\u2019s lead in prioritizing climate change, each rolling out a plan to address the issue. In a statement on Saturday, Hillary Clinton called the climate accord a \u201chistoric step forward in meeting one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.\u201d Her top rival for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, went further, calling the agreement \u201ca step forward,\u201d but saying it \u201cgoes nowhere near far enough.\u201dRob Nichols, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, said: \u201cWhile the governor believes that climate change is real and that human activity contributes to it, he has serious concerns with an agreement that the Obama administration deliberately crafted to avoid having to submit it to the Senate for approval. That\u2019s an obvious indicator that they expect it to result in significant job loss and inflict further damage to our already sluggish economy.\u201dIssues like terrorism and immigration have consumed much of the debate in the Republican race. When climate change is discussed, Republicans often focus on the costs, voicing concerns similar to Mr. Kasich\u2019s. \u201cAmerica is not a planet,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said in September, explaining that he did not want to \u201cdestroy our economy\u201d by placing restrictive regulations on companies.Among Democrats, 66 percent prioritized protecting the environment, compared with 22 percent who thought the economy was more important.Roughly seven in 10 Democrats said they believed that global warming was caused mostly by human activity such as burning fossil fuels, compared with three in 10 Republicans. And 86 percent of Democrats said the United States should join an international treaty requiring the country to reduce emissions in order to fight global warming \u2014 more than twice the 42 percent of Republicans who took that position. Another Republican acknowledgment of the deal came from former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who on Sunday described it as a \u201cpositive development\u201d if \u201cmostly symbolic.\u201d Still, like other Republicans, he questioned the extent to which Mr. Obama had prioritized climate change over other matters.\u201cIt is a shame we don\u2019t see the same commitment from the Obama administration to address the present threat America faces from ISIS and radical Islam,\u201d Mr. Pataki said.Some Republican candidates say they believe that man-made climate change is real, but play down the issue.

Humans expand and polish a few of the most important articles.\u2014 While Facebook\u2019s virtual assistant M, introduced in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2015, uses AI to answer user questions, humans vet the answers to improve them.\u2014 IBM\u2019s Watson is employed at some hospitals in the United States to determine the best course of treatment for individual cancer patients. Watson analyzes genetic information and the medical literature, and then provides suggestions to the doctors in charge.Humans supervise these AI programs and make the ultimate decisions, but white-collar workers are understandably starting to worry about the day when AI can go it alone.Don\u2019t panic: Though the AI Revolution is underway, it is unlikely to eliminate many office jobs within the next five to 10 years. Current AI research and usage only targets specific tasks, like image recognition or data analysis, while most jobs require workers to draw on a broad range of skills.But I think it\u2019s important to understand why the job market will change. There have been important advances in AI in recent years, especially in the area known as deep learning. Rather than telling a computer exactly how to do a task with step-by-step programming, researchers employing a deep learning system step back and let it apply techniques such as pattern recognition and trial and error to teach itself how \u2014 techniques humans use. To be clear, \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d does not mean that such machines are sentient, as they are portrayed in science fiction; only that given more data, they may perform a task better.A team of researchers from Google announced a breakthrough in machine learning in 2012. They had created a network of 16,000 computer cores that was partly modeled on the human brain, with a billion connections between simulated neurons. The researchers fed 10 million images to the AI over three days and, unsupervised, it taught itself to recognize categories like human bodies and \u2014 the Internet\u2019s favorite \u2014 cats. In 2015 a group from DeepMind, a company acquired by Google, published research showing that a neural network had been given the same inputs as a human on dozens of Atari games from the \u201970s and \u201980s \u2014 the pixels and the score \u2014 and had become an expert player at some of them without having been given any prior instruction or the rules for the games.As the technology improves, we are giving AI systems more and more work to do, just as we did with computers in their infancy. In 2014 and 2015, Skype introduced simultaneous translation in English, French, German, Italian, Mandarin and Spanish. Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are all digital assistants that can carry out basic commands such as making to-do lists, playing music and tracking flights. Google has been testing self-driving cars and hopes to bring them to the public within the next four years.It\u2019s true that some sectors may experience a slowdown in hiring as AI handles specific parts of jobs, freeing up workers to focus on other tasks. Financial advisers and insurance agents have already teamed up with AI programs that, respectively, make recommendations for portfolio management and monitor for insurance fraud. This efficiency may mean that new job applicants will be turned away as the number of people required to staff a business declines.The news that will definitely happen in 2016.But history shows that employment usually recovers after a technological revolution \u2014 though the directions it can take may be unexpected. There is a lot of debate over how much disruption the AI Revolution will bring, but I am optimistic that new jobs will replace the old ones in areas we can\u2019t even imagine yet, just as the working world evolved after the Industrial Revolution. We don\u2019t blame the steam engine or tractors or sewing machines for unemployment now.AI has already created new opportunities. Consider a service like Magic, an SMS-based delivery startup that serves customers anywhere in the U.S. Magic\u2019s idea is that a user can get anything delivered on demand by text message, through the coordinated efforts of humans and AI. In China, similar startups employ hundreds of customer service staffers to cater to callers\u2019 various needs \u2014 though it\u2019s possible that digital assistants may one day take over from \u201cmanual intelligence.\u201dMany people may decide to return to school to gain new skills in these emerging fields. We may also see a surge of interest in jobs that require a broad range of abilities and human intuition, such as nursing, child care and sales. While massive open online courses like those offered on the platform I founded have already helped millions of people around the world to educate themselves, we can expect that working professionals will more routinely pursue further training as they try to stay ahead of the competition.It seems likely that developed countries will undergo the most disruptive changes \u2014 in some economies, the service sector accounts for over 70% of gross domestic product. In developing countries, the impact on white-collar workers is unlikely to be immediate, due to slower adoption of AI technology, though such regions may experience a decline in outsourced manufacturing jobs with further advances in robotics. This sounds worrisome only because we can\u2019t anticipate the new jobs that these technologies will bring and the new businesses that people will devise, as they always have. The future\u2019s still bright, thanks to our creativity \u2014 our unique trait.In July, an open letter from more than 1,000 AI and robotics researchers and other prominent figures \u2014 Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Steve Wozniak among them \u2014 warned against using AI in warfare and called for a ban on autonomous weapons. Even that technology is not as advanced as the sentient robots envisioned in the 2015 movies \u201cEx Machina\u201d or \u201cChappie.\u201d These movies imagine \u201cstrong\u201d AI, or AI that is generalized, and able to carry out most human activities, as opposed to \u201cweak\u201d or narrow AI, which is task-specific. No one can say whether strong AI will be created, and if so, when. I asked some Chinese AI scientists about it, and given their responses, I may as well have been asking about the possibility of alien life.That would be a world in which perhaps even child care jobs are threatened, but thank goodness we have many years before the dawn of strong AI-directed robots. In that future, we may not need to work very hard to support ourselves. The robots will be doing most of the labor, while we will have the time and leisure to explore what it is to be human.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Announces Further Stimulus Measures, but Investors Are Unimpressed", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the reaction to stimulus measures the central bank announced on Thursday \u2014 steps more timid than had been widely expected \u2014 suggested that Mr. Draghi somehow miscommunicated with the traders, pundits and prognosticators who set the course of financial markets.Around Europe, stock prices fell on Thursday after the central bank said it would extend its program of buying bonds and other assets by six months but would not raise the amount of monthly purchases. The central bank also changed a key interest rate to encourage banks to lend more, but did not cut key borrowing rates.Based on recent statements by Mr. Draghi and other top officials at the European Central Bank, investors had thought there would be much, much more.\u201cHe typically has underpromised and overdelivered,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, practice head for Europe at the consultancy firm Eurasia Group. \u201cThat is not the case this time around. What we\u2019ve got is the bare minimum of what people were expecting.\u201dIt was either a rare case of Mr. Draghi failing to send clear enough signals, or a sign that his proposals had met unexpected resistance among the 25 members of European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council, which met in Frankfurt on Thursday morning. At a news conference explaining the new steps, Mr. Draghi would say only that the moves had been approved by a \u201cvery large majority\u2019\u2019 of the Governing Council.The central bank is trying to give the lumbering eurozone economy a shove at the same time the Federal Reserve is getting ready to risk slowing down the United States economy by raising interest rates.The eurozone economy grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the third quarter \u2014 compared with a 2.1 percent rate in the United States. And unemployment across the 19-country euro currency union is 10.7 percent \u2014 more than double the United States\u2019s jobless figure.Mr. Draghi rebutted reporters\u2019 questions about why the new measures seemed more limited than what the economy might need. He described the steps as a recalibration of the central bank\u2019s stimulus program, which he said had been a success since it began in March.\u201cWe are doing more because it works, not because it fails,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to consolidate something that has been a success.\u201dBut some analysts said that Mr. Draghi had probably been unable to win over members of the Governing Council who think more stimulus is unnecessary, or who want to keep some monetary weapons in reserve in case the economic situation gets worse. Mr. Draghi acknowledged that terrorist attacks in Paris, along with the European influx of migrants from Syria, presented risks to the eurozone economy that are not yet possible to gauge.\u201cDraghi is now evidently coming up against more opposition,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients. Mr. Draghi \u201cdoes not have sufficient support within the E.C.B. Council to act on a grand scale,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.The Governing Council did decide to extend monthly purchases of government bonds and other assets, a way of pumping money into the economy, at least through March 2017.The bank also said it would increase the penalty it charges banks to keep money in its vaults as a way of pressuring them to lend more. Banks will pay interest of 0.3 percent to keep money at the central bank, compared with the previous rate of 0.2 percent.And the central bank expanded its purchases of bonds to include debt issued by regional and local governments.But the central bank did not announce an outright increase in its monthly spending on bonds beyond the current level of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, as many analysts had expected. And though it said it would be spending more as it reinvests repayments of principal from the bonds and other assets it acquires, the central bank provided no estimate of how big those receipts might be.Nor did it take other steps on interest rates that might encourage commercial banks to increase lending that might help revive the nearly dormant eurozone economy. Some analysts had expected a cut in the rate that banks pay to borrow short-term funds from the central bank. Their hope had been that the rate would drop to zero from its current 0.05 percent.The bond-buying program was originally planned to run at least through September 2016. Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that it could be extended beyond March 2017, \u201cif necessary.\u201dThe Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone equities, a key indicator, began falling even as Mr. Draghi was still speaking and ended the day off 3.6 percent. The euro rose more than 2 percent against the dollar, to $1.09, as investors raised their expectations of the returns they are likely to receive on money kept in European assets.A stronger euro is generally negative for the eurozone economy because it makes exports from the region more expensive for foreign customers. In addition, the central bank is trying to make market interest rates go down. A stronger euro means investors expect the rates to go up.Mr. Draghi had signaled in recent months that he was dissatisfied with the performance of the eurozone economy and that the central bank would intensify its already significant efforts to energize the economy and raise the region\u2019s worrisomely low inflation to a healthier level. Whether the measures announced on Thursday will make a difference remains to be seen.Eurozone inflation, at an annual rate of only 0.1 percent in November, is far below the European Central Bank\u2019s official target of just below 2 percent. Mr. Draghi and other members of the bank\u2019s governing council had all but promised that more stimulus measures would be coming on Thursday unless there was a substantial improvement in economic data.To skeptical questions from reporters on why the central bank was not doing more, in light of the recent data, Mr. Draghi defended the measures and the effects of the stimulus program so far.He said that eurozone government bond yields, a measure of governments\u2019 borrowing costs, had fallen since the stimulus program began, and that commercial bank lending rates were also lower.Economists are skeptical that the bank\u2019s stimulus measures so far have had a substantial effect on increasing the availability of credit in the eurozone, which is one of the program\u2019s goals. Many banks have other problems, like large numbers of troubled loans, that are keeping them from lending, no matter how cheaply they can borrow from the central bank.\u201cAll these measures have had an effect on the economy,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think our communication was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThese measures need time to be fully appreciated.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Renminbi Declines After Being Named a Global Currency, Posing Challenges", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut soon after reaching that milestone, the renminbi started slowly and steadily falling as Chinese companies and individuals moved huge sums of money out of the country\u2019s weakening economy.The falling currency sets a fresh challenge for Beijing\u2019s leaders as the Chinese renminbi is increasingly woven into the global marketplace. While a weaker currency helps the country\u2019s exporters, the government must also control the slide, or risk fanning market worries and trade tensions.So far, the Chinese government has stepped into currency markets repeatedly to control the tempo of the drop, but not enough to stop it.Over the last two weeks, the renminbi has dropped 1.3 percent against the dollar. The move follows a 4 percent devaluation in August. And while China\u2019s central bank has stayed studiously silent, most banking industry economists now expect the renminbi to continue slipping in the weeks and months to come.\u201cWe are looking for larger depreciation in the first half of next year, and then a stabilization,\u201d said Ryan Lam, the head of research at Shanghai Commercial Bank, a Hong Kong institution.The currency is partly a barometer of global forces, a sign of the Chinese economy\u2019s weakness and the dollar\u2019s strength. It also reflects the market\u2019s bet that the currency will continue to fall as the Chinese government looks to help the country\u2019s economy by making exporters more competitive.Every morning this last week, the central bank has weakened by an additional 0.1 or 0.2 percent its daily fixing of the value of the renminbi, which sets the midpoint for the currency\u2019s daily trading range.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, faces a tricky balancing act.While a weaker currency helps Chinese exporters, it also adds to the country\u2019s already widening trade surplus with the United States.A continued drop in the currency could start trade issues in the midst of the American presidential elections. Candidates mentioned China nearly two dozen times in Tuesday\u2019s Republican presidential debate, none of them favorably. Carly Fiorina described China as a \u201crising adversary\u201d and asserted that like North Korea, \u201cthey, too, recognize one thing: strength and their own economic interest.\u201dSome longtime American critics of China\u2019s currency policies had tried to persuade the Obama administration to try to block the I.M.F. decision, contending that the renminbi continues to be heavily controlled by the Chinese government. Those critics of China\u2019s currency policies point to the recent weakness as evidence.\u201cIt\u2019s not at all surprising to me that once they got what they wanted, the renminbi is sliding further downhill,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. \u201cWe have to take much tougher action against the Chinese government if we\u2019re going to have success combating currency manipulation.\u201dThe I.M.F. has a policy of not commenting on short-term currency fluctuations, while the People\u2019s Bank of China and the United States Treasury very seldom do so. All three declined to issue statements on the renminbi\u2019s drop since the I.M.F. decision three weeks ago.The I.M.F. had said that China has adopted substantial reforms aimed at making the renminbi more \u201cfreely usable.\u201d The Treasury accepted this in lending American support to the decision by the I.M.F.\u2019s board to accept the renminbi. The I.M.F. and the Treasury have both urged China to let markets play a greater role in setting the value of the renminbi, which makes it harder for them to object now when market forces push down the currency.Those market forces are tougher to manage, although China still has formidable resources to do so.It has the world\u2019s largest trade surplus. And until the last couple of years, that kept the renminbi on a path of gradual appreciation. But money is sluicing out of the country now, and it is more than offsetting the money that comes in from China\u2019s selling of more goods overseas.The Chinese government has responded to faltering investment spending in the country by cutting interest rates. While lower lending rates have helped housing prices and construction by making mortgages cheaper, lower rates on bank deposits have also given an extra incentive for Chinese investors to look overseas for opportunities. At the same time, the Federal Reserve is now raising interest rates, making it more attractive to keep money in dollars.The People\u2019s Bank also has far less autonomy than central banks in the West. Major currency policy decisions, including the decision to let the renminbi sink steadily lower against the dollar, are made by Communist Party leaders, leaving the central bank to manage day-to-day interventions in the markets.Still, China has more ability than most countries to prevent a plunge. The nation has the world\u2019s largest foreign exchange reserves, $3.5 trillion worth of dollars, euros and other currencies.An official news outlet, People\u2019s Daily, reported last month that the authorities had closed an underground bank that had handled illegal foreign exchange transactions totaling $64 billion, mainly money leaving the country, since the start of 2013. The authorities needed 35,000 sheets of paper to print records from the underground bank, People\u2019s Daily reported.Chinese exporters \u2014 and importers in the United States and Europe \u2014 are celebrating the renminbi\u2019s weakness.Betty Chong, a director of the J.C. & Winsons Company, which manufactures gloves, hats and scarfs in Wuxi for export, said that she no longer added a premium to her prices as a buffer against appreciation of the renminbi. \u201cThe devaluation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar of course helps my exports \u2014 my goods are comparatively more competitive than those from nearby manufacturers in Bangladesh, Vietnam and India,\u201d she said.But because the dollar has faltered in the past two weeks, the drop in the renminbi lately has been even sharper against other currencies. The renminbi has fallen 3.7 percent against the euro in the past two weeks, for example.A weaker renminbi is not a complete boon to Chinese companies.Zhang Zepeng, the sales manager at the Qingdao Reliance Refrigeration Equipment Company, which makes cold-storage rooms and refrigerator compressors in Qingdao, has profited from a weaker renminbi on its exports. But he is concerned about rising costs for supplies bought overseas, since his company also sells within China.\u201cSince we need to import some of our raw materials, I do not want to see the RMB further devalue to, say, 6.7 or 6.8 against the U.S. dollar, since that will mean we will have to pay more for our raw material imports as well,\u201d he said. It is now around 6.5 to the dollar.If China does allow the renminbi to decline further in the coming months, it would not be the first emerging market to achieve a breakthrough in international economic relations only to see its currency soon tumble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electric Scooters, and a Network", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Energy for TomorrowTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 Across Asia, motorized two-wheeled vehicles provide mobility for the masses, but emissions from hundreds of millions of scooters and motorcycles are responsible for more than half of traffic pollution in many cities, choking the air with hazardous levels of benzene and particulate matter, in addition to greenhouse gases.This year, a Taiwan-based startup called Gogoro has been using the scooter-filled streets of Taipei to test its Smartscooter, an electric scooter with an efficient all-electric drive train, sleek design and Internet of Things ingenuity. But Gogoro doesn\u2019t want to be called a scooter company. It sees itself as an energy services company at heart.\u201cWhat technology has done to content, it can also do to energy,\u201d said Horace Luke, Gogoro\u2019s chief executive. The company operates a 4G-connected network of 90 battery-swapping stations around metropolitan Taipei serving a fleet of 2,000-plus smartscooters that are challenging their gasoline-powered rivals in performance \u2014 zero to 30 in just over 4 seconds \u2014 convenience, and environmental impact.The Smartscooter is quickly gaining market share. As of late November, Gogoro\u2019s flagship vehicle accounted for 95 percent of Taipei\u2019s electric vehicles and 5 percent of scooters overall, Mr. Luke said.Gogoro scooters are powered by two lithium-ion batteries that use the same Panasonic cells as Tesla batteries, with one charge enabling travel of up to 60 miles. When it\u2019s time to swap in fresh batteries, a smartphone app offers directions to the closest station with available batteries (one is a 7-eleven convenience store). In seconds, the user replaces used batteries \u2014 which send vehicle diagnostics to the Gogoro network via Bluetooth \u2014 with the newest and most-charged batteries at the station.Panasonic has bought into Gogoro\u2019s vision. In November, Gogoro announced that the Japanese company had joined the Taiwan government and the billionaire Samuel Yin as Series B, or second round, investors in Gogoro, making it the second electric vehicle maker to attract Panasonic capital, the other being Tesla. Shortly after raising $130 million in Series B funding, Gogoro announced that it would expand into Europe, beginning with Amsterdam. \u201cThe fundamentals of how people live changed in a decade with the smartphone,\u201d Mr. Luke said. \u201cIf we put the same effort into how energy is consumed, how much can we change things in 10 years?\u201dMr. Luke speaks from experience. He was chief innovation officer at the Taiwan-based smartphone maker HTC from 2006 to 2011, helping transform the company from one that made products for other companies to a global brand. While at HTC, Mr. Luke and a colleague, Matt Taylor, began discussing their vision for a new company that would leverage technology for social impact. Being based in Taiwan \u2014 where 14 million scooters serve a population of 23 million \u2014 scooters seemed like a good place to start.\u201cThe scooter hasn\u2019t seen much evolution in the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cWe asked ourselves if we could apply modern technology to something we see buzzing in the streets every day and make a better product in the process.\u201dIn 2011, the two men co-founded Gogoro, with Taylor as chief technology officer. They decided to rebuild the scooter from the ground up. Their initial focus was on performance and innovation, but minimizing environmental impact quickly became important.In Taiwan, pollution from scooter exhaust is a public health concern. Studies have found correlations between higher measurements of the fine particulate matter classified as PM2.5 in the air and increased cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in local hospitals. During peak traffic hours, exhaust hangs heavy on the city\u2019s scooter lanes, also affecting air quality for nearby pedestrians. The amount of pollutants found in emissions from a new gas scooter exceeds the pollution found in new car emissions by a factor of 100 to 1,000, said Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t of the Switzerland-based Paul Scherrer Institut. Scooters using two-stroke engines are the worst culprits, he said.\u201cThe two-stroke engine scooter is the first vehicle to think about in terms of going all-electric, even before larger vehicles, because the pollution is much worse,\u201d said Mr. Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t, who researched scooter emissions from 2010 through 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s the logical next step in reducing traffic pollution in many Asian cities.\u201dThe Taipei government agrees, and is actively promoting electric scooter purchases. The city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection offers replacement subsidies of around $45 for residents who retire their two-stroke scooters. A subsidy of up to $800 is available to those who replace their gas motorcycles with electric scooters. Gogoro Smartscooters currently cost between $2,200 and $2,375.In Gogoro\u2019s most recent round of funding, the government also invested $30 million via its Taiwan Development Fund. The company appeals to a government concerned by the vulnerability of its semiconductor industry, an economic pillar that faces increasing competition from China. \u201cThey see Gogoro as a huge opportunity for furthering the tech sector,\u201d Mr. Luke said.Taiwanese themselves have welcomed Gogoro. Elaine Kuan, a 29-year-old corporate accountant in Taipei, said she bought her Smartscooter in late July for its ease of riding and convenient technology, but also for its low environmental impact. \u201cI have asthma, so air pollution is a big deal to me,\u201d Ms. Kuan said. \u201cI hope that starting with myself I can slowly influence others and make the planet a place without vehicle emission pollution.\u201dPerformance and convenience were the two main reasons Darren Liu, a 31-year-old pastry chef, bought his Smartscooter. \u201cThe riding experience and acceleration are much better than my previous gas-powered bike,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first electric scooter I\u2019ve seen that can get up into the hills.\u201d The battery swap model was also a big selling point. His previous experience using a relative\u2019s electric scooter required hours of charging, compared with 30 seconds to swap his Gogoro batteries.As it expands beyond greater Taipei to Taoyuan \u2014 where it is headquartered \u2014 and the tech hub Hsinchu, Gogoro is exploring the possibilities offered by a growing network of battery stations. \u201cAt our core, we\u2019re an energy company,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cOnce the mix is actually working, it\u2019s readily scalable.\u201d The stations cost less than $10,000, have a small footprint and require only an outlet and Internet access, he said.Mr. Luke said his company envisions an open system in which other companies develop products that can use Gogoro\u2019s batteries. Many companies \u2014 in fields as diverse as robotics, logistics and appliances \u2014 have inquired, he said. But he added that Gogoro\u2019s longer-term vision was focused on \u201chow to take energy and give it back to the grid when it needs it most.\u201dGogoro\u2019s entrance into the market this year comes as car companies including General Motors, Ford and Daimler-Benz are beginning to view themselves as service providers rather than manufacturers.\u201cThere\u2019s a transformation in the market where companies are being expected to expand into energy services,\u201d said John Gartner of the consultancy Navigant Research. Companies that get involved in electric-powered mobility will naturally move toward stationary storage, he said.\u201cThey\u2019re looking to expand both markets by getting to economies of scale faster,\u201d Mr. Gartner added. Mr. Luke said that taking the scooter to Amsterdam in the first half of 2016 would provide a platform for demonstrating the role of Gogoro\u2019s scooters and battery stations to new markets.\u201cIf you think about smart cities in the world today, Amsterdam comes up in the top three, if not the top one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of success in Taipei. We\u2019re taking that momentum and building on that to move into Europe quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders: To Rein In Wall Street, Fix the Fed", "Date": "2015-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWALL STREET is still out of control. Seven years ago, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department bailed out the largest financial institutions in this country because they were considered too big to fail. But almost every one is bigger today than it was before the bailout. If any were to fail again, taxpayers could be on the hook for another bailout, perhaps a larger one this time.To rein in Wall Street, we should begin by reforming the Federal Reserve, which oversees financial institutions and which uses monetary policy to maintain price stability and full employment. Unfortunately, an institution that was created to serve all Americans has been hijacked by the very bankers it regulates.The recent decision by the Fed to raise interest rates is the latest example of the rigged economic system. Big bankers and their supporters in Congress have been telling us for years that runaway inflation is just around the corner. They have been dead wrong each time. Raising interest rates now is a disaster for small business owners who need loans to hire more workers and Americans who need more jobs and higher wages. As a rule, the Fed should not raise interest rates until unemployment is lower than 4 percent. Raising rates must be done only as a last resort \u2014 not to fight phantom inflation.What went wrong at the Fed? The chief executives of some of the largest banks in America are allowed to serve on its boards. During the Wall Street crisis of 2007, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive and chairman of JPMorgan Chase, served on the New York Fed\u2019s board of directors while his bank received more than $390 billion in financial assistance from the Fed. Next year, four of the 12 presidents at the regional Federal Reserve Banks will be former executives from one firm: Goldman Sachs.These are clear conflicts of interest, the kind that would not be allowed at other agencies. We would not tolerate the head of Exxon Mobil running the Environmental Protection Agency. We don\u2019t allow the Federal Communications Commission to be dominated by Verizon executives. And we should not allow big bank executives to serve on the boards of the main agency in charge of regulating financial institutions.If I were elected president, the foxes would no longer guard the henhouse. To ensure the safety and soundness of our banking system, we need to fundamentally restructure the Fed\u2019s governance system to eliminate conflicts of interest. Board members should be nominated by the president and chosen by the Senate. Banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed\u2019s boards and to handpick its members and staff. Board positions should instead include representatives from all walks of life \u2014 including labor, consumers, homeowners, urban residents, farmers and small businesses.The Fed must also make sure that financial institutions are investing in the productive economy by providing affordable loans to small businesses and consumers that create good jobs. How? First, we should prohibit commercial banks from gambling with the bank deposits of the American people. Second, the Fed must stop providing incentives for banks to keep money out of the economy. Since 2008, the Fed has been paying financial institutions interest on excess reserves parked at the central bank \u2014 reserves that have grown to an unprecedented $2.4 trillion. That is insane. Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that would be used to provide direct loans to small businesses.Third, as a condition of receiving financial assistance from the Fed, large banks must commit to increasing lending to creditworthy small businesses and consumers, reducing credit card interest rates and fees, and providing help to underwater and struggling homeowners.We also need transparency. Too much of the Fed\u2019s business is conducted in secret, known only to the bankers on its various boards and committees. Full and unredacted transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee must be released to the public within six months, not five years, which is the custom now. If we had made this reform in 2004, the American people would have learned about the housing bubble well in advance of the financial crisis.In 2010, I inserted an amendment in Dodd-Frank to audit the emergency lending by the Fed during the financial crisis. We need to go further and require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a full and independent audit of the Fed each and every year.Financial reforms must not stop with the central bank. We must reinstate Glass-Steagall and break up the too-big-to-fail financial institutions that threaten our economy. But we need to start with fundamental change. The sad reality is that the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t regulate Wall Street; Wall Street regulates the Fed. It\u2019s time to make banking work for the productive economy and for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And it begins by making the Federal Reserve a more democratic institution, one that is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans rather than the billionaires on Wall Street.Bernie Sanders is a senator from Vermont and a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president.Advertisement"}

Bartlett III is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law and faculty co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law, Business and the Economy. Justin McCrary is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law and the director of the Berkeley Social Science Data Laboratory.Like all dark pools, IEX operates as an alternative trading system. In September, Mr. Katsuyama filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to make IEX an official stock exchange. The comment period recently closed, so an action by the agency is expected soon. Although the S.E.C. originally set a deadline of Dec. 21 to act on the application, it recently asked for another 90 days to make a decision.Imagine you\u2019re a trader looking to sell 100,000 shares of XYZ, and the national best bid and offer across all exchanges stands at $10.00 and $10.01. To get the best price, you might try posting a limit order on an exchange at the national best offer of $10.01 and wait for a market \u201cbuy\u201d order to fill it. But success is uncertain: A market order may never arrive, and even if one does, exchanges observe price-time priority. So you may be so far back in line that your order sits unfilled.As a second-best option, you may consider using a dark pool. These non-exchange platforms allow traders to submit orders that are \u201cpegged\u201d to the midpoint of the national best bid and offer, or here $10.005. So rather than wait in line to sell at $10.01, you can submit a midpoint sell order to a dark pool hoping to find a buy order. This, too, is uncertain, but the fact that you\u2019re selling at $10.005 (rather than $10.01 offered on exchanges) should entice buyers to check dark pools for midpoint liquidity.The problem, however, is that midpoint orders expose you to latency arbitrage. When a dark pool calculates the price for your order, it obviously needs to obtain the national best bid and offer. Many dark pools turn to a central processor called the Securities Information Processor, to which all exchanges are required to send changes to their best bids and offers.IEX\u2019s secret sauce is a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that prevents this arbitrage from occurring. By separating its access point and its matching engine by 36 miles of coiled fiber optic cable, IEX forces every order to experience a 350-microsecond delay from the time it is submitted to the time it is executed. IEX does this because 350 microseconds is just enough time for it to see an update to the national best bid and offer and re-price a pegged order. For investors trading on IEX, this means submitting a midpoint peg order will not be subject to latency arbitrage; the delay makes it too hard to hit a stale midpoint order before IEX updates its price.Now that IEX is seeking to become an exchange, the main dust up is whether the speed bump is consistent with rules governing stock exchanges. Like all exchanges, IEX wants trading centers to route marketable orders to it when its quotations are at the national best bid and offer.But quotations on exchanges must be \u201cimmediately\u201d accessible to receive this benefit, and the speed bump is obviously intended to introduce a delay in accessing IEX quotations.In opposing the application, incumbent exchanges have focused on this seemingly clear conflict between the rule and IEX\u2019s structure, but it is not clear the strategy has worked. Instead, IEX has used it to highlight how lots of exchanges coil their fiber to create access delays.The difference is that, although IEX does it to provide equal access to its platform, other exchanges do it to assure co-location subscribers that they all receive the same level of latency \u2014 a response that makes their focus on the speed bump awkward, to say the least.All of which brings us back to the S.E.C. A recurring theme in the IEX application is that the quiet revolt by investors outlined in \u201cFlash Boys\u201d has now become a full-fledged movement for a referendum on our speed-based market structure.In light of this uncertainty, regulation by application is an ill-advised technique for regulating a market. Whatever comes of the IEX application, we hope that the experience encourages the S.E.C. to be more responsive to issues that are known to concern market participants.Advertisement"}

Something strange is happening over the Arabian Sea, she said: \u201cThe sky is getting hot more and more,\u201d perhaps because something has angered the goddess Lakshmi.As Ms. Mangela rounded up village women to pray at the water\u2019s edge, state fisheries scientists were tracking worrying changes in the water, where in the last half century average surface temperatures have risen three-tenths of a degree Celsius, or half a degree Fahrenheit. This warming is driving familiar species into cooler waters, they say, replaced by species traditionally found hundreds of miles to the south, like Indian mackerel and oil sardines.Ashok Lavasa, secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said negotiators were aware of the impact climate change is having on the country, which has more than 4,000 miles of coastline and 1,200 islands. But India takes the view that developed countries, like the United States, are responsible for the problem, and must take the biggest steps on a solution, a notion enshrined in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Mr. Lavasa would like to see that legal divide continue, even though developing economies are expected to become the largest greenhouse gas emitters in the 21st century.\u201cWhen you talk about historic obligations, we are not reinterpreting those agreements,\u201d Mr. Lavasa said.Four thousand miles from the Paris talks, a familiar smog has settled over India\u2019s large cities, reducing the midday sun to a pale, blurry wafer. The pollution, a dangerous mix of suspended particles from kerosene stoves, vehicles, diesel generators and burning crops, trash and firewood, is at the same high level as November of last year. But awareness has soared, said Joshua S. Apte, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, who has studied Delhi\u2019s air pollution since 2007.Take the case of Manisha Pathak, 44. Ms. Pathak, who has lived in Delhi for two decades, left home with her children Sunday night, on a short walk to get ice cream. Her father now informs her every morning of the neighborhood\u2019s concentrations of PM 2.5, particulate matter that is considered the most dangerous because it penetrates deep into the lungs, contributing to heart attacks and strokes.Average concentrations near her house last month were 331 micrograms per cubic meter; 10 is the level considered safe by the World Health Organization. Ms. Pathak\u2019s father has abandoned his morning walk; her brother-in-law, who has asthma, is exploring a transfer out of New Delhi. And on Sunday, Ms. Pathak was seized with anxiety over whether it was safe to be outside. She told her children to walk faster.\u201cIt was horrible the moment we got onto the main road,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can feel that whatever you are inhaling, it is not air. It is something you should not inhale.\u201dSimilar fears are radiating through middle- and working-class neighborhoods of Delhi and Mumbai. Dr. Vivek Goswami, a consulting pediatrician at Fortis Hospital in Delhi, said asthma diagnoses in children had jumped by 20 percent over the same period last year.Ms. Pathak said she now believed limiting emissions should be a priority for the government. \u201cIt is needed and required,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cThis is a basic thing that a man needs.\u201d\u201cThe media, in a way that couldn\u2019t happen in Beijing, has made this such an issue that policy makers can\u2019t be seen to be avoiding it,\u201d Mr. Apte said.For farmers and fishermen, the changes associated with a warming climate have emerged gradually.Vinay D. Deshmukh, a fisheries scientist who headed a marine research center in Mumbai, recalled his puzzlement around seven years ago, when he first saw boats coming back loaded with oil sardines, a fish whose northernmost range traditionally ended 400 miles to the south. The fish, he said, were \u201cemaciated,\u201d with bulbous heads and little flesh. His hypothesis: The sardines, \u201crunning away from the hot water to survive,\u201d had wandered so far that they no longer had a familiar stock of phytoplankton.Since then, the oil sardines have expanded their range 900 miles, turning up in the nets of fishermen as far north as Bangladesh. Mumbaikars showed so little interest in eating sardines that they are now ground up as a supplement for animal feed.Chabi Gayakard, scanning the crowd for paying customers at Sassoon Docks, shook her head disapprovingly when asked about the sardines. \u201cThe hotter it gets, the more they come,\u201d she said. \u201cUpper-class people don\u2019t eat them.\u201d A friend, standing over a dead shark, suggested that God had sent waves of heat as a punishment, after \u201cwatching how we humans behave.\u201dA thousand miles north of Mumbai, the apple farmers of Himachal Pradesh, in the foothills of the Himalayas, are following the Paris talks raptly.As children, they waded through heavy snowfall in their orchards by mid-December, but now the cold temperatures necessary for apple farming come a month and a half later, and some farmers have moved orchards as much as 2,000 feet higher, where the temperature is cooler.Over the last seven years, virtually all the apple farmers have come to believe that global warming is a major factor in the decline of crops, said Ravinder Chauhan, president of the Apple Growers Association of India.\u201cMy worst anxiety is that the process of global warming may be irreversible,\u201d he said. Every day, since the beginning of the Paris talks, Mr. Chauhan has scanned the newspapers for reports of progress.

{"Headline": "Leaving Iran\u2019s Nuclear Past a Mystery", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisVIENNA \u2014 The Iranian nuclear crisis began a decade ago when Tehran\u2019s leaders refused to answer questions from international inspectors about evidence that a secret team of scientists, working in a complex organization that sprawled across military and university laboratories, were experimenting with the technology to build a nuclear weapon.Ten years of standoffs, sanctions, cyberattacks and negotiations followed.Now, as the United States and its allies try to open a new chapter with Tehran \u2014 hoping to build on the deal reached in July limiting its production of nuclear fuel \u2014 the political environment is different. There is even talk of \u201ccoordination,\u201d though not true cooperation, in fighting the Islamic State.A public accounting of the full history, Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration officials argue, no longer really matters. If the nuclear deal signed in July is fully implemented, Iran will have dismantled the infrastructure it would need to produce weapons-grade fuel for the next 15 years at least. Even the most sophisticated bomb blueprint is useless without nuclear fuel, no matter what kind of weapon it designs.Mr. Obama, aides say, concluded some time ago that preventing a nuclear-armed Iran in the future is far more important than trying to force it to admit to a program that it has long contended never existed. The atomic energy agency pushed as far as it could in that direction, dismissing as implausible Iran\u2019s explanations that the work was for a variety of nonnuclear projects. Its conclusion that Iran pursued computer modeling of nuclear explosions through 2009, Mr. Obama\u2019s first year in office, was a bit of a surprise: Many expected that the Iranian nonanswers would completely stymie the investigation.Yet the decision to essentially close the file \u2014 expected to come at a meeting here of the agency\u2019s board this month, with the consent of the Obama administration \u2014 raises questions over whether the world\u2019s nuclear watchdog has lost its ability to strike fear into nations secretly pursuing the bomb. If Iran could avoid fully answering many of the questions about 12 different technologies it was pursuing, will it be emboldened to stiff-arm inspectors as they seek to enforce the nuclear deal? And what about other states, such as Saudi Arabia and Japan, that might be interested in developing nuclear weapons at some point?\u201cI worry we have created a poor precedent for the future,\u201d one senior agency official said before the report was distributed on Wednesday. \u201cWe have no way to force states to come clean, and never have,\u201d added the official, who was granted anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the news media. \u201cWe only have the moral authority that comes from making sure they do.\u201dEven after a decade of work, significant mysteries remain. Eight years ago, the United States intelligence agencies published a conclusion that Iran had a full-scale version of the Manhattan Project until 2003, and believed other work continued later.This year, Mr. Kerry said that a full confession by Iran was unnecessary because American intelligence agencies already had \u201cperfect knowledge\u201d of Iran\u2019s past activities, a statement that the intelligence agencies themselves thought was a bit generous about their understanding. But in private assessments given to Mr. Obama, the C.I.A. and the Energy Department say they have plenty of data to create a \u201cbaseline\u201d of Iran\u2019s abilities to produce a weapon if it ever got hold of enough plutonium or highly enriched uranium by cheating on the accord.But Mr. Einhorn wrote that he was not alarmed because the nuclear agreement with Iran \u201cprovides significant tools to prevent future weaponization activities,\u201d including an explicit prohibition on nuclear explosive modeling and research on systems to initiate a nuclear chain reaction and to turn uranium into metal. In other words, the steps to building a bomb that the International Atomic Energy Agency was most concerned about are explicitly prohibited.Other American officials say that out of an abundance of caution, they have worked from the assumption that if Iran got weapons-grade nuclear fuel, it already knows just about everything it needs to fashion it into a bomb. \u201cIt is unlikely that anything the Iranians might say about past weaponization efforts would affect U.S. planning to stop an Iranian breakout,\u201d Mr. Einhorn wrote, using the phrase for racing to produce a weapon, \u201cespecially because whatever they said would hardly be taken at face value.\u201dIran would hardly be the first to skip the stop at the atomic confessional. South Africa never revealed much about the secret projects that enabled it to produce nuclear weapons, which it gave up long ago. Neither did South Korea, which was caught by the United States decades ago, apparently seeking a bomb capability to match North Korea\u2019s.But Iran is a special case, and especially complex. The Obama administration maintains that the country hardly got off without penalty. Its economy suffered years of sanctions and hundreds of billions of dollars in lost oil revenues. It was perceived as an international outlaw, and ultimately had to agree to dismantle much of its capacity to enrich uranium and produce plutonium. For the next 15 years, it is under heavy constrictions.But as former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell once remarked, \u201cyou can\u2019t bomb knowledge.\u201d And it is the depth of Iran\u2019s knowledge about the art of nuclear weapons production that remains, a decade later, one of many mysteries about the country\u2019s plans for the future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy Is Growing, but Not Fixed Yet", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportThe economy is performing almost exactly as the people paid to predict these things thought it would.This makes the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Dec. 16 an easy one: It will most likely raise its target for interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, away from the near-zero level where it has been lodged for seven years.You\u2019ll rarely see an economic report that more closely matches economists\u2019 expectations. Another report earlier in the week that suggested that the manufacturing sector was contracting looks to be an outlier.Fed officials keep saying they are data-dependent in their policy choice, and this data backs up the idea that the United States economy is fundamentally in pretty decent shape, with consistent job growth and a low enough unemployment rate that employers are starting to offer workers higher raises.But because these numbers take some of the mystery out of the next Fed meeting, it\u2019s worth looking at the questions we still don\u2019t know the answers to.For the Fed, March is the new December. Meaning, the question now turns from \u201cwhen will they first raise rates?\u201d to \u201cwhen will they raise rates after that?\u201d What really matters for the economy is not so much what the Fed does 12 days from now, which we pretty much know, but how rapid or slow the path is toward higher rates.The thing about the new jobs numbers is that, solid though they may be, they are solid in exactly the same way that most jobs numbers have been solid for the last couple of years. They don\u2019t show the kind of progress on some key weaknesses in the economy that the Fed might like to see if it\u2019s going to move faster, rather than slower, in the path of rate increases.Consider one of the great weaknesses of the economy the last few years: the millions of people who left the labor force entirely during the last recession and have not returned, many of them of prime working age. The new numbers don\u2019t offer much sense of progress. The ratio of the population working was unchanged at 59.3 percent, which is only a tenth of a percentage point higher than it was a year earlier.And average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent, which was what forecasters expected but also doesn\u2019t suggest that wage inflation is starting to break out. That number is up 2.3 percent over the last year, which is hardly the stuff that would fuel fears of excessive inflation.The economy has withstood the threat that China and other emerging markets would drag down the global economy, a fear that enveloped financial markets over the summer. The unemployment rate is low. At the Fed, those arguing that it\u2019s time to wean the economy from its reliance on zero rates are likely to win the day.But in terms of the day-to-day experience of American workers and potential workers, the new numbers point to how much repair there is left to take place.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the change in manufacturing jobs in November. The sector lost 1,000 jobs; it did not gain 46,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California and Germany, Opposites With a Common Energy Goal", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 One is a European country known as \u201cthe powerhouse of Europe\u201d that struggles against soggy winters and seemingly endless gray skies. The other is a digitally driven American state, known as \u201cthe Golden State,\u201d for its abundant sunshine and year-round growing season.One is determined to lead an energy transformation through carefully drafted laws and regulations; the other is driven by an inventive spirit of boundary-pushing and experimentation.And one is a crucial player in behind-the-scenes negotiations in the Paris climate talks, while the other has no formal role whatsoever but is a ubiquitous, cheerleading presence, with its governor and former governor popping up all over town this week at high-profile events.In many facets, Germany and California could not differ more. Yet they share one overarching goal: to develop climate-friendly energy solutions that can serve as a model for the countries now meeting in Paris, as they each try to curb carbon emissions.The two locuses of energy innovation have recognized their mutuality and have become close collaborators, traversing the nearly 5,700 miles to share ideas and study the other\u2019s best practices.California\u2019s \u201cmillion solar roof\u201d program, started under former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (who is one of the active California representatives in Paris), mirrored Germany\u2019s \u201chundred-thousand solar roof\u201d initiative that began a few years earlier.LichtBlick, a clean-energy provider based in Hamburg, Germany, has teamed up with Tesla Motors to help homeowners in Germany integrate its renewable energy storage cells into the country\u2019s grid.Beyond the mutual benefits, the experiences of California and Germany \u2014 both of which have managed to keep their economies chugging, and even growing \u2014 are seen as laboratories for the kinds of ideas that could help 195 countries and the European Union reach emissions targets that they have at least generally pledged to meet.\u201cGermany and California have to become learning hubs for the rest of the world,\u201d Robert Weisenmiller, chairman of the California Energy Commission, said this year during a visit to Berlin, where he exchanged ideas with policy makers and others involved in Germany\u2019s renewable energy programs.Germany, with nearly 83 million people, has more than twice the population of California. Both are expanding their clean power, especially wind and solar, to ensure that it accounts for more than a third of all energy generated by 2025. Both want to slash their carbon emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. And both are seeking ways to improve their respective transportation sectors, in which they share a love of fast, gasoline- or diesel-powered cars.\u201cThere have constantly been conversations between California and Germany regarding renewable energy and how to bring it into service in the best possible way,\u201d said Angelina Galiteva, a founder of the California-based Renewables 100 Policy Institute, which promotes the transition to renewable energy and recently showed a group of German and other European experts around Sacramento and Silicon Valley.For all the similarities, there are also profound differences that reflect the local cultures, the makeup of the power grid and the role of government in determining energy policy.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.One of the elements that most baffled the Germans visiting California was the realization that residents with solar panels on their homes were not required to share information with operators about how much power they planned to generate, or the amount they would draw from the grid.Such a laissez-faire approach would be unthinkable in Germany, where the grid is overseen by a government entity, and \u201csmart\u201d meters that gather and relay such information will be required from next year.Yet Ms. Galiteva said she envied Germany\u2019s ability to impose that level of control on renewables and the grid.Seven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.The German government began its solar program in 2000 by offering generous payments to anyone generating power through solar, wind or biomass that was fed into the grid \u2014 which was required by law. That move is widely viewed as having helped make renewables attractive on a global scale, with investment in renewable energy worldwide reaching $270.2 billion in 2014.But Germany\u2019s policies have come at a price, especially for citizens: The monthly power bill for a three-person household has more than doubled since 2000, to $94 a month. California, by contrast, has been able to avoid that steep jump through stringent conservation measures and by including the utilities in its renewable expansion plans; the average monthly bill in California, air-conditioning and all, is $88.The envy works both ways. Many Germans look longingly to California, not only for its abundant sunlight, but for the prowess of its tech industry, which is increasingly linked to the growth of renewable energy. And Germany lacks the capital and regulatory ease to allow innovations to become viable businesses.Philip Sch\u00f6der knows both sides well. The 32-year-old German helped Tesla Motors launch in Germany before returning this year to Sonnenbatterie, a German-based renewable energy storage company with a branch in Los Angeles, where he got his start.He points to the culture of risk-taking in California, supported by easier-to-navigate corporate laws and abundant venture capital, as one reason for the state\u2019s energy transformation.\u201cIn California they understand that failure is necessary, that life cycles are short, and the traditional way of thinking here, to let the Americans come up with something and we Germans will perfect it, no longer works,\u201d Mr. Sch\u00f6der said.Other differences are on full display in Paris, where California has almost played the part of the 196th participating country \u2014 without nationhood or actual say. In contrast, despite its strong record in doing exactly what the other nations hope to achieve, Germany has remained behind the scenes.But even as he winces at the word \u201cleadership,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Flasbarth, an under secretary in the country\u2019s Environment Ministry, said Germans realize the importance of taking more of a Californian approach when trying to secure a climate-change deal.\u201cI think that we will be able to play a strong role,\u201d he said, \u201cto be a driving force toward an agreement.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, which allows the central government to claw back the money those entities had been intending to use to make their own bond payments; it will be used instead to pay the top-priority general obligation bonds.Some of the entities losing their cash to the clawback are still expected to make their Jan. 1 payments, because they had previously set up emergency reserves. Still, credit analysts will probably consider them to be in technical default, because they will have depleted their reserves and the clawback will keep them from setting aside fresh money for the next bond payment.Regulatory filings suggest that at least one entity, the Puerto Rico Infrastructure Financing Authority, has not set up a debt-service reserve and may have no way to avoid full default. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla has already issued warnings that some of the island\u2019s bondholders were likely to be left empty-handed, although he did not specify which. Almost 20 different entities on the island issue debt. Besides clawing back money from some of them, the government has been diverting cash from vendors, taxpayers and certain programs in a juggling act that cannot be sustained forever.\u201cIt is very probable that from here on out, Puerto Rico will not find the mechanisms to make its payments,\u201d said Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla in a news briefing this month at the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration in Washington. \u201cCash has run out. There are no more fiscal gymnastics that we can do.\u201dThe creditors of one major Puerto Rican borrower, the public electric utility, have been concerned enough about a default to agree in advance to accept smaller payments. Earlier this month, a group of creditors of the big utility \u2014 the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or Prepa \u2014 said they had agreed to reduce their bond principal by 15 percent and accept a lower interest rate, as part of a plan to keep Prepa from defaulting on its roughly $9 billion of debt.The deal has not yet closed and is not expected to for several months. Only about 70 percent of Prepa\u2019s creditors are on board; others may be waiting to see if a better offer comes along.\u201cWe are, to a large extent, trying to map uncharted territory,\u201d said Sergio Marxuach, policy director at the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research group in San Juan.Second in line were bonds issued by other government agencies, but covered by the central government\u2019s guarantee. Third was a type of bond backed by a dedicated sales tax. Those bonds have been issued by a governmental unit called the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation, known by the Spanish acronym Cofina, since 2006, initially as a way of balancing budgets in what was thought to be a recession. The recession has not ended and is now often likened to the 1930s, and Cofina has some $15 billion of debt outstanding.Mr. Marxuach said Puerto Rico\u2019s secretary of justice had issued an opinion that the sales taxes dedicated to Cofina could not be clawed back to make general-obligation bond payments, but whether that opinion would hold up in court had not been tested. He also said the Cofina bonds\u2019 proceeds had been put to uses that \u201cappear to be Constitutionally prohibited.\u201d\u201cIn the absence of a binding court decision, this legal issue remains open to judicial interpretation,\u201d he said.Questions like that might be put to rest if Puerto Rico is given access to the federal bankruptcy courts, something that Congress is expected to take up in the coming months. Some members of Congress have been calling for a limited form of Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy, which would cover only a handful of the island\u2019s public corporations.But in recent months, as the size and legal complexity of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt has come into focus, many policy makers have concluded that all of Puerto Rico\u2019s debts should be restructured in one place.\u201cWhat I can tell you is, the first quarter of the year is an essential period of time for this to be addressed,\u201d said Mr. Lew, referring to Puerto Rico\u2019s pleas for access to bankruptcy. \u201cAnd they need restructuring authority that covers all credit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Steps Up, but Its Currency Still Has Dues to Pay", "Date": "2015-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe dollar lost a bit of its exalted status last week and the Chinese renminbi gained some luster. That was the straightforward meaning of an announcement in Washington by the International Monetary Fund, which decided to admit the renminbi to an exclusive group of elite currencies.But global markets told quite a different story: The renminbi remained no more than a promising but relatively inconsequential currency, while the euro weakened and the dollar remained at the center of world events, with effects that rippled through the world economy.To make sense of these apparently conflicting pictures, first examine the I.M.F. decision on the renminbi. It was long awaited and, in some ways, portentous, signaling China\u2019s growing political clout, if not the ascendance of its currency.S.D.R.s aren\u2019t a currency, but they can be used as a claim on currencies in the basket, indirectly bolstering the role of the renminbi as a potential reserve currency. While this doesn\u2019t have much day-to-day significance right now, it certifies that China\u2019s currency, which could barely be traded on world markets only a few decades ago, has already come a long way. In order to qualify for inclusion, an S.D.R. member needs to be the currency of a major exporter, and the renminbi certainly is that.The other main qualification is ticklish: A currency needs to be \u201cfreely usable.\u201d Using a strictly technical definition, the I.M.F. declared that the renminbi meets that test, even though its price doesn\u2019t move freely in currency markets and it isn\u2019t traded or held nearly as much as the other major currencies.The I.M.F. acknowledged that \u201cchallenges\u201d remained for the renminbi and stressed \u201cthe importance of continuing and deepening\u201d the financial and economic reforms that have taken place in China. These reservations are substantial.Nonetheless, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said quite correctly that the I.M.F. decision amounted to \u201clandmark recognition\u201d of China\u2019s growing economic power. In order to make room for the renminbi in its S.D.R. basket, the I.M.F. shrank the other four currencies, especially the euro. The dollar lost a little of its stature.But if the renminbi\u2019s rise in status signaled the incipient decline of the dollar, you wouldn\u2019t have known it from the action in the foreign currency markets, or from any other major markets last week. The dollar did fall against the euro on Thursday, after the European Central Bank issued policy guidance that surprised some traders. But if anything, the almighty dollar, as Washington Irving once called the greenback, retained every bit of its global importance.It was striking that on the very day of the I.M.F.\u2019s announcement about the renminbi, the dollar actually rose to an 11-year high against major currencies, according to Bloomberg trade-weighted data. And on Wednesday, the value of the dollar reached new heights.It was bolstered by comments from Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, suggesting that the Fed would soon raise short-term interest rates after holding them close to zero for nearly seven years. Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony before Congress on Thursday added to that general conviction in the markets, though the dollar briefly gave up ground against the euro after the European Central Bank in Frankfurt loosened monetary policy less than had been expected.Still, the market consensus remains that diverging policies in Europe and the United States will solidify a trend that has been underway for many months: The euro will weaken further and the dollar will grow ever stronger.What\u2019s more, the rising dollar over the last year has already had profound effects. It has helped account for the drop in commodity values, which are commonly priced in dollars. The soaring greenback has also pummeled producers of coffee, cotton, copper, zinc, oil and gold, and it has punished many commodity-producing nations, like Brazil, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Canada.And in earnings calls with financial analysts, a range of American companies reported that the dollar had created significant headwinds for their businesses, and was likely to do so in 2016. As Goldman Sachs reported in its most recent beige book \u2014 a survey of corporate America that it periodically performs: \u201cA strong U.S. dollar continued to weigh on earnings, particularly for companies with significant international exposure.\u201dThose effects are widely expected to strengthen, not weaken, in the months ahead. The dollar remains the main currency in which the world does business. It accounted for more than 43 percent of foreign currency turnover in 2013, the most recent I.M.F. figure, compared with less than 17 percent for the euro, the second-most-widely-used currency. At 1.1 percent, the renminbi barely showed up on the radar.Still, the renminbi is being traded frequently in Asia, the I.M.F. found, if not much in Europe or North America. And because China is already among the world\u2019s biggest exporters \u2014 it is the biggest, by some measures \u2014 it has leverage to shift commerce toward the renminbi rather than the dollar.China has already demonstrated that a small shift in the value of the renminbi can have major effects on global markets. In August, it announced that it would allow the renminbi to float in a broader range \u2014 a shift that helped China receive the benediction of the I.M.F. last week \u2014 but when the currency briefly lurched downward, world currency, stock and commodities markets fell sharply.In Beijing last week, Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said the bank intended to \u201ckeep the renminbi\u2019s exchange rate stable at a reasonable level,\u201d yet would also gradually allow the currency to move more freely. Those goals may prove to be difficult to achieve simultaneously. Having disrupted the markets only recently, China could do so again.But China\u2019s rising status at the I.M.F. could have a calming effect. It will lead to a small rebalancing of global reserves at central banks, which are likely to begin to modestly increase their renminbi holdings. Eventually, the renminbi could become a haven in times of trouble, a place where investors seek security, not a currency from which people flee, as has recently been the case.In order to achieve that transformation, the renminbi will have to become much more freely and dependably usable than it already is. It is becoming more important and will undoubtedly grow in stature. But the dollar remains at the fulcrum of world trade and global economics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If It Owns a Well or a Mine, It\u2019s Probably in Trouble", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe pain among energy and mining producers worsened again on Tuesday, as one of the industry\u2019s largest players cut its work force by nearly two-thirds and Chinese trade data amplified concerns about the country\u2019s appetite for commodities.The full extent of the shakeout will depend on whether commodities prices have further to fall. And the outlook is shaky, with a swirl of forces battering the markets.The world\u2019s biggest buyer of commodities, China, has pulled back sharply during its economic slowdown. But the world is dealing with gluts in oil, gas, copper and even some grains.\u201cThe world of commodities has been turned upside down,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS, a consultant firm. \u201cInstead of tight supply and strong demand, we have tepid demand and oversupply and overcapacity for commodity production. It\u2019s the end of an era that is not going to come back soon.\u201dThe pressure on prices has been significant.Prices for iron ore, the crucial steelmaking ingredient, have fallen by about 40 percent this year. The Brent crude oil benchmark is now hovering around $40 a barrel, down from more than a $110 since the summer of 2014.Companies are caught in the downdraft.A number of commodity-related businesses have either declared bankruptcy or fallen behind in their debt payments. Even more common are the cutbacks. Nearly 1,200 oil rigs, or two-thirds of the American total, have been decommissioned since late last year. More than 250,000 workers in the oil and gas industry worldwide have been laid off, with more than a third coming in the United States.The international mining company Anglo American is pulling back broadly, with a goal to reduce the company\u2019s size by 60 percent. Along with the layoffs announced on Tuesday, the company is suspending its dividend, halving its business units, as well as unloading mines and smelters.The situation has darkened in recent months.In July, the company outlined plans to cut 53,000 jobs after reporting a loss of $3 billion for the first half of the year. Now, Anglo American plans to reduce its current work force of 135,000, to 50,000 employees.\u201cQuite frankly we didn\u2019t expect the commodity price rout to be so dramatic and in all likelihood the next six months are going to be even tougher,\u201d Mark Cutifani, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at an investors\u2019 conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe have pulled costs out of the business, but we need to do more because prices continue to deteriorate.\u201dChina looms large in the commodities equation.Between 2000 and last year, companies invested hundreds of billions of dollars to expand their production capacity to satisfy China in a period of rapid economic expansion. Much of the corporate growth was fueled by debt.But the situation has proved unsustainable as demand has waned. Chinese copper imports are down nearly 3 percent from last year, while imports of steel products are down by more than 12 percent. The country\u2019s crude oil and iron ore imports are still up, but by rates that are slowing from previous years.The economy\u2019s slowing growth rate is adding to the uncertainty. China reported on Tuesday that exports, the country\u2019s engine of growth, slipped 6.8 percent in November, compared with the same month a year ago. Imports were also weak, although the rate of decline was lower than in the previous month.The weakening Chinese demand is hurting prices while production is overwhelming markets.Many international oil projects have been canceled and production should fall more rapidly next year. But it probably won\u2019t be quickly enough to stabilize prices. That is because companies are getting more production out of their investments as efficiency has improved. And some need to keep producing to keep up with their debt payments.The commodity fallout has been global.The Swiss company Glencore is scrambling to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third before the end of 2016 by slashing its copper-mining operations in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and selling much of its agricultural business. Kinder Morgan, the North American pipeline company, cut its dividend on Tuesday afternoon, prompting a sell-off in the stock after hours.There have already been about 40 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings by North American oil and gas producers this year, accounting for roughly $15 billion in secured and unsecured debt. And energy experts predict more bankruptcies in 2016 if oil prices remain below $40 a barrel, or even below $50 a barrel.When one company topples, it reverberates broadly.On Monday, Energy & Exploration Partners, a Fort Worth oil and gas driller, filed for Chapter 11 protection. In the bankruptcy, it listed debt of more than $1 billion owed to several service companies, including units of Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.For some players, the mess creates opportunity. Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil company, predicts a wave of consolidations and corporate shake-ups because of financial strain from the commodity price collapse.\u201cThere is about $150 billion of private equity out there looking for deals in the U.S.,\u201d he said. Others are facing a period of prolonged problems.Anglo American is drastically shrinking to remain viable.Since he became chief executive in 2013, Mr. Cutifani said, not a single month has passed during which any of the products that Anglo American mines has risen in price. When he took the job, Mr. Cutifani signaled that the free-spending ways of the commodity price supercycle had ended by selling the corporate jet.Now, everything is getting a second look. Anglo American will close its London head office and share space in the city with the headquarters of De Beers, its diamond mining unit. Over all, Anglo American plans to reduce operating costs over the coming year by $1.1 billion and cut capital spending by an additional $1 billion in the same period.The company intends to focus operation in three areas: the diamond operations of De Beers; industrial metals like copper; and bulk commodities like coal. Details about the job cuts will not be announced until February, but it appears that they will probably focus on the firm\u2019s bulk commodities operations.Mr. Cutifani said that Anglo American would simply shut money-losing mines rather than sell them at heavily discounted prices, although he did not entirely rule out asset sales. The nickel, coal and iron ore mines, he said, will have to show that they can reduce costs sufficiently to generate cash.\u201cIf not, they won\u2019t be in the portfolio, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this sort of environment, nothing can be considered business as usual.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As U.S. and Europe Pass the Hat at Climate Talks, China Clings to Developing-Nation Status", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week, China is crying poverty.Europe and the United States, still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, have been trying to pass the hat for contributions from increasingly affluent middle-income countries, particularly China.China has considered itself a developing country for purposes of climate negotiations for more than 20 years. And it is sticking to that position, even as locking in sources for the $100 billion annually for poorer countries is one of the biggest remaining hurdles for the talks, which are scheduled to end Friday.Western officials have responded to China\u2019s stance by volubly praising Beijing for its willingness to limit future emissions of greenhouse gases while also pursuing quiet diplomacy on the financial issue. They are trying to find legal language acceptable to China that would mandate a sizable financial contribution.\u201cHopefully we can work quietly and effectively with China to bring them even further on board, but I think China has made a huge difference and has already stepped up significantly,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday at the conference.He also noted that hundreds of millions of people in China are still very poor.Less than two days before their deadline to conclude a sweeping new climate accord, negotiators from nearly 200 countries have yet to resolve major issues, including how and when pledged cuts to carbon emissions would be verified.Lead negotiators said they were confident that a deal could still be reached, although Rachel Kyte, the World Bank\u2019s special envoy for climate change, mentioned at the energy conference that the talks could run into Saturday or Sunday. But some outside observers who have been monitoring the talks said that the compromises necessary to bring it across the finish line could weaken the deal so much it would become nearly toothless.At the heart of the proposed deal is a set of pledges from 186 countries, representing more than 90 percent of the global economy, to cut their emissions. But a draft text published on Wednesday did not include any details on how those emissions cuts would be monitored and verified.China has been splashing out huge sums for other projects, but refuses to let them count toward the $100 billion in annual contributions called for in the climate negotiations.China is also the world\u2019s largest exporter and holds $3.5 trillion in foreign reserves. The reserves have been financed with money borrowed from China\u2019s commercial banks, however, and the potential need to repay that money someday means that it can be invested in overseas projects but not donated outright.Chinese officials have worried that if they agree to contribute toward the $100 billion annual assistance for developing countries, China might someday be classified as an industrialized country and asked to follow more stringent limits on greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set binding limits for emissions from industrialized countries but was less stringent on developing countries.Western officials have been seeking a compromise. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz told reporters on the sidelines of the energy conference that he welcomed Chinese assistance to developing countries, even if it did not count toward the $100 billion a year that developing countries want from the West.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s money in the game, but that\u2019s not the U.S. government response,\u201d he said, adding that the Treasury would have the final say on financial issues.Negotiators have been looking for a way to finesse China\u2019s concerns about being labeled an industrialized country while still including China\u2019s ambitious international investment programs in the needed $100 billion. With the deadline for the climate talks looming, any absence of Chinese money makes it harder to come up with pledges of $100 billion a year.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of industrialized democracies, recently estimated that $62 billion of the $100 billion was raised last year. But countries like China and India question how much of that money represents firm pledges.\u201cDeveloping countries are saying, \u2018We\u2019re not seeing the money\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s why transparency is so important,\u201d said Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s top climate negotiator, at a news conference on Tuesday in Le Bourget, on the sidelines of the climate talks. \u201cThe O.E.C.D.\u2019s number has not been acknowledged by developing countries. This is something that we need to address.\u201dMr. Xie defended China\u2019s ability to represent the interests of the Group of 77, a bloc of largely very poor nations that coordinate their stances in many international negotiations. China remains a member of the group despite three decades of rapid growth that have given it the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u201cWe are actually part of the G-77,\u201d Mr. Xie said. \u201cSo why can\u2019t we mention the G-77?\u201dMr. Li, of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that Western governments had refused to keep pace even with Western businesses in addressing climate change. \u201cThat\u2019s the barrier, I think, not China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope in the next three or four days we can solve the problem.\u201dNo matter the shape of the deal that emerges, it is also certain to require governments that have already committed to substantial emissions cuts to begin looking at how they can do still more.Keith Bradsher reported from Paris, and Coral Davenport from Le Bourget, France. Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Le Bourget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seattle Considers Measure to Let Uber and Lyft Drivers Unionize", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter burning out the clutch on his Kia Soul last year, Don Creery bought a new car with an automatic transmission. He went into debt for the vehicle because he considered it an investment: He had just started driving full time in Seattle for Lyft and Uber, the ride-hailing start-ups, and was making money.Since then, Uber and Lyft have cut the rates they charge passengers for rides and ended the incentives used to recruit drivers. Mr. Creery said he now has to drive 10 to 12 hours a day to make the amount of money he once did working six to eight hours.\u201cEarly on, these companies were really great,\u201d said Mr. Creery, 62, a lifelong Seattle resident whose primary source of income is driving for Uber and Lyft. \u201cBut when it comes down to it, they keep lowering their rates on us.\u201dIn a statement, Uber emphasized the flexibility it gives workers, reiterating its longstanding claims that many drivers do not want to be treated as full-time employees.\u201cDrivers say that with flexible and independent work with Uber, 50 percent of them drive fewer than 10 hours a week, 70 percent have full-time or part-time work outside of Uber, and 65 percent choose to vary the hours they drive 25 percent week to week,\u201d Uber said.Lyft echoed the sentiment, saying it \u201cprovides consumers with an alternative to vehicle ownership and drivers with the ability to make money in their free time.\u201dABDA is working with Seattle Teamsters Local 117. Dawn Gearhart, a representative for Local 117, said working for on-demand companies provided flexibility but had downsides. \u201cIt\u2019s a really attractive model for employers, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all the rights that workers have fought for over the past century should go out the window,\u201d she said.Unionization could give drivers leverage to negotiate on issues many of them feel powerless to do anything about now. For instance, drivers could gain a voice on minimum per mile charges for riders and establishing processes for deactivating drivers that seem less arbitrary than the ones currently in place at Uber, said Mike O\u2019Brien, a Seattle City Council member who introduced the unionization legislation.\u201cIt\u2019s clear the nature of work has shifted in part because of technology and in part because there are corporations that don\u2019t like labor protections,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is that reality going to look like? I believe there should be some solutions.\u201dThis time, the process in this tech-loving city \u2014 home to many Amazon and Microsoft employees \u2014 is playing out differently. On Wednesday, the phones in Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s office were quiet. He said he had received few complaints from Uber customers about the right-to-unionize vote and, to his knowledge, Uber had not sought to mobilize its users the way it did before.\u201cI think if Uber felt they could hammer us on this, they would,\u201d he said.Nick Hanauer, a Seattle tech entrepreneur and investor who is also a prominent advocate for greater income equality, called the unionization effort a \u201cstep in the right direction in terms of trying to bring some sanity and balance to these new business models.\u201d He added that city and state governments were where the boldest action was taking place on many new-economy issues.Uber hasn\u2019t been totally quiet. David Plouffe, the Uber policy executive and former Obama campaign manager, said at an event in Seattle this year that the proposed law was \u201cgenerally believed to be flatly illegal.\u201dUber has two potential legal arguments against the measure if it passes. The first is that federal law reigns supreme when it comes to organizing, rendering a city ordinance on the subject essentially null and void. The second is that collective bargaining by independent contractors would amount to illegal price-fixing under antitrust law.Experts say the first argument has less merit: Federal law governs organizing when the workers are employees, but clearly omits independent contractors. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue\u201d as long as the workers are indisputably contractors, said Wilma Liebman, a former chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board. Ms. Liebman conceded that the issue could be more ambiguous if the status of the workers was in dispute, as with Uber. The second argument favors Uber. According to John Kirkwood, a professor of antitrust law at the Seattle University School of Law, the only way organizing by Uber drivers could be legal is under a so-called state action exemption from antitrust law.The proposed legislation does not appear to meet the requirements for such an exemption, he said.The measure could face serious problems in the federal courts as it stands. Mr. Kirkwood cited the example a few decades ago of a group of lawyers in the District of Columbia who regularly did contract work representing indigent defendants and organized a work stoppage to demand better pay. The Supreme Court ruled in 1990 that they had engaged in an illegal price-fixing boycott.Mr. O\u2019Brien, the Seattle councilman, said he believed the law would be \u201clegally defensible\u201d if it passed, having developed the ordinance \u201cin consultation with our law department.\u201dRegardless of the outcome, the effort\u2019s rise to national attention could motivate others to follow.Doug Bloch, the political director for the Teamsters in Northern California and northern Nevada, said passage of the Seattle law could spur a similar law in his region, which includes Oakland, Calif. It, like Seattle, has a rich union tradition.Mike Isaac reported from New York, Nick Wingfield from Seattle and Noam Scheiber from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Oakland, Some Raiders Fans Fear the Meaning of \u2018Last Home Game\u2019", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday \u2014 Christmas Eve, no less \u2014 the Raiders played their last home game of the year, and possibly their last home game ever in Oakland.At Ricky\u2019s, in San Leandro, a 10-minute drive south of O.co Coliseum, fans stewed amid the old Raiders programs, bobbleheads and jerseys lining the walls, fearing the worst about the possible move yet looking for signs of optimism.They had been here before \u2014 the team left Oakland for Los Angeles after the 1981 season but returned in 1995.And so over wings and beers, members of Save Oakland Sports, a fan group, worked through the scenarios: The Rams move, and the Chargers and the Raiders stay; the Chargers and the Raiders, who want to build a stadium together near Los Angeles, move; the Raiders build a new stadium in Oakland; and on and on.\u201cWe live in this era of stadium roulette, where you don\u2019t know which chamber the bullet is in,\u201d said Dave Newhouse, a longtime sportswriter who covered the Raiders in the 1970s. \u201cYou\u2019ll never see a more abused set of fans.\u201dMore than in previous years when the N.F.L. flirted with putting a team in Los Angeles, all signs suggest the league is taking the issue seriously, with a high probability that at least one team will land there next season or the season after.The reason a move seems likely now is that the owners of three teams are willing to put up the total cost, or close to it, of building a new stadium there. They have also arrived at the point where they can get out of leases in their home markets.But the league owners have not reached a consensus on how to proceed.Some owners favor a plan by the owner of the Rams, E. Stanley Kroenke, to build a domed stadium on the southwest fringe of Los Angeles, as part of a retail and entertainment district in Inglewood, Calif. Other owners like the proposal made by the Chargers and the Raiders, which calls for an outdoor stadium in Carson, about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, that would be built by a venture with Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, at the top.Before moving forward, the owners must, according to their relocation guidelines, take into account what Oakland, San Diego and St. Louis have done to keep their teams.St. Louis has done the most. It cleared many legal and financial hurdles in planning for a new $1 billion stadium, largely government-funded, on the banks of the Mississippi River. The Rams have not publicly commented on the stadium proposal.Civic advisers in San Diego proposed building a new stadium next to the Chargers\u2019 current home, but the team dismissed the effort as too little, too late.Oakland lags behind.The city has said that it cannot afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new stadiums for the Raiders and the Athletics, who share O.co Coliseum (the \u201cO.co\u201d derives from Overstock.com\u2019s marketing name, although local residents still call it Oakland Coliseum). Oakland and Alameda County are still paying off their share of a $220 million renovation that added more than 10,000 seats and suites, nicknamed Mount Davis in reference to Al Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner at the time.Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city, which along with the county owns the land around the Coliseum, could retire the roughly $100 million in debt on the building and make infrastructure improvements on the property if the Raiders built there. But Schaaf said that might not be enough to impress the league.\u201cI know the N.F.L. doesn\u2019t expect a fully baked proposal from Oakland,\u201d Schaaf said in an interview this week. \u201cOakland has a very complex situation, and we\u2019re really committed to threading the needle of keeping this team we love but also being responsible to our taxpayers.\u201dSchaaf is hopeful, however, that when the owners weigh what city or cities they are willing to abandon, they recognize that Oakland has a booming economy in the country\u2019s sixth-largest television market. (St. Louis is the 21st largest; San Diego is the 28th.) And while the Raiders (7-8) have not finished with a winning record since 2002 \u2014 and they are out of playoff contention for the 13th straight season \u2014 the team has a rich history in the city dating to 1960.The Raiders could also stay by default if the league\u2019s owners decide that only one team could succeed at selling enough luxury seats, suites, regular tickets and sponsorships in the Los Angeles area, which has not had an N.F.L. team in two decades.\u201cI\u2019ve always looked at this as the owners trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s cube blindfolded with vertigo,\u201d Andy Dolich, a former executive with the A\u2019s, the San Francisco 49ers and other teams, said of all the variables confronting the league. \u201cJust because someone spent $60 on a Raiders jersey doesn\u2019t mean he is going to spend $60,000 on personal seat licenses to see the Raiders in Los Angeles.\u201dThrough a spokesman, the Raiders\u2019 owner, Mark Davis, declined to be interviewed.On Thursday morning, a dozen or so fans stood in the rain outside the Raiders\u2019 offices to let Davis know of their devotion.\u201cStay in Oakland, Mark; do what\u2019s right,\u201d screamed Ray Perez, a fan who goes by the nickname Dr. Death. \u201cThis is bigger than football. This is our family crest.\u201dAt the stadium a few hours later, Andy Coronado, a retired deputy sheriff from Stockton, was calmer. Sitting in his black and silver bus, he said that he preferred the Raiders stay put but that he would follow them to Carson if they moved.\u201cBusiness is business,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they go, I go.\u201dMany other fans nearby were less accepting, including the mayor\u2019s mother, Barbara Schaaf-Schock, a fan since the 1960s.\u201cAs far as I can tell, there\u2019s a wall around Oakland,\u201d she said when asked if she would travel to Los Angeles to root for the team.Davis has said he would prefer to stay in Oakland. Under one scenario, that would be a possibility, but perhaps only for an additional year. It would hinge on only the Chargers or the Rams \u2014 not both \u2014 moving to Los Angeles next season, giving Oakland more time to come up with a way to keep the team.If no progress was made, the Raiders could apply to move in 2017 and share the stadium built by the Chargers or the Rams.\u201cMoving it back a year might buy them time politically and economically,\u201d said David Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California.That is the hope Raiders fans are clinging to. They are encouraged when Davis professes his love for Oakland yet are dismayed to read news reports that say the team is open to moving to cities like San Antonio.\u201cThe Raiders have been threatening to move somewhere else for 35 years, and the fans just keep coming to the games,\u201d said Chris De Benedetti, another member of Save Oakland Sports. \u201cIf there\u2019s a bad idea hall of fame, the Raiders moving to L.A. again would be a first-ballot entry.\u201dNot to add to the angst, but the Golden State Warriors, who play in an arena next door to O.co Coliseum, have laid the groundwork for a move to San Francisco. The A\u2019s have fought for years to move to San Jose but have been rebuffed by Major League Baseball.At least those teams would still be in the region.A Raiders move nearly 400 miles away to Southern California \u2014 a six-hour drive or worse \u2014 would send fans into a tailspin and, in their view, contradict the team\u2019s silver-and-black bad-boy motif, which they believe befits the city\u2019s roughhewn edges and industrial past.In a room at Ricky\u2019s on Monday, a couple of dozen members of the Raiders Booster Club were having their annual Christmas toy drive. After a loss the day before to the Green Bay Packers, which ensured another nonwinning season, the boosters contemplated the game Thursday against the Chargers.Contrary to the hand-wringing at the other end of the restaurant, a more resigned mood prevailed.\u201cIt\u2019s one conversation we don\u2019t talk about at the meeting because there\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d said Wayne Deboe, the chapter president. \u201cSo far, there\u2019s been talk but no action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposed Extension of Tax Credits for Renewable Energy Would Have Uneven Effect", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut even as renewable energy stocks rallied \u2014 SolarCity\u2019s shares surged more than 40 percent \u2014 and advocates and executives cheered, some sectors of the industry appeared to benefit more than others.The solar and wind industries got much of what they wanted, energy specialists said, while some technologies, like fuel cell storage and geothermal, were largely left off the table. Biofuels were somewhere in the middle.For the solar industry, the proposed extension, up for action in Congress this week, is better than many executives and analysts had expected. For example, the investment tax credit for solar projects, which was to fall to 10 percent at the end of 2016, is to stay at 30 percent until 2019, then gradually decline to 10 percent by 2022. And, in another gain, projects will be required only to begin construction, rather than operation, as is the case now, to qualify for the credit.The effect, specialists say, will be to make large, commercial-scale projects more viable, like the roughly two gigawatts\u2019 worth scheduled to come online in Texas for 2017.For example, Tony Clifford, chief executive of Standard Solar, a developer and builder based in Rockville, Md., said that the company had passed up or abandoned close to $100 million worth of business, including a large wastewater treatment plant in the Midwest, because it did not think it could get them up and running by the end of 2016. Now he is hopeful that if the legislation passes as proposed, some of that business could return.In addition, said Shayle Kann, who leads GTM Research, more states, including Ohio, Illinois and Florida, could become strong residential markets for solar by the end of the decade.\u201cThe market wasn\u2019t going to disappear,\u201d without an extension of the 30 percent solar investment tax credit, he said. \u201cWhat you weren\u2019t going to have is the bunch of new states pick up that are going to become economically viable over the next few years. The big impact for distributed solar is just more geographic diversity.\u201dWind industry executives and proponents were similarly bullish about how the extension would affect them. The production tax credit, which expired at the end of 2014, is to be extended retroactively through 2016 and then decline in value each year until it is phased out in 2020. The five-year step-down offers one of the longest periods of certainty in more than a decade.In the near term, developers may proceed with projects that had stalled in the face of questions about meeting federal construction requirements, said Michael Garland, chief executive of Pattern Energy. But longer term, the new time horizon would help the industry to continue bringing costs closer to those of conventional fuels, even cheap natural gas.\u201cThe manufacturers know the goal they have to get to,\u201d Mr. Garland said, \u201cand we can push them a bit to get there.\u201dNonetheless, he said, the industry would still not end up on a level playing field with conventional fuels, which have access to tax advantages that wind does not, or solar, which would largely retain a permanent 10 percent investment tax credit.But Lee Peterson, a senior tax manager in the Renewable Energy Industry Practice at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said the differences among the industries made sense, given that wind developments benefit from much larger economies of scale and have had access to subsidies and development financing longer than solar.\u201cEven a massive solar system is still dramatically smaller than a wind project \u2014 it\u2019s sort of like comparing the difference between a bus and a fleet of taxi cabs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it makes sense that they would have different treatments.\u201dThe inclusion of biofuel incentives, while welcome, seemed unlikely to give those fuels as big a boost as the incentives aimed at conventional oil, which will stay in place longer, said Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. A tax credit for producers of cellulosic biofuels applies only to gallons produced and sold, so while it will help companies that have plants up and running, it would have a limited ability to spur the development of more.\u201cA company like DuPont that is just now opening up a commercial-size facility in Nevada, Iowa, is given a real opportunity to sell that product competitively,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be up and running and producing before you\u2019re going to see any benefit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Fed Set to Lift Interest Rates, the Little Guy Feels Anxious", "Date": "2015-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAURORA, Colo. \u2014 William Harris tapped his retirement savings to open A-Town Pizza, a Neapolitan pizzeria, in this Denver suburb three years ago. He borrowed $200,000 to open a second location this year and now employs 60 people. On a good Friday, his shops sell 1,200 pies.Mr. Harris, for one, is not ready. \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you hear that the government is planning to slow things down,\u201d the wiry 39-year-old said as he folded menus. \u201cWe live on people\u2019s extra money. That\u2019s the money they spend on pizza. And it still feels very fragile.\u201dMonetary policy is conducted in a language of bloodless abstraction, and most Americans pay little, if any, attention. But the Fed is about to make a big bet, and the decisions it makes in Washington have large consequences, here in Colorado and across the nation.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.The Fed\u2019s move is coming in the face of worries about the health of the stock market and falling commodities prices. Still, by itself, the increase probably will not matter much. The Fed is expected to set short-term rates in a range from 0.25 to 0.5 percent, a small jump from the current range of zero to 0.25 percent.It is what follows that will make the difference.Yet the local mood is fragile. Housing prices have climbed 24 percent above the precrisis peak, but whereas that once would have encouraged economic optimism, now people fret that home prices are due for a fall.Optimists say that the economic expansion is just gaining steam and that modestly higher rates will probably not slow the region\u2019s growth.\u201cThe Fed threw a bunch of money into the financial system, but it hasn\u2019t stimulated growth or inflation the way it might have in earlier periods,\u201d he said.Builders, for example, will start construction on about 9,000 single-family homes in the Denver metropolitan area this year, according to Metrostudy, a real estate research firm. That is up 14 percent from last year \u2014 but less than half the 20,000 home starts in the Denver area at the peak of the bubble in 2005.Others, however, are still waiting for prosperity to affect them.Ethel Ayo\u2019s landlord raised her rent this year by $400 a month, to $1,126. Ms. Ayo has a part-time job as a home-care worker and her son, a college student, works at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Together they can barely afford the rent \u2014 and then only because the landlord does not require full payment at the beginning of the month. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t hear me talk about food,\u201d Ms. Ayo said. \u201cAfter I work two or three days, I buy $50 of food and make it last two or three weeks.\u201dOfficials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.Mr. Harris, the restaurateur, says Denver\u2019s growth feels nothing like the boom he lived through in Southern California a decade ago. He is struggling to repay his start-up costs, particularly during the holidays, when people eat less pizza. The Fed will most likely raise rates before his risks have paid off. If it has overestimated the recovery and moves too fast, people will have less money to spend, and Mr. Harris said he could lose his restaurants and his retirement savings.On South Broadway, a commercial strip south of downtown lined with dilapidated auto dealerships and freshly painted marijuana shops, those worries seem far away. Khalid Sarway, sales manager at Famous Motors, says he is selling about 25 used cars a month, and he does not think higher rates will bother his customers.\u201cThe people, they don\u2019t care about the rate,\u201d said Mr. Sarway, who added that he was making more money now than in the best years before the recession. \u201cThey just want a vehicle. They just want to be able to get back and forth between their jobs and school, or whatever their lifestyle is.\u201dNorth of downtown, Denver\u2019s tech entrepreneurs also see little immediate danger from higher rates.Uber has its Denver office in one corner of the sprawling building.Mr. Adams is trying to raise $500,000 to test a biometric device that uses blood pressure readings to measure hydration levels \u2014 data that he says could help athletes as well as people with medical conditions, like those on dialysis.Like many of his peers, Mr. Adams thinks low rates have made it easier for young companies to raise money from investors seeking higher returns. Denver is also a technology frontier town, reliant on coastal capital, so it may be more vulnerable if the availability of funding begins to recede.But Mr. Adams said he expected the money to keep flowing even as rates on safer investments like corporate bonds start to rise. \u201cThe people I\u2019m pitching want to get in early and make a big multiple,\u201d he said.Some in the real estate business similarly insist that the local market will probably remain hot. Greg Geller, the owner of Vision Real Estate, says builders are struggling to keep pace with population growth because it takes years to find land, obtain permits and train replacements for workers laid off during the recession.Others are less sanguine. Mitchell Goldman, the owner of Apex Homes, said customers rushed to buy houses in recent years because they worried prices would climb. Now people are holding back, wondering if prices will fall.\u201cI\u2019ve been getting asked the question a lot, \u2018Should we wait?\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Goldman said he expected that higher rates would also push some buyers out of the market. The math, after all, is inexorable. If mortgage rates increase by one percentage point, the monthly cost of a $300,000 mortgage increases by $177.He added that he was looking for land to build a home for his own family. They have moved several times in recent years, but with higher interest rates on the horizon, he wants to build \u201ca more permanent forever home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little more anxious,\u201d Mr. Goldman said. \u201cInterest rates are never going to be what they were when I was growing up, but every little bit makes a difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shell Opens Natural Gas Wells Off Irish Coast", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpening the taps in the Corrib field, more than 50 miles offshore, is a breakthrough for the oil and gas industry in Ireland, which has had mostly disappointing results in recent years while encountering resistance from environmental groups.The gas was discovered in 1996, and Shell has struggled to win approval from the government for the project, which has long been opposed by local environmental campaigners. Philip Robinson, a Shell spokesman, attributed the long interval between discovery and the start of production to environmental opposition, but said relations with the local communities had improved in recent years.Kinsale Head, the only other major discovery off Ireland, which imports nearly all of its fuel needs, including large volumes of gas, has been online since 1978. Periodic bursts of excitement about oil and gas troves that might be found in Irish waters have ended up sputtering.Pat Shannon, chairman of the Irish Offshore Operators\u2019 Association, a trade group, said that the area where Corrib is, known as the Atlantic Margin, was promising for oil and gas operators.\u201cI think this is a very significant day for the exploration industry in Ireland,\u201d Mr. Shannon said.Alex White, Ireland\u2019s minister for communications, energy and natural resources, gave Shell the final go-ahead on Tuesday, saying that Ireland would benefit from having its own resources. In approving the project, Mr. White said he had made consent subject to 20 conditions, including \u201cenvironmental management.\u201dMr. White added that Ireland was committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and that gas, which is used for generating electric power, had a role in easing the transition to a greener economy. Developing local gas, Mr. White said, \u201cwill deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply\u201d and economic development.The minister said that the gas would meet more than 40 percent of demand on the island.Shell says that along with its partners, Statoil of Norway and Vermilion Energy Ireland, it has spent 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, on the project and that Corrib would provide 175 jobs for up to 20 years.Terence Conway, a spokesman for the group Shell to Sea, which has fought the project, said that opponents, who worried that building a large gas processing facility on land at a place called Bellanaboy Bridge risked accidents and pollution, had few options left. \u201cThere is not much more we can do at the moment,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Some looked at energy use and its consequences while others expressed optimism that with good governance, a community could clean up its mess.Here is a selection of the responses. They have been edited and condensed for clarity.Dependence on Fossil FuelsI blame the three Chinese oil giants over their crude oil processing standard. And China\u2019s infrastructure is frustratingly inadequate. There would be fewer cars and the air quality would improve if there were better public transportation. It is a complicated chain effect, and the underlying problem is bad governance.The main issue is fuel structure. China is using too big a percentage of fossil fuels. A secondary issue is its low standard in refining its fossil fuels.People always say, let\u2019s restrict gas-burning vehicles and instead encourage electric cars. But bringing cars like Tesla into China won\u2019t make a difference. They run on electricity and not on fossil fuels, but most of the electricity comes from coal-fired power plants. So the source of our problems is still there.Water Is Not BetterChina pushes hydro power as clean energy. But hydro power brings proven damage to the ecosystem. Maybe it means less carbon emission, but it has some disastrous effects, too.A China Problem?Just look at Beijing now, you will find how hypocritical China is. \u2014 Jammy Hsieh, Taipei, Taiwan Carbon emission is not any single country\u2019s problem. You can\u2019t just blame China. Other countries like the U.S. and the U.K. are just as bad emitters as China. Blaming China alone is unfair.You Americans and Europeans went through the same: economic growth first and environmental cleanup later. China is on the same road as you were! If this is not a carefully dressed innuendo, then what is it? It is like saying when you pollute, it is legal, but when others do it, it is not! Cheap shot!\u2014 Jessy Gu, ShanghaiChina will do the world a big favor if it can clean up its own environment. Let\u2019s not wish for any more than that.To me, smog is just a visual problem for now. China will be doomed if it ever becomes more than that.There Is Still HopePeople used to throw trash everywhere outside my apartment building. Then the community built a recycling station and ran educational campaigns about sorting your garbage before taking it out. Now our community is much better. The people are nicer.It takes the government and NGOs working together to improve neighborhood service and public education.There is nothing wrong with saving fuels and cutting emissions without hurting the economy and people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s for an environment we all share.A Dystopian BeijingI published a sci-fi story that did not feel so sci-fi called \u201cThe Smog Society\u201d in 2006. The story is set in a heavily polluted Beijing in the future, where everybody wears a mask when they go outdoors. The protagonist, Lao Sun, is a retiree and a member of the Smog Society, a nongovernmental organization that runs independent monitoring of the air quality for real, uncensored data.Nine years later, everything has become our everyday reality. Beijing has become the smog capital, with its air pollution as bad as that of London on Dec. 5, 1952. The official air-quality reports are not reliable. The Chinese have learned to make fun of it and of themselves, posting surreal photos on social media and writing smog jokes. They research on different brands of masks and air filters. My friends, middle-class elites with good educations and handsome incomes, are all worried about their children. When the government lifted the ban on a second child and encouraged couples to have children, one mom said, \u201cThe weather is depressing. What is the point of choosing kindergartens, or buying a house close to a good school? What is the point of choosing between a public school and an international one? It\u2019s all pointless. I feel guilty and anxious seeing my kid grow up in this environment.\u201dI think China has moved past the time when people could be reduced to statistical numbers and living equaled surviving. Perhaps policy makers should change the way they think accordingly as they handle pollution and other issues where people\u2019s lives are at stake.\u2014 Stanley Chan, 34, Beijing, tech start-up manager and science-fiction writerAdvertisement"}

The neo-Nazi website, Daily Stormer, was out and proud earlier this week: \u201cHeil Donald Trump \u2014 the Ultimate Savior.\u201d After endorsing the Republican presidential front-runner earlier this year for his call to deport 11 million Mexican immigrants, the fomenters of American fascism have now added an apt twist to his slogan, one not far from the truth of the campaign: \u201cMake America White Again.\u201dAnd sure, all the little Hitlers probably don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans. But what about the 35 percent of Republican voters, in the New York Times/CBS News poll, who say they\u2019re all in with the man sieg heiled by aspiring brownshirts and men in white sheets?It\u2019s a very ugly political moment, but there it is: The Republican Party is now home to millions of people who would throw out the Constitution, welcome a police state against Latinos and Muslims, and enforce a religious test for entry into a country built by people fleeing religious persecution. This stuff polls well in their party, even if the Bill of Rights does not.Trump\u2019s proposal \u2014 \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d \u2014 is not just flotsam from the lunatic fringe. Well, it is. But the fringe is huge: Early polls show a plurality of Republican voters agree with Trump on banning all Muslims. And many would go even further.\u201cAdd in every other kind of immigrant and it\u2019s perfect,\u201d tweeted Ann Coulter, who sells xenophobia as a mean girl provocateur, with many friends in the far right media universe.Trump himself doesn\u2019t seem to care about comparisons to the buffoonish (Mussolini), the truly scary (the evil one admired by the Daily Stormer) or the fictional \u2014 worse than Voldemort, as J. K. Rowling tweeted.He sloughed off the fascism talk by associating his proposal with the internment in America of the Japanese during World War II. There\u2019s a winning thought. I was wondering when he was going to get around to alienating Asian-Americans, the highest-earning, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States, according to Pew.To review: He started with \u201cthe blacks,\u201d through his smear campaign on the citizenship of the nation\u2019s first African-American president. Moved on to Mexicans, war veterans, women who look less than flawless in middle age, the disabled, all Muslims and now people whose grandparents were rousted from their American homes and put in camps.Which gets us back to his base and their awful bedfellows in the neo-Nazi bunkers. Who are these people? His supporters, most of them, do not see the shadow of the Reich when they look in the mirror. They are white, lower middle class, with little education beyond high school. The global economy has run them over. They don\u2019t recognize their country. And they need a villain.Trump has no solutions for the desperate angst of his followers. Tearing up trade agreements is not going to happen. Deporting workers who pick our fruit and hang sheetrock is not going to lift the fortunes of those who will no longer do those jobs. Barring all Muslims will not make us safer.What he\u2019s done is to give marginalized Americans permission to hate. He doesn\u2019t use dog whistles or code. His bigotry is overt. But the table was set by years of dog whistles and code. The very \u201cun-American\u201d sentiment that Republican elders now claim to despise has been a mainstay of conservative media for at least a decade.Yes, it\u2019s encouraging that what is left of establishment Republicans have condemned Trump\u2019s most odious idea yet. Sarah Palin, who stirred the resentment of \u201creal Americans\u201d against the nefarious Other when her party put her on the ticket in 2008, stands nearly alone in backing Trump\u2019s call to bar entry into our country by adherents of the world\u2019s second largest faith.Still, it\u2019s hard to take seriously House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s rare objection to a lunatic suggestion from his party\u2019s presidential front-runner when he says he would also back Trump should he be the nominee.\u201cIt\u2019s not our party,\u201d lamented Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s not our country.\u201d As a Mormon, the senator has to be familiar with a time when there was an open war on his faith, when Mormons were considered not only un-American but domestic terrorists.That history is instructive, as we struggle with Trump\u2019s hysteria and the millions fired up by his hate. But the only way to get rid of the goose-steppers drawn to the G.O.P. is to vow to never support the man giving them something to march to.Advertisement"}

Even the lowest subsidy estimates far exceed the pledge by advanced industrialized nations to spend $100 billion a year by 2020 to fight climate change.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Critics of subsidies say their greatest benefits go to the middle class and the rich, who can better afford cars.That report noted that some countries spent a greater share of their gross domestic product on fossil fuel subsidies than on health or education.Going into the Paris climate talks, China, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Morocco, Singapore and Vietnam had committed to addressing subsidies, Mr. Kretzmann said. \u201cGovernments have a lot of incentive and opportunity to eliminate those now, with oil prices so low,\u201d he added.And as prices have dropped, subsidies have been reduced in many countries, including India, Indonesia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, said Dr. Hare of Climate Analytics.While attempts to cut subsidies have led to social unrest, more recent efforts, including a gradual phaseout to soften the blow, have enjoyed quiet success.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t want to solve these countries\u2019 fiscal problems on the backs of their weakest citizens,\u201d Mr. Levi said.\u201cI doubt that eliminating the intangible drilling cost write-off would reduce oil production at all,\u201d he said.An article last Sunday about global fossil fuel subsidies misstated the amount of gasoline that sells for 2 cents in Venezuela.

Apple executives have repeatedly stated that they pay the required amount of tax in the countries where they operate.Europe\u2019s increased focus on Apple, though, forms part of a growing crackdown by European officials on the tax dealings of many American international companies operating in the 28-member bloc.Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, whose European operations are based in low-tax Luxembourg, are also facing similar inquiries into their tax dealings. The companies have denied any wrongdoing.Apple, which has denied accusations that it does not pay enough tax in certain countries where it generates significant revenue, is just one of a number of American companies that have used Ireland as a base for its international headquarters.Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the Western world, compared with 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States, though Irish officials deny that the low-tax structure represents unfair competition.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nations Approve Landmark Climate Accord in Paris", "Date": "2015-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLE BOURGET, France \u2014 With the sudden bang of a gavel Saturday night, representatives of 195 nations reached a landmark accord that will, for the first time, commit nearly every country to lowering planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to help stave off the most drastic effects of climate change.The deal, which was met with an eruption of cheers and ovations from thousands of delegates gathered from around the world, represents a historic breakthrough on an issue that has foiled decades of international efforts to address climate change.Traditionally, such pacts have required developed economies like the United States to take action to lower greenhouse gas emissions, but they have exempted developing countries like China and India from such obligations.The accord, which United Nations diplomats have been working toward for nine years, changes that dynamic by requiring action in some form from every country, rich or poor.\u201cThis is truly a historic moment,\u201d the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said in an interview. \u201cFor the first time, we have a truly universal agreement on climate change, one of the most crucial problems on earth.\u201dA group of 195 nations reached a landmark climate agreement on Saturday. Here is what it means for the planet, business, politics and other areas.President Obama, who regards tackling climate change as a central element of his legacy, spoke of the deal in a televised address from the White House. \u201cThis agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is fully committed to a low-carbon future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.\u201dScientists and leaders said the talks here represented the world\u2019s last, best hope of striking a deal that would begin to avert the most devastating effects of a warming planet.Mr. Ban said there was \u201cno Plan B\u201d if the deal fell apart. The Eiffel Tower was illuminated with that phrase Friday night.The new deal will not, on its own, solve global warming. At best, scientists who have analyzed it say, it will cut global greenhouse gas emissions by about half enough as is necessary to stave off an increase in atmospheric temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That is the point at which, scientific studies have concluded, the world will be locked into a future of devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, severe droughts and flooding, widespread food and water shortages and more destructive storms.But the Paris deal could represent the moment at which, because of a shift in global economic policy, the inexorable rise in planet-warming carbon emissions that started during the Industrial Revolution began to level out and eventually decline.At the same time, the deal could be viewed as a signal to global financial and energy markets, triggering a fundamental shift away from investment in coal, oil and gas as primary energy sources toward zero-carbon energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear power.Highlights from the final draft text of a climate agreement submitted to the delegates in Paris.\u201cThe world finally has a framework for cooperating on climate change that\u2019s suited to the task,\u201d said Michael Levi, an expert on energy and climate change policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cWhether or not this becomes a true turning point for the world, though, depends critically on how seriously countries follow through.\u201dJust five years ago, such a deal seemed politically impossible. A similar 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen collapsed in acrimonious failure after countries could not unite around a deal.Unlike in Copenhagen, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France said on Saturday, the stars for this assembly were aligned.The changes that led to the Paris accord came about through a mix of factors, particularly major shifts in the domestic politics and bilateral relationships of China and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest greenhouse gas polluters.Since the Copenhagen deal collapsed, scientific studies have confirmed that the earliest impacts of climate change have started to sweep across the planet. While scientists once warned that climate change was a problem for future generations, recent scientific reports have concluded that it has started to wreak havoc now, from flooding in Miami to droughts and water shortages in China.In a remarkable shift from their previous standoffs over the issue, senior officials from both the United States and China praised the Paris accord on Saturday night.Secretary of State John Kerry, who has spent the past year negotiating behind the scenes with his Chinese and Indian counterparts in order to help broker the deal, said, \u201cThe world has come together around an agreement that will empower us to chart a new path for our planet.\u201dXie Zhenhua, the senior Chinese climate change negotiator, said, \u201cThe agreement is not perfect, and there are some areas in need of improvement.\u201d But he added, \u201cThis does not prevent us from marching forward with this historic step.\u201d Mr. Xie called the deal \u201cfair and just, comprehensive and balanced, highly ambitious, enduring and effective.\u201dNegotiators from many countries have said that a crucial moment in the path to the Paris accord came last year in the United States, when Mr. Obama enacted the nation\u2019s first climate change policy \u2014 a set of stringent new Environmental Protection Agency regulations designed to slash greenhouse gas pollution from the nation\u2019s coal-fired power plants. Meanwhile, in China, the growing internal criticism over air pollution from coal-fired power plants led President Xi Jinping to pursue domestic policies to cut coal use.In November 2014 in Beijing, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced that they would jointly pursue plans to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions. That breakthrough announcement was seen as paving the way to the Paris deal, in which nearly all the world\u2019s nations have jointly announced similar plans.The final language did not fully satisfy everyone. Representatives of some developing nations expressed consternation. Poorer countries had pushed for a legally binding provision requiring that rich countries appropriate a minimum of at least $100 billion a year to help them mitigate and adapt to the ravages of climate change. In the final deal, that $100 billion figure appears only in a preamble, not in the legally binding portion of the agreement.\u201cWe\u2019ve always said that it was important that the $100 billion was anchored in the agreement,\u201d said Tosi Mpanu-Mpanu, a negotiator for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the incoming leader of a coalition known as the Least Developed Countries coalition. In the end, though, they let it go.Despite the historic nature of the Paris climate accord, its success still depends heavily on two factors outside the parameter of the deal: global peer pressure and the actions of future governments.The core of the Paris deal is a requirement that every nation take part. Ahead of the Paris talks, governments of 186 nations put forth public plans detailing how they would cut carbon emissions through 2025 or 2030.Those plans alone, once enacted, will cut emissions by half the levels required to stave off the worst effects of global warming. The national plans vary vastly in scope and ambition \u2014 while every country is required to put forward a plan, there is no legal requirement dictating how, or how much, countries should cut emissions.Thus, the Paris pact has built in a series of legally binding requirements that countries ratchet up the stringency of their climate change policies in the future. Countries will be required to reconvene every five years, starting in 2020, with updated plans that would tighten their emissions cuts.Countries will also be legally required to reconvene every five years starting in 2023 to publicly report on how they are doing in cutting emissions compared to their plans. They will be legally required to monitor and report on their emissions levels and reductions, using a universal accounting system.That hybrid legal structure was explicitly designed in response to the political reality in the United States. A deal that would have assigned legal requirements for countries to cut emissions at specific levels would need to go before the United States Senate for ratification. That language would have been dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, where many members question the established science of human-caused climate change, and still more wish to thwart Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda.Seven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.So the individual countries\u2019 plans are voluntary, but the legal requirements that they publicly monitor, verify and report what they are doing, as well as publicly put forth updated plans, are designed to create a \u201cname-and-shame\u201d system of global peer pressure, in hopes that countries will not want to be seen as international laggards.That system depends heavily on the views of the future world leaders who will carry out those policies. In the United States, every Republican candidate running for president in 2016 has publicly questioned or denied the science of climate change, and has voiced opposition to Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies.In the Senate, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, who has led the charge against Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, said, \u201cBefore his international partners pop the champagne, they should remember that this is an unattainable deal based on a domestic energy plan that is likely illegal, that half the states have sued to halt, and that Congress has already voted to reject.\u201dThere were few of those concerns at the makeshift negotiations center here in this suburb north of Paris. The delegates rose to their feet in applause to thank the French delegation, which drew on the finest elements of the country\u2019s longstanding traditions of diplomacy to broker a deal that was acceptable to all sides.France\u2019s European partners recalled the coordinated Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people and threatened to cast a shadow over the negotiations. But, bound by a collective good will toward France, countries redoubled their efforts.\u201cThis demonstrates the strength of the French nation and makes us Europeans all proud of the French nation,\u201d said Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for energy and climate action.Yet amid the spirit of success that dominated the final hours of the negotiations, Mr. Arias Ca\u00f1ete reminded delegates that the accord was the beginning of the real work. \u201cToday, we celebrate,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow, we have to act. This is what the world expects of us.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the approval of a landmark climate accord by 195 nations misstated, in some editions, part of the name of the agency that employs Michael Levi, an energy expert, who said, \u201cThe world finally has a framework for cooperating on climate change that\u2019s suited to the task.\u201d The agency is the Council on Foreign Relations, not the Center on Foreign Relations.An earlier version of the above correction misstated the number of nations that approved the deal. It was 195, not 193.Sewell Chan, Melissa Eddy, Justin Gillis and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fixing Fannie and Freddie for Good", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsIN the longstanding debate about what should be done to overhaul Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage behemoths that taxpayers rescued at the height of the financial crisis, a growing number of groups, including several hedge funds and other investors, as well as civil rights groups and consumer advocates, are offering a surprising answer: Go back to the very system we just bailed out.In September 2008, after the two institutions had racked up tens of billions in losses that had wiped out their capital, and amid fears about what their insolvency might mean for the American housing market and the wider economy, the then newly created Federal Housing Finance Agency stepped in to place Fannie and Freddie in conservatorship. Taxpayers have backstopped the two institutions and their mortgage securities ever since.Yet, hard as it is to imagine, given the colossal scale of this bailout and the dramatic effect that their failure had on the broader economy, many are arguing that we should now resurrect Fannie and Freddie as the privately owned but taxpayer-backed oligopoly whose collapse contributed mightily to the financial turmoil and resulting Great Recession.More surprising still, one of the primary reasons offered by many proponents of this view is that we cannot end their stranglehold without decreasing competition in the mortgage market.This view isn\u2019t merely counterintuitive; it\u2019s wrong.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among the largest financial institutions in the world, currently purchasing roughly one-half of the mortgages issued by lenders in the United States. They package and create securities out of these loans, and provide guarantees to the investors that they will be paid their principal and interest under any economic scenario. They thus act as critical gatekeepers in determining what kinds of mortgage loans lenders can make, and who gets a loan and under what terms.The concern is that any move to reform Fannie and Freddie by diminishing their dominance of the housing finance system will inevitably mean that the nation\u2019s biggest banks will swoop in to take over their gatekeeping role. If they do, then these banks will use that power to their advantage, squeezing out smaller competitors.This would indeed be a bad outcome. We would simply be swapping one dysfunctional system dependent on too-big-to-fail institutions for another with the same problem.If this were what reforming Fannie and Freddie was all about, then the critics of reform would be right. But it\u2019s not.The point of the kind of reform that we support is to end the system\u2019s dependence on too-big-to-fail institutions. It is critical to ensure that no institution central to the system has an incentive to take on excessive risk, knowing that taxpayers will bail them out if things go wrong, as happened with Fannie and Freddie and could happen in a system overly dominated by other too-big-to-fail institutions.One of us, Mark Zandi, is on the board of a mortgage insurer; the other, Jim Parrott, advises several financial institutions in the housing finance industry. Some of these institutions could benefit from Fannie and Freddie reform, while others may suffer. But our focus is not the interests of these institutions, any more than it is those of the big banks or the shareholders of Fannie and Freddie. The aim of reform should be to create a healthier housing finance system, which means, among other things, one with greater competition.In winding down Fannie and Freddie\u2019s duopoly, Congress could and, we have long argued, should explicitly prohibit institutions that make mortgage loans from also playing the role of gatekeeper to the secondary market of mortgage-backed securities. Congress could also cap the market share of any single gatekeeper at a low enough level to preclude market concentration, or it could even create new gatekeepers to ensure that smaller lenders never are locked out of making mortgage loans.Legislative reform could be a long time coming, however, given the complex politics of the issue. In the meantime, the F.H.F.A. should work to ease the mortgage giants\u2019 unhealthy hold on the market.The agency has already taken two steps that hold great promise: requiring that Fannie and Freddie share the risk they take when guaranteeing mortgage securities with a broad range of private financial institutions, and that they develop a common platform for offering securities on mortgage loans.Done right, these steps could eventually open up the market to greater competition, reducing the dominance of Fannie and Freddie without enabling other too-big-to-fail institutions to take their place.It is simply not true that we are forced to choose between one system dominated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and another dominated by a few huge banks. The argument is at best ill considered, and at worst a red herring that will undermine any attempt to achieve significant reform.There is no reason we can\u2019t create a dynamic mortgage market with plenty of competition, free of an unhealthy dependence on institutions we cannot afford to let fail. As we consider reforming the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we should settle for nothing less.Jim Parrott is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and the owner of Falling Creek Advisors, a financial consulting firm.

There are certainly frightening parallels, in the demagoguery of some of our presidential candidates, in the polarization of our politics, in the nationalist reaction to our foreign policy challenges, and in the intolerance to our ethnic and religious differences.But the context of American politics is significantly different from that of Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. We have no nostalgia for an authoritarian past, our political system is replete with checks and balances against concentrated power, and our political culture reflects our heterogeneous society.The very characteristics that make American politics so frustrating to many people are also the safeguards against the collapse of democracy that Germany \u2014 and many other European countries \u2014 experienced in the first third of the 20th century.Gerhard Loewenberg, Iowa City, IowaMany people think it is preposterous to draw analogies to Weimar Germany when discussing American politics in the 2016 elections or to take Donald Trump seriously, but Roger Cohen reminds us we have good reason to be frightened, not only of ISIS but of ourselves and what the politics of fear and hate can do and have done to democracies.Hermann G\u00f6ring, speaking during the Nuremberg trials, said: \u201cVoice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.\u201d We all need to take the threats to our democracy seriously whether they emanate from outside or inside America.Laura Norman, New YorkDonald Trump is not Hitler. He is however the logical outgrowth of what our political class has done to America. Washington has weakened us, divided us, made us poorer and more dependent, has made us less-respected and less-feared, and has laid upon us a caste of bureaucracy that imposes governmental ossification while making itself wildly richer and more powerful.Anyone who can turn that ship around is worthy of our attention, and maybe our votes. Surely no Democrat in America today is capable of or desirous of steering that ship. Trump has seen what Washington has done to America.

{"Headline": "Fed Raises Key Interest Rate for First Time in Almost a Decade", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInterest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans, and on savings accounts and other kinds of investments, are likely to remain low for years to come.\u201cThe economic recovery has clearly come a long way, although it is not complete,\u201d the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said at a news conference after the announcement. Exactly seven years ago, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero in order to nurse the ailing economy back to health. Recently it changed direction. This is how it works.The decision \u201crecognizes the considerable progress that has been made toward restoring jobs, raising incomes and easing the economic hardships that have been endured by millions of ordinary Americans,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. The Fed\u2019s announcement came exactly seven years to the day after the central bank cut its benchmark rate nearly to zero.The Fed is trying to tiptoe between two kinds of danger. It wants to raise rates to improve its defenses against future risks, including higher inflation or another economic downturn. But if it moves too quickly, it risks undermining the current recovery. It faces the additional challenge of increasing domestic rates while other central banks are holding rates down.The result, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, is a plan for the \u201cloosest tightening\u201d in the Fed\u2019s modern history. Move too quickly, Mr. El-Erian said, and the Fed could \u201ccause severe market volatility, undermining economic conditions.\u201dOfficials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.The decision on Wednesday was the most important and riskiest step the Fed has taken since Ms. Yellen became chairwoman in early 2014. Every other developed nation that has raised rates since the end of the financial crisis has been forced to backtrack as growth slowed.Financial markets took the news calmly. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 1. 5 percent to close at 2,073.07. The yield on two-year Treasuries, closely tied to short-term interest rates, closed above 1 percent for the first time since April 2010.Ms. Yellen will now face the challenge of maintaining an internal consensus over the pace of rate increases amid considerable economic uncertainty and the political pressures of a presidential election year.Ms. Yellen won the support of all 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, a victory that reflects the Fed\u2019s tradition of maintaining the appearance of consensus on major decisions. Three of those officials had argued in recent months that the economy might not be ready for higher rates, a view shared by some economists and by Democrats who argue that the Fed is prematurely curtailing job and wage growth.\u201cWhen millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates is bad news for working families,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe Fed should act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago.\u201dSome Republicans, meanwhile, bid good riddance to the era of near-zero interest rates. \u201cUnsustainably low interest rates clearly didn\u2019t solve the problem, or else Americans today wouldn\u2019t be stuck in the slowest, worst-performing economic recovery of our lifetimes,\u201d Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.The Fed cited strong job growth, and the broader backdrop of a moderate but steady economic expansion, as evidence that the economy no longer needed quite as much of its help. \u201cThe committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise over the medium term to its 2 percent objective,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting.The Fed also released economic projections by its senior officials underscoring that they expect slow growth. The officials predicted, on average, that the economy would expand by 2.4 percent next year, while the unemployment rate would drop to 4.7 percent. Even as they forecast joblessness would remain low, they predicted inflation would rise only gradually to the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as most healthy.Most officials predicted the Fed would once again miss its 2 percent inflation target next year.At the news conference, Ms. Yellen faced repeated questions about the persistent sluggishness of inflation. She posed the question to herself in her opening statement, \u201cWith inflation currently still low, why is the committee raising the federal funds rate target?\u201d Because, she said, inflation was being suppressed temporarily by factors like lower oil prices but would rise as job growth continued. She added that the Fed needed to act because monetary policy works gradually.\u201cAbrupt tightening could increase the risk of pushing the economy into recession,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The Fed\u2019s initial rate increase, effective on Thursday, is likely to have a modest impact on the broader economy. JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank, announced soon after the Fed\u2019s decision that it would raise its prime rate to 3.5 percent, increasing the interest rate on many loans. But the bank said it would not increase the rate it pays on deposits. Wells Fargo and Bank of America similarly took advantage of the Fed\u2019s decision to fatten profit margins rather than pass along the benefits to savers.As the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate rises, mortgage rates and other long-term borrowing costs are likely to rise too, but the relationship is not mechanical. During the housing boom, mortgage rates barely budged as the Fed increased short-term rates because of increased foreign investment. That pattern could recur if investors once again conclude that the United States is the safest place to park money.Still, some analysts said they expected higher rates would begin to curtail economic activity fairly quickly, pointing for example to the auto market. Cheap loans have spurred car sales to record heights even as home sales have lagged. Higher rates \u201cwill hurt borrowers and it will hurt the real economy because that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the auto industry right now,\u201d said William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Financial markets began the process of adjustment in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s announcement, and there, too, some signs of stress were evident. Corporations with questionable credit, for example, are paying more to borrow money. Average yields on junk bonds climbed to 8.86 percent on Tuesday from 6.72 percent in January.But it has pumped so much money into the system as part of its stimulus campaign that drainage is impractical. Instead, beginning Thursday morning, the Fed planned to pay banks and other financial firms not to lend below its new benchmark rate.To set the new base line, the Fed said it would pay banks a rate of 0.5 percent on unused money, and would borrow up to $2 trillion from other financial firms at a rate of 0.25 percent.Those measures were stronger than markets had expected, reflecting the Fed\u2019s determination.Advertisement"}

Now he is waiting for an opportunity to go to Libya.\u201cIf I get a chance, I will go,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I have the money.\u201dEven after two years, some may consider him a recent migrant here. For decades, eastern Sudan has hosted refugees from both countries. Eritrea\u2019s decades-long war of independence brought tens of thousands here, as did political strife in parts of Ethiopia. While many have accustomed themselves to a challenging life in Sudan, many of their children now are looking for better opportunities elsewhere.\u201cSudan has always been at the crossroads of migration routes, for refugees and migrants,\u201d said Angela Li Rosi, deputy representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Sudan.Ghere Abraham, 45, is an Eritrean refugee who has lived in Sudan for nearly 30 years. A video of Islamic State fighters in Libya slaughtering Ethiopian and Eritrean migrants this year sickened him. Two of the people killed in the video had lived in his neighborhood in Khartoum.The April evening the video was released, he went to the neighborhood church where condolences were being offered. It also reminded him of what could have happened to his eldest daughter, who tried recently to cross the Sahara to the Mediterranean with hopes of reaching Europe. He managed to stop her just in time, after threatening to kill the broker responsible for putting her in contact with smugglers.\u201cI cried when I saw her,\u201d he said.His daughter, Hiweit Abraham, 20, spoke grudgingly about the events, with no regrets about making the attempt to leave.\u201cI have no life, no respect, there\u2019s nothing I can do here,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I am a refugee.\u201dMustafa Ismail Abdalla, 25, grew up in Sudan. His father was a political activist with the Oromo Liberation Front, an Ethiopian rebel group labeled a terrorist organization by the Ethiopian government. But his life he is about working: He has been doing it since he was 8 and juggles three jobs today.\u201cSome of my friends went a few months ago and are in France now,\u201d he said. \u201cI just need a little more money and I will go.\u201dThe high season for departures is February to October, when the waters along the Mediterranean tend to be lower, migrants here say. The smugglers have waiting lists, and many who make the trip face the dangers of detention, beatings, abuse and sexual assault in the desert. While most of the migrants heading to Libya are from Eritrea and Ethiopia, increasing numbers are Sudanese, especially from Darfur, as well as Syrians and even Pakistanis and Nigerians who travel to the Mediterranean via Sudan. Here, they contact the smugglers through brokers, who take off into the desert from meeting points throughout the capital that shift to avoid detection.\u201cIt\u2019s around $1,200 to get to Libya,\u201d Ali Ibrahim, a smuggler, said. \u201cPrices go up and down if there are problems.\u201dFrom the outskirts of Khartoum, four-by-four pickups with 20 to 30 \u201cheads\u201d journey through Sudan\u2019s northern desert to the Libyan border, where they are delivered to another group of smugglers.\u201cIf you die in the desert, no one would know,\u201d said Mr. Ibrahim, the smuggler, elaborating on the dangers of the trip.\u201cThere are children that run away, make their arrangements with smugglers, call their parents, \u2018Mom, I\u2019m in Benghazi\u2019\u201d Bernardo said.The Sudanese government is paying more attention to migration. Last year, the Sudanese Parliament passed an extensive anti-human-trafficking bill and held an international conference to address the problem.\u201cWe lack the experience and are calling for more training,\u201d said Awad Dahia, head of passports, immigration and civil registration at the Ministry of Interior.But some migrants contend that Sudanese officers are involved in the illegal trade as well.\u201cIf there is credible evidence against anyone, an officer or a government official, then the law should be applied against them,\u201d Mr. Dahia said.For the migrants and refugees here who want a better life and to move on, there is a debate on the fruitfulness of the risks taken.Mr. Abraham, who said that he was worried that his 14-year-old son would also try to leave, believes that the risks taken by the younger generation of refugees and migrants are not worth it.\u201cThey are after a life that does not exist,\u201d he said.But Mr. Taero, the former university student, felt that was no reason to stay.\u201cIt does not matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also dying here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Introduce Bill for Puerto Rico Relief", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnder pressure to help Puerto Rico avoid a bond default on Jan. 1, Senate Republicans introduced a bill on Wednesday to extend several forms of assistance to the island.But the measure stopped well short of embracing proposals from the Obama administration, which include giving Puerto Rico access to bankruptcy court.The senators acted as Antonio Weiss, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, warned that without congressional action, Puerto Rico risked \u201canother lost decade.\u201dThe Republicans\u2019 measure would include up to $3 billion in cash relief, a payroll tax break for residents of the island and a new independent authority that could borrow for Puerto Rico \u2014 but with no taxpayer guarantee.\u201cConsistent with the views of Congress and the administration that there will be no \u2018bailout\u2019\u00a0\u201d of Puerto Rico, said a bill summary, \u201cthe full faith and credit of the United States is not pledged for the payment of debt obligations issued by the authority.\u201dThe bill also called for Puerto Rico \u2014 and all the states \u2014 to disclose, for the first time, the true financial condition of their pension systems for government workers. Currently, governments use actuarial numbers, which can significantly understate a pension plan\u2019s cost. Shifting to fair-value numbers could help with coming negotiations in which Puerto Rico has said it plans to divert money from its bondholders and use it to pay pensions.The proposed new disclosures would also make it easier to identify other states whose pension systems are so distressed that they may have to try similar negotiations in the future.To get the $3 billion, the bill proposed tapping a $12 billion public-health fund created under the Affordable Care Act, for research and preventive medicine programs nationwide. The bill summary said the money was as yet \u201cunobligated,\u201d and could be \u201crepurposed\u201d with federal supervision to help tide Puerto Rico through an alarming cash squeeze this winter.To give Puerto Rican workers a tax break, the bill would reduce by 50 percent the Social Security taxes now withheld from their paychecks.And in an echo of the control board that Congress imposed on the District of Columbia in the 1990s, the Republicans\u2019 bill would designate a \u201cchief financial officer\u201d for Puerto Rico to advise the island\u2019s governor on drafting and sticking to an annual budget.The legislation was introduced by the Republican chairmen of three Senate committees with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico\u2019s affairs: Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, whose Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax policy; Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, whose Judiciary Committee is responsible for bankruptcy law; and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has jurisdiction over matters involving America\u2019s territories.Each of those committees has recently held a hearing on Puerto Rico\u2019s travails, taking expert testimony on the severity of the island\u2019s debt crisis and what might be done to restore stability and economic growth. In each of the hearings, Republicans said they wanted to help, but were troubled by a lack of information about the Puerto Rican government\u2019s spending practices.\u201cDespite repeated attempts by Congress to clarify how the interplay between federal tax, health care and pension policies affect the territory\u2019s economy, we have been unable to receive audited financial statements from Puerto Rico or adequate information from federal health officials,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in a statement. \u201cFederal taxpayers and the Puerto Rican people deserve better.\u201dHe and the other senators said they had decided to go ahead with a bill based on the limited information they already had. They said it would take time to solve Puerto Rico\u2019s problems, and in the meantime they hoped to get more financial information.Lawmakers from both parties have been working toward a Jan. 1 deadline, when Puerto Rico owes bond payments of as much as $902 million, according to the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research institute in San Juan. So far, the island has been struggling to stay current on most of its obligations. But officials say they are running out of cash and it is not clear that Puerto Rico will have enough money to pay what it owes on Jan. 1.About $332 million of that bond payment is for general-obligation bonds, which are constitutionally guaranteed in Puerto Rico. It would be unprecedented, and unlawful, for Puerto Rico to skip such a payment outside of bankruptcy \u2014 yet Puerto Rico is barred from using Chapter 9 bankruptcy.The Obama administration has expressed doubt that Puerto Rico could successfully restructure without being able to impair all of its bonds, including those with constitutional protection. But Republican lawmakers suspect that if Puerto Rico were to get the tools to legally impair its general-obligation debt, it would not be long before fiscally troubled states, like Illinois, came calling for the same thing.On the details of how to revive Puerto Rico\u2019s failing pension system, or changing the way doctors on the island are paid by federal programs like Medicare, the bill proposes only further study.The legislation was introduced during end-of-the-session drama in Washington, as the governor of Puerto Rico came to Washington to make one last plea for help.Speaking at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Mr. Weiss, the Treasury official, said that the National Economic Council and the Treasury had already \u201cconvened a broad, administration-wide effort\u201d among federal agencies \u201cto develop the most effective policy response to the crisis.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cit has become clear that resolving Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis requires congressional action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In E.U. Crises, a Decentralized Alternative", "Date": "2015-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyBrussels\u2019 knee-jerk reaction to crises is to ask for more power. Its latest series of problems has fueled right-wing populism, which feeds off the idea that the European Union already has too much influence. Unless the bloc adopts more decentralized solutions, it could unravel.As the European Union grapples with an influx of refugees, terrorism and the lingering euro crisis, some prominent people are outlining apocalyptic visions. Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, has compared the European Union\u2019s current position to the decline of the Roman Empire, arguing that it has let its defenses crumble. Brendan Simms, a history professor at Cambridge University, has drawn parallels with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, saying these were all unsuccessful attempts to create supranational entities.Meanwhile, Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National, speaks gleefully about the possibility that Britain could leave the European Union, saying this would be like the fall of the Berlin Wall. One senior European Union official agreed, though he was morose rather than gleeful about the prospect. If Britain leaves after its referendum on the topic, he said, voters in other countries might ask for plebiscites of their own.The European Union is doing a poor job of managing its multiple crises. One million refugees and economic migrants have entered the bloc illegally this year, most taking advantage of Greece\u2019s lack of effective border controls. A few of the jihadists responsible for the Paris attacks last month have exploited the weakness. As if this was not bad enough, the eurozone economy is growing only slowly and flirting with deflation.All these topics, as well as the threat of a British exit from the European Union, were on the agenda when leaders met on Dec. 17 and 18. They reached few firm conclusions.The two big crises \u2014 over the euro and migration \u2014 have common features. The European Union was overly ambitious in creating both the single currency and the border-free Schengen Area. It didn\u2019t have the tools to manage either effectively. Nor was the European Commission strong enough to police the rules that had been agreed on. The commission\u2019s response has been to push for more centralization. Part of its answer to the euro crisis is to establish the post of eurozone finance minister. Its solution to the migration problem includes creating a coast and border guard that could, in extremis, intervene in a Schengen country against its own government\u2019s wishes.From a technocratic perspective, these ideas make some sense. But they both would involve significant and symbolically important losses of national sovereignty.If the European Union were seen as an effective and legitimate institution, it might be able to get away with such a power shift. But, with euro-skepticism rife not just in Britain, these proposals are a godsend for the populist right.The European Commission is determined to push the ideas because it sees no other way of keeping the show on the road. This betrays a lack of imagination. With the euro crisis, there is a decentralized alternative based on using the discipline of markets rather than rules. The key is to make investors pay when either governments or banks borrow too much.To be fair, the eurozone has already made some strides to ensure that bank investors share the financial burden of rescues via \u201cbail-ins.\u201d But it has done little to stop lenders from being infected by overindebted governments.One solution is to tell banks they must limit their financial exposure to any particular state. Such a change could cause trouble for countries like Italy, pushing up their borrowing costs. But now is the perfect time to start the transition, given that the European Central Bank is buying so many government bonds and keeping a lid on yields.Similarly, there is an alternative to a border guard that can swoop into a country against its government\u2019s wishes. This is to suspend from Schengen any country that isn\u2019t doing an adequate job of policing its frontiers and doesn\u2019t call on the proposed European border and coast guard for help.The advantage of such decentralized solutions is that they push back responsibility onto nation-states and don\u2019t require transfers of sovereignty that are politically unfeasible.Something like this is needed because, otherwise, there is a risk that the European Union could disintegrate. That would not only cause economic damage; it would make Europe weak at a time when its neighborhood has become increasingly dangerous.Advertisement"}

A similar dynamic was in play in departmental elections in March, when over half of the left\u2019s voters switched to the mainstream right candidate in the second round, and the right went on to win 535 out of 538 contests with the National Front.J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, a polling expert, noted that the \u201cRepublican front was effective, as a big proportion of the left\u2019s voters voted for the right,\u201d meaning Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party. In the southern region around Nice, 65 percent of those who voted Socialist in the first round voted for the right\u2019s candidate in the second, and in the north around Lille, where Ms. Le Pen was running, the figure was 70 percent, Mr. Fourquet said at a news conference.The gravelly voiced party leader, perpetually sucking on an electronic cigarette, appears to both revel in that status and to be embittered by it. And since she represents the \u201ccourageous and determined patriots,\u201d defeat is never her party\u2019s fault. Nevermind the big turnout Sunday \u2014 jumping by more than eight percentage points between the first and second rounds, suggesting an electorate mobilized to beat her \u2014 and the lopsided rejection.Instead, she was the victim of a conspiracy, she told her disappointed supporters in the strangely high-flown language that is the uneasy bearer of her populist message.Sunday\u2019s loss \u201crevealed the fundamental lie on which has rested for decades the French political system,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. What was \u201crevealed with no possible ambiguity were the hitherto occult connections of those who claim to oppose each other but who, in reality, share power, without ever resolving your problems, and worse, lead the country, from one mandate to another, into submersion\u201d by migrants \u201cand into chaos.\u201dIn other words, the two mainstream parties, the Socialists and the Republicans, ganged up on her, and she lost.The party \u201cdoesn\u2019t realize that in order to win power, it has to make allies and expand its audience,\u201d said Sylvain Cr\u00e9pon, a political scientist and an expert on the National Front. \u201cYou can see the limits of its strategy. Any alliance with the right is impossible,\u201d he added.To be sure, Sunday\u2019s election was not a total loss for the party. It tripled the number of councilors who will sit on the country\u2019s regional assemblies, to 358, providing a potent carrier for the party\u2019s message. And it scored a record number of votes, 6.8 million \u2014 400,000 more than the previous record in the 2012 presidential election.Ms. Le Pen made it clear that she is looking forward to the 2017 presidential election. \u201cIn relation to 2017, she is clearly positioning herself,\u201d said Val\u00e9rie Igounet, a historian who specializes in the National Front. The party\u2019s \u201cpolitical representatives are now spreading themselves out all over France,\u201d she said.But Ms. Le Pen will face the same hurdle then. \u201cTheir ideas continue to repulse over 70 percent of the French,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9pon said.Both right and left freely steal from the National Front\u2019s ideas, with the left often sounding law-and-order themes and the right vowing to crack down on immigration. \u201cThe other two parties wage their campaigns around the Front\u2019s ideas,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9pon said. But they are always careful to avoid its extreme xenophobia and its anti-Muslim rhetoric.\u201cWhat distinguishes the National Front is its outrageousness, its radicalism,\u201d Mr. Cr\u00e9pon said. The party\u2019s dilemma, never resolved, is that \u201cif it is too radical, it marginalizes itself, but if it normalizes itself, it becomes too commonplace.\u201d As Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie, the party\u2019s founder, once remarked, none of its base voters would be interested in a National Front that sounds too tame.The party\u2019s supporters made that much abundantly clear at a boisterous flag-waving rally here last week. \u201cWith all this immigration, and then the immigration leading to terrorism; she said it, and nobody was listening,\u201d said Nellie Viaro, a National Front municipal councilor from the Paris suburbs.\u201cShe\u2019s a woman of conviction who is persecuted by the Socialists,\u201d said Yves Breugnot, a party activist. He added, referring to France\u2019s flag, \u201cWith the Socialists, there is no blue-white-red, there is only red.\u201dThere were no big winners in Sunday\u2019s vote, though the ruling Socialists did better than expected, holding on to five regions to the right\u2019s seven and getting just under 30 percent of the vote. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party, with just over 40 percent, was hoping to sweep the boards but fell far short, a result interpreted by most pundits as a sign of strength for the Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in the pre-electoral period before 2017.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Very Low Interest Rates May Stick Around", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA History of MoneyThe interest rate that caused this anxiety? A mere 5.4 percent on the 10-year United States Treasury note \u2014 lower than the rates during the entirety of the 1980s and most of the 1990s.What does this have to do with the Fed\u2019s likely move this week? For years, financial commentators have been predicting an imminent rise in rates. After all, goes the theory, the Fed has been engaged in extraordinary interventions to artificially depress the cost of borrowing money. Surely those rates will snap back to their pre-2008 levels, if not rise higher. If that happens, get ready for double-digit mortgage rates and a substantially higher cost to maintain the government debt.Very low rates have often persisted for decades upon decades, pretty much whenever inflation is quiescent, as it is now. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note was below 4 percent every year from 1876 to 1919, then again from 1924 to 1958. The record is even clearer in Britain, where long-term rates were under 4 percent for nearly a century straight, from 1820 until the onset of World War I.The real aberration looks like the 7.3 percent average experienced in the United States from 1970 to 2007.\u201cWe\u2019re returning to normal, and it\u2019s just taken time for people to realize that,\u201d said Bryan Taylor, chief economist of Global Financial Data, which scours old records to calculate historical financial data, including the figures cited here. \u201cI think interest rates are going to stay low for several decades.\u201dOf course, rates could go up. But what that analysis may have missed is that interest rates historically are most closely tied to inflation. How much investors demand as compensation for lending their money is shaped in no small part by how much they think that money will be able to buy when they get it back. And the pressures that normally generate inflation seem to have disappeared in recent years.The Fed and its counterparts overseas at the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have spent the last few years applying every policy they can think of to get inflation to rise up to their 2 percent target, with limited success. In a world awash in supply of workers, oil and more, financial markets show little sign that investors think that will change anytime soon. Current Treasury bond prices predict annual inflation in the United States of only 1.7 percent a year over the next three decades.That would imply that we are in an economic era more like the late 19th century, with persistent low inflation or mild deflation, or perhaps like the 1950s, when the economy was growing but inflation was firmly in check.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Both financial markets and Federal Reserve officials seem to believe some version of this forecast. To understand why, it helps to start with a bit of the math behind the multitrillion-dollar bond market.A crucial driver of long-term interest rates (which the Fed doesn\u2019t directly control) is what investors think the Fed will do with short-term interest rates (which it does control). If people thought the Fed was going to raise short-term interest rates up to 5 percent soon, no one would lock their money up in a 10-year bond paying only 2.2 percent.And while the central bank is likely to move that rate up a quarter percentage point at the two-day meeting that ends Wednesday, in their most recent forecasts Fed officials have made clear that they don\u2019t expect that rate to rise back to levels that were common before the global financial crisis.At the onset of the crisis in 2007, the Fed\u2019s official target rate was 5.25 percent. Now the officials\u2019 median forecast for that rate\u2019s longer-term level is a mere 3.5 percent.Markets, and Fed forecasts, can be wrong, of course. Neither in 2007 predicted the sharp downshift in inflation and rates that was to come in the crisis. And our understanding of what shapes inflation and growth dynamics is quite limited.Still, starting with Japan in the 1990s and now across the advanced world, the predominant problems of the last several years have revolved around weak demand, plenty of supply, low inflation and resulting very low interest rates. The simple fact that the Fed is poised to raise rates a bit above zero doesn\u2019t change that.But the lessons of history do offer this guidance: Whether rates will be high or low a few years from now has very little to do with what the Fed does this week. It has quite a lot to do with what happens to forces deep inside the economy that are poorly understood and extremely hard to forecast. And just because many people are old enough to remember the high inflation and high rates of the 1970s and 1980s doesn\u2019t mean that is the normal to which the economy will inevitably revert.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of an economist.

{"Headline": "China Plans to Upgrade Coal Plants", "Date": "2015-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe announcement formalizes a step China is taking to try to reach broader coal-use and emissions goals to decrease some of the world\u2019s worst levels of air pollutants and to help in limiting climate change. China is by far the world\u2019s largest coal consumer and emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.Earlier this week, President Xi Jinping of China attended the start of the Paris climate talks to reiterate China\u2019s commitment to helping in the global struggle to limit the effects of climate change. During those same days, levels of air pollution across northern China reached their peaks for the year so far. In parts of Beijing, levels of deadly, fine particulate matter called PM 2.5 were 40 times as high as the recommended daily exposure limit set by the World Health Organization.The cabinet, the State Council, said Wednesday that the upgrades to coal-fired power plants would mean a reduction in raw coal use of around 100 million metric tons. That is consistent with an earlier policy plan announced by the government that said new coal-fired power generating units would consume about 300 grams of coal per kilowatt-hour on average. The power industry accounts for about half of China\u2019s annual coal use.Newer power plants in China emit less pollution and carbon dioxide than older ones. Plants in the power industry are less polluting on average than those that produce heavy commodities like steel and cement, as well as heating boilers for wintertime warmth in north China.The slowing economy means there will be a lower growth rate in the demand for power, and overall coal consumption will probably not increase, despite the addition of new coal-fired plants, according to environmental researchers.In November 2014, Mr. Xi announced that China would try to reach a carbon emissions peak by around 2030, and China has said it is setting a cap on coal use in 2020 of 4.8 billion tons. China\u2019s coal consumption was flat in 2014 compared with 2013 when measured by energy generation, and some scientists say China may already be reaching its peak in coal use.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhattan as Tinsel Town: Holiday Decorations Traditional and Weird", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosFor large segments of the resident Grinch population, holiday time can be a period of ambivalence, malaise, Bing Crosby overload and eggnog-induced regret. It is tough enough inducing jollity when looming at month\u2019s end is what amounts to a calendar blackout \u2014 consecutive days of holy observance when little or nothing gets done \u2014 followed by the New Year and lots of credit-card debt.Yet what is the harm in succumbing to some ephemeral splendor in the form of a city bedecked? Particularly now that a resurgent economy has inspired commercial landlords, civic groups and retailers to outdo themselves in seasonal display, there is reason \u2014 whatever one\u2019s system of belief \u2014 to celebrate the current blitz of Christmas decoration as an excuse for communal convergence, a chance to stand slack-jawed in awe in front of a giant tree.\u201cAs time goes by, the only holiday that sticks to the holiday heritage seems to be Christmas,\u201d Chris Suarez, a 39-year-old livery car driver, said recently, noting that in his recent rounds, he had seen more trees, lights, snowflakes and giant candy canes than he could ever recall. \u201cEven Citibank had, like, this mesh in the windows with snowflakes coming down.\u201dThis is, in fact, a banner year for twinkling trees, wooden nutcrackers and artificial snowflakes in bank windows, or else hovering over Fifth Avenue; the most imposing of these is the Unicef snowflake suspended above 57th Street like a Baccarat meteorite.Is it adequately appreciated that the snowflake, at one of the world\u2019s greatest retail intersections (Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Van Cleef & Arpels anchor its four corners), was designed by Ingo Maurer? It is not. Yet the glittering 3,300-pound flake composed of 16,000 crystals is almost self-evidently the output of this brilliant German-born industrial designer, one whose work is in museum collections throughout the world.With a characteristic gift for incorporating into his designs negative space around a source of illumination, Maurer\u2019s flake (which replaced a far cruder one introduced in 1984) manages to draw in the stately architectural ensemble surrounding it and seems to pinpoint the fabled intersection as the center of the universe as twilight descends.Maybe the creation of enchantment is an ideal inimical to modernity, as the Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n once claimed. Or maybe we can all still be stirred by atavistic urges to let nature bewitch us. Seemingly everywhere in the city this season there are pleasures to be gained from gawping at dying evergreens. Even a cynic would have to concede the elegance of, for instance, that forest of Christmas balsams installed each year in the Seagram Building\u2019s plaza pools.Just as wondrous is the facade and a walkway outside Lord & Taylor, embowered and turning a dull stretch of Midtown into a magical wood. Equally fantastical are the evergreen dinosaurs flanking the entrance to the Museum of Natural History, which may not make sense in the context of a Christian holiday, yet remain a welcome presence in a season that also, let\u2019s not forget, includes Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and Chinese takeout for nonbelievers.In their own way, the goofy, grinning prehistoric reptiles rendered in greenery befit their site as well as the Magi, shepherds, woodsmen, washerwomen and putti populating the Neapolitan Baroque Nativity scene surrounding the tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Do these figures \u2014 some dating to the 18th century, some brand new \u2014 seem as hectic and neurotically preoccupied with their own concerns as the humans gazing at them? Perhaps so, and for good reason. \u201cWe always modeled them on local people,\u2019\u2019 explained Gennaro di Virgilio, whose family\u2019s atelier in Naples has produced hand-carved and painted figures for Nativity scenes since 1830. \u201cNeapolitans are a little bit \u2026 dramatic,\u2019\u2019 he added in local dialect, \u201clike people in New York.\u2019\u2019Few attending the annual lighting of the Christmas trees that have stood in the Park Avenue median for the last 71 years are likely to have been aware that the custom began as a commemoration of American military members who died in World War II. Yet by their presence last Sunday, members of those crowds jamming the avenue outside the Brick Presbyterian Church made a tacit statement of belief in still-potent democratic ideals in a world plagued by terrorist threats.And surely, if the astonishing 78-foot, 10-ton colossus at Rockefeller Center is nothing else, it is a testament to sharing, especially when you consider that Albert Asendorf first encountered the tree 59 years ago, when he was 4, on the lawn of the Gardiner, N.Y., house he was raised in. By donating to the city what is doubtless the most photographed tree on earth, Mr. Asendorf and his domestic partner, Nancy Puchalski, were making what they called a gift to the world.By creating a tree of an altogether more ominous sort, the society event planner Bronson van Wyck made a clear contribution of his own \u2014 to the Annals of Weird. There it stands, just off the lobby of the St. Regis hotel, a towering tree that looks as if it were created by committee via s\u00e9ance: Edward Gorey, meet Johann Grimm. If you can hear me, rap twice. Neatly framed and tucked in amid the branches of this tree is a sign that makes the curious, if not entirely reassuring, claim that no stags were harmed in creating a tree bristling from base to crown with gilded antlers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expected Repeal of Oil Export Ban Unlikely to Have Immediate Impact", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 Ever since the 1970s, when international oil boycotts threatened the American economy and produced around-the-block waiting lines at gasoline stations, a ban on oil exports has been at the heart of national energy policy.Now, if a congressional deal holds up and President Obama agrees as is expected, that policy is about to be reversed.With the world overflowing with oil, it is unlikely the repeal of the ban will have a big immediate impact on crude prices or suddenly lift the American oil industry out of its tailspin of bankruptcies and job losses.Oil prices have sunk by nearly two-thirds since summer 2014, and the price of the American benchmark crude fell an additional $1.76, to $36.75, on Wednesday. Global storage is full to the brim, Iranian exports are about to hit the market and global trade is slowing, so few experts see a big expansion of markets anytime over the next year at least. But for oil executives, the deal was the culmination of a long-sought goal, even if it will take time to help them much.\u201cIt will mean more jobs, more drilling,\u201d said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, which is based in Texas. Mr. Sheffield, a leading advocate for lifting the ban, added: \u201cThat helps the entire economy, energy security, it helps with our allies, it will help our trade balance. To me, it\u2019s very, very big.\u201dOil executives and other experts also said that the repeal would open new markets for American oil in Mexico, South Korea, Japan and China over the next several years, easing those countries\u2019 dependence on unstable supplies from the Middle East, North Africa and Russia.And most immediately, lifting the ban should give some American oil companies a few modest new markets and a bit of extra flexibility that might be the difference between shutting off some production in places like Texas and North Dakota and eking out a bit of cash to keep the taps on.\u201cConnecting U.S. oil production to global markets will have immediate national security impacts,\u201d said David Goldwyn, who was the top energy diplomat in the State Department during the first Obama administration, \u201cand as the market recovers it will enable struggling American companies to meet rising demand.The promise of those extensions \u2014 along with those aimed at promoting the development of biofuels, especially those derived from nonfood sources \u2014 prompted a collective sigh of relief among clean energy executives and investors.Stock prices, which had tumbled in recent months in the face of volatility in the sector, rallied. SolarCity, for example, was up about 30 percent to around $52 in the afternoon, practically double where it was a month ago, while SunEdison, whose stock has languished below $10 since September, had climbed roughly 30 percent to above $6.The production tax credit for wind, which had expired at the end of 2014 and helped bring the cost of wind power near or below that of conventional fuels in many parts of the country, is to be extended retroactively until the end of next year and then decline in value each year until it is phased out in 2020. The investment tax credit for solar, which was to decrease to 10 percent, from 30 percent, at the end of next year, is to stay at 30 percent until 2019 and then gradually step down until 2022.Energy policy experts said that the agreement allowed Republicans and Democrats to claim victory, but was also a sign that the transition to a lower-carbon economy promised in the Paris climate talks was already an industry reality.\u201cExtending the wind and solar tax credits for the rest of the decade allows the White House to say they have provided businesses certainty to expand renewable investment,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former Senate Finance Committee staff member and Clinton administration climate official. \u201cRepublicans can now say they phased down the renewable energy tax credits to zero in five years, ending subsidies many of them opposed.\u201d The global price of a barrel of oil remains near its lowest point since the depths of the 2009 recession.But energy experts said it was the repeal of the oil export ban that carried the most symbolic weight. They noted that conditions in the global oil markets could change suddenly at any time, given the instability of North Africa, the Middle East and in other major producing countries like Venezuela and Nigeria. American oil on world markets could serve as a buffer for future shocks.Lifting the ban, they said, sends a telling message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that the United States can push for stronger sanctions against Russian oil without jeopardizing the economies of countries that buy its oil, especially in Europe. It also means that if Iran does not comply with its nuclear agreement and sanctions are snapped back, Iranian customers like India and Japan can look to the United States as an important new oil source.\u201cThe U.S. crude oil export ban is the symbolic manifestation of the historical trauma of America\u2019s experience of the 1973 oil embargo,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis. \u201cTaking this law off the books reflects the new reality of America\u2019s energy power.\u201dThe repeal would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, when domestic production fell year after year until the shale revolution took hold in 2007 and 2008. Using hydraulic fracturing to blast through hard rocks with water, sand and chemicals, the industry began to produce in fields that had been largely worthless. Oil production nearly doubled by early this year to more than nine million barrels a day, replacing most imports from the Middle East and North Africa.The export ban has covered crude produced in the lower 48 states and exports other than those to Canada, while exports of processed fuels like gasoline and diesel have been allowed. The Obama administration has tinkered with the ban, allowing in 2014 the export of a limited amount of extra light oil, mostly coming out of the shale fields of Texas and North Dakota. This year it gave permission to export some more to Mexico in a swap for heavier Mexican crude desired by refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.With the price collapse over the last year, companies are decommissioning rigs and production is beginning to drop. Few executives think 2016 will be much better, and companies are cutting their exploration budgets.The United States already exports 4.5 million barrels a day of refined petroleum products like gasoline and diesel, and industry executives say an additional half million barrels to a million barrels a day of crude exports could come over the next several years. That is not a large number considering that the global market is roughly 94 million barrels a day.\u201cU.S. crude exports are unlikely to impact the big picture in global oil markets given that the U.S. is still a major importer of crude to the tune of seven million barrels a day or close to 7 percent of current global production,\u201d said Badr H. Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an oil company based in the United Arab Emirates. \u201cAny U.S. exports will have to be matched by increased imports, leaving the global crude supply-demand balance unchanged.\u201dClifford Krauss reported from Houston and Diane Cardwell from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Echoes of the Past as David Cameron Enters Talks on Britain\u2019s Future in European Union", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British prime minister holds high-stakes talks before a crucial referendum on whether to abandon European integration. Though distracted by other problems, the German chancellor tries to help him out. Back home, British critics snipe, hoping the negotiations will collapse.That is broadly the position faced by Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain this week as he enters delicate discussions over his country\u2019s membership terms in the European Union, ahead of a plebiscite on whether to quit the bloc.But it was also the situation more than four decades ago, when Britons last had the opportunity to vote on their European destiny. And pro-Europeans are hoping that history will repeat itself.At stake is not just Britain\u2019s membership in the 28-nation bloc, but also perhaps the future of European integration, because the union can ill afford the shock that a British exit would bring.Mr. Cameron, who is seeking concessions from the other European nations that would help assure that British voters choose to stay in the union, has borrowed heavily on tactics deployed in 1974 and 1975 when Prime Minister Harold Wilson used a similar approach to keep Britain in the bloc, then called the European Economic Community.As now, Britain\u2019s governing party was split over Europe at the time (it was Labour four decades ago, the Conservatives now), and the referendum pledge helped paper over divisions.In 1974, Germany was crucial in the negotiation, but it was preoccupied by other issues: Then, it was the economic fallout from the oil price surge; now, it is the influx of a million migrants this year and the aftershocks of the debt crisis in the 19-nation eurozone.But by the spring of 1975, talks had concluded successfully, and Britons voted later that year to stay in a bloc that they had joined just two years earlier.In one sense, current British diplomats have things easy because, while the Conservative Party may be divided on Europe, those who openly want to leave the bloc are not prominent in government ministries. That was not the case in 1974-75, when some senior Labour ministers hoped the renegotiation would fail so that Britain would leave.In a confidential internal report on the 1974-75 negotiation, only recently published, a senior British official, Nicholas Spreckley, wrote, \u201cThere was throughout the sensation of living in dangerous times and success seemed very far away.\u201dThe demands in the 1970s included a mechanism to lower British budgetary contributions, changes in agricultural policy and concessions for exporters of farm products from former British colonies like New Zealand (to which the British felt special ties).Bernard Donoughue, a close aide to Mr. Wilson at the time and now a member of the House of Lords, recalled that \u201cit was not anticipated that Europe would make major concessions, because it is in the nature of the beast that they cannot without major treaty change.\u201d Changing a treaty is even harder now, he added, because all 28 nations need to ratify a new one.\u201cWe targeted a couple of key areas where we knew we would get something,\u201d Lord Donoughue said.Mr. Cameron\u2019s objectives include an end to Britain\u2019s obligation to forge an \u201cever closer union,\u201d measures to increase economic competitiveness, greater powers for national parliaments to block European legislation, and guarantees that Britain \u2014 which uses the pound instead of the euro \u2014 will not be materially disadvantaged.Mr. Cameron also wants to restrict welfare benefits for European Union citizens who come to Britain to work, until they have lived in the country for four years. That is highly contentious because it threatens to breach the rule that no European Union country should discriminate against the citizens of another.David Hannay, a member of the House of Lords and a former British diplomat, said that, as in 1974, the dispute today involves a split within the governing party. And then as now, the other European countries generally wanted Britain to stay but were unwilling to make wholesale changes to accommodate British demands \u2014 and had bigger problems of their own.\u201cBut one of the main differences was that Britain had only joined in January 1973; if we had left in 1975, nothing much would have changed,\u201d Lord Hannay said, adding that Britain is now far more integrated into the bloc.Sir Stephen Wall, a former British diplomat and historian of Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, said that Mr. Wilson achieved little on his central demands. The concession on British budget contributions never helped, and the whole issue resurfaced a decade later under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Few substantial changes to European agriculture were achieved, and Britain asked for guarantees against several things that were never likely to happen anyway.Mr. Cameron may be in a stronger position, Sir Stephen added, because \u201cI think our partners would have been less reluctant to see us go then than they would now, partly because our economy was weaker then.\u201dYet a warning to Mr. Cameron reverberates through the decades from Mr. Spreckley\u2019s confidential note.In 1974, he wrote, other European nations \u201cattached importance to British membership, but they were not prepared to compromise on the principles of the Community in order to maintain it.\u201dIn a phrase that rings as true now as it ever did, he added that it was \u201calmost impossible to guess how much they would be prepared to give way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Poland Lurches to Right, Many in Europe Look On in Alarm", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnder their undisputed leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, they pardoned the notorious head of the security services, who was appealing a three-year sentence for abuse of his office from their previous years in power; tried to halt the production of a play they deemed \u201cpornographic\u201d; threatened to impose controls on the news media; and declared, repeatedly and emphatically, that they would overrule the previous government\u2019s promise to accept refugees pouring into Europe.But the largest flash point, so far, has been a series of questionable parliamentary maneuvers by the government and the opposition that has allowed a dispute over who should sit on the country\u2019s powerful Constitutional Tribunal to metastasize into a full-blown constitutional crisis \u2014 with thousands of protesters from all sides taking to the streets.\u201cI am very agitated and depressed,\u201d Andrzej Zoll, a former president of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, said in an interview with Gazeta Wyborcza, one of the country\u2019s leading newspapers. \u201cTwenty-five years of democratic Poland is coming to an end.\u201dOn Saturday, antigovernment protesters marched peacefully through central Warsaw chanting for \u201cdemocracy.\u201d On Sunday, a pro-government \u201cMarch of Freedom and Solidarity\u201d drew a somewhat smaller crowd of peaceful participants and featured chants of \u201cGod, Honor, Fatherland\u201d and the singing of patriotic anthems like \u201cLet Poland Be Poland.\u201dAt Saturday\u2019s protest, Ryszard Petru, leader of a new opposition party called Modern, bemoaned the moves of the new government and its leader. \u201cKaczynski has managed to divide Poles yet again,\u201d Mr. Petru said. \u201cAnd he has done it in just one month.\u201dTop leaders of the Law and Justice Party \u2014 who did not respond to repeated requests for comment \u2014 describe such sentiments as overblown and insist they are only fulfilling the legitimate desires of the constituents who put them in office.Nor, they insist, will there be significant changes in relations between Poland, the European Union, NATO and the United States, despite whatever changes the new conservative government unleashes domestically.\u201cLaw and Justice supported Poland\u2019s accession to the European Union,\u201d said Konrad Szymanski, the new government minister for European affairs. \u201cWe support integration as a framework for European cooperation but, as almost every member state, we have our opinions about the future of the union.\u201dYet the leadership has often seemed to confirm its critics\u2019 worst fears. After some opposition members called for a European Union investigation of the new government\u2019s actions, Mr. Kaczynski described them as traitors. \u201cIn Poland, there is a horrible tradition of national treason, a habit of informing on Poland to foreign bodies,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it is. As if it\u2019s in their genes, in the genes of Poles of the worst sort.\u201dThe speed with which Law and Justice moved to capitalize on its definitive victory in October\u2019s parliamentary elections has deeply unsettled Polish politics \u2014 as has the re-emergence of older faces from the party\u2019s previous days in power, from 2005 to 2007.Rather than showcasing Mr. Kaczynski and other figures from the party\u2019s last time in government, Law and Justice ran younger, more moderate candidates, first Andrzej Duda for president in the spring and then Beata Szydlo for prime minister in the fall. But in the closing days of the campaign, and certainly since the government took power, Mr. Kaczynski reasserted himself, and brought back many of his oldest allies.Nationalist fervor is on the rise. At a rally of right-wing youth groups in Wroclaw last month, the figure of an Orthodox Jew was burned in effigy.For years, under the previous center-right governing party, Civic Platform, top officials spoke before a backdrop of Polish and European Union flags. Now, Ms. Szydlo has decreed that only Polish flags will be used.\u201cI am happy that in these difficult times, Poland belongs to the E.U. and NATO,\u201d Ms. Szydlo said. \u201cBut we decided that Polish government sittings and press conferences after these meetings will, from now on, take place against the background of, in my opinion, the most beautiful white-and-red flags.\u201dWhile Law and Justice was in the opposition for eight years, it agitated repeatedly for fresh investigations into the 2010 crash of a plane in Smolensk, Russia, that killed Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s twin brother, Lech Kaczynski, then the country\u2019s president, as well as dozens of other top Polish officials.Some party officials, including a few with top positions in the new government, suggested that the crash might have been orchestrated and covered up by the Russians, perhaps with the connivance of Civic Platform and its then-leader, Donald Tusk, who is now president of the European Council in Brussels.These conspiracy theories were rarely raised during the recent election, but now that Law and Justice has assumed power they are back in the public discussion in a major way.The new foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, called on Russia to cooperate in a fuller investigation of the crash. \u201cEither they solve this case amicably, or it will become necessary to hand it over to international tribunals,\u201d he said. A top government spokeswoman, Elzbieta Witek, said in a television interview that a state tribunal should investigate Mr. Tusk, too. That was just her \u201cpersonal opinion,\u201d she said.The performances went on, but not before drawing concern that the new government intended to control artistic productions it did not approve of. Those concerns were not lessened by a television interview with Mr. Glinski in which he derided the program he was on and hinted that the new government intended a firmer grip on the media.\u201cThis is a pornographic program, in fact, just as your station has been spreading propaganda and manipulation for a few years,\u201d he told an interviewer on the public television channel. \u201cAnd that is going to end as this is not how the public television should function.\u201dBut the most significant dust-up came over the composition of the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal. In the run-up to the election, Civic Platform appointed five new judges to the 15-member panel, even though two of the vacancies would not occur until a new government took power.In response, Law and Justice refused to seat any of those five judges and, instead, appointed five judges of its own.The Constitutional Tribunal ruled this month that Civic Platform had the authority to appoint only three judges, and it declared unconstitutional large parts of new legislation covering the tribunal introduced by Law and Justice.But the new government continues to insist that its five judges \u2014 and none of Civic Platform\u2019s \u2014 be admitted to the tribunal. Confusion about how this will play out, and who actually has ultimate authority over the Constitution, has unsettled Polish politics and raised passions on all sides.\u201cYou are developing Putinist standards,\u201d said Robert Kropiwnicki, a Civic Platform member of Parliament. \u201cThe master himself would be proud.\u201dBoth of Poland\u2019s leading parties believe themselves inheritors of the Solidarity movement that propelled the country\u2019s independence movement in the 1980s.Mr. Kaczynski made explicit the link his party sees between the government and the church in a speech celebrating the 24th anniversary of a religious radio station. \u201cThe church and its teachings are the foundations of Polishness,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everyone, even if they are not believers, has to accept it. Any hand raised against the church is also a hand raised against Poland.\u201d\u201cThe transition phase between communist and post-communist Poland was very painful for a large part of the population,\u201d Mr. Smolar said. \u201cFor a lot of people, especially the older population, it was perceived as a catastrophe.\u201dNow there are concerns that the party, simmering in opposition for so long, will seek to redress a litany of grievances, even if it means bending the Constitution.\u201cThis is not the problem in Poland only,\u201d said Aleksander Kwasniewski, Poland\u2019s left-wing president from 1995 to 2005. \u201cThis is happening in countries across Europe. This is the problem of democracy in general. Traditional democracy is in crisis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Regulator to Bolster Its Safety Rating System for Cars", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government will make significant changes to strengthen a rating system for cars that has for years awarded high marks to almost all vehicles, even those that have been the subjects of multiple safety recalls.The agency also said it would revise the rating system to include additional crash tests and new advanced crash-test dummies with more sensors.\u201cWe\u2019re going to raise the bar for protecting vehicle occupants,\u201d Anthony Foxx, the transportation secretary, said during a news conference at the Department of Transportation. He was flanked by two crashed vehicles and four of the new, more humanlike dummies.\u201cWe ultimately want to eliminate crashes altogether,\u201d he said.The rating system, with origins that date from 1978, allows the agency to award as many as five stars to vehicles based on crash protection and rollover safety. Ratings can be a powerful government seal of approval for automakers, which have used them in advertising.The investigation found that, for models from 2011 through 2015, 92 percent of the overall safety ratings were four or five stars. And notably, the percentage of four- and five-star overall ratings increased each year, from 83 percent for 2011 models to 96 percent for 2015 models, even though the standards had ostensibly been toughened in 2011.In the case of Chevrolet, six of the eight cars it had trumpeted as having five stars in early 2014 \u2014 more than any other brand, it said \u2014 would later be recalled for various safety defects, some more than once.The day after The Times article was published, lawmakers criticized the agency and its acting administrator at the time, David J. Friedman, over the rating program at a hearing held by a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \u201cYou see five stars. You think that is the Good Housekeeping seal of approval,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said at the hearing. \u201cThe consumer is misled.\u201dDuring the hearing, Mr. Friedman defended the five-star system and objected to the article, but acknowledged that officials at the agency had talked internally about how to make it clearer to consumers that vehicles rated under the program could be recalled.Now, safety regulators are taking a different view.Mark R. Rosekind, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that achieving a five-star rating would be tougher than ever.The agency said it had been considering changes to the program for nearly a year. Mr. Rosekind took over as the agency\u2019s administrator last December.The agency will also add half-star ratings to give consumers more discriminating information about vehicle performance.The agency said that it would add a new crash test to measure how well vehicles protect passengers in an angled crash from the front. In its 195-page plan detailing the changes, the agency said this crash type continues to \u201cresult in deaths and serious injuries despite the use of seatbelts, airbags, and the crash-worthy structures of late-model vehicles.\u201dA pedestrian rating will be based on tests that determine how well cars minimize injuries and fatalities to pedestrians. In 2013, the most recent year for which complete information is available, 4,735 pedestrians were killed in traffic-related crashes, according to the agency.Congress recently passed a transportation bill requiring crash avoidance information to be included on new vehicle window stickers \u2014 just as the government fuel economy ratings are. The measures won broad support from lawmakers, safety specialists and automakers.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, applauded the regulators\u2019 move to include crash avoidance technology in its rating system.\u201cThis update is a win both for consumers and innovators \u2014 highlighting a vehicle\u2019s advanced safety systems will allow consumers to make informed purchasing decisions, and in turn spur greater use of these potentially lifesaving technologies,\u201d he said in a statement.John O\u2019Dell, a senior editor and vehicle safety specialist at Edmunds.com, a car shopping and research website, said the new measures were overdue.\u201cThis is a big step and it is a needed step,\u201d he said, adding that the changes indicated auto safety regulation was being taken more seriously than in the past.Mr. O\u2019Dell said that automakers had over the years become savvy about the safety regulator\u2019s requirements and had learned to design their cars to do well in the ratings. He added that this would still happen, but it would take a while for car manufacturers to adapt. And, in the meantime, vehicles may become safer in the areas where the agency bolsters the tests.The Auto Alliance, a trade group representing automakers, said it welcomed the agency\u2019s embrace of new safety technologies. \u201cWe will provide constructive comments on the agency\u2019s proposal\u201d as more evaluations and data become available, it said in a statement.Ron Nixon reported from Washington, and Danielle Ivory from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Path for Climate Change, Beyond Paris", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut many political leaders gathering there \u2014 including governors, mayors, and provincial cabinet secretaries \u2014 are pushing for more aggressive cuts. By the dozen, they are signing a voluntary agreement committing their jurisdictions to faster and deeper reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases than their national governments have promised.\u201cWe are not moving fast enough,\u201d Gov. Jerry Brown of California, who is helping to lead the effort, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do more.\u201dAll of which raises a provocative question: What would a truly ambitious plan to tackle climate change look like?Despite the intensity of the debate around global warming, the question has long been considered theoretical, and few people have spent much time studying potential steps to \u201cdeep decarbonization\u201d \u2014 certainly not at the level of detail needed for a concrete plan.Lately, that has started to change. But the recent analyses make clear just how difficult a worldwide transition to a clean energy system is likely to be.\u201cThe arithmetic is really brutal,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Sachs, a prominent Columbia University economist. \u201cWe\u2019re in such a dreadful situation that every country has to make this transformation, or else this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201dThe analysts used conservative assumptions about current technologies and their costs. They also presumed that developed countries would not be willing to make big changes in their way of life \u2014 that people would continue to insist on transportation, refrigerators, electric lights and so forth \u2014 and that poor countries would keep striving to reach higher standards of living, requiring more energy.The experts also made a point of ruling out energy miracles, such as technologies like nuclear fusion that could help enormously if they became available but are still largely on the drawing board. \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t put on a hard hat and go visit a technology in the field, at least in pilot stage, then we didn\u2019t include it in our analysis,\u201d said Ben Haley, a senior consultant at Energy and Environmental Economics, a consulting firm involved in the work.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.With those assumptions, the experts focused on a specific question: Can emissions be cut enough from now to 2050 to meet an international target designed to head off the worst effects of climate change?\u201cIt can still be done \u2014 barely,\u201d said Guido Schmidt-Traub, the executive director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which helped organize the effort.That means experts who have long argued for a more intensive research program on clean energy have a point. The 16-country analysis suggests that many technologies, like electric cars and offshore wind turbines, have to become cheaper and better.In an interview, Mr. Gates said that poor countries would be reluctant to switch to clean energy technology unless it becomes better and cheaper, \u201cand the only answer to that is innovation.\u201dYet the new research on decarbonization also suggests that the environmentalists who have long called for a rapid expansion of existing clean-energy technologies also have a point: The very process of rolling them out helps to spur innovation, and as they spread beyond niche markets, economies of scale drive down the costs.Solar power offers a stunning example, with costs of the panels plunging 80 percent in the last decade, a direct result of subsidies and other policies meant to create a larger market. In many places, solar power is still more expensive than power produced from fossil fuels, but the difference has narrowed considerably.Yet such scenarios would involve an extraordinary push. Dr. Jacobson\u2019s plans would require, among many other actions, that 156,000 wind turbines be built off American coasts in the next 35 years, and twice as many on land. In 20 years of effort, European countries have managed to build about 3,000 offshore turbines.In an interview, Dr. Jacobson cited a scientific paper that calculated the oil and gas industry has been building 50,000 new wells a year in North America since 2000. Each of those, he said, is as complicated as erecting a wind turbine, and building tens of thousands of turbines a year would be well within the nation\u2019s industrial capability.\u201cWe think it\u2019s technically and economically feasible,\u201d Dr. Jacobson said. \u201cIt ultimately does come down to political will. If people don\u2019t want to do it, it\u2019s not going to happen by itself.\u201dDr. Jacobson has often cited the United States\u2019 mobilization during World War II as an example of what can be done by a determined society. But to some other experts, that very argument speaks to the political and economic impracticality of his plans.\u201cI just don\u2019t see a World War II-style mobilization happening for anything other than a world war,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, an energy analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that. So the question is, what are we going to do?\u201dThe scenarios laid out by the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project echo Dr. Jacobson\u2019s plans to a degree, in that they call for substantial amounts of renewable power. But these scenarios also suggest that the energy transition would be easier and cheaper with additional technology options, including some that are disliked by the environmental movement.For instance, in some countries with growing power demands, like China, the research found that nuclear power would be essential for staying within a strict emissions budget. Mr. Jenkins said that new nuclear plants would also be needed in some American states that had few other options.And many experts believe the United States, even if it does not build many new nuclear plants, would be foolish to shut down the ones it has, given that they supply 19 percent of the country\u2019s electric power with minimal emissions. Yet some of them have shut down lately, occasionally because of safety fears but mainly because of low power prices prompted by the abundance of natural gas.The research also suggests that to meet strict targets, some countries might need to keep burning coal or natural gas to generate power while capturing the carbon dioxide emerging from smokestacks, compressing it and injecting it deep underground.Most fossil-fuel companies do not appear to be putting much effort into the approach, either, even though it may be the only way for some of them to stay in business over the long haul.\u201cIt is a highly contested technology, but if they want to save their industry, they should be investing like crazy in proving the technology,\u201d Dr. Sachs said.Perhaps the most compelling finding of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project is that governments could easily flub the energy transition by failing to plan far enough ahead. Most countries are setting 10- and 15-year targets that can be met with incremental changes.Yet that almost guarantees that the toughest problems, like perfecting the carbon-capturing technology, will be tackled too late to meet the long-term goal of zero emissions, the researchers found.\u201cBy the time you get to the hard things, you\u2019ve lost too much time,\u201d Mr. Schmidt-Traub said. Instead, governments have to figure out where they want to be in 2050, he said, and then work backward to plot the necessary technological path, while remaining open to new inventions.While the best technology mix varies by state or country \u2014 wind is a good option in Iowa, solar power in Arizona or Australia \u2014 the researchers found some themes across all the countries they examined.To achieve the emissions goals, the entire economy, including transportation, needs to be electrified as much as possible. That might mean cars\u2019 running on batteries, but it could also mean cars\u2019 running on hydrogen, created by using nighttime electricity from nuclear reactors or wind turbines to split water molecules.The scenarios for the United States, according to the Deep Decarbonization project, do not envision broad adoption of electric cars until the 2030s. But that is only 14 years away, suggesting an urgent need to make the cars better and cheaper, and to roll out charging stations by the millions.Another potential dead end, the research suggests, would be an overreliance on natural gas. Gas is a lower-carbon fuel than coal, and switching power plants to run on gas can achieve big emission reductions in the short run. The Obama administration, with its Clean Power Plan, is trying to lock in such a switch in the United States.But the deep-decarbonization research suggests that gas has to go away within a few decades, which means that heavy investment in natural gas pipelines and power plants now could wind up undermining the long-term goals.In addition, governments buy millions of cars, generally for their employees to take short hops around town. Switching those fleets to electric cars would help expand the market and reduce costs through economies of scale.Larger governments, like states and provinces, could do more. California, for instance, has set a goal of pushing 1.5 million electric cars onto its roads over the next eight years, probably by offering subsidies.A bill that the California Legislature considered earlier this year would have ordered a 50 percent reduction in gasoline use in that state over the next 15 years, by means unspecified in the bill; the oil companies narrowly beat that back, but the fight is probably not over.The California governor, Mr. Brown, is expected to be one of the stars of the gathering in Paris, perceived by many people abroad to be the strongest leader in the United States on climate change. He helped to create the pledge that other mayors and governors are signing.He argues that if states and cities can figure out how to move first on climate, they can essentially drag their national governments behind them.\u201cCalifornia, doing more than any other state in America, is setting a pace, and will step it up,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut we have to be part of a larger movement to really get global warming under control.\u201dCoral Davenport contributed reporting from Paris.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Economic Woes Buoy Opposition Before Election", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by8 PhotosCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 On a sunny afternoon, Jorge Mill\u00e1n, an opposition candidate for congress, walked through the narrow streets of a lower-middle-class neighborhood, pressing the flesh in what was once a no man\u2019s land for people like him.But now, the mood had changed considerably. \u201cVote on Sunday. Vote for change,\u201d Mr. Mill\u00e1n said over and over. He was greeted with hugs, kisses and smiles.Venezuelans go to the polls on Sunday in legislative elections that could change the political balance in Venezuela, a country that has long been painfully split between the followers and opponents of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and his successor, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.The opposition candidates for the 167 seats up for grabs in the National Assembly have been hammering home a one-word message: change.And it seems to be hitting the mark.\u201cI want change for the country so we can have something better,\u201d said Ismer D\u00edaz, 26, who voted for Mr. Maduro and supported Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who was president for 14 years.Working behind the counter at a small grocery, he shook Mr. Mill\u00e1n\u2019s hand and took a leaflet. He admitted a few minutes later that he did not know Mr. Mill\u00e1n\u2019s name but said that he planned to vote for him anyway, a throw-the-bums-out attitude that is widespread here.The ballots will show each candidate\u2019s name with a party symbol, in this case the thumbs-up logo of the Democratic Unity coalition that agglomerates most opposition parties.Down the street, Jes\u00fas Oma\u00f1a, 37, a motorcycle taxi driver, also shook Mr. Mill\u00e1n\u2019s hand.\u201cI was a Chavista, but Ch\u00e1vez isn\u2019t here anymore,\u201d said Mr. Oma\u00f1a, referring to the followers of the former president.\u201cIt\u2019s this guy,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Maduro. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201dMr. Oma\u00f1a complained about having to stand in long lines to buy food and about the fast-rising prices, saying that for the first time since Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was elected in 1998 he would vote for an opposition candidate.\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need something good for Venezuela.\u201dVenezuelan politics was dominated after 1998 by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and the movement he started, which he called the Bolivarian revolution, after the country\u2019s independence hero, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, and his disciple, Mr. Maduro, was elected to succeed him, vowing to continue Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist-inspired policies.But Mr. Maduro lacks Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s magical connection with supporters, and even his good luck. Venezuela\u2019s economy depends enormously on oil production, and during much of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s presidency oil prices were very high. Now they have dropped significantly, putting a severe strain on the country\u2019s budget.Mr. Maduro has also stuck ardently to many of the economic policies Mr. Ch\u00e1vez left behind, such as strict controls on prices and foreign exchange, which economists say are now making things worse.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez greatly expanded the power of the executive branch and eliminated checks and balances, dominating a weak judiciary and packing the electoral council with loyalists, while the National Assembly acted as a rubber stamp. That has continued under Mr. Maduro.But if the opposition wins a majority in the National Assembly, it would change the political balance in profound ways and set up a power struggle with Mr. Maduro and the government institutions that he controls.The once powerful Chavista movement has shown itself to be greatly weakened by the country\u2019s economic debacle and Mr. Maduro\u2019s leadership. Rallies for the candidates of Mr. Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party have been much more tepid than similar gatherings in the past under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.And Mr. Maduro, despite saying repeatedly that he is confident of a victory on Sunday, has foreshadowed defeat.During his weekly television program on Tuesday, he called the possibility of an opposition victory a \u201cnightmare\u201d and said that if \u201cwe were to lose Sunday\u2019s elections, life goes on, the fight goes on, and the revolution would find new paths and a new character.\u201dIf the government loses its majority, \u201cwe would take to the streets to fight, to do battle, to defend our country,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.The government has warned that if the opposition takes over Congress, it will strip away the social programs created by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez.If that were to happen, Mr. Maduro said, \u201cwith the Constitution in my hands I would declare myself in total rebellion with the people mobilized in the streets. You can be certain I will never allow it.\u201dMr. Maduro, in the style of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, has made himself the principle campaigner for his party, and he led its final rally, in a street in central Caracas, on Thursday. At several points, he paused for a response from the crowd but got only scattered cheers.\u201cI\u2019ve always been with\u201d the governing party, \u201cbut with all the calamities that we\u2019re going through I\u2019m having my doubts,\u201d said Natalia Rojas, a schoolteacher, who said she attended the rally because she felt pressured to do so at work. She said the rally suffered in comparison with those of past years when Mr. Ch\u00e1vez generated great excitement.\u201cNot many people and lots of government workers standing around being apathetic,\u201d she said.Mr. Maduro claims that the country\u2019s economic problems are the product of an economic war waged against him by capitalist enemies, abetted by a biased news media, a message often repeated by his followers.\u201cI support my government totally, and we are going to win,\u201d said Minathay Ferrer, 40, a government worker. \u201cThings are bad, but it makes me angry when people say we are going to lose. It\u2019s media warfare.\u201dThe government has plowed public resources into its campaign, as it has for years. Mr. Maduro and other officials preside over giveaways of apartments, cars and other goods. Government-controlled television and radio stations and newspapers trumpet the government message and savage opponents.Even the ballot has pitfalls, critics contend. Right next to the blue logo of the Democratic Unity coalition is a similar blue logo for a tiny party that also features the word \u201cunity\u201d in its name, a juxtaposition that opposition leaders say is meant to confuse voters. In one district, the other unity party is even running a candidate with the same name as the Democratic Unity candidate, Ismael Garc\u00eda, and the two names will appear side by side on the ballot, with similar blue logos.Opposition candidates said one of the biggest surprises of the campaign has been the warm reception they have received in what were once hostile pro-government strongholds.Carlos Mendoza, 53, a motorcycle taxi driver and former convict who works in the district where Mr. Mill\u00e1n is running, said that he belongs to a group, known as a colectivo, that in the past was paid by the government to help out during campaigns, attend rallies and drive voters to the polls. Such groups were also often used to intimidate opposition supporters.\u201cThey called us again this time,\u201d Mr. Mendoza said. \u201cI told them, \u2018No way, you\u2019re not using me again.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re from the streets,\u201d he said, \u201cand we want change.\u201dPatricia Torres contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mass Layoffs in China\u2019s Coal Country Threaten Unrest", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHEGANG, China \u2014 In the dank shower room where the miners soak, the coal dust from their bodies staining the water chocolate, a lone worker sat smoking a cigarette, staring at the floor.He lingered, he said, because since his pay had been cut in half, he had been eating dinner at his parents\u2019 apartment, and he dreaded the humiliation of going there again.\u201cIf any of the leaders would do their job properly, the situation would not be like this,\u201d said the worker, Mr. Guo, 39. \u201cIf they want to sack me, they should just do it. Can it get any worse?\u201dIt probably will.China has managed mass layoffs at creaky, state-owned businesses like Longmay before, averting the threat of strikes and unrest by suppressing protests and offering payouts and job training.But that was when the economy was booming and could readily absorb displaced workers. The test the government now faces in this depressed coal town and in other hard-hit areas across the country is whether it can head off labor discontent in a slowing economy.Longmay has delayed the bulk of the layoffs, cutting only several hundred older workers who held nonessential jobs. Last month, the government of Heilongjiang Province, which owns Longmay, announced a $600 million bailout that would help the company repay its bonds. But analysts see the infusion as short-term relief that will not prevent a reckoning.The coal industry is hurting nationwide, as coal prices have fallen nearly 60 percent since 2011, said Deng Shun, an analyst at ICIS C1 Energy, a consultancy based in Shanghai. And Longmay, he said, produces far less coal with extra workers than newer, more efficient companies.\u201cThey are quite worried about social unrest, so they delay,\u201d he said. \u201cThese layoffs should have happened two years ago.\u201dStill, there have already been flashes of discontent.In April, even before the layoffs were announced, thousands marched on the streets of Hegang, a city of about one million, to protest delayed salaries. The organizers were arrested and jailed.In October, company management stifled a protest by locking workers in the mines. The police patrolled the streets outside the company headquarters on the day the rally was planned.A few weeks later, Internet regulators exposed a group of workers discussing a demonstration on an online bulletin board. They were hauled to a police station, fingerprinted and warned that jail sentences would follow if they dared do it again.\u201cWe are all on edge, the company is on edge,\u201d Mr. Chen, 27, an organizer of that abortive protest, said over breakfast at a nearly empty restaurant, washing it down with a couple of beers at the end of his night shift. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is going to happen. It all depends on how the company takes care of the laid-off workers.\u201dLike other miners here, he spoke to a foreign reporter on the condition that he be identified only by his surname for fear of reprisal.The reaction of the demoralized workers is being watched closely because the staying power of the Communist Party has been immutably linked to its ability to deliver continued economic progress. The unwritten social compact here is that the party delivers growth, jobs and higher living standards, and in exchange, the workers acquiesce to its monopoly on power, surrendering the right to organize unions or protest.That bargain could fall apart if workers no longer believe the government is living up to its end.The signs of severe economic trouble are evident. For-sale signs hang on the facades of restaurants that draw few customers. Robberies are on the rise; manhole covers and cellphones are popular targets. Women say they have stopped wearing jewelry for fear of being assaulted.Heilongjiang has been one of the most depressed provinces in China for years. Its economic output fell 2.2 percent in the first three quarters of this year compared with the same period last year, without adjusting for inflation, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Still, the state-owned mines have been reluctant to cut production because there is little other work here. The first round of layoffs at Longmay, though relatively small, came soon after the September announcement.Workers in their late 50s were called to an office on the second floor of a disused building. Two young clerks barked orders at men. They were told to sign two-page contracts that pledged a small monthly stipend and vague promises of retraining.Mr. Hui, 55, was one of the first. \u201cIt was 7 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d he recalled. \u201cOur captain came to our changing room after meeting with the leaders. He said, \u2018Here is bad news for you guys.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018Hui, you are one of those who are above the age limit.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Hui said he was crushed. He had worked as a firefighter at the mine for 35 years and expected a pension. He had not been told how much severance pay he would received, he said.Although his wife, son and daughter-in-law had jobs, he could not make ends meet. \u201cI have been paying the mortgage of my son and the day-to-day expenditures for our grandson,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m short of cash. I have to work. What else can I do? I want to give my grandson the best education so he can leave this place. There is no future in coal.\u201dThe management of the Longmay Group declined to be interviewed. In response to a request to its headquarters in Harbin, the company said, \u201cWe are busy planning the reform of the company, and we are not ready to give information to the public.\u201dAs the region\u2019s population has dwindled in the last decade, the younger people who have stayed say they feel trapped. They have few skills to offer to factories in southern China, which in any case no longer hire the way they used to. And they are boxed in, expected to work in the mines, they say, by family traditions.A 29-year-old mechanic who declined to be identified said he loved his job working with precision instruments in one of the mine\u2019s workshops. He had tried to get a job in the port town of Dalian, but his parents forbade him to move, he said.Blinking back tears, he said he depended on his fianc\u00e9e, who earned a handsome salary as a video editor, and his father, who made more money than he did driving a truck.\u201cMost who are still here are like me, they don\u2019t have a way out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the company would pay our salaries on time and in full, the workers would love to work.\u201dOne employee, Mr. Cui, 40, a driver, said he had quit rather than wait to be laid off. He hopes to secure a taxi license to augment his severance of $104 a month, which he says is not enough to get by on, much less pay back the $6,000 he borrowed for his wife\u2019s medical bills.When the full brunt of the layoffs comes, the violence could be terrible, he predicted. Since the last economic crisis, in the 1990s, a conspicuous new group had appeared: the owners of recently privatized small mines who drove around in Mercedes-Benzes.\u201cIn the 90s, everyone was poor,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the rich are too rich, and the poor are too poor. Because of the layoffs, everyone is worried. No one has a way to live outside the mines. With the New Year holidays coming, there will be chaos in Hegang.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Terror From Europe's Future Street", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe family of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the Paris attacks, lived on Future Street in Brussels. Theirs was a \u201cspacious if shabby corner home,\u201d my colleagues, Andrew Higgins and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, write. Abaaoud\u2019s parents, Moroccan immigrants to Belgium, had done well enough.The Rue de l\u2019Avenir, or Future Street, was supposed to lead to a decent European life, not veer off to Syria and the apocalyptic universe of the Islamic State. Future Street, a place of opportunity for the industrious, was what the Turkish and Moroccan and Algerian immigrants coming to Europe from the 1960s onward sought.Abaaoud, son of Brussels, was not poor, not stupid, not marginalized. He was on the ladder before he stepped off into a zigzagging life between Syria and Europe. He attended for a year an exclusive Catholic School, the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Pierre d\u2019Uccle. I lived in Uccle between 1980 and 1982. Europe does not get much more leafy or placid than that.But Future Street, so luminous a half-century ago during the great postwar European recovery \u2014 what the French call \u201cLes Trente Glorieuses\u201d (or the 30 glorious years) \u2014 has become a much more ambiguous place. It is now situated, thanks to technology, between homeland and adopted land in the jangling, borderless, cacophonous space of modern civilization.A bad economy is not what flips young Muslims off Future Street onto the road to Raqqa. It\u2019s the humiliation of purposelessness. It\u2019s a quest for respect. It\u2019s laying the burden of choice to rest through a subsuming mission against the \u201cdecadent\u201d West. It\u2019s the discovery of a plausible flight from ambivalent modernity to the Caliphate\u2019s zealous strictures.Abaaoud, killed by French security forces in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, joins all the other sons (mainly sons) who could not abide the future despite comfortable circumstances and opted to take refuge from it in the all-resolving ideology of jihadist violence. He joins Mohamed Atta and Faisal Shahzad and Michael Adebolajo, plotters and perpetrators from New York to London who did not come from poverty or social exclusion.Atta, who took the first plane into the North Tower, and Shahzad, who plotted mayhem at Times Square, and Adebolajo, who killed a British soldier with a knife and machete on a London street, placed their college educations at the service of destruction of the liberal Western order. Theirs were the educated choices of what the late Fouad Ajami called \u201cIslam\u2019s nowhere men,\u201d people for whom Western freedom became alienation.ISIS is not a social issue. You don\u2019t kill 130 people in Paris because you lost your job or never had one. It is ideological. It must therefore be fought by a counter-ideology, among other things. This neither the United States nor Europe nor their nominal Arab and Muslim allies have been able to articulate. Saudi Arabia and Turkey have played double games with their bastard child, ISIS.What inhabits that spacious if shabby corner house on Future Street? In one Islamic State video, Abaaoud urged Muslims to shake off a \u201chumiliating life\u201d in Europe and find \u201cpride and honor\u201d in their religion and in jihad.Humiliation is an ample notion. It may embrace anything from the Algerian war of more than a half century ago to the Iraq war; it may invoke Gaza; it may be social; it may well be sexual. But whatever its nature, it is escaped by adherence to the Islamic State\u2019s state in the making, that border-straddling land where doubt goes to die, where each day has its assigned task and all needs are met.The dangerous thing about this ISIS territory, the Caliphate\u2019s embryo, is not so much its oil revenue, or its training facilities, or its proximity to the West, or its control over several million people \u2014 it is its magnetic assertion of Suuni jihadist power, the retort to humiliation that drew Abaaoud from Future Street. The United States and Europe would not have accepted its existence in 2001. They would not have accepted that terrorists centered in a sanctuary close to a NATO border could shut down Brussels or the University of Chicago.But the West will no longer deploy infantry against global jihad. Nor will Arab states. That is a high-risk policy \u2014 too high, in my view. ISIS is working on the means to make the carnage in Paris look modest.Europe is now entwined with the Syrian debacle \u2014 its refugees moving westward, its violence, its intra-Islamic battle, and its jihadi-spawning void. Abaaoud\u2019s story is also a warning in a world where, as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter put it recently at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, \u201cdestructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of human beings.\u201dFuture Street has done a one-eighty. Europe\u2019s opportunities drew Abaaoud\u2019s father to Brussels. Abaaoud\u2019s younger brother, Younes, was 13 when he left Brussels for Syria. He will likely return. And this middle-class adolescent Islamist will not be bearing a bouquet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelan Official Is Said to Be Charged in Drug Case in U.S. Court", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn social media, N\u00e9stor Reverol, the head of Venezuela\u2019s National Guard, has bragged about seizing large shipments of cocaine in raids against drug cartels.Mr. Reverol, a favorite of the country\u2019s former president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, previously led the nation\u2019s antidrug agency and a minister of the interior.But American prosecutors say that he has also been on the payroll of narcotics traffickers, tipping them off to raids and even stalling investigations, a person familiar with the federal case against him said on Tuesday.Charges against Mr. Reverol, along with Edilberto Molina, another former official in Venezuela\u2019s antidrug unit, will soon be unsealed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, according to the person familiar with the case.The indictment will mark the latest in a series of charges by United States prosecutors against powerful Venezuelans who the prosecutors say have assumed a large role in the narcotics trade. Investigators say that the corruption extends to the top levels of the government and that the line between officialdom and the underworld has blurred.Earlier this year officials said they were investigating Diosdado Cabello, the head of the National Assembly, considered the second most powerful person in the country. That inquiry involved accusations that Mr. Cabello had been involved with drug shipments to the United States. Mr. Cabello has strongly denied any wrongdoing and any link to traffickers.And in November, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged two nephews of Cilia Flores, the wife of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, with conspiring to transport 800 kilograms of cocaine to the United States.They were arrested in Haiti.According to the person familiar with the case, who asked not to be identified given the sensitivity of the legal proceedings, Mr. Reverol received payments from criminal organizations, regularly alerting traffickers about when and where raids were to take place.Mr. Reverol personally \u201cstopped or hindered investigations\u201d of drug traffickers, using his powerful posts to allow them to operate in Venezuela with impunity, the person said.American investigators have long accused the government in Caracas of corruption and of being involved in drug trafficking. Mr. Maduro has strongly denied the accusations that government officials are involved in the drug trade and has said the allegations are part of an American plot to undermine his government.Mr. Reverol and Mr. Molina could not immediately be reached for comment. An official at Venezuela\u2019s Information Ministry said that he did not have information about the charges against Mr. Reverol and Mr. Molina. Mr. Reverol was the head of the National Antidrug Office, a rough equivalent of the American Drug Enforcement Administration, for many years. He was named interior minister by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in October 2012 and was replaced the following year after Mr. Ch\u00e1vez died and was succeeded by Mr. Maduro.Mr. Reverol was made commander of the National Guard in October of last year.A Twitter account in his name has boasted in recent months of raids by the National Guard against drug traffickers. A post from Dec. 10 showed a photo of national guardsmen using a crane to uncover a hidden shipment of cocaine in the flatbed of a tractor-trailer.\u201cDetected by our canine unit,\u201d the post says.The National Guard is responsible for protecting the country\u2019s borders, though its members, according to people who live along the border, are widely believed to be involved in all sorts of contraband, especially across the long border with Colombia. The contraband could include the illegal export of cheap Venezuelan gasoline, government-subsidized foods like milk powder and corn flour, and drugs.American officials say that a large portion of the cocaine that leaves Colombia passes through Venezuela. Many drug shipments leave by plane from hidden airstrips in Venezuela and arrive in the United States via Central America and the Caribbean.The federal case could be another embarrassment to Venezuela\u2019s leftists who have vowed to carry on the legacy of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013. Members of his United Socialist Party were crushed in legislative elections on Dec. 6, which handed the opposition a two-thirds supermajority.Venezuela\u2019s economy, which is expected to contract by 10 percent this year, was the prime cause for the upset. But the opposition also accused the government of endemic corruption after 17 years in power.In September, federal prosecutors in Miami unsealed separate indictments against Pedro Lu\u00eds Mart\u00edn, a former official with the country\u2019s intelligence police, and Jesus Alfredo Itriago, a former anti-narcotics investigator. The indictments said the men were involved in shipments of cocaine to the United States. The men remain at large.And in July of last year, officials in Aruba arrested a former Venezuelan intelligence chief, Hugo Carvajal, at the request of the American authorities. Federal prosecutors in the United States said that Mr. Carvajal had taken payments from Colombian drug traffickers and had invested in and coordinated drug shipments.The Aruban authorities ultimately returned Mr. Carvajal to Venezuela rather than sending him to face charges in the United States, in a setback for American law enforcement officials.Mr. Maduro of Venezuela denied that Mr. Carvajal was involved in trafficking.Patricia Torres contributed reporting from Caracas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economist\u2019s Criticism of Federal Reserve Policies Gains Ground", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bernanke\u2019s speech largely focused on his own legacy, but the issue of how mindful the Fed should be regarding the effect that rate changes have on other countries has become critically important.This fall, Fed governors surprised many by deciding not to raise rates; one of the factors cited was the impact that China\u2019s currency devaluation would have on already fragile emerging markets. Many economists have been warning that a rate increase combined with uncertain exchange rates in China and other countries would weaken global growth.Now, with all indications pointing to a rate increase this month \u2014 the first in more than nine years \u2014 the fear remains that emerging markets will get hit by another round of capital volatility and currency devaluations as investors exit risky assets in favor of higher yielding prospects in the United States.All of which makes Ms. Rey\u2019s research particularly relevant, not least her recommendation that policy makers in the United States and abroad put in place regulations that reduce the intensity and speculative fervor of these flows. That could mean capital controls in emerging markets or new rules for investment funds that would punish short-term trading by investors.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Ms. Rey is not the first economist to propose that volatile capital flows, especially those that cause real estate bubbles, may be harmful for countries that absorb them.But by highlighting how new exchange rate policies intended to help countries handle these money streams have not worked, Ms. Rey\u2019s research offers a provocative new twist.In previous emerging market crises, most countries got into trouble because their exchange rates were tied to the dollar, making them vulnerable to the ups and downs of interest rate policies in the United States.To better insulate themselves from these external policy shocks, the I.M.F. and most economists advised these countries to let their exchange rates float freely, which most have done.What Ms. Rey found, however, was that countries like Brazil, Turkey and South Africa were just as exposed to the whipsaw effect of rate-driven capital flows with flexible rates as they were when currencies were pegged to the dollar.This conclusion suggests that what ails countries like Turkey and Brazil is less their troubled economies (high inflation and lots of debt) and more the volatile investment flows coming into their countries.And it questioned what has long been seen as a core principle for emerging economies: that the free flow of capital into and out of these markets is a force for good that should be encouraged.\u201cThere is no doubt that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s work carries with it important policy implications,\u201d said Mr. Shin, the economist at the Bank for International Settlements, whose work on global capital flows Ms. Rey has drawn upon.Ms. Rey\u2019s paper, delivered in the summer of 2013, could not have been better timed. Just months earlier, global markets had been roiled by the so-called taper tantrum when global investors pulled billions of dollars out of emerging economies based on the news that the Fed would taper its bond purchasing program.Suddenly, she was very much in demand \u2014 fielding calls from central bankers, policy makers and global investors alike, all of whom were searching for a framework to help them analyze this sudden bout of market volatility.\u201cIt has been a nice surprise \u2014 life has definitely gotten busier,\u201d Ms. Rey said in a telephone interview from Santiago, Chile, where she was talking to the central bank there about how best to respond to capital flows. \u201cThis is an important debate. We have to decide which flows are beneficial and which are speculative.\u201dHer ascent has been rapid. A gift for crunching numbers lifted her from the small town of Brioude in central France to a Grande \u00c9cole in Paris, a scholarship at Stanford University and a doctorate from the London School of Economics.In 2000, she was recruited to Princeton University by none other than Mr. Bernanke, who was the chairman of the university\u2019s economics department at the time.Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.She is married to Richard Portes, a prominent economist also at the London Business School.Indeed, it would be from this very platform that Mr. Bernanke would offer up his deconstruction of Ms. Rey\u2019s thesis one year later.To be sure, he took care to laud the quality of her work, but there was also a hint of defensiveness in his remarks. After all, Mr. Bernanke was the one holding the monetary reins during this period and he questioned whether Ms. Rey\u2019s definition of a swarm of investors chasing risky assets when rates in the United States are low might not be overly simplistic.And wasn\u2019t it also true that those experiencing the most turbulent capital flows \u2014 Turkey, Brazil and South Africa, for example \u2014 were already on edge as a result of their own economic problems?Unlike many rising economists, Ms. Rey has a humble air about her, and she takes pains to say that her research is not meant to be critical of Mr. Bernanke\u2019s time at the Fed.But she stands firmly by her claim that the Fed\u2019s propensity to spur speculative \u2014 and at times damaging \u2014 investment flows remains underappreciated and that more aggressive steps need to be taken to mitigate them.\u201cI think Ben has a very good point, even if we do recognize a global financial cycle, how do we know it is excessive,\u201d she said. \u201cStill, my evidence points to additional risk-taking \u2014 not only in emerging markets but Europe as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
