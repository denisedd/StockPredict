{"Headline": "From Coal to McDonald\u2019s, Catching Up on the Year\u2019s Stories", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIf only there were more lumps of coal in Christmas stockings.That might be the last, fanciful hope for the coal industry, which is in an epic crisis threatening to send even the largest coal companies into bankruptcy. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the end game for a lot of producers,\u201d said Jorge Beristain, head of Americas metals and mining equity research for Deutsche Bank, who titled his latest report on coal \u201cThe Hour of Reckoning.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s been a social backlash against coal,\u201d Mr. Beristain said. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten ugly.\u201dApart from a few politicians in coal-producing states and mining-industry workers and executives, no one is exactly mourning the industry\u2019s plight. Big pension funds and endowments are still jettisoning their stocks and environmentalists and student activists are keeping up the pressure. \u201cCoal,\u201d Mr. Beristain said, \u201chas been tarred and feathered.\u201d\u0095For Steven H. Davis, the former chairman of global law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, this will be the first holiday season since the firm\u2019s 2012 collapse that he can celebrate without threat of a jail term hanging over his head.In October, a Manhattan jury acquitted him and two co-defendants of dozens of felony charges but deadlocked on others. During the four-and-a-half-month trial, no one testified that Mr. Davis knew about any of the questionable accounting maneuvers, let alone that he orchestrated them. Jurors were asked by prosecutors to infer that comments by Mr. Davis that the firm needed to meet its loan obligations, which seem innocuous on their face, were actually \u201ca command to commit fraud.\u201dThe jury\u2019s preliminary vote on the most serious felony charges against Mr. Davis was 11-1 in favor of acquittal, according to jurors I interviewed.In light of the outcome, and after prosecutors reviewed the case, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., indicated he would dispose of Mr. Davis\u2019s case with a deferred prosecution agreement. Charges will be dropped as long as Mr. Davis meets certain conditions. He won\u2019t have to plead guilty or face automatic disbarment.Prosecutors have been criticized by many for failing to pursue more white-collar criminal cases after the financial crisis. But they have a higher duty to seek justice and not pursue unsubstantiated charges that garner favorable headlines but can ruin lives and careers. Mr. Davis has been out of work since he was indicted.Mr. Davis\u2019s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said Mr. Vance and his prosecutors \u201creviewed the evidence and concluded he shouldn\u2019t be retried. To the credit of the office, they decided to do the right thing rather than stubbornly going ahead.\u201d\u0095If my experience is any indication, travelers hoping for lower airfares and more travel options this holiday season have been sorely disappointed.I postponed a trip to Houston next week to visit family when I encountered fares that topped $1,000 for a coach seat \u2014 on a flight that departed New York at 5:40 a.m.The International Air Transport Association, the airline trade group, said this month that North American airlines would earn a record $33 billion this year, and even more \u2014 $36.3 billion \u2014 next year.Given plunging fuel prices, not to mention a Justice Department antitrust investigation that began soon after my column appeared, you would think airlines would be competing more aggressively. After all, high profits go hand-in-hand with a lack of competition.The air transport association attributed the record profitability in part to lower fuel prices. But in a competitive industry, those savings would be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices and better service \u2014 not fatter profit margins.The record profits \u201cshow that the airlines\u2019 anti-consumer strategy is working for them, but not for fliers,\u201d said Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, who called for an antitrust investigation of the industry last summer.\u201cTheir fuel costs are dropping, their rationale for added charges like baggage fees has evaporated, but consumers are seeing no benefits in lower fares,\u201d he said, adding that the airlines may be \u201coverplaying their hand. They\u2019re creating a very powerful case for the Department of Justice to take action.\u201d\u0095Have you been to McDonald\u2019s lately?But what about the food? In January, after one bite of a tasteless chicken wrap and a squishy cheeseburger bun, Mr. Zakarian wryly noted, \u201cThe food could be better.\u201dHeidi Barker, a McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman, told me this week that the chain had taken up Mr. Zakarian\u2019s challenge. \u201cSteve Easterbrook, our C.E.O., has made it clear that as a brand and a business we have to do better. And that means better-tasting food. Better ingredients. We want changes that people will notice.\u201dIn March, McDonald\u2019s said it would phase out the use of chickens injected with antibiotics and use milk only from cows not treated with hormones. In September, it said it would use only eggs from cage-free hens. It\u2019s offering breakfast throughout the day. New menu items include an \u201cartisan\u201d grilled chicken sandwich, a buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich (using real buttermilk, Ms. Barker stressed) and even a lobster roll during the summer months. Gone are the wan chicken wraps that had visibly pained Mr. Zakarian.Consumers and investors have taken notice. In October, McDonalds said same-store sales rose 0.9 percent \u2014 the first increase in same-store comparisons in two years. After dropping below $90 in January, shares of McDonald\u2019s were trading this week at over $118 \u2014 up over 30 percent in a flat-to-down year for the overall market.On my latest visit, the lines were chaotic, but once I reached the register, the server was a model of patience and courtesy. The new crispy chicken sandwich was vastly better than anything I tasted on my last visit. And the bun easily passed the squish test. It called to mind the toasted challah bun used for the famous cheeseburger at the Lambs Club, the upscale Midtown restaurant co-owned by Mr. Zakarian.An earlier version of this column misstated the given name of the celebrity chef with whom Mr. Stewart had lunch at a McDonald\u2019s in January. He is Geoffrey Zakarian, not Gregory.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Brands in Paris Look Ahead With Hope", "Date": "2015-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a midweek morning, with a month to go before Christmas, the entrance halls of Galeries Lafayette, one of the busiest department stores in Paris, appeared to be bustling with shoppers.From a snaking line of Chinese tourists waiting to claim tax refunds to sales assistants arranging displays of luxury chocolates and liqueurs, it seemed business as usual for the retailer, just a little more than a week after a series of terrorist attacks killed 130 people in the French capital and horrified the Western world.But upstairs told a different story. On the first floor, a nervous sales associate for an Italian luxury house, who declined to be named because he was not allowed to comment, estimated that sales had dropped 40 percent in the week after the attacks. Another recalled how, days earlier, the sound of a Chanel concession awning being unfurled inside the store had been mistaken for gunshots, sending dozens of panicked shoppers, already on edge because the police were searching a car out front, diving for cover.\u201cIn the past week, we\u2019ve noticed a change in the people who come to our boutique: Less people are casually strolling around the store,\u201d he said, adding that store security measures had been toughened after the attacks, with more guards and plainclothes agents. \u201cThe people who come are here to buy and then leave.\u201dOver on the Rue St. Honor\u00e9, few people had come to shop on a street that is home to dozens of the city\u2019s most popular luxury boutiques.\u201cHotels nearby say they\u2019ve seen a considerable amount of cancellations, and we are feeling that decline,\u201d said an associate from the doorway of a glittering but deserted flagship store for a British accessories label. (The store manager agreed to speak on condition that neither he nor the brand would be identified, as he is not allowed to speak for the house.)\u201cWe expect the locals to come back more quickly than international customers,\u201d the manager said. \u201cFrom abroad, the attacks are all they think about now when they hear the word Paris.\u201dEven before the attacks, the global market for luxury personal goods was heading for its weakest year since 2009, according to research conducted by Bain & Company, the management consulting agency, as a combination of volatile stock markets, a strong dollar, slowing economic growth in emerging markets and geopolitical turmoil hurt bottom lines.But after the attacks on Nov. 13, and with as much as 30 percent of annual sales made in the year-end holiday quarter, its performance in 2015 could turn out even worse than expected.\u201cThe timing of the attacks is unfortunate given the market was already softening, particularly at the higher end. They have come in what was already a muted global consumer environment,\u201d said Luca Solca, an analyst for Exane BNP Paribas. Stocks of major luxury groups such as LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering dropped when markets opened Nov. 16, the Monday after the attacks, but then they moderated, with travel companies having the greatest losses.\u201cLuxury sales are concentrated to a very small number of major cities and Paris is in the top three \u2014 if not the top destination \u2014 in which these sales are made,\u201d Mr. Solca added. \u201cIn the short term, we are seeing tourists pausing before traveling to Europe, and this will go on for some time. The events will undoubtedly weigh on the next quarter for companies. The question now is how much.\u201dSales of luxury goods in France reached $20.2 billion last year, according to research from Euromonitor International, with more than 50 percent of purchases made by tourists. Fflur Roberts, the head of luxury goods at the market research company Euromonitor, added that the decrease in Chinese travelers in particular, already dropping since Beijing\u2019s decision to lower the value of the renminbi this summer, would have a considerable impact.Meanwhile, Michel Jauslin, general manager of the Palace Hotel Park Hyatt Paris-Vend\u00f4me and Park Hyatt\u2019s vice president for France, confirmed that bookings had taken a sizable hit as visitors stay away because of fears of further attacks.\u201cNaturally, occupancy is drastically decreasing in the wake of the attacks,\u201d he said last week, having noted earlier this year that the Charlie Hebdo shootings in January also had an \u201cenormous impact\u201d on the first few months of the year.\u201cWe noticed a lot of cancellations right after the attacks for the following days and weeks, with the decrease more significant on bookings from the leisure traveler segment than the business one,\u201d Mr. Jauslin said.The situation is not dissimilar to the aftermath of previous attacks. Travel dropped drastically after the London bombings in 2005 and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, prompting companies and governments to encourage shoppers to continue going about their daily lives. \u201cI ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy,\u201d President George W. Bush said in a televised address in September 2001. Though executives at many luxury companies have avoided making public comments in the current climate, with many declining to be interviewed for fear of appearing insensitive, statements from some have echoed the president\u2019s sentiments 14 years later.\u201cOnce again Paris suffered from a terrorist attack with a scale and horror unprecedented in France,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of Kering.\u201cThis attack is an attack against our way of life, against our values, against liberty and against humanity,\u201d he added. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the most appropriate attitude is to continue living normally, by showing courage, solidarity and vigilance.\u201dSome shoppers appeared to be listening. At the corner of the Place Vend\u00f4me and the Rue St. Honor\u00e9, Betty Hyatt of San Diego, along with her husband, daughter and granddaughter, said she did not regret their decision to come to Paris. \u201cWhen we learned about the attacks, we did not think twice about canceling our trip,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are feeling very safe and having a great time in the capital.\u201dBut Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a senior partner at Bain based in Milan, said caution was likely to define shoppers\u2019 spending in coming months, with the effect from Paris being felt in other European shopping cities such as London, Rome and Milan.\u201cThe negative impact is likely to be major as these kinds of levels of mass violence and geopolitical unpredictably do not create a positive emotional and psychological background that make people inclined to shop,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople tend to stay home, particularly as they don\u2019t feel safe in crowded locations, including shopping streets or malls that are seen as high-risk targets for further attacks.\u201dShe also suggested that there could be positive effects, including sales increases in e-commerce or local consumption by travelers from farther afield, particularly China.In the long term, luxury buyers will return to Paris, Ms. D\u2019Arpizio predicted, as the city is always going to be a popular destination and be associated with luxury, with the heritage of many high-end brands deeply rooted in the French capital and its way of life.\u201cBut the key now for brands will be trying to stay close to their customers and maintain a sense of close personal relationships,\u201d she said.\u201cHistorically we\u2019ve seen own-brand stores perform better than wholesalers in uncertain climates, with clients drawn to what they know,\u201d she added. \u201cCompanies that preserve those bonds will be the ones most likely to weather the storms of the coming months ahead.\u201dJulie Carriat contributed reporting in Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Support for Assault Rifles Is All in \u2018Good, Clean Fun\u2019", "Date": "2015-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySUNRISE, Fla. \u2014 As Eddie Pereira helped his 15-year-old nephew fire a semiautomatic assault rifle for the first time, Mr. Pereira\u2019s son, a more experienced shooter, snapped pictures of the rite with a phone.Mr. Pereira, 45, is a regular at the target range here at Markham Park, a county-run recreation area outside Fort Lauderdale that offers family camping, boating, biking, a dog park, a nature trail and, at the far end, a 100-yard shooting range.Mr. Pereira, his brother and their two sons were trying out his new AR-15-style rifle, the country\u2019s best-selling style of long gun, which looked as if it came straight out of a commando movie. He bought it for $600, then personalized it with $400 worth of accessories like different sights and grips. He has a 30-round magazine so he does not have to reload too often.\u201cI like the way it looks, and I like the sport of it,\u201d said Mr. Pereira, who runs a business transporting construction materials. \u201cIt\u2019s good, clean fun.\u201d\u201cAnd I have it if I ever need it for personal protection,\u201d he added.Many gun enthusiasts express deep exasperation of their own. They argue that most non-shooters do not understand the technology and appeal of modern weapons that are widely used for target shooting and, increasingly, hunting. They say proposed bans would do nothing to prevent crime or even lessen the toll of mass shootings.\u201cFrom my experience, the bad guys are always going to get the guns, and gun control is only going to affect law-abiding citizens,\u201d said Oscar Plasencia, 57, a retired police officer who was practicing on a recent Saturday at the Markham Park range.Mr. Plasencia uses an AR-15 model with just a five-round magazine when hunting deer, and said it was no different from many other semiautomatic hunting rifles.\u201cI have a 30-round magazine in my AR at home, for home defense,\u201d he added.Variants of the AR-15 design, a civilian version of the military\u2019s M-16 without the capacity to fire in automatic bursts, have in recent years been the highest-selling rifles in the country, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation in Newtown, Conn., the trade association for the gun industry.Less common but also popular are models based on the AK-47, the Soviet-designed assault weapon that is widely used worldwide. Both designs are off patent and produced by dozens of companies.American sales of these rifles, as indicated by production plus net imports, reached 1.5 million in 2012, far higher than in any previous year, according to foundation estimates.Sales have remained brisk over the last three years and appear to have surged in recent months, suggesting that more than 10 million \u201cmodern sporting rifles,\u201d as the foundation has sought to rename them, are in circulation in the United States.The foundation says that only \u201ccosmetic features\u201d distinguish these rifles from other common firearms and that it is misleading to call them assault weapons no matter how menacing they may look to some.\u201cConsumers like the design, and they\u2019re voting with their wallets,\u201d said Larry Keane, the senior vice president and general counsel of the foundation. Made with lightweight aluminum and polymers, they are easy to hold, have little recoil, are durable and accurate and have modular components, enabling buyers to customize their weapons.With semiautomatic rifles and pistols so ubiquitous, many gun control advocates now place a higher priority on measures like expanded background checks, to help keep guns out of the wrong hands, than on pursuing a ban on particular designs.At the same time, many remain convinced that some restrictions on the weapons would be worthwhile, especially a limit on magazines larger than 10 rounds, which could slightly slow down a mass killer.\u201cJust because these weapons are becoming more popular is not a reason that they should be accepted without question,\u201d said Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\u201cMany people find it fun to shoot lots of rounds, and I don\u2019t dispute that,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think we don\u2019t have the right balance here.\u201dDefining an assault weapon in the civilian market has always been difficult. Starting in 1994, Congress banned sales of semiautomatic assault weapons, defined as those with a detachable magazine and any two of several traits defined as military features, like pistol grips and folding stocks on rifles and second grips on the barrels of handguns. Also banned were magazines holding more than 10 rounds.But the law expired in 2004 and was not renewed, as opposition to gun control hardened and as no strong evidence emerged to indicate it had reduced gun violence.Democratic proposals now before Congress would be somewhat more restrictive than the previous federal ban. They would prohibit sales of semiautomatic rifles and pistols that combine detachable magazines with only one other \u201cmilitary feature\u201d from a list of physical traits and, again, would prohibit magazines holding more than 10 rounds.Here at the gun range, opinions varied on gun control more broadly, with some saying they could support stronger efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally disturbed. But nearly everyone seemed to feel that controls on semiautomatic rifles and large magazines would be futile.\u201cTen or 30 rounds, what difference does it make?\u201d asked Allen Doyle, 63, an accountant. \u201cI can change a clip in 1.5 seconds.\u201dOne of the features described in the legal bans as \u201cmilitary,\u201d and by the gun industry as \u201ccosmetic,\u201d is a pistol grip on rifles \u2014 a handle beneath the trigger. This makes it easier to hold the rifle steady while firing repeatedly, a desired feature to shooting enthusiasts.But Mr. Horwitz, of the gun-control coalition, sees the feature differently.\u201cTraditional hunting rifles are very accurate on the first shot,\u201d he said, which is usually all one gets when hunting game. \u201cThe pistol grip allows the same accuracy on rounds two to 100, a very helpful addition when the shooter is aiming at people.\u201dScott Pechnick, the creative director of an ad agency, brought an AR-15, an AK-47 with an antiquated-looking wooden stock and banana clip, a traditional rifle and a Glock semiautomatic pistol to the Markham Park range.\u201cI enjoy shooting \u2014 to me it\u2019s a stress reliever,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also a firm believer in self-defense.\u201dMr. Pechnick, 31, said he favored wider background checks and thought that someone should be monitoring large purchases of ammunition. \u201cYou can buy 1,000 rounds of ammunition online and nobody says anything,\u201d he said, adding that banning the rifles seemed pointless.Mr. Pereira\u2019s nephew Joey, the 15-year-old who was shooting an AR-15 for the first time, said that the recoil from the first shot had come as a shock, but that after that \u201cit wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d he said.His father, Jorge Pereira, said he did not share his brother Eddie\u2019s love of guns but saw nothing wrong with it, \u201cand I\u2019m a registered Democrat.\u201dIf there were no guns in the world already, he said, a ban on assault weapons might make sense. But now, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that a ban is going to do all that much.\u201dWhat is more, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s a sizable population out there that would see it as a call to revolution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Digital Ad Spending Expected to Soon Surpass TV", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTelevision has lost its longtime grip on advertising budgets as digital ad spending continues to surge, according to some of the advertising industry\u2019s most closely watched forecasts to be released on Monday.Television ad sales are expected to fall slightly this year, decreasing globally for the first time ever aside from a recession year, according to the Interpublic Group\u2019s Magna Global.TV will account for 38.4 percent of the $503 billion global ad market this year and will drop to 38 percent of the market in 2016, according to the forecast.In the meantime, digital media will continue its meteoric rise. Digital ad spending will grow 17.2 percent this year, to nearly $160 billion, and 13.5 percent in 2016, and is expected to overtake TV as the biggest advertising category by the end of 2017, the forecast says.Publicis Groupe\u2019s ZenithOptimedia expects digital media to pass TV in 2018.\u201cTV global growth is diminishing,\u201d Vincent Letang, the head of global forecasting at Magna Global, said. \u201cIn most major developed markets, TV growth is slowing and in some cases stagnating.\u201dThe companies plan to present their forecasts at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York on Monday.In the United States, Magna Global predicts, digital media will overtake TV as the No. 1 advertising category in 2016, with nearly $68 billion in ad sales compared with $66 billion for TV.The prospect that online and mobile platforms would capture more ad dollars than TV became inevitable in the last several years. Until recently, advertisers were dipping into their print budgets to feed their digital ad purchases. But ad dollars are now flowing from TV to digital, said Jonathan Barnard, the head of forecasting for ZenithOptimedia.\u201cOver the last year or so, that\u2019s really been the first time we\u2019ve seen money specifically coming out of TV and going onto digital,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing about the loss of revenue from TV to digital for a long time, but the last year has been when it\u2019s been fairly visible.\u201dIn particular, ad dollars are now flowing faster into online video, social media and mobile. ZenithOptimedia predicts mobile ads will account for 50.2 percent of Internet advertising in 2018, surpassing desktop ads for the first time.That shift in ad dollars to online and mobile has led to what Mr. Letang of Magna Global calls \u201cdigital deflation\u201d: those ads are typically cheaper, and as ad dollars move to digital, there is pressure on media sellers to cut their ad prices. As a result, growth in the overall ad spending market is slowing.Magna Global estimates that ad sales in the United States will increase 5.2 percent in 2016, to $176 billion. But when ads for nonannual events like the Summer Olympics and presidential elections are stripped out, the pace of growth in ad sales will slow to 3.3 percent in 2016 from 3.8 percent this year.Over all, Magna Global predicts that global ad spending will grow by 4.6 percent, to $526 billion in 2016, and ZenithOptimedia sees an increase of 4.7 percent, to $579 billion. WPP\u2019s GroupM cut its growth estimate to 4.5 percent, from 4.8 percent, to $520 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When White Diamonds Won\u2019t Cut It", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersIF there is a holiday gift almost guaranteed to make a recipient swoon with joy, it is a diamond. But while such stones remain appealing as jewelry, the value of certain colored diamonds has increased while traditional white diamonds have fallen.Diamond dealers are talking about pink, blue and red diamonds as investments, citing a recent track record of double-digit returns. This new interest in such rare gemstones can make a holiday gift 10 to 20 times more expensive than a similar, high-quality white diamond. Yet there are others in the trade who question whether these stones will pay the dividends people imagine in the Christmases to come.\u201cFancy colored diamonds are the flavor of the year \u2014 they\u2019re hot, they\u2019re sexy, they\u2019re great,\u201d said Martin Rapaport, chairman of the Rapaport Group, which is considered a primary source of diamond pricing information.\u201cIf someone said, \u2018I want to buy something great for my wife,\u2019 I\u2019d say, great, buy fancy colored diamonds; you\u2019re a billionaire,\u201d he added. \u201cBut anyone who wants to invest in the flavor of the month shouldn\u2019t do it.\u201dUnderstanding the lust for colored diamonds begins with understanding the broader forces pushing and pulling diamond prices.The white diamonds that adorn engagement rings and will dangle from ears and wrap around bracelets this holiday season have fallen in value over the last year. Prices for one-carat diamonds have dropped 7.15 percent as of Dec. 1, according to an index Mr. Rapaport developed.Mr. Rapaport said demand for white diamonds had dropped globally because of a slowing Chinese economy, currency devaluation in Russia and low oil prices in the Middle East. Yet on the supply side, the cost of rough, white diamonds has stayed high, which has hurt the rest of the diamond trade\u2019s ability to make a profit.During the same time, colored diamonds have surged in value. Buyers have sought them out for their beauty, extreme rarity and investment potential.The best-known pink diamonds, for example, are from the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. That mine, which supplies 90 to 95 percent of the world\u2019s pink diamonds, will be exhausted by 2020, and the scarcity has driven up prices.\u201cArgyle pink diamonds outperform any other,\u201d said Leibish Polnauer, president of Leibish & Company, a colored-diamond dealer. \u201cThey\u2019re less and less available and more and more in demand. Fifteen years ago we bought Argyle pink diamonds for $10,000 a carat. Today it\u2019s $150,000, $200,000, $250,000 a carat.\u201dDealers say wealthy buyers in volatile economies view rare, colored diamonds as a hedge against economic uncertainty. A diamond can also be a discreet way to put a tremendous amount of money into something smaller than an aspirin tablet.\u201cYou can buy a large house for $1 million, or about one-half of a carat of a red diamond,\u201d said Yaniv Marcus, founder of the Diamond Investment and Intelligence Center. \u201cA one-carat red diamond could be valued at $2.5 million.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about rarity,\u201d said Frank Everett, vice president and sales director in the jewelry department at Sotheby\u2019s. \u201cThe best ones stand out like a great piece of art.\u201dIn the last year, Sotheby\u2019s has sold two well-known blue diamonds for record-setting prices. A 9.75-carat blue diamond that belonged to the socialite Bunny Mellon sold in November 2014 for $32.6 million \u2014 or $3.3 million a carat. Last month, the auction house sold the 12-carat Blue Moon for $48.5 million \u2014 or just over $4 million a carat.Those prices far outstrip the 100-carat white diamond Sotheby\u2019s sold in April for $22 million \u2014 or $220,000 a carat.More broadly, a one-carat fancy pink diamond in a cushion cut is 11.50 times as expensive as a one-carat cushion-cut white diamond that has been judged to be internally flawless and carries the highest color rating, said Eden Rachminov, head of the advisory board of the Fancy Color Resource Foundation. A blue diamond is 20.8 times as expensive as a similar white diamond.But it is not so simple to jump into the trade just based on the soaring prices. Investors also need to understand the very different ways white and colored diamonds are judged.With white diamonds, it is the widely known measures of color, cut, clarity and carat weight that drive prices. But investing in white diamonds is a lot like picking quality stocks. There are established measures of quality, relatively transparent pricing, knowable transaction costs and liquidity, at least in smaller carat sizes.Mr. Rapaport views investments in white diamonds as a way to capitalize on the growth of the global middle class who will buy them as gifts and drive prices back up.In the world of colored diamonds, what determines value is more subjective. The range of prices for any given colored diamond can vary wildly, corresponding not only to the rarity of their colors but also to the vividness of the color itself. (The so-called chocolate diamonds that mall jewelers are advertising are not considered investments; until fairly recently, they were used for industrial purposes because they are so common.)\u201cIt\u2019s the strength of the color,\u201d said Jordan Fine, president of JFine Inc., a dealer that specializes in colored diamonds. \u201cA light yellow could be $3,000 a carat and a vivid yellow could be $15,000 a carat. A one-carat light pink could be $75,000 to $700,000 a carat for a vivid pink.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom how expensive and rare that little stone is.\u201d\u201cColored diamonds don\u2019t have a price list or somebody managing the value,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a true supply-and-demand free trade. It\u2019s like real estate. Its value is what someone will pay for it.\u201dMr. Rachminov said the prices of yellows have been stable, tending to track the stock market, but the pinks and blues have soared in value, which has made some industry experts like Mr. Rapaport skeptical. (Red diamonds are at the top but they are exceedingly rare.) \u201cThere\u2019s more interest from high-net-worth individuals, just like there\u2019s more demand for art and wine and luxury items in general,\u201d Mr. Rachminov said.Colored-diamond dealers talk of the stones as a store of value, and they have shown to be over decades. But they are not the easiest investments to sell.\u201cThe approach should be long term,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trading commodity first of all because of liquidity. The return is exponential over time.\u201dHe also divides colored diamonds into two categories: jewelry and investments. This is by quality but also by the color itself. He said there are not enough orange, green, violet, and purple diamonds to create the liquidity for an investment market. Therefore, most investors focus on blue, pink and red diamonds.Yet that line between jewelry and investment can get blurred. Sam, who owns a medical business in New Jersey but asked that his last name be withheld for security concerns, has amassed a collection of dozens of colored diamonds. He bought his first pink diamond in a ring as a gift for his wife in 2005. Then he bought a green diamond and realized that the stones could be used to finance his children\u2019s college education.\u201cI put some money into that green diamond and that started a collecting bug,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it became trying to find some of the best examples of different colors of vivid colored diamonds.\u201dMr. Fine, who sold Sam many of his stones, said some of his pink diamonds had doubled in value in 10 years. But Sam said he also was aware that his timing was right.In 2007, he bought a half-carat vivid pink diamond in the Argyle tender \u2014 an annual private auction of the best pink diamonds from the mine. But this year, he bid four times the price for a smaller pink diamond of lesser quality and lost.Still, as with any thing of beauty, it can be a lot harder to look rationally at sparkling colored diamonds than a list of company names in a securities portfolio.Sam said he had amassed a collection valued at $6 million of 41 colored diamonds in almost every different hue but can\u2019t bear to sell them. \u201cNow I keep them securely in a vault and I go down and look at them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of concentrated wealth in a thing of great beauty.\u201dThe Wealth Matters column on Saturday about the investment value of colored diamonds included a quotation from Yaniv Marcus, founder of the Diamond Investment and Intelligence Center, that misstated how much of a red diamond could be purchased for $1 million. About a half a carat of a red diamond, not 1/16 of an ounce, would cost that amount. The column also miscalculated the equivalent value of a 100-carat white diamond that recently sold at Sotheby\u2019s. The diamond sold for $22 million, or $220,000 a carat \u2014 not $2.2 million a carat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shkreli Indictment Portrays Small-Time Fraud ", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartin Shkreli told investors that his hedge fund had an auditor, that it had posted a 36 percent return since its inception and that it had $35 million in assets under management.None of it was true, federal authorities say.His former hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, had recorded losses of at least 18 percent and was essentially broke by 2011, having less than $1,000 in its bank account, according to the indictment. The hedge fund had no auditor.The authorities described Mr. Shkreli, 32, as a failed trader with a habit of spreading falsehoods and running his businesses on fumes and misappropriated money. His Ponzi-like scheme, they said, involved looting Retrophin, a biopharmaceutical company he used to run, to pay back his disgruntled investors.\u201cAt a certain point, when you lie, it catches up with you,\u201d said Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, at a news conference discussing the charges.The schemes outlined by both prosecutors and securities regulators were not especially sophisticated.The indictment charges Mr. Shkreli with two counts of securities fraud, saying that he deceived the fewer than two dozen investors in his former hedge fund about the firm\u2019s viability and performance in persuading them to give him more capital. He also faces five conspiracy counts.Mr. Shkreli, the authorities said, quickly lost money at a small hedge fund he managed called Elea Capital Management from 2006 to 2007.At his next fund, MSMB, he did not disclose information about his prior losses and poor performance when raising money from investors.He also lied about MSMB\u2019s assets. He told an investor in December 2010 that the firm had $35 million in assets under management. In fact, it had $700.He then lost even more money \u2014 some $7 million \u2014 at MSMB when he bet wrong in 2011 that the shares of a small pharmaceutical company would fall in price. He owed Merrill Lynch, his brokerage firm, that amount, and settled with Merrill for $1.35 million. He used money from a new fund, MSMB Healthcare, to pay off the Merrill settlement.Again, he did not tell investors.Finally, at Retrophin, he once again used company money to cover up his failed investments.Mr. Shkreli received help, authorities said, from a corporate lawyer, Evan Greebel, 42, who at time was working for the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.Mr. Greebel, who lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., recently joined the Kaye Scholer firm as a partner. Prosecutors charged him with helping Mr. Shkreli engineer a series of fraudulent transactions that effectively took money from Retrophin so it could be given to some of Mr. Shkreli\u2019s former hedge fund investors.The indictment mirrors some of the accusations contained in a civil lawsuit filed in August by Retrophin, which ousted Mr. Shkreli as chief executive in 2014. The company had accused him of using Retrophin as his personal piggy bank to help pay off upset investors in the hedge fund by hiring some of them for sham consulting jobs.The authorities contend that fraudulent transactions were devised to make it appear as if Mr. Shkreli\u2019s former hedge fund had invested in the pharmaceutical company when in fact it had not.In a scheme involving two other unnamed people, Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Greebel created a paper trail using backdated stock transfer agreements in response to an inquiry the S.E.C. had begun in early 2012.Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Greebel also used $3.4 million in Retrophin funds and stocks to settle claims with several MSMB investors who were threatening to sue in 2013. The money was transferred to the hedge fund investors, even though Retrophin had no responsibility for those claims.The indictment contends the lawyer was an active participant in the scheme.In some instances, Mr. Greebel removed the outside auditors from Retrophin from emails to hide what he and Mr. Shkreli were doing, the authorities said. The indictment includes portions of an email exchange between Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Greebel in which they discussed questions from Retrophin\u2019s auditors in August 2013 about the appropriateness of the settlement agreements.In one email, Mr. Shkreli writes, \u201cThere were serious faults with the agreements including lack of board approval.\u201dMr. Greebel responds, \u201cThat will open up some very big issues. The current thinking is let RTRX pay,\u201d referring to Retrophin\u2019s trading symbol. \u201cIt would be easier than the road you are referring to,\u201d he continued, adding that the auditor \u201cwould get very spooked with what you are talking about.\u201d\u201cThat works for me,\u201d Mr. Shkreli replied.It is not clear from the court filings what Mr. Greebel\u2019s motivation might have been in helping Mr. Shkreli with the purported fraud. Mr. Greebel is charged with one count of conspiracy.Regulatory filings with the S.E.C. show that Retrophin was not Mr. Greebel\u2019s only corporate client. In recent years, Mr. Greebel had built an expertise working with Bitcoin, the digital currency. He is listed on filings with the S.E.C. as one of the outside lawyers working on the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, the publicly traded Bitcoin investment vehicle that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss plan to introduce.On Mr. Greebel\u2019s profile at Kaye Scholer, which he joined during the summer, it mentions that The Financial Times recognized him as an \u201cinnovative lawyer\u201d in the United States.A spokeswoman for Kaye Scholer said in a statement: \u201cWe are deeply concerned that these charges have been made against Mr. Greebel. He has been with us for a relatively short period of time, and all the alleged activities occurred before he joined the firm. We are conducting our own internal investigation, and based on our findings we will take appropriate action.\u201dJacquelyn L. Heard, a spokeswoman for Katten Muchin Rosenman, said, \u201cIt would be inappropriate for us to comment on an investigation into a former colleague.\u201dIn a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Shkreli said, \u201cIt is no coincidence that these charges, the result of investigations which have been languishing for considerable time, have been filed at the same time of Shkreli\u2019s high-profile, controversial and yet unrelated activities.\u201dMr. Shkreli, dressed in a short-sleeve, black T-shirt and dark jeans, was released on $5 million in bail, secured by a bank account and guaranteed by his father and his brother.Mr. Greebel was released on $1 million in bail, secured by his house, and guaranteed by his wife and his mother.Mr. Shkreli, who had shown a great deal of self-confidence in recent television appearances before his arrest, looked a little shaken during the arraignment, occasionally twisting his head to look at the packed courtroom.At one point, he questioned Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy after the judge mentioned a date, asking, \u201cDid you say 2016, your honor?\u201dHe wore sunglasses as he exited the court in the pouring evening rain, declining to speak to journalists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Masters\u2019 Prices Are No Laughing Matter", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe then proceeded to ram the violin through the canvas.In those days, of course, Rembrandt was the gold standard. But the Dutchman and his fellow old masters have fallen out of fashion and are no longer as coveted by collectors and investors.As a measure of that fall, 10 works have sold at auction for more than $100 million since 2004, and all of them were made by modern or contemporary artists in the past 120 years. Older paintings have seen their value, in relative terms, level off or decline. The trend was plain to see in recent weeks, as London\u2019s auction houses tried to find buyers for their latest tranche of old masters. As has been the case in recent years, there were few works by major names.Christie\u2019s biannual evening sale on Dec. 8 raised just 6.5 million pounds with fees, about $9.7 million, against a low estimate of \u00a312.7 million. Nineteen of the 45 works, or 42 percent, failed to sell, including the two most highly valued lots \u2014 a 1582 watercolor study of a hare among plants by Hans Hoffmann, a pupil of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and a fine 1770s Francesco Guardi view of the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, carrying low estimates of \u00a34 million and \u00a31.5 million respectively.Little wonder, then, that Christie\u2019s, the dominant player in the auction market for modern and contemporary art, is re-marketing its old master paintings as \u201cclassic art.\u201d It will be offering old masters and other historical pieces next year at its Rockefeller Center sales in April, rather than January. The week will feature a themed sale that includes 20th-century works. And its \u201cclassic art\u201d format will debut in London in July, Christie\u2019s said on Friday.At its own auction the following evening, Sotheby\u2019s achieved a far more respectable total of \u00a322.6 million with fees, although it was just above the low estimate of \u00a321.8 million based on hammer prices. Of the 44 lots offered, 15 did not sell, or 34 percent.A lone European telephone bidder paid a top price of \u00a39.1 million for a smaller 1825 version of John Constable\u2019s admired but difficult-to-love 1824 vertical landscape, \u201cThe Lock,\u201d that had been in the same British family since 1855.As a point of comparison, the combined \u00a329.1 million total from those old master sales was 34 percent less than the \u00a344.2 million Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s took in at equivalent events five years ago, in December 2011.\u201cThe auction market is extremely selective,\u201d said Henry Pettifer, the head of old master paintings at Christie\u2019s, whose sale total had been dented by a 15th-century Flemish Madonna and child by Hans Memling that the auction house had sold privately for more than \u00a33.5 million and had withdrawn from the sale. \u201cThe availability of fresh material is limited,\u201d he added, alluding to how few museum-quality works are in private hands. And, thanks to Artnet and other databases that list auction results, wealthy people who buy art have become all too aware of how hard it is to make a profit on old masters.In one example, Christie\u2019s was offering the mid-18th-century canvas \u201cRebecca and Eliezer at the Well\u201d by the Venetian artist Francesco Fontebasso at a low estimate of \u00a3120,000. The pleasant piece of rococo decoration had been bought at auction in 1990 for $286,000, according to Artnet. At the Dec. 8 sale it fell to a single telephone bid of \u00a3115,000, about $170,000, before fees. Investors do not expect to incur a loss of about 40 percent a quarter century after buying a Warhol or a Basquiat. Reselling an old master can be even harder when that painting has been languishing in a dealer\u2019s gallery.On Nov. 24 and 25, Sotheby\u2019s auctioned the collection of the fourth-generation Munich dealer Konrad Bernheimer, who owns the historic London gallery Colnaghi. Mr. Bernheimer, 65, has decided to scale down his operations. He is closing his Munich gallery, selling his grand Bavarian home, Marquartstein Castle, and is merging Colnaghi with a fellow London dealer, Coll & Cortes.Despite Sotheby\u2019s branding the two-part auction as \u201cThe Bernheimer Collection,\u201d his stock proved a hard sell. Only 22 out of the 42 lots at the Nov. 24 evening sale found buyers, with a top price of \u00a3197,000 with fees for the 1732 Nicolas Lancret painting, \u201cLe Menuet\u201d \u2014 a frothy \u201cf\u00eate champ\u00eatre\u201d scene with childlike dancers \u2014 that had been purchased for $744,000 at auction in 2005.Two weeks later, Mr. Bernheimer was among the dozens of long-established old master dealers attending the London evening sales. In the past, they would buy at these auctions to stock up for the Maastricht European Fine Art Fair in March in the Netherlands. But with sellers encouraging Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s to compete for their business with ever-higher valuations, and auctions now marketed to a shallow pool of wealthy buyers, there was conspicuously little trade bidding.\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve not to recognize we\u2019re at a pretty serious moment,\u201d said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, director of the London dealer Agnew\u2019s. \u201cThere has been a massive taste shift. But when a good old master does come up at auction and it is priced correctly, you do get some excitement.\u201dOne of the few lots to sell significantly above its estimate, at Sotheby\u2019s, was a 1780 landscape by Joseph Wright of Derby showing a cavern in the Gulf of Salerno with the figure of Julia, the banished daughter of Emperor Augustus.Wright is one of the most original figures of British Romantic painting, and this composition, held in the same private collection in Derbyshire since 1840, had an approachable low estimate of \u00a3100,000 because of condition issues and \u2014 not insignificantly \u2014 the fact that it was a charity donation to benefit Syrian refugees. As a result, at least three bidders pushed the price to \u00a3665,000 with fees.\u201cThe new money is interested in old masters, but it wants what Duveen sold to the robber barons. It wants names,\u201d said Hugo Nathan, a co-founder of the London advisers Beaumont Nathan. He was referring to Joseph Duveen, the British art dealer who was responsible for bringing many great works of art to the United States.Mr. Nathan was among the few dealers actively bidding at the evening sales. Buying on behalf of a client, he paid \u00a3506,500, or twice the estimate, at Christie\u2019s for Charles-Antoine Coypel\u2019s 1737 painting, \u201cThe Destruction of the Palace of Armida.\u201d\u201cToday you have to shop by image,\u201d Mr. Nathan said. \u201cBut if you are brave and don\u2019t follow fashion, there are opportunities.\u201dPeople are still looking at old masters for pleasure, if not as lucrative investments. Sotheby\u2019s said 6,000 people visited its Dec. 5 to 9 viewing, compared with the 6,400 who saw its Impressionist and contemporary sales in June. At the lower end of the price scale, many historic paintings do find a market \u2014 Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s day sales of old master paintings on Dec. 9 and 10 had solid-enough selling rates of 67 and 65 percent apiece.But there remains a mass of old master paintings in dealers\u2019 stocks \u2014 and in collectors\u2019 minds \u2014 whose asking prices still hark back to the age of Tommy Cooper. Unfortunately, in today\u2019s market, and at those prices, many of these paintings will be as sellable as that Stradivarius canvas with the hole in it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Giving Bondholders a Voice in Debt Restructuring", "Date": "2015-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe underlying problem is that since the 1930s, the securities laws have barred basic free contracting among bondholders, via the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Although the ban is exceedingly poor \u2014 one can think of few groups less in need of contractual guidance in the United States than institutional bondholders \u2014 the lurking amendment would worsen the plight of the bondholder.One of the most prominent New Dealers, William O. Douglas, thought that insiders too often demolished retail bondholders in out-of-court restructuring cases. He wanted to bar votes from binding bondholders, despite that other securities holders, like shareholders, typically approve major transactions by vote, as even bondholders do in bankruptcy. He was then the influential chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. (Yes, this is same William Douglas who later became a Supreme Court justice.) Congress agreed.The effort backfired, however. First, the voting ban meant that a handful of holdout bondholders could stymie a sound restructuring of a weakened company. Some holdouts act strategically, some do not like the deal on offer. But when the bondholders seeking a compromise see that the holdouts will get a big payout, they often stop being willing to compromise. They fear that the holdouts will be fully paid, while they get less. The deal dies and the company goes bankrupt.Then, decades later, smart investment bankers deployed a powerful but contentious mechanism, the \u201cexit exchange offer.\u201d In it, the debtor company offers new bonds for old bonds, but insists that investors exchanging their old bonds first vote to delete the bonds\u2019 protections. The securities laws allow bondholders to vote on their protections but not on their payment terms. When the exit consent structure works for the deal makers, it drops nonparticipating bondholders into a \u201cdeath trap\u201d: The dissenting bondholder either takes an undesirable deal or suffers as the bonds lose protections and value. Courts and commentators are split on whether Douglas\u2019s ban on changing the payment terms or maturity date barred the tactic; in recent months, courts in major restructuring cases stopped splitting and confirmed that it did.Imagine bonds for which the issuer had promised never to transfer value to its owners until the bondholders were paid back. The issuer offers to exchange those bonds for new bonds of an affiliate, but the issuer requires that the exchangers vote first to waive that no-payout protection. The bondholders who exchange do not care about the no-payout protection, because it is the affiliate that will owe them money after the protection is gone, so they vote to waive the no-payout protection. Those who do nothing would be hurt because, after the protection is gone, the debtor could transfer money to its shareholders and be unable to pay the remaining bondholders back. A bondholder would exchange even if the deal is bad \u2014- as long as doing nothing leads to a worse deal.Thus Douglas\u2019s no-vote rule facilitated one serious distortion \u2014- the holdout who can kill a good deal \u2014- and then, in reaction, deal makers invented a countervailing distortion: the coercive exit consent exchange offer to twist or break the arms of dissenting bondholders.Recent court decisions confirmed that the law bars the exit consent distortion (and possibly more), because it requires that bondholders get to make their own call as to payment terms. The lurking rider would validate the latter exit consent distortion.It would be far better to simply repeal the voting ban. It\u2019s anachronistic for the 21st-century bond market to stymie uncoerced votes in restructuring cases.The consequence would be no holdouts after a vote, and no need for coercive exit consents. Congress should be modest about adding an important bond market rider without input from the S.E.C. and the bond market over all. If it cannot wait and the rider validating hardball tactics must pass, then a simple rider to the rider needs to be put in to give the S.E.C. authority to fix problems that will arise: \u201cFor bonds issued after June 30, 2016, bondholders may vote on payment terms, under conditions approved by the S.E.C.\u201dA well-functioning bond market needs a way to restructure bonds via noncoercive votes. If bondholders had that right, restructuring cases would not need the exit consent maneuver to force holdouts into submission.Today\u2019s financial marketplace operates by deal-making, and institutional bondholders know what they are doing. Shareholders vote on mergers and restructuring; bondholders should be able to, as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Way to Unrig Stock Trading", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsAMERICA\u2019S equity markets are broken. Individuals and institutions make transactions in rigged markets favoring short-term players. The root cause of the problem is that stocks trade on numerous venues, including 11 traditional exchanges and dozens of so-called dark pools that allow buyers and sellers to work out of the public eye. This market fragmentation allows high-frequency traders and exchanges to profit at the expense of long-term investors.Individual investors, trading through brokers like Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade, suffer first as the brokers profit by hundreds of millions of dollars from selling their retail orders to high-frequency traders and again as those traders take advantage of the orders they bought.Market depth, critically important to investors who trade large blocks of securities, also suffers in the world of high-frequency traders. Startling evidence for the lack of robustness in today\u2019s market comes from a 2013 Securities and Exchange Commission report that found order cancellation rates as high as 95 to 97 percent, a result of high-frequency traders\u2019 playing their cat and mouse game. Market depth is an illusion that fades in the face of real buying and selling.Securities markets work best as a central clearinghouse where all buyers and sellers of stocks come together. Not so long ago, when the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq operated as virtual monopolies, American equity markets were the envy of the world. Until 2000, Nasdaq was wholly owned by a nonprofit corporation; the New York Stock Exchange was nonprofit until 2006. To ensure that they would operate in the public interest, they were treated much like public utilities.The unfairness of trading markets became a subject of intense focus with the publication in 2014 of Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cFlash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,\u201d which describes the way these markets are rigged in favor of high-frequency traders. Fortunately, Mr. Lewis provides a hopeful ending, predicting that the book\u2019s hero, a trader named Brad Katsuyama, would save the day by forming his own exchange to serve real investors.Mr. Lewis was right. Mr. Katsuyama\u2019s company, IEX (in which Yale has a small indirect investment), has filed an application to become a national securities exchange. Exchanges are the key to price discovery \u2014 the determination of the true price of an asset \u2014 because the National Market System requires brokers to route trades to the exchange displaying the best price. Right now, brokers and their larger exchange competitors can ignore IEX and other regulated alternative trading platforms, even if they display the best prices.Its exchange competitors, which include the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and BATS, cater to the interests of high-frequency traders, which typically provide more than 50 percent of all trading volume. In addition to trading fees, exchanges charge fees for high-speed proprietary data feeds that provide privileged access to market data.Exchanges advance the interests of traders by sponsoring esoteric order types, which for hard-to-understand reasons receive the approval of the S.E.C. An example is the New York Stock Exchange Day Intermarket Sweep Add Liquidity Only Order. Regular investors have no idea such an order type exists or what it means. Yet order types like these are essential to the dirty work of the high-frequency trader.High-frequency traders pay to locate their computer servers inside of exchanges\u2019 order execution centers, where they get early access to trade information that they use to jump in front of \u2014 front run \u2014 other clients. These co-located computers detect orders to buy and sell on one exchange and then rapidly send cancellations and orders to other venues where their servers are also co-located. Does this sound like a fair system?IEX\u2019s plan is to forgo the high profits earned by the major exchanges from selling speed advantages on the theory that they can make money more ethically by attracting long-term investors.Its strategy is simple. IEX will not allow traders to reap the benefits of speed, instead slowing down all participants by 350 microseconds. This prevents the front-running facilitated by exchanges, which has led to vigorous and vitriolic opposition from groups that profit from the current arrangement.An unholy alliance of exchanges (including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and BATS) and high-frequency traders like Citadel have petitioned the S.E.C. to reject IEX\u2019s current application. In essence, the petitioners argue that it is consistent with commission rules for an exchange to sell certain customers an advantage over others, but IEX should not be allowed to remove these advantages.The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and BATS seek to block IEX from competing, when they collectively own 10 of the 11 national stock exchanges. By creating (and receiving S.E.C. approval for) so many exchanges, the current infrastructure fragments the market without providing the benefits of real competition.Maybe IEX\u2019s business model will work and maybe it won\u2019t, but the S.E.C. should act in the public interest. Approval of IEX\u2019s application will not fix America\u2019s equity markets; it will make them less broken. The commission should not succumb to the special interests of competitors and their fellow travelers. It should approve IEX\u2019s application and provide a real alternative for long-term investors.Jonathan Macey is a professor of law and David Swensen is the chief investment officer at Yale.Advertisement"}

That leaves the situation less than predictable, he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be shocked in 10 years to look back and see that we\u2019ve turned a corner in coal \u2014 and I would not be surprised to see a rise,\u201d he added.Dr. Yuen of Citi Research disagreed. The pressure on coal is \u201cstructural,\u201d he said, and related in part to the boom in renewable energy production.\u201cProbably, we aren\u2019t going back,\u201d he predicted.He added that, along with North America and Europe\u2019s slowing demand, even Chinese coal demand may already be coming down. And while India will continue to use coal, imports of it might drop as the country improves its own mining capability.Over time, new technologies for renewable energy will become cheaper and more efficient, he said, in a familiar \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d that creates jobs and builds new industries, leading to further advances.The deployment of renewable energy has already grown so sharply, he noted, that some American states whose political leaders oppose the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan might well find themselves in \u201caccidental compliance\u201d as their use of renewable energy reduces the need for burning fossil fuels.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "6 Companies Make Market Debut in China After 5-Month Hiatus", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Shares started trading in six newly listed companies in China on Wednesday after a five-month hiatus for initial public offerings and just weeks before rules governing investors in new listings are set to change.Shares in all the companies surged by their daily limit of 44 percent, a typical increase for listings in China. The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock indexes both rose about 0.1 percent.The companies had filed to go public between February and June, but the Chinese government had banned new share sales in July in an effort to stem a plunge in the markets. The move created a backlog of nearly 700 companies that have been waiting to make their debuts.Public offerings were a popular investment before the ban, with companies often reaching the limit of how much their shares could rise on the first day. That effect was partly because of speculation and partly because of government policies meant to ensure that businesses were not overvalued when they went public.Under current rules, buyers must back their order with cash up front, even though the entire share order is unlikely to be filled. That can temporarily tie up hundreds of billions of dollars that might be invested elsewhere.About 3.978 trillion renminbi, or about $606 billion, was locked up for initial public offerings in June, while 42 billion renminbi was actually raised, according to ANZ Research.But the China Securities Regulatory Commission said the deposit requirement for initial public offerings would be different in 2016. That may make more funds available for investing in new listings, and stocks in general, analysts said.Changing the rules could make new listings more inviting, said David Qu, a rates strategist at ANZ Research.The old requirements, however, apply to the companies that started trading on Wednesday and the other 22 expected to list before the end of the year. Nonetheless, Mr. Qu says there is little to worry about.\u201cThe P.B.O.C. is definitely going to maintain accommodative liquidity in the market in spite of the I.P.O.s,\u201d he said, referring to the People\u2019s Bank of China. \u201cThey will inject liquidity when necessary, so I\u2019m not worried about the I.P.O. tightening this year.\u201dHerald van der Linde, an equities strategist at HSBC, said the government was working hard to make the process of going public more efficient. He added that it would take a while to see how the market responded to the resumption of public offerings.\u201cSometimes when equity markets are hot, you see them do phenomenally well,\u201d he said, referring to new listings. \u201cI don\u2019t really expect that at the moment; you get that when there is liquidity. It will be much more muted from what we\u2019ve seen for some of the past.\u201dAnji Foodstuff, a condiment maker; BanBao, a toy manufacturer; and Bomin Electronics, which makes printed circuit boards, were listed on the Shanghai stock exchange on Wednesday.The Shenzhen listings were Hubei Kailong Chemical Group, which makes explosives; Zhejiang Zhongjian Technology, which makes gardening machinery; and Beijing Sanfo Outdoor Products, a manufacturer of camping items.Advertisement"}

The Push to Divest Grows", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookYou probably own a stake in a gun manufacturer, whether you know it or not.Just take a look at your 401(k) plan. If you\u2019re in one managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity or just about any other mutual fund group, you\u2019re most likely the owner of shares in the three primary publicly traded gun or ammunition makers: Smith & Wesson; Sturm, Ruger & Company; and the Olin Corporation.If you own any of the broad index funds or even a target-date retirement fund, you\u2019ve got a stake in the gun industry.What if you own one of these 401(k) plans, but don\u2019t want to financially support gun makers? Is there anything you can do about it?Just over the weekend, Letitia James, New York City\u2019s public advocate, took an even more unusual step. Hoping to cut off funding for gun makers, she sought to pressure TD Bank, which has provided $280 million in financing to Smith & Wesson, to cut its ties with the gun maker.\u201cAs we stare at the financial smoking gun that enables gun violence, inaction is not an option,\u201d Ms. James wrote in a letter to TD Bank. \u201cIf you want to do business with New York City, you can\u2019t be in bed with companies that manufacture the agents that kill our children and families.\u201dA spokeswoman for TD said, \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the events in San Bernardino and our sympathies go out to the individuals and their families affected by this tragedy. As a matter of corporate policy we do not comment on the nature and specifics of our relationships with our customers.\u201dOf course, gun manufacturers are legitimate businesses, as are the financial services companies that fund them. On Monday, in a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas spoke to this in bemoaning the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to hear a Second Amendment challenge to a Chicago suburb\u2019s ordinance that banned certain weapons.In attacking the gun industry, Ms. James is taking a page from other successful efforts to pressure \u201csin\u201d industries like cigarettes and coal. While seeking divestments has long been popular, they have had little direct impact, according to studies, despite the headlines they often generate.But efforts to prevent banks and other financing sources from lending money to certain companies has been far more effective. For instance, as chronicled in this column earlier this year, a number of advocacy groups successfully ended the practice of mountaintop removal of coal in Appalachia, an environmentally devastating practice, by pressuring banks like Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse to choke off funding, which they did over nearly a decade of pressure.After Sandy Hook, which also involved a Bushmaster rifle, several public pension funds that had money invested in Cerberus called on it to sell the company. Cerberus publicly pledged to sell, but after an unsuccessful auction, decided to maintain ownership while allowing investors to sell their stakes. Last spring, it bought out investors like the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, but maintained ownership of the company. Privately, the firm told investors it would be unfair to sell the company at a huge loss for investors who didn\u2019t have a problem with owning a gun maker.Now, Stop Handgun Violence has urged Americans to boycott all companies owned by Cerberus, including Shaw\u2019s, Star Market, Safeway, Osco Drug and Steward Health Care. It\u2019s unclear how widespread the boycott will be or whether it will influence Cerberus\u2019s control of Remington Outdoor.A spokesman for Cerberus declined to comment. In 2013, after Sandy Hook, the firm made clear in a statement that it did not want to get involved in social or political issues. Instead, it saw its job as trying to make money for its investors.\u201cAs a firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,\u201d it said. \u201cOur role is to make investments on behalf of our clients.\u201d It added: \u201cIt is not our role to take positions or attempt to shape or influence the gun policy debate.\u201dThat stance is often the default position on Wall Street. It shouldn\u2019t be.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about investors\u2019 efforts to divest their portfolios of gun manufacturers, misstated the nature of the business of the Olin Corporation. The company makes ammunition; it is not a gun manufacturer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Markets Were Flat in 2015. Thank Goodness.", "Date": "2015-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking StockName a financial asset \u2014 any financial asset. How did it do in 2015?The answer, in all likelihood: Meh.It might have made a little money. It might have lost a little money. But, barring any drastic moves in the final trading days of 2015, the most widely held classes of assets, including stocks and bonds across the globe, were basically flat. In the United States, for example, a whopping 1.98 percent return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s stock index (including reinvested dividends) as of the Dec. 28 closing price was roughly matched by a 1.07 percent return on intermediate-term Treasury bonds.While that may be disappointing news for people who hoped to see big returns from at least some portion of their portfolio, it is excellent news for anyone who wants to see a steady global economic expansion without new bubbles and all the volatility that can bring.Emerging market stocks and high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds were the exception \u2014 they experienced an outright correction \u2014 and are interesting in their own way. But for all the economic and financial developments in 2015 \u2014 the onset of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, a long-awaited interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, an economic slowdown in China and a sharp drop in the stock markets in August \u2014 the most widely held investments are ending the year at peace.One way of thinking of what happened in 2015 goes like this: From the spring of 2009 until 2014, a furious rally in virtually all assets proceeded with only a few interruptions because it was spurred along by interventions by global central banks.Part of the explicit point of the Federal Reserve buying up $3.5 trillion in bonds over that five-year period \u2014 essentially taking the supply of safe assets like Treasury bonds off the market \u2014 was to encourage investors to push money into other, riskier assets.Those actions succeeded in encouraging investors to tolerate less compensation for taking on risk. That is, their actions drove up stock market prices much faster than the underlying earnings of the companies were rising. In the fall of 2011, $1,000 invested in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 bought $78 in annual earnings. Now, the same $1,000 buys $54 in earnings.The efforts by the central banks succeeded at getting investors comfortable with taking risks again. But they haven\u2019t succeeded in getting a full-throated economic expansion going. Growth has remained in the 2.5 percent ballpark in the United States and slower than that in Europe and Japan.Any future gains for stocks will happen because the economy is growing and companies are thereby making more money, not just because investors have been persuaded to accept ever-lower returns for taking on investment risk.What does this mean for 2016? Whether investors in the stock market and other risky investments win or lose depends less than in recent years on what happens at the Federal Reserve in Washington or the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Future returns will depend on whether 2016 is finally the year that all that interventionism starts to translate into higher incomes, more spending and greater profits in the real economy, not just the financial one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina\u2019s New President Moves Swiftly to Shake Up the Economy ", "Date": "2015-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut now, just three weeks into his four-year term, Mr. Macri\u2019s sweeping economic changes are roiling Argentina, accentuating the divide he wanted to bridge and leading some Argentines to doubt whether he will be a change for the better.\u201cThey voted for him to get the government out, but they didn\u2019t think about what was going to come,\u201d said Dami\u00e1n Raspa, 36, a machine worker at an electronics factory from La Matanza, a working-class district of greater Buenos Aires where Mr. Macri lost heavily to his main rival in the election, Daniel Scioli. The devaluation and a slashing of export taxes favored influential farmers on Argentina\u2019s Pampas lowlands who had speculated about such moves by hoarding their grain harvests. They struck an agreement with Mr. Macri\u2019s government to immediately sell billions of dollars of grain stocks, like soy, to ease the shortage of funds at the Central Bank.But while these agricultural exports are now more profitable for the farmers, for people like Mr. Raspa, the devaluation is eroding their salaries and fueling price increases as imports become more expensive.In his first days in office, Mr. Macri has made quick-fire, market-oriented changes meant to reinvigorate the economy after sluggish business investment and growth in recent years.In contrast, his predecessor, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who had bruising clashes with the farmers, preferred driving demand through policies like energy subsidies for consumers.Many Argentines welcome the changes. Daniel \u00c1lvarez, 57, who works at a hardware store in La Matanza, said that under the Kirchner administration, precarious Central Bank foreign reserves were being hemorrhaged to shore up the peso. \u201cThey didn\u2019t leave a buck,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez said. \u201cBoth Macri and Scioli were going to devalue. There was no other option to get dollars in. Yes, it directly favors the farmers, but the idea is that indirectly it favors us.\u201dBut in the short term, there is the danger of fueling inflation, which is already about 25 percent, according to unofficial estimates frequently used because the national statistics institute\u2019s figures have not been trustworthy. In turn, if real wages do not keep up, battles could break out between the government and powerful trade union leaders. Political and social organizations are already panicked about Mr. Macri\u2019s moves.Eduardo Levy Yeyati, an economics professor at Torcuato di Tella University here and a visiting professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said Mr. Macri, who had tiptoed around his plans during the campaign, now faced the hard political task of following through with adjustments even though the economy, boosted by the government\u2019s pre-election spending, improved this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnection between perceptions and the economic reality,\u201d said Professor Levy Yeyati, emphasizing the unsustainability of a large budget deficit and an overvalued currency. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to explain these things to the public when they feel like they\u2019re doing O.K.\u201dMr. Macri must also tread carefully, analysts said, because of his small margin of victory in the election. A decision to temporarily appoint Supreme Court judges by decree, bypassing Congress during its summer recess, was criticized as an overreach of executive power. This, together with moves viewed as steps toward the dismantling of a media law that is strongly endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters, has left him less room for unpopular measures.Mr. Macri has already moved to cool the simmering economic tensions, keeping Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s price control programs in place for now and offering a small one-time payment to around eight million recipients of state pensions or child benefits.Still, repercussions are already being felt. \u201cIt\u2019s the workers who always pay for these crises,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Lemos, 54, who manages a downtown paint store, as he clicked through an online price list showing that the price of some products had risen by 25 percent overnight. \u201cSales are going to drop.\u201d Similarly, Sergio Camerucci, 52, who manufactures trophies and sells them to sports leagues, said the price of the plastic he needed to make the trophy bases rose by 20 percent after the devaluation.Most economists expect the devaluation \u2014 and the accompanying raising of interest rates to anchor the peso \u2014 to result in anemic growth or a recession in 2016 before a rebound in 2017, with perhaps growth of 3.5 percent, according to Sebasti\u00e1n Vargas and Pilar Tavella, Barclays economists in New York. This year, growth will be 0.4 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund; other economists predict it will be higher.Supporters of Mr. Macri seem to understand this progression. \u201cThe last 12 years were terrible,\u201d Mr. Camerucci said of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political movement, pointing to his falling sales over the last three years and the import restrictions, which made it difficult to buy the machinery he needed. \u201cWe have to be patient, but we are on a good path.\u201dDaniel Scatilazzi, 44, who was selling homemade pies and sandwiches from a stall, said he would suffer as prices jumped but understood Mr. Macri\u2019s motives. \u201cI\u2019ll put up with it,\u201d said Mr. Scatilazzi, a former supporter of Mrs. Kirchner who voted for Mr. Macri because he wanted change. \u201cWe have to give him time to work.

{"Headline": "Foreign Investors Tiptoe Through Minefield of Greek Banking System", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Over the last six months, Greece has provided both highs and lows for foreign investors.A few brave hedge funds have cashed in because of the stellar returns they have earned from Greek government bonds, which since Greece signed its bailout deal in August have been among the world\u2019s best performing investments.But those who bet heavily on Greek banks \u2014 like John Paulson, David Einhorn and Wilbur Ross \u2014 have had their investments evaporate after the recent recapitalization of the Greek financial sector.In recent years, investing in Greece has always been a bit of an all-or-nothing affair as the lure of sky-high returns has always been tempered by the very real prospect that you might lose your shirt.And so it was last week when a group of prominent investors came here to gauge whether, in the wake of Greece\u2019s close brush with leaving the euro last summer, it was safe to invest in Greek assets again.But at an investor conference here, the main concern was less about what technical reform the government was passing or what was going on with Greece\u2019s debt, but whether Greece, and Europe for that matter, could regain the trust of global financial community.\u201cWe have become too obsessed with structural reforms and debt in Greece,\u201d said Chetan Gulati, who oversees European investments out of London for Perry Capital.An $8 billion hedge fund based in New York, Perry, along with funds like Japonica Partners, Greylock Capital and the French funds H20 and Carmignac, have made a mint from their Greek bond investments as yields have fallen to 8 percent from 14 percent since August. (Bond yields move in the opposite direction from their prices.)While many of these investors may be happy with such a payoff, they know how fleeting such gains can be if another political crisis engulfs Greece.\u201cWhat investors are looking for today is a return of the stability, confidence and trust that has been destroyed over the past six months,\u201d Mr. Gulati said, his voice rising as he addressed the conference participants.That means the government has to make clear that the last six months have been a mistake, he said; the Greek opposition must support the government if it does the right thing; and finally, he, concluded, Europe has to let it be known that Greece is part of the club \u2014 because right now it is not.Mr. Gulati\u2019s cri de coeur struck a chord, prompting robust applause from an audience that, for most of this two-day investor conference, had been unresponsive. And it summed up the conflicted feelings of foreign investors in terms of how they should approach Greece these days.Enticing prospects of high-yielding government bonds and hugely discounted Greek bank stocks have lured a procession of investors to Athens in recent months. At the same time, however, the looming risks of jittery politics and a mountain of nonperforming loans have kept most investors on the sidelines.Perhaps the most powerful sign that investors may be willing to give Greece the benefit of the doubt, at least for a while longer, is that just about all the funds that took big losses in Greek bank stocks have not washed their hands of Greece, as one might expect.Instead, Greek bankers here say that these investors chose to participate in the latest fund offering, enticed no doubt by discounts of as much as 70 percent of the company\u2019s total value. (The previous recapitalization in 2012 offered investors a 30 percent discount.)European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.Such giveaway prices, however, were not enough to attract more conservative long-term investors. Of the foreigners that did participate, most were hedge funds with a high tolerance for risk, bankers said.Greece\u2019s two largest banks, for example, Piraeus and National Bank of Greece, were not able to attract enough interest from overseas, and as a result they had to scramble at the last minute to tap domestic sources. They also were forced to accept cash from Greece\u2019s semiofficial bank oversight fund, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund.At the forefront of investor worries is the willingness of the nation\u2019s left-leaning prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to deliver on the painful reforms he promised creditors in the summer. And while the government has pushed through a slate of tough measures, the most politically explosive of them all, cutting pensions, remains unresolved.\u201cWe are a bit behind schedule \u2014 there have been delays in the decision-making process,\u201d said Declan Costello, the representative at the European Commission overseeing Greece. \u201cWe would also like to see a more positive business and investment agenda.\u201dAs for the banks, which are sitting on nonperforming loans of 107 billion euros, it could be said they are cheap for very good reason.Mr. Karagiannis says that the only way Greek banks can start making loans again is to allow outside investors to buy some of the nonperforming loans that the banks are holding \u2014 which in cases like Piraeus Bank is close to half the existing book of loans.But experts say that antiquated bankruptcy laws and fears of vulture investors pushing Greeks out of their homes and taking over companies pose a hurdle for outside investors looking to replicate their successes in more open markets like Ireland and Spain.Bank executives also say that they would be reluctant to sell their bank loans at bargain basement prices that distressed investors are demanding.\u201cAt some point we may do this, but why should we sell at these prices?\u201d said Spyridon Papaspyrou, a senior executive at Piraeus Bank, the largest lender in Greece.Mr. Papaspyrou says that Piraeus has set up a small \u201cbad bank\u201d with 2,600 people combing through 31 billion euros in bad loans in an effort to see which borrowers can pay but are choosing not to \u2014 and thus can be taken to court \u2014 and those who are just unable to make their payments.But he and all Greek bankers agree that their biggest challenge is regaining the trust and confidence of the millions of Greek savers who withdrew about 40 billion euros from the Greek banking system this year. The vast majority of these funds, economists here say, is stuffed in bureau drawers, under mattresses or locked away in personal safes.If this vast trove of liquidity returns to the banking system, the banks will then be able to wean themselves off expensive short-term loans from the European Central Bank and return to their core business of making loans.It will not be easy. With two scares in three years over leaving the euro, Greek depositors are understandably gun shy about keeping their hard-earned savings in their banks. And with capital controls limiting the amount of cash they can withdraw, there is little incentive for nervous savers to return to the Greek banking system.For the moment then, for everyday Greeks as well as foreign investors, more needs to be done before they can put their full faith in Greek institutions.\u201cFor all this money to return from under the mattresses there needs to be a new climate of trust,\u201d said Aristides Xenofos, the chief executive of the fund overseeing the Greek banking sector. \u201cThis is what is critical.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Why pay for the privilege of parking money at a bank if you could instead withdraw cash, put it under your mattress and avoid the charge entirely?Economists have argued in the past that the only way to make significantly negative interest rates possible would be to eliminate cash money entirely, or else anytime rates fall below zero there could be mass withdrawals from the banking system (and mass purchases of safes, lockboxes and very secure mattresses).The Federal Reserve in the United States and Bank of England have kept their target rates above zero all along, partly out of fear that cutting lower would disrupt money markets in a way such that the costs wouldn\u2019t be worth the marginal impact on economic stimulus.The question all along has been this: Is there some tipping point at which negative rates would create mass withdrawals from the banking system?Well, maybe. But we aren\u2019t there yet.One way to think of what is happening right now is as a grand experiment of \u201chow low can they go.\u201d Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, pointedly avoided answering questions at his news conference Thursday about whether the central bank had now arrived at its true lower bound, insisting only that the new negative 0.3 percent rate was appropriate right now. In other words, further cutting hasn\u2019t been ruled out.The flaw in the old concept of the \u201czero lower bound\u201d seems to have been this: There are a lot of benefits to keeping money in a bank besides the interest you earn. If you keep $10,000 in savings in a bank, and the bank gets robbed, you\u2019re unaffected; the bank is on the hook for the losses. If you keep it in your freezer, theft is your problem. The peace of mind of having your $10,000 in a federally insured bank account and the ability to write a check to make a purchase or wire money to a family member are valuable. More valuable, it seems likely, than the $30 in annual costs that would apply if the Fed put in place the E.C.B.\u2019s new negative 0.3 percent rate.The experience in Europe over the last year \u2014 really the absence of some catastrophe with negative rates \u2014 helps explain why one Fed official argued at the central bank\u2019s September meeting that American interest rates should also be slightly negative. (The official is unnamed in official projections, but Fed watchers believe it is Narayana Kocherlakota, the Minneapolis Fed president.)What we\u2019re learning from Europe about negative rates and the nonexistence of the zero lower bound is an exemplar for a lot of monetary experimentation over the last six years. Tools that existed as academic thought experiments a decade ago are now becoming standard-issue parts of the central banks\u2019 policy tool kit. Strategies tried briefly by small countries like Denmark are embraced by the giants of the world economy.In other words, we know a lot more now than we did a decade ago about what works in extreme monetary situations. It\u2019s just too bad we had to learn these lessons the hard way \u2014 through years upon years of trial and error, with lots of economic suffering along the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Junk Bond Fund That Barred Investors Reaches S.E.C. Deal", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThird Avenue Management reached an agreement with its regulator on Wednesday over its abrupt move last week to bar investors in a stricken bond fund from taking their money out.The fund\u2019s portfolio is made up of hard-to-sell corporate bonds either in bankruptcy or emerging from it, making it impossible for portfolio managers to meet mounting redemption demands.As a result of the agreement, the remaining assets of the Focused Credit Fund will be transferred from a liquidating trust back into the original mutual fund structure. This will allow remaining investors to track the fund\u2019s value on a daily basis via its ticker, TFCVX.But the move is not expected to hasten the return of investor assets, which company officials said could take a year or more.A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. said that the agency \u201crequired the fund to put in place investor and market protections, including ongoing commission oversight and provisions involving an orderly and fair process as a condition of its approval of the order.\u201dThird Avenue\u2019s general counsel, W. James Hall, said that he did not think there would be any additional delay in investors in the fund getting repaid.The after-the-fact agreement between the S.E.C. and Third Avenue underscores how fast events were moving last week. While the investment firm had been in communication with Washington before the shutdown, Third Avenue felt that it did not have the time to wait for official approval, people briefed on the discussions said.In its filing, Third Avenue said that its credit fund had experienced $1.1 billion in redemptions this year through Dec. 9. That figure was almost one and a half times the fund\u2019s remaining assets of $788 million on that date.In November alone, the company said, redemptions totaled $317 million \u2014 quite a sum for a fund where a sizable chunk of its securities do not even trade.By early December, the fund had raised $200 million in cash to meet investor requests, the filing said. The remains of this cash position were being distributed to investors on Wednesday, Third Avenue said.The filing provided additional details explaining Third Avenue\u2019s unorthodox strategy. The board overseeing the fund, which is led by Third Avenue\u2019s founder, Martin J. Whitman, had a call with management on Nov. 30 and was informed of the difficulties the fund was having in satisfying sales requests.On Dec. 9, the board unanimously agreed to move the securities into a liquidating trust, to keep sales from pushing bond prices down even further.According to the filing, regulators \u201cexpressed concerns\u201d over the move, no doubt fearful of the precedent that Third Avenue was setting, and the prospect that it could cause runs on other bond funds.Complaints and queries also came in large numbers from investors. In its filing, Third Avenue said that after moving the securities into a trust, it asked the S.E.C. for so-called exemptive relief, which would allow assets to be returned to the fund but keep investors from removing them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Junk Bond Rout That Wasn\u2019t", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBut after a few tremors this week, the market for junk bonds (more politely referred to as high-yield debt) stabilized. In recent years, this market has been red hot as investors desperate for higher returns in their bond portfolios piled in.In the wake of Third Avenue\u2019s implosion, no other mutual funds collapsed, and junk bond exchange-traded funds \u2014 a particular target of Mr. Icahn\u2019s warnings \u2014 handled record volume without any glitch. As investors breathed sighs of relief, stock markets around the globe staged modest recoveries.It\u2019s too soon to say the worst is over for investors, or even that the junk bond crisis is over. It took over a year for the earliest signs of serious problems in the mortgage bond market to metastasize into the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a full-blown financial crisis.But in conversations this week with a wide range of investors, Wall Street executives, and economists, no one told me they thought that the Third Avenue fund\u2019s liquidation was likely to set off another crisis. And while bubbles may yet emerge, by their very nature they\u2019re likely to be found somewhere entirely unexpected \u2014 not a closely watched, highly liquid market like the $1.3 trillion United States junk bond market.\u201cThe Third Avenue situation is unique,\u201d said Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, who has been in frequent contact with clients throughout the week. \u201cThey owned really low-credit-rated products compared to the typical high-yield fund. The long-term impact of rising rates remains a big question mark. But no one thinks that the collapse of Third Avenue is going to contaminate the world.\u201dIn part that\u2019s because today\u2019s junk bond market \u2014 and the institutions that invest in it \u2014 lack two important ingredients of past crises: high leverage (heavy borrowing to finance the purchase of assets) and concentrated bets. While Third Avenue\u2019s portfolio was concentrated in thinly traded, obscure bonds, it had no leverage. Its failure didn\u2019t put any lender in peril, the way the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to crises at A.I.G. and throughout Wall Street.And most junk bond funds, including the two largest high-yield E.T.F.s, also have no leverage and are highly diversified, with hundreds of securities across all industries. Goldman said this week in a note to clients that outside the battered energy sector, \u201cbanks are still upbeat about credit quality.\u201dMark Wiedman, global head of the iShares E.T.F. business at BlackRock, said that the characteristics of E.T.F.s made them far safer than owning individual junk bonds. \u201cThe vast majority of E.T.F.s, including all of ours, are unlevered, passive vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re boring.\u201dUnlike mutual funds, which may need to sell underlying fund positions to meet shareholder redemptions, E.T.F. shares trade like stocks. Last Friday, Blackrock\u2019s flagship junk bond E.T.F., the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond E.T.F., experienced a surge in trading \u2014 $4.3 billion, four times the record daily volume before that week. (On an average day the fund trades about $700 million worth of shares.) On Monday trading hit $3 billion.Yet \u201cthere were zero snafus,\u201d Mr. Wiedman said. \u201cThe trading added liquidity. I keep wondering how many stress tests we have to pass.\u201dMr. Wiedman dismissed comparisons of Third Avenue to Long Term Capital Management, which had to be bailed out in 1998, igniting market turmoil. \u201cLTCM was too big and too levered,\u201d he said. \u201cThird Avenue was small and unlevered. They shut the fund, so there was no forced selling. You can make the case they shouldn\u2019t have been holding so many illiquid assets while offering daily liquidity, but in that regard they were an extreme outlier. This doesn\u2019t reflect any massive problem.\u201dHoward Marks, co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, the world\u2019s biggest distressed-debt investor, has also long been warning about excess in the markets. But he agreed that the Third Avenue fund was an outlier. \u201cWhen you have a fund promising daily liquidity, which owns things that don\u2019t trade and don\u2019t price, you\u2019ve got the ingredients for a meltdown,\u201d Mr. Marks said. \u201cBut that means it\u2019s a function of one fund\u2019s management, not a weakness of a whole asset class. I\u2019d be very surprised if it leads to any kind of cataclysm.\u201dNot all financial crises involve high leverage. The Reserve Fund, the money market mutual fund that \u201cbroke the buck\u201d after Lehman Brothers collapsed, had no leverage. But its shares, designed to trade at a constant $1 and be the equivalent of cash, fell below $1 because its assets included Lehman debt, which plunged in value.\u201cReserve breaking the buck was a huge systemic shock,\u201d said Alan Blinder, professor of economics and public policy at Princeton, and author of \u201cAfter the Music Stopped,\u201d an analysis of the financial crisis. \u201cEvents might prove me wrong, but I doubt the analogy holds\u201d with Third Avenue.\u201cThird Avenue investors knew they were living in a high-return/high-risk world,\u201d Mr. Blinder said. \u201cInvestors in the Reserve Fund thought they were living in a low-return/low- or zero-risk world. So I don\u2019t see Third Avenue as a big shock to the system.\u201dSome investors saw in last week\u2019s junk bond turmoil not the makings of another crisis, but a buying opportunity. Douglas Kass of Seabreeze Partners, a money manager known for his bearish views, said he\u2019s been buying junk bond funds, even ones that use some borrowed money.Third Avenue\u2019s problem was a \u201cliquidity event, not a fundamental event like the other crises,\u201d he said. \u201cI totally reject Carl Icahn\u2019s view that this is a systemic problem. When you see a selling panic like the one that happened last Friday, it usually marks the end of a downturn, not the beginning.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that investors in junk bond and other assets buoyed by years of record-low interest rates won\u2019t lose money. Bond prices drop when interest rates rise, as they have in anticipation of this week\u2019s Fed move, which can hardly be called a surprise.Even so, \u201clots of people may have gone into high-risk credit funds not fully anticipating or understanding the risk,\u201d Mr. Marks said. Last week \u201cwas a wake-up call,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople went from oblivious to risk to obsessed with risk. I\u2019d say it\u2019s an overreaction, but in many ways it\u2019s a healthy correction in response to some warning signs that have been ignored for years.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the surname of an executive at BlackRock.

{"Headline": "Against the Odds, Qihoo Gets Its Buyout", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe biggest take-private of a Chinese company listed in the United States has been finalized despite financing challenges. Tapping retail investors may have helped raise the new equity needed. But others considering similar buyouts may find the journey harder.After a year of stock market volatility in China, raising the funds to take Qihoo, an antivirus and search group, private was no mean feat. Even after securing $3.4 billion in debt to fund the deal, the investor group led by its chief executive, Zhou Hongyi, still had to raise $5.9 billion in new equity.In June, when the management buyout offer was first announced, mainland stocks were hitting seven-year highs. Sourcing billions in funds to take foreign-listed companies private, with the idea of relisting them on China\u2019s own stock market, seemed much more straightforward. Since then, the Shanghai benchmark index has fallen 30 percent and regulators have only just loosened a ban on new listings.Mr. Zhou and his consortium, which includes Ping An Insurance and Sequoia Capital China, probably got much-needed help from China\u2019s retail investors. Wealth management products linked to Qihoo\u2019s privatization were being advertised on the country\u2019s most popular chat app. One, reviewed by Reuters Breakingviews, offered prospective investors returns of up to five times.For the two dozen or so United States-listed companies that have announced take-private plans, repeating Qihoo\u2019s financing feat may not be as simple. Although a big deal, it\u2019s also a big name, and it has the scale to attract investors even when the market is weak. As for the 20-plus peers waiting to follow Qihoo back home, they may not have the heft to defy such odds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Junk Bond Fund Will Liquidate, and Reimburse Investors Slowly", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move, announced Thursday by Third Avenue Management funds, was a troubling sign of the recent deterioration in junk bonds, a category that has been hurt in particular by the debt of energy companies struggling with the slump in oil and gas prices. Energy debt accounts for roughly a sixth of the market. More important, the action by Third Avenue highlights a longstanding fear among regulators and economists that too many investors have piled into risky areas of the bond market, like leveraged loans and emerging-market debt, as well as junk bonds.As funds in these areas have grown in size, the ability of portfolio managers to buy and sell these securities in a reasonable amount of time has been curtailed as investment banks have stopped making a market in these areas because of regulatory constraints.This is what apparently happened to Third Avenue\u2019s Focused Credit Fund, which not long ago was about $2.5 billion in size and had recently shrunk to $788 million as investors rushed to redeem their shares because of weakness in the junk bond market.High-yield bonds have had some of the worst returns among bonds this year. A benchmark Merrill Lynch index is down 3.7 percent for the year and a basket of higher-risk junk bonds has lost 13 percent.Trouble in the junk bond market can be a harbinger of tougher times to come in terms of the broader economy.With no sign that selling pressures were abating, Third Avenue, which manages a total of $8 billion in customer assets, has decided to stop fulfilling investor sell orders and liquidate the fund.The remaining assets in the fund will be put into a liquidating trust and sold off gradually, the company said, the idea being to not drive down prices too sharply. This process could last more than a year, which means current investors in the fund may have to wait at least that long to get their money back.In a statement explaining the decision, Third Avenue\u2019s chief executive, David M. Barse, said that investor requests for redemptions, along with a \u201cgeneral reduction of liquidity in the fixed-income markets\u201d made it impracticable for the fund to \u201ccreate sufficient cash to pay anticipated redemptions without resorting to sales at prices that would unfairly disadvantage the remaining shareholders.\u201dThe interest rates on junk bonds, riskier bonds that companies with higher debt loads are able to sell to yield-hungry investors, have spiked over the past month in the face of concerns that a slowing economy would push many of these companies into default.\u201cThis confirms many of the fears we have had about high levels of corporate debt and the lack of liquidity in the marketplace,\u201d said Hung Tran, a senior executive at the Institute of International Finance, which has been warning about this issue. \u201cIt should also be seen as a powerful motivation for mutual funds to review their liquidity management strategies.\u201dWhat is surprising about the fund\u2019s failure, analysts say, is that it had not taken more precautions to have cash on hand in case this type of situation arose. Of late, many funds investing in these less-than-liquid niches of the market have increased cash levels and even taken out credit lines from banks in order to be prepared for a selling wave.Third Avenue, founded in 1986 by Martin J. Whitman, a vocal proponent of investing in value stocks, seems to have been caught short in this regard.In addition to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade like securities on an exchange and track a wide array of bond, equity and commodity baskets, have drawn many billions of dollars into their junk bond funds.To date though, these funds \u2014 which promise instant liquidity to investors \u2014 have not experienced major problems despite a tremendous pickup in buying and selling activity.By definition, a high-yield fund will invest in companies that are more at risk of going bust than a fund that buys the bonds of blue-chip companies like General Electric or JPMorgan Chase. But the Third Avenue fund seemed to have a particularly large share of companies that were either bankrupt or on the verge.Among its top holdings were Clear Channel Communications, the highly indebted radio broadcaster; Energy Future Holdings, a Texas electricity provider now in bankruptcy; and Liberty Tire Recycling, which is in talks to restructure its debts.But while the yields on these securities may have been appealing, their liquidity was not.Even in good times, these types of securities are hard to buy and sell, meaning a seller has to search out a buyer before he can dispose of his position.Before the financial crisis, large investment banks were the primary market-makers of these kinds of securities. Since 2009, however, they have slashed their inventories of corporate debt to $1.5 trillion from $9 trillion.At the same time, there has been an explosion of bonds issued by companies, with the result being more bonds than ever in issuance and an increasingly limited number of firms to trade them.Explaining why the investor panic in this area was appealing, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than people running out of a building with their hair on fire.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Drug C.E.O. Martin Shkreli Arrested on Fraud Charges", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Shkreli said he was confident that he would be cleared of all charges.Those price increases combined with Mr. Shkreli\u2019s jeering response to his critics has made him a lightning rod for public outrage and fodder for the presidential campaign. His company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, and others, like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, have come under fire from lawmakers and consumers for profiting from steep price increases for old drugs.Still, for many of his critics, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s arrest was a comeuppance for the brash executive who has seemed to enjoy \u2014 relish, even \u2014 his public notoriety. On Thursday, a satirical New Yorker column by the humorist Andy Borowitz said Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyers had informed their client their hourly legal fees had increased by 5,000 percent.\u201cPersonally, I think Martin Shkreli has become wealthy at the expense of the public good. I don\u2019t believe for a second that his manipulation of drug prices fuels valuable research as he has claimed,\u201d said Katie Uva, a 2006 alumna of Hunter College High School in Manhattan where Mr. Shkreli attended, in an email response to questions. This fall, Ms. Uva started an online fund-raising campaign to match a $1 million donation from Mr. Shkreli to Hunter in the hope of persuading the school to return the donation. So far, the campaign has raised about $800 from 16 donors.Mr. Shkreli (pronounced SHKRELL-ee) could have been a quintessential archetype for the immigrant\u2019s dream of American success. He grew up in a crowded apartment on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, the son of Albanian immigrants who worked janitorial and other side jobs to support him and his three siblings.Mr. Shkreli was admitted into Hunter, an elite Manhattan public school for the intellectually gifted. On Thursday, two former classmates remembered Mr. Shkreli as a somewhat shy person who could often be found lingering in the school\u2019s hallways, playing chess, his guitar or looking at stocks in the newspaper.But he stopped attending classes and was asked to leave before his senior year. He received the credits needed for his high school diploma through a program that introduced him to Wall Street, placing him at an internship at the Wall Street hedge fund Cramer, Berkowitz & Company.Eventually, Mr. Shkreli opened his own hedge fund \u2014 Elea Capital. It didn\u2019t last long, collapsing in 2007 on a big bet he made that went against him. Undeterred, in 2009, he started his second hedge fund, MSMB Capital, the initials of Mr. Shkreli and his partner, Marek Biestek, whom he met while attending Baruch College.Like Elea, MSMB\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t nearly as hot as Mr. Shkreli let on. From 2009 through 2012, Mr. Shkreli lost millions of dollars trading in the market, according to the accusations contained in the indictment. But he hid those losses, telling investors instead that the funds had strong double-digit returns.In 2011, Mr. Shkreli started Retrophin, which quickly adopted a controversial business strategy, acquiring old, neglected drugs used for rare diseases and quickly raising their prices.The investigation is related to Martin Shkreli's time as a hedge fund manager and running the biopharmaceutical company Retrophin.Soon, however, Mr. Shkreli was making a plan to use Retrophin assets to pay off MSMB investors. When seven MSMB investors threatened to sue in 2013, Mr. Shkreli and Evan Greebel, the lead outside counsel for Retrophin, used $3.4 million in Retrophin funds and stock to settle the investors\u2019 claims, even though Retrophin had no responsibility, the indictment says.Mr. Greebel was also arrested on Thursday and charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.Later, when Retrophin\u2019s auditor raised questions about the settlements, Mr. Shkreli and Mr. Greebel created fraudulent consulting agreements for the investors, thinking they could pay the money back without upsetting the auditor, the indictment states. From September 2013 to March 2014, they created fake consulting agreements for four investors, paying $7.6 million in cash and stock. Retrophin\u2019s board did not approve of the consulting agreements, the indictment says.In 2014, Retrophin ousted Mr. Shkreli as its chief executive. A lawsuit filed this summer by the company mirrors many of the same accusations contained in the federal charges.Once again, Mr. Shkreli didn\u2019t let failure slow him down. In August of this year, he raised $90 million in a first round of financing for Turing, his new biopharmaceutical company.One of his first moves was to pay $55 million for the American marketing rights for Daraprim, a 62-year-old drug for toxoplasmosis and immediately increase the price by 5,000 percent. The jump brought the cost of a course of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars.Congressional committees and politicians denounced his move, but Republicans and Democrats have been split on how far to pursue further regulation of the drug industry or its practices.News of his arrest prompted Representative Elijah Cummings, a leading Democrat on the House Oversight panel, to release this statement: \u201cMr. Shkreli has lined his own pockets at the expense of patients who desperately need their medications, and he should be ashamed of himself.\u201dDespite the public outcry, Mr. Shkreli neither reversed his decision nor showed any regret in the numerous interviews he has conducted with the media in recent weeks.Instead, he threw gasoline on the fire. After leading an investor group to take control of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, a failing California biotechnology company, Mr. Shkreli agreed to license the worldwide rights and said he would immediately elevate the price of a drug used to treat Chagas\u2019 disease, a potentially deadly parasitic infection.And then there are the bizarre, hourslong live streams, including a conversation he had on Monday with a girl who identified herself as a student at Hunter.Mr. Shkreli told her that he was planning to dominate the rap industry, have Hunter renamed for himself and bail a rapper out of jail.When the girl asked if he would attend a school dance with her, he demurred, adding, \u201cI am blushing though.\u201dMr. Shkreli\u2019s antics have not gone unnoticed by federal law enforcement officials.When asked on Thursday if agents had seized the rare Wu-Tang Clan album that Mr. Shkreli reportedly bought, Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney, was coy.\u201cI wondered how long it was going to take to get to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of where he got the funds that he raised to buy the Wu-Tang Clan album.\u201dMatthew Goldstein and David Chen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A manufacturer pays on his sales after the cost of parts, and so on.When you add it all up, it\u2019s equivalent to a very broad sales tax on all the goods and services in the economy. Most other advanced countries have a tax like this, with exceptions for favored sectors like education and health care. Mr. Cruz says he would tax everything, which is how he could raise so much money with a rate of 16 percent.But some people misunderstand the horrors of VATs. In particular, they assume a new, large VAT will cause a sharp rise in prices, as businesses simply add the tax onto the price of goods and services. But that would only happen if the Federal Reserve let inflation rise.New taxes may increase the cost of doing business, but overall price levels can only rise if central banks adopt monetary policy that allows them to. You may have noticed that, over the last decade, the United States and other advanced countries had sharply fluctuating fiscal policy, including significant changes in tax rates, but low and stable inflation. That\u2019s because the link between taxes and prices is not automatic.Another way to understand this is to think about the political fights over the sales tax. Retailers often oppose proposals to raise sales taxes. If all of a sales tax were simply passed on to the consumer, why would retailers care about the rate? The answer is that a sales tax is also economically similar to a tax on profits plus payrolls, and the retailers don\u2019t want to face more taxes on profits.That leaves a big question: Would a VAT like Mr. Cruz wants ultimately be paid by consumers, or by workers and business owners, or by some combination?The answer is important, but not quite as important as it would first seem, because all options ultimately describe the same set of people. We are all consumers \u2014 even the owners of businesses \u2014 who have bothered to accumulate wealth because it will make it possible to consume things later. A VAT could be passed entirely onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This would cause consumers\u2019 real incomes to decline by 16 percent. Or, prices could stay the same, and businesses could adjust to the new tax by cutting employees\u2019 wages and taking home less in after-tax profits, also causing their real incomes to decline by 16 percent.While the two options would have similar effects across the whole economy, their effects on individuals would vary, mostly because people already have some wealth they earned before the tax was imposed. If the VAT were to cause a rise in prices, its effects would be that of any other bout of inflation: The value of wealth would decline for owners of debt, whether banks that hold mortgages or retirees with savings in Treasury bonds.On the other hand, the decline in businesses\u2019 after-tax profits as a result of the need to pay VAT would show up as a decline in stock prices. Anyone owning stocks would be hurt. It wouldn\u2019t be quite so bad for them if we also had a bout of inflation, because that would reduce the real amount of corporate debts (companies would have to pay the same number of dollars to settle their existing bonds, but a dollar wouldn\u2019t be worth as much anymore) and that savings would accrue to shareholders.Taxes that are imposed on workers\u2019 wages after they are paid, such as the income tax, need not lead to inflation. These can be allowed to fall on workers, who will simply see their after-tax incomes fall, without disrupting the overall labor market. But higher indirect taxes on workers \u2014 like the employer-paid part of payroll tax or Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposed VAT \u2014 may require an inflation offset. That\u2019s because these taxes reduce the wages that businesses are willing to pay.Employers find it\u2019s hard to cut the nominal wage a worker is paid, because workers tend to get very upset. Of course, that wage \u201cstickiness\u201d is good for the worker who doesn\u2019t face a wage cut, but it also means companies will tend to hire fewer workers. A significant new VAT that did not come with a bout of central bank-driven inflation would cause unemployment to soar.In Mr. Viard\u2019s view, a VAT like the one Mr. Cruz is proposing would probably need to come with a significant, one-time burst of inflation \u2014 but not a full 16 percent. More likely it would require about half that, because Mr. Cruz would repeal the employer-paid part of the payroll tax, partly offsetting those employers\u2019 new VAT bill.So the Cruz plan would indeed probably lead to a significant, one-time rise in the price level of less than 16 percent. The tax would fall partly on consumers, and partly on workers and business owners, who of course are more or less the same people.That assumes the Federal Reserve actually responds to the tax with a labor market stabilizing policy, which is one of its key policy aims. But its other key policy aim is price stability, and as you may have noticed in recent years, the Fed has been perhaps overly obsessed with this latter aim, failing to hit even its own modest targets for inflation despite labor market weakness.Given that track record, the Fed will not be eager to allow a one-time, high-single-digit rise in prices, even if a change in tax policy made such a rise really useful. If the Fed held prices down despite firms\u2019 desire to cut wages, adopting the VAT could cause a sharp bout of unemployment and a recession.All that disruption is a crucial reason it would be very challenging to shift the United States to a VAT-based tax system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Funds Struggle With Steep Losses and High Expectations", "Date": "2015-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen David Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital, plays host to his investors at the American Museum of Natural History in January, his guests will sip cocktails and dine under a 94-foot blue whale in the Milstein Hall.William A. Ackman will hold court one week later, at the New York Public Library at Bryant Park, where investors in his Pershing Square Capital Management will mingle in the historic halls of marble, wood and gold.The lavish settings will be the same as in years past, but the circumstances will be strikingly different: Both billionaire hedge fund managers, and many of their peers, will be under pressure to explain to their investors how they lost so much money this year.As the final performance figures for the industry come in, one thing is clear: 2015 could not have ended soon enough for many managers and their investors. Hedge fund managers like Mr. Einhorn, Mr. Ackman and Larry Robbins have stunned investors with the depth of their losses \u2014 in the double digits for some of their investment portfolios through early December.Pressure from investors to perform better will be intense for hedge fund managers heading into 2016. Few bank analysts expect stocks to perform much better next year than they did this year, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was set to end the year largely unchanged from where it began trading. The prospect that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates \u2014 a step it took in December for the first time in nearly a decade \u2014 may also weigh on the markets and complicate the odds of a strong bounce-back in the new year.Steep losses this year come at a difficult time for the nearly $3 trillion industry; some pension funds have openly questioned what value hedge funds add to a portfolio in light of their hefty fee structure. Hedge funds typically charge 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of performance, which means that managers can still haul home multimillion-dollar paydays even when they lose money for their investors.Hedge funds were hurt, in part, because they piled into many of the same companies \u2014 often known as \u201chedge fund hotels\u201d because of their popularity among hedge fund managers \u2014 that suffered sharp declines in shares later in the year. Among them were SunEdison, Williams Companies, Cheniere Energy and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which drew negative publicity for steep increases in some drug prices.Any hedge fund that went into 2015 bullish on energy stocks was hurt; oil is now trading below $40 a barrel.Other losses were set off by a domino effect of macroeconomic events \u2014 including surprise currency moves by central banks in China, Switzerland and elsewhere, as well as plunging oil prices, the collapse of commodity prices and turmoil in emerging markets.For many firms, it was a whipsaw year, where strong gains were made in the first half of 2015 only to be reversed over the last six months. Investors in Mr. Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square will be familiar with the queasy feeling those wild swings produce. A year ago, Pershing Square posted one of its best years, generating a nearly 40 percent return. As late as the first week of August, the firm\u2019s main fund was up about 11 percent for the year. Since then, it has been on a downward trajectory, and big, concentrated bets on Valeant and Platform Specialty Products have tumbled.As of Dec. 22, Pershing Square\u2019s main public portfolio was down 19.5 percent for the year.Other big losers in 2015 include Mr. Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital, which is down 20 percent, and Mr. Robbins\u2019s Glenview Capital Management, which has lost 17 percent. The performance figures, through the end of November, were included in an HSBC report. And John A. Paulson, who made billions and a name for himself betting against the housing bubble, lost investors\u2019 money in three funds through October.Even with the dismal numbers, there were some rising stars. The average hedge fund, as measured by the Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, was up less than 1 percent. A small group outperformed against the backdrop of a disappointing year in equity and bond markets, with the S.&.P 500 down slightly heading into the final days of 2015.Gabriel Plotkin, a former SAC Capital Advisors manager, and his hedge fund Melvin Capital was the industry outlier. Melvin Capital, a stock-focused hedge fund that started last year, had gained almost 40 percent by the middle of November, according to a person briefed on the fund\u2019s performance who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Plotkin was one of the top consumer stock traders at SAC Capital Advisors, the former hedge fund founded by Steven A. Cohen.Other notable hedge funds that look poised to make the top performing list this year include Israel Englander\u2019s Millennium Management, which gained 11 percent through November, and Sahm Adrangi\u2019s Kerrisdale Capital, which was up 18 percent in the same period, said people briefed on those firms\u2019 performance numbers. Renaissance Technologies, founded by James H. Simons, and its two main funds were up more than 16 percent, according to a person with knowledge of the performance who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A broad swath of firms also posted more modest gains in 2015, including Aaron Cowen\u2019s Suvretta Capital Management, which was up 7 percent at the end of November, and Saba Capital Management, founded by Boaz Weinstein, which gained 6 percent through mid-December, according to people knowledgeable about those firms\u2019 numbers.Although most of the attention has been on the losers of 2015, it was not just poor performance that plagued the industry. The year also included a number of prominent closures and redemptions at some brand-name firms. And the pace quickened over the third quarter.Three major investment firms \u2014 Bain Capital, Fortress Investment Group and BlackRock \u2014 were all forced to shut down hedge funds. Michael Platt also chose to throw in the towel at BlueCrest Capital Management as investor demands grew.Still, the overall number of hedge fund closures this year is running below last year\u2019s total of 731, according to Preqin data.But Wall Street is famous for producing traders who make lots of money, then fall hard but still return for second and even third acts. That is no doubt something many hedge fund investors are banking on for 2016.An article on Tuesday about the dismal 2015 returns for many hedge funds misstated the history of oil prices this year. While benchmark crudes in the United States and Europe are both trading below $40 a barrel now, that was not the case \u201cfor most of the year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Software Maker Atlassian Sets Its I.P.O. at $21", "Date": "2015-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year has proved a tough one for stock market debuts. But the year is poised to end on a high note, thanks to a software company born in Australia.Atlassian, a maker of business development and collaboration software, priced its initial public offering at $21 a share on Thursday, above its expected price range of $19 to $20, and raising $462 million.At the I.P.O. price, the company was valued at $4.38 billion, making it the fifth biggest company to go public this year, according to Renaissance Capital. The software maker\u2019s last private investment round valued it at $3 billion.The stock sale is a rare bright spot for companies looking to go public. Even prominent names have struggled to win the valuations that they had sought. That has chilled a once-heated market, with the number of I.P.O.s filed this year down 32.6 percent from the same time last year, according to data from Renaissance Capital.Companies as varied as the luxury department store Neiman Marcus and the Caribbean telecommunications company Digicel postponed their market debuts after investors proved reluctant to pay up.And many of those who did make it to the public markets have suffered from faltering performance. Over all, the average I.P.O. that priced this year has fallen 2.4 percent from its offer price, according to Renaissance Capital.Unlike many other tech \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 companies valued above $1 billion \u2014 Atlassian was founded not in Silicon Valley but in Australia, begun in 2002 and initially financed in part by some $10,000 in credit card debt.Since then, the company has grown to 51,000 customers and more than 1,200 employees.The company makes a number of products meant to make life easier for software developers, like its JIRA project management tool \u2014 a name derived from the Japanese moniker for Godzilla \u2014 its HipChat chat software, and its Bitbucket code management tool.Among its most notable traits is that Atlassian has not actually collected money from outside investors. Instead, it is a \u201cbootstrapped\u201d company, financed by its own profits. (Several financial firms, including Accel Partners and T. Rowe Price, bought shares from employees in so-called secondary transactions, but never actually invested directly in the company.)The company has been profitable for the last three years. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the company earned $6.8 million on revenue of $319.5 million, compared with net income of $19 million on revenue of $215 million in the previous year.Another distinguishing feature of Atlassian is that it does not employ a huge sales force, bucking the trend of software companies hawking their products as far and wide as possible. Instead, the company relies on word-of-mouth marketing, as teams within a client persuade others to adopt its software.The company is expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Thursday under the ticker symbol \u201cTEAM.\u201dIts offering was led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.Advertisement"}

At 8:30 a.m., the Census Bureau will report the latest data on the trade balance in November, with economists expecting a slight widening in the trade deficit.Although exports are rising, led by demand for aircraft from overseas buyers, imports are forecast to rise more, a trend likely to continue because of the strong dollar. At 9 a.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller survey of home prices will most likely show that average prices in October were up 5.5 percent from a year ago, in line with the overall trend for 2015. Although existing-home sales unexpectedly dropped in November, according to another report released last week, most economists think that was a temporary dip that was related to new government regulations.Financial markets on Thursday will end a volatile year of trading in the United States that was dominated by concerns about the Chinese economy and the future policy decisions of the Federal Reserve.The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is on track to close the year at about the same place that it began, despite many significant moves at the end of the summer. This has been the worst year for American stocks since 2011, when the major indexes ended the year largely unchanged. Bond investors also struggled this year, as they prepared for the Fed\u2019s decision, which came this month, to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.European stocks were set to end a disappointing 2015 not far from where they started the year, after a spring rally fizzled on anxieties about the direction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate policy and concerns about global growth.Financially challenged Puerto Rico faces another deadline, on Jan. 1, for payments on some of its $72 billion of debt. This time the payments amount to about $902 million, according to the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research institute in San Juan. About a third of that is for general obligation bonds, which are constitutionally guaranteed in Puerto Rico, a United States commonwealth.The slowdown in China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector is expected to have continued throughout December. On Friday, the result of an official purchasing managers\u2019 index, one of the earliest monthly glimpses at the state of the economy, is expected by economists to show a reading of 49.8.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battered, Apologetic and Still Pitching Their Hedge Funds", "Date": "2015-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet even in this most humbling of years, some of these same hedge funds are soliciting investors for more money and marketing new funds that promise bigger and better opportunities.To go to battered investors with a new moneymaking spiel takes a certain self-confidence that seems second nature to billionaires. Some might even call it chutzpah. Mr. Robbins appeared to acknowledge as much in his letter to investors. \u201cUnfortunately, opportunity often feels like a punch in the face,\u201d he wrote.And that has been the case even as some prominent funds shut down and talk grows about the diminishing luster of hedge funds as an asset class. Investors are, and will continue to be, eager for higher returns in a world of near-zero interest rates even as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise rates for the first time in nearly a decade.The number of new hedge fund start-ups is outpacing fund closures this year, despite mounting fear in recent days about the viability of firms that are heavily invested in junk bonds.That\u2019s not to say that the industry hasn\u2019t been hard hit. Based on Preqin estimates, around $24 billion of hedge fund assets have been liquidated this year. The total that hedge fund managers have available to invest in stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities has also shrunk by the most since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 as investors asked to pull their money out of some hedge funds and firms returned money, according to data from HFR.The average hedge fund has gained just 0.3 percent this year, according to HFR\u2019s weighted composite index. That is enough to outpace the 0.75 percent decline this year in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.On that score, however, 2015 has been the exception. The broad hedge fund index has underperformed the stock market in America the previous six yearsThose years of mediocre returns persuaded some investors, including big pension funds and smaller institutional investors, to pull money from underperforming firms.Yet only a few other public pensions have followed Calpers\u2019s lead. Instead, investors have tended to punish underperforming funds by pulling dollars from those portfolios and redeploying them elsewhere \u2014 sometimes even to other portfolios managed by the same manager.This summer, two of the world\u2019s biggest banks, Bank of America and UBS, recommended that their private wealth units\u2019 clients pull money out of Mr. Paulson\u2019s Advantage fund. Money raised from the clients of Wall Street banks was a big source of the growth in the assets of the Advantage fund, which had been Mr. Paulson\u2019s largest portfolio for outside investors.Today, that fund is down 11 percent for the year and manages under $2 billion in assets. Advantage has been supplanted by another fund that makes bets on mergers and acquisitions; it now manages more than $9 billion in assets and has taken in some of the investor money once directed to the Advantage portfolio.Mr. Paulson\u2019s merger and acquisition fund, however, is also underperforming. The merger arbitrage fund was down about 4.4 percent as of the end of November, said people briefed on the performance numbers.\u201cThe Calpers decision is a bit of an anomaly in the space,\u201d said Todd E. Petzel, chief investment officer at the private wealth management firm Offit Capital, who added that most consulting firms employed by large institutional investors continue to recommend allocating money to hedge funds.In light of that perspective, he said: \u201cThe question then becomes, What do you do with a hedge fund that disappoints over a long period of time? You substitute out.\u201dJames G. Dinan of York Capital, in raising new money, chose to focus on a fund that mainly invests in distressed securities in Europe, a region that has been a bright spot for York Capital. While the firm\u2019s flagship fund is down 12 percent so far this year, its York Capital Europe fund has gained 4.5 percent.Boaz Weinstein, a hedge fund manager who began his career at Deutsche Bank making billions trading complex securities before the financial crisis only to lose a bundle in 2008, has been marketing a new fund that will invest in a portfolio of closed-end junk bond funds at a time when many high-yield funds are liquidating or being flooded with investor redemptions.An October marketing document for the fund notes that \u201csome investors are concerned about exposure to the high-yield asset class, given it is late in the credit cycle.\u201dIn many ways, Mr. Weinstein has been having a good year after three consecutive years of losses. His firm, Saba Capital, has made 6 percent for investors as of the end of November, according to a person briefed on the firm\u2019s performance.Nonetheless, he is being sued by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada, once his biggest investor. He was accused of deceptive accounting when the pension fund asked for its money back. Mr. Weinstein has denied the allegations and said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the lawsuit.In writing to Glenview investors, Mr. Robbins said, \u201cI\u2019ve failed to protect your capital.\u201dSince then, Mr. Robbins has recovered some losses but is still down 15.8 percent this year, dragged down by a bigger rout across health care stocks.Still, he has offered investors a chance to put fresh money into a side vehicle that will focus on health care stocks on the condition that money does not come from his poorly performing fund. He has raised $1.5 billion in so-called committed capital for that fund, according to a public filing.Mark W. Yusko, chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital, said the decision to give new money to a manager who has subpar performance in a given year ultimately comes down to a matter of faith.\u201cWhat you have to decide as an investor is, Do you believe that the skill level of the managers has changed?\u201d Mr. Yusko said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then the portfolio theory of investing says that\u2019s when you should be adding capital.\u201dAn article on Wednesday about fund-raising efforts by some hedge fund managers despite recent poor performance referred incorrectly to a fund that is run by John A. Paulson. It is a merger arbitrage fund, not a merger arbitration fund. The article also misstated the amount of money raised in a fund run by Larry Robbins. It is $1.5 billion, not $1.5 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Equity Fees Are Sky-High, Yes, but Look at Those Returns", "Date": "2015-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorThe reason is obvious. As an asset class and with the right fund, private equity is nigh unbeatable, well worth the fees paid.It\u2019s a big check to write, to be sure, but the money is worth it if private equity earns its keep. And private equity certainly did for Calpers.Without private equity, Calpers \u2014 which is only 77 percent funded as of year-end 2014 \u2014 and California retirees would be in much worse shape than they are today.Could Calpers have negotiated a better deal on fees? Perhaps, but we don\u2019t know the breakdown of the fees, and in any case about 12 percent of the total is far less than the standard 20 percent in profits private equity firms charge.The returns show that the strategy to date has been astoundingly successful and explain how Yale has kept up with its rivals. (Yale has also benefited from astoundingly successful venture capital investments over the last decade, something that will most likely not last in an age of dead unicorns.)It is not all unicorns and roses with private equity. Academics like Josh Lerner and Steven Kaplan have found that those seeking such fantastic returns do not always find it.The higher returns of private equity are justified in part as extra compensation to satisfy investors for the illiquidity and theoretical higher risk. But how much more this return should be is subject to some debate. Some, including Mr. Swensen, have suggested that private equity should outperform a leveraged investment in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index since that is after all what a private equity investment is \u2014 a fund borrowing money to buy companies.The gurus, though, may be overestimating the return required of private equity for both its illiquidity and risk. There are benefits to having a fund manage your investment, and private equity is quite a capable manager. During the financial crisis many of these funds were able to salvage near bankrupt investments and turn them into profits.Even with all of these caveats, there is no doubt that the private equity asset class has been a savior for many pension funds and endowments. Small pension funds (a billion dollars or less) still beg to get into larger private equity funds and are regularly turned down. It is only a lucky few that get access to the right private equity firms.It is hard to gauge how important all this is. These companies ought not to be engaging in these practices. But these are small amounts amid the billions of dollars of fees. One also has to wonder where the investors are. These are all sophisticated investors who can ask about and deal with these fees. Was there a practice that investors didn\u2019t know about?More important, a key ingredient of private equity\u2019s success is that it can earn those returns and take its share of the profit. If private equity\u2019s profits are narrowed, the question is whether returns will also be reduced. Perhaps not, but one suspects that private equity firms will simply increase their normal fees to compensate.And so, in the debate about private equity perhaps we should balance the criticism of private equity firms for excessive fees with the great demand for private equity investments and the important role they play in meeting investors\u2019 and pensioners\u2019 needs. It brings to mind a line from when private equity first became prominent in the 1980s: Where\u2019s the beef? The answer is, it\u2019s with those stellar returns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seismic Political Shock in Spain", "Date": "2015-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn retrospect, it might seem surprising that the voter backlash had not come earlier. Though Spain\u2019s austerity regime has not been as drastic as Greece\u2019s, unemployment remains above 20 percent, with young people affected most severely, many services have been cut back, and more hardship lies ahead. While the Popular Party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy could claim that Spain had turned the corner with growth projected at 3 percent this year, it was apparently not enough to counter austerity fatigue and a sense that the burden was not being equally shared because of the cronyism, corruption scandals and stagnation of the established parties.It may take a long time to sort out who will govern next. Mr. Rajoy gets the first crack at forming a coalition, but it\u2019s not certain he will find willing partners. It\u2019s thus possible that new elections will have to be called for early next year. The markets quickly reacted to the uncertainty \u2014 Spanish bonds and stocks fell on the results. Beyond Spain\u2019s borders, leaders of other European Union countries facing austerity fatigue, like Italy and France, are likely to wonder whether imposing too much belt-tightening might spell political disaster for them as well.On the other side of the ledger, the Spanish shock should compel the European Union and its sternest member, Germany, and the International Monetary Fund to re-examine the austerity they have been imposing on countries most affected by Europe\u2019s debt crisis. Spain is not Greece \u2014 it is the fourth-largest economy of the eurozone, and Mr. Rajoy had been willing to take the needed medicine. What the vote showed is that there are limits to the sacrifices people in any country will take, and that when sacrifices are demanded, leaders must spread them equitably and transparently.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Self-Serve World, Start-Ups Find Value in Human Helpers", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtIt\u2019s unfashionable to admit this in the age of Expedia, Priceline and other do-it-yourself online tools, but here it is: I miss travel agents.Yet as you suffer through another holiday travel season, you might pause to consider how much we\u2019ve really gained \u2014 and lost \u2014 in ditching human agents for machines. And you might welcome an emerging trend on the Internet: start-ups that are trying to put human agents, whether in travel, home services or shopping, back at the center of how we make decisions.Lola, which is currently open only in a limited prerelease version, has an unusual interface: When you\u2019re looking to book a trip, you just send a text. Your request can be vague \u2014 \u201cHey, my family is thinking about going to Europe next summer\u201d \u2014 because on the other end sits a human. The agent knows your general travel preferences and has access to many of the same tools you\u2019d use to book a trip. But the agent also has something extra \u2014 experience and data to help make decisions about the kind of trip you should take.Mr. English isn\u2019t allergic to tech. He co-founded and served as the chief technology officer of Kayak, the booking site acquired by Priceline in 2012 for nearly $2 billion. But Mr. English often manned the customer service phone line at Kayak, and would get calls from people who had grown frustrated with online booking.\u201cI tried to create the best travel website on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as good as we thought our tech was, there were many times where I thought I did a better job for people on the phone than our site could do.\u201dYou\u2019ve most likely experienced the headaches Mr. English is talking about. Think back to the last time you booked anything beyond a routine trip online. There\u2019s a good chance you spent a lot more time and energy than you would have with a human. Sure, the Internet has obligingly stepped in to help; there are review sites, travel blogs, discussion forums and the hordes on social media to answer every possible travel question. But these resources only exacerbate the problem. They often turn what should be a fun activity into an hourslong research project.Still, Mr. McClure said his business has lately been thriving. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is information overload,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is so much information out there that people research themselves into a circle and they get confused. And then they call one of my agents and say, \u2018Would you just help me out?\u2019 \u201dIt\u2019s not just in travel that we\u2019re all being asked to shoulder more work. The Internet\u2019s great magic is what a business school professor would call \u201cdisintermediation.\u201d By surfacing all of the world\u2019s information and letting each of us act on it, computers help us bypass the expensive human brokers and service people who once sat in between consumers and suppliers.An economist would praise the great disintermediation for its efficiency. As a customer, you may have a different reaction: Look at all the work you\u2019re now being asked to do. Was it really wise to get rid of all those human helpers?In many cases, yes, but there remain vast realms of commerce in which guidance from a human expert works much better than a machine. Other than travel, consider the process of finding a handyman or plumber. The Internet has given us a wealth of data about these services. You could spend all day on Craigslist, Yelp or Angie\u2019s List finding the best person for your job, which is precisely the problem.\u201cA quick glance from our handyman gives us an idea of who to send to your job, and what it will cost,\u201d Mr. Ludlow said. The company handles payment processing, scheduling and any complaints if something goes wrong.I recently used Happy Home to get a few home theater cables concealed in a wall. The experience was liberating \u2014 I found a handyman and a drywall specialist to do my job with little more than few texts, and no time spent scouring through web reviews.It isn\u2019t feasible to get humans involved in all of our purchases. Humans are costly and they\u2019re limited in capacity. The great advantage of computers is that they \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 software can serve evermore customers for ever-lower prices.But one of the ironies of the digital revolution is that it has also helped human expertise scale. Thanks to texting, human customer service agents can now serve multiple customers at a time. They can also access reams of data about your preferences, allowing them to quickly find answers for your questions.As a result, for certain purchases, the cost of adding human expertise can be a trivial part of the overall transaction. Happy Home takes a cut of each service it sets up, but because it can squeeze out certain efficiencies from operating a network of service professionals, its prices match what you\u2019d find looking for a handyman on your own. That\u2019s true of human travel agencies, too \u2014 the commissions on travel are so good that Lola can afford to throw in human expertise almost as a kind of bonus.The rise of computers is often portrayed as a great threat to all of our jobs. But these services sketch out a more optimistic scenario: That humans and machines will work together, and we, as customers, will be allowed, once more, to lazily beg for help.The State of the Art column on Thursday, about start-ups that are using humans, rather than algorithms, to offer service, misstated the location of Montrose Travel, whose president said is thriving as customers increasingly seek out live agents. The company is based in Southern California, not Northern California.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Earmarks Billions to Help Prod Its Companies", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s central bank announced a small but perhaps symbolically significant change to its stimulus efforts on Friday, earmarking 300 billion yen a year, or $2.4 billion, to buy shares in companies that expand the economy by investing in their factories or by raising workers\u2019 pay.Coming just two days after the United States Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis, the move emphasized the growing divergence between tighter monetary policy in the United States and the ultra-accommodative stance of Japan. The bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said the timing of the two decisions was merely coincidental.Instead, Mr. Kuroda said, the bank wants to refine its existing program, which analysts say has beaten back \u2014 but not yet defeated \u2014 the deflation that has haunted Japan for two decades.\u201cThe business environment is favorable, but there are still differences in the way companies have responded,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said. \u201cThe B.O.J. is doing what it can to support capital spending and investment in human resources.\u201dBy focusing on companies that invest in production and workers, Mr. Kuroda was addressing a stubborn obstacle to his efforts to promote consumption and stoke inflation: Many businesses are defensively hoarding cash rather than injecting it back into the economy. That has kept a lid on wages and prices, forcing the bank to postpone a goal of achieving around 2 percent inflation.\u201cThe B.O.J. is sending the message through the market: Please cooperate,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.The central bank also on Friday extended the average maturity of the government bonds it buys from a range of seven to 10 years to seven to 12 years, in what Mr. Kuroda called a \u201ctechnical\u201d adjustment.Investors seemed unsure what to make of Friday\u2019s moves, which were less assertive than others made by Mr. Kuroda since he took over as central bank chief in early 2013. His mandate was to overturn the bank\u2019s previously cautious approach and take it into a \u201cnew dimension\u201d of aggressive monetary expansion.The Nikkei 225 average jumped immediately after the announcement on Friday and the yen fell against the dollar, but both moves were soon reversed. Japanese stocks closed nearly 2 percent lower on the day.The Bank of Japan already buys \u00a53 trillion of equities a year under its existing asset-purchasing program, as well as tens of trillions of yen of government bonds and other financial instruments. That is many times more than it set aside with the new stock-buying program that it announced on Friday and said would begin in April.And unless the bank raises its target for overall monetary expansion by the time the additional buying starts, it will have to reduce its accumulation of other assets to make room, weakening the effect on financial markets.Nonetheless, it came as a surprise, Ms. Sera added, because few investors had expected the bank to take any action at all.The bank has left its policy settings unchanged for months, despite softening prices, to the disappointment of some analysts and investors. Its last major monetary expansion occurred more than a year ago, in October 2014.Mr. Adachi, of JPMorgan, said that if nothing else, the bank had sent a message that it was still actively looking for new ways to support the economy.\u201cThe B.O.J. doesn\u2019t want markets to conclude that it\u2019s never going to ease again,\u201d he said.Mr. Kuroda seemed to concede that point at a news conference after the policy announcement. Referring to a view expressed by some critics that the bank had effectively run out of ammunition in its stimulus drive \u2014 it is now buying up a majority of the bonds that the government puts on the market \u2014 he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that qualitative and quantitative easing will reach a limit anytime soon.\u201dIn its announcement, the bank said the new stock-buying initiative would target index funds \u201ccomposed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively making investment in physical and human capital.\u201dThe program, it said, would start by buying funds that track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400, a relatively new index made up of Japanese companies that are judged to meet high standards of governance and profitability.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robust Jobs Report All but Guarantees Fed Will Raise Rates", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsider it a done deal.In addition to announcing 211,000 new hires last month \u2014 a bit more than Wall Street had expected \u2014 the Labor Department also revised upward its earlier estimate of job creation in September and October by a total of 26,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5 percent.The labor market strength evident in the November data removes the last major uncertainty before the Fed decision.\u201cThis is a green light from our perspective,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. Wall Street, which in the past has sold off after strong jobs data and the prospect of higher interest rates, greeted the report with enthusiasm, perhaps because it removes any remaining uncertainty about the Fed\u2019s plans. Stocks reversed Thursday\u2019s losses and rose more than 2 percent; bond yields fell slightly. The report on Friday echoes other recent positive data on job openings, new weekly claims for unemployment benefits and private payroll surveys, Mr. Orlando added. \u201cThis is a good number for liftoff,\u201d he said, referring to the expected move by the central bank, which has held rates near zero since December 2008.If hiring continues at a healthy pace next year, as most economists now predict, it could also blunt Republican criticism in the presidential campaign of Democratic economic policies, which have been a prominent target for the current crop of G.O.P. candidates.With an average monthly payroll increase of 210,000 so far this year, the 211,000 gain in November \u2014 though still subject to revision \u2014 has a metronome-like element of consistency. It is also near the average monthly increase of 199,000 in 2013 and 260,000 in 2014.\u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve thought the labor market was in pretty good shape, and this just confirms that,\u201d said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. After the release of the jobs report, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Patrick T. Harker, added his voice to the chorus of Fed officials who said it was time for the central bank to raise interest rates.\u201cRaising rates this year will, in my view, serve to reduce monetary policy uncertainty and to keep the economy on track for sustained growth with price stability,\u201d Mr. Harker said at a Fed conference in Philadelphia.Still, even after more than six years of economic recovery from the devastating financial crisis, the labor market is well below its pre-recession levels and pockets of economic weakness remain.At 62.5 percent, the proportion of Americans in the labor force remains near multidecade lows. The jobless rate for African-Americans rose by 0.2 percentage point in November to 9.4 percent, which is more than twice the 4.3 percent level for white Americans.Moreover, the economy is still 2.8 million jobs short of where it would have to be to match pre-recession employment levels while also absorbing new entrants into the work force, according to the Hamilton Project, a research group associated with the Brookings Institution in Washington. Even if the current trend continues, that so-called \u201cjobs gap\u201d will not be closed until mid-2017.In addition to the tempo of hiring and the unemployment rate, Fed policy makers have been paying close attention to the pace of wage increases. In November, the government said wages rose by 0.2 percent, leaving the 12-month change in average hourly earnings 2.3 percent higher.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Despite steady hiring gains and a falling unemployment rate, wage growth in recent years has barely advanced faster than inflation. In October, that trend seemed to improve, with an unexpectedly strong 0.4 percentage point increase in average hourly earnings that pushed the 12-month gain to 2.5 percent even as the pace of inflation fell, mostly because of lower energy prices.But with November\u2019s figures reverting to the earlier trend, Mr. Clemons said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of wage pressure yet.\u201dHe foresees two more interest rate increases next year, bringing short-term rates to about 0.75 percent at this point next year. Other analysts, like Mr. Orlando, expect the Fed to raise rates roughly every other meeting next year, which would bring the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to about 1 percent in the fall of 2016.\u201cIt is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to,\u201d she added.In the November data, the mix of sectors doing the hiring was encouraging, with big gains in construction, education and health services, and the white-collar professional and business services sector.On the other hand, the mining and logging sector lost 11,000 jobs, hit by continuing job cuts in the oil patch and other commodity-dependent industries.One wild card in the November report was the retail sector. But the data showed that stores added 31,000 retail jobs.The transportation and warehousing sector added 6,400 jobs in November, reversing losses in September and October.In Chicago, Redwood Logistics has been on a steady growth track all year, adding about 100 employees in the last 12 months, said the company\u2019s chief executive, Todd Berger. With a nationwide work force of about 425, Mr. Berger said he anticipated hiring another 100 workers in the next year. Although many people might consider strong shoulders to be the main qualification for a job at a shipping and transportation company, the reality is very different.Most of Redwood\u2019s jobs require a college degree, Mr. Berger said. In November, Redwood filled three managerial positions, all of which paid more than $100,000 a year and required specialized training and experience.Salaries for less-skilled positions, like truck drivers, have also been creeping up. In Texas, Redwood has been hiring drivers from among those laid off from the energy industry.\u201cOur drivers will go to work in the oil fields when that\u2019s hot,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re coming back.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oil Prices Plunge 5% After OPEC Stands Pat", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn only 16 months global oil prices have collapsed from over $110 a barrel to less than half that, and the oil industry in the United States and around the world is reeling from its worst crisis since the late 1990s. On Monday, the American benchmark broke the $38-a-barrel mark, a price that makes drilling and completing wells a losing proposition in almost all oil fields around the country.Oil stocks were sent tumbling, along with the rest of the market, as the price plunge put additional pressure on their finances. Kinder Morgan, the pipeline giant, said on Friday that it was reviewing its dividend. Shares of independent oil companies like Apache and ConocoPhillips fell by more than 3 percent on Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s another damaging blow to the U.S. oil industry,\u201d said Steven H. Pruett, president and chief executive of Elevation Resources, a Texas oil company. \u201cThe rig count will continue to decline, the production decline will accelerate and capital spending plans will be curtailed further, as will employment.\u201dA variety of factors is behind the price drop, analysts say, including the surge in American and Iraqi oil production in recent years and a slowing in demand growth from China and other developing countries.But it was the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia and a few Persian Gulf allies, in November 2014 not to cut production to shore up prices as it often had in the past, that sent prices into a collapse.Last week, traders and oil executives held scant hopes that maybe Saudi Arabia would listen to the urgings of several OPEC nations like Venezuela, Iran, Ecuador and Algeria to cut production, and that maybe Russia and some other non-OPEC producers would join in the effort. But those hopes were dashed on Friday when OPEC refused to tinker with its output, which is now at near-record levels.The refusal to cut production left American oil executives expressing concern about the future of the industry.\u201cThey can continue to decimate our industry and it will take years to come back,\u201d said Steve J. McCoy, director of business development for Latshaw Drilling, a drilling contractor based in Oklahoma. \u201cThey are doing their best to keep America from being energy self-sufficient or to have the ability to export.\u201dThe Saudis\u2019 actions are having the effect of forcing companies to reduce their shale production in the United States, which though expensive, has nearly doubled American oil output in recent years. The shale revolution, a relatively recent phenomenon, also threatens to increase production in many other countries that can eventually drill into their own hard rocks.Several smaller American companies with higher debt loads have missed bond payments or been forced into bankruptcy. Domestic production has so far declined modestly because producers have been able to drill more efficiently and because their service companies have been forced to lower their prices, although output is expected to drop faster in 2016.An estimated 250,000 oil and gas workers have lost their jobs over the last year worldwide. In Texas, the biggest American producer, at least 50,000 jobs have been lost.OPEC officials said that before they made any decision about future production cuts, they wanted to see the impact on global markets of new barrels from Iran \u2014 expected to be as many as 500,000 a day by the second half of 2016 \u2014 as Tehran complies with the recent nuclear deal. They also suggested that Saudi Arabia might be willing to cut as long as other major producers were willing to do the same.Many oil analysts have compared the Saudi strategy to a game of chicken to see which large producers would blink first.

{"Headline": "Square Merchants Bought Shares During Its I.P.O., With a Start-Up\u2019s Help", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTushar Bajaj, 35, and his wife, Leena, 42, have casually bought and sold stocks for years. Until last month, they had never been able to buy shares in an initial public offering.Over the last five years, the couple have used Square\u2019s payment processing technology to run their own business \u2014 a makeup and henna tattoo service for brides and their families, based in Austin, Tex.When Mr. and Mrs. Bajaj saw that Square was allowing merchants like them to buy shares in its November I.P.O. they bought about $2,500 worth of stock at $9 a share. Some 28 days later, those shares are worth about $3,500, up 40 percent.The Bajaj family was among 14,000 Square sellers that bought into the company\u2019s I.P.O. through a platform known as Loyal3, the company is expected to announce on Wednesday. Loyal3 allocates stock to individual investors as opposed to large, professional money managers. The platform was responsible for allocating 5 percent of Square\u2019s $243 million I.P.O.In most I.P.O.s, investment banks sell shares to the best clients \u2014 mostly big institutional investors \u2014 leaving individual, retail investors largely on the sidelines.To cater more to its merchants, Square tapped the efforts of Loyal3, a financial start-up that contends that a business\u2019s most loyal customers can be loyal shareholders as well. Since its founding in 2008, Loyal3 has participated in 15 deals, including the I.P.O.s of the movie theater chain AMC Entertainment and the pet food manufacturer Blue Buffalo.The firm selects merchants to allocate shares to on a first-come-first-serve basis. Merchants can purchase $100 to $2,500 worth of shares.\u201cIn the spirit of leveling the playing field, we want to share our public offering with our sellers,\u201d Jack Dorsey, Square\u2019s chief executive, said in a video presentation to merchants considering buying stock in the I.P.O.During Square\u2019s first day of trading on Nov. 19, an additional 6,000 individuals purchased shares through Loyal3.Square\u2019s first-day trading surge led to some second-guessing over the pricing. The company decided to price shares at $9 in the offering. The low price had prompted a so-called ratchet, giving more shares to later investors at the expense of earlier ones, such as employees. If the company had been able to price higher, therefore taking a smaller first-day gain, that dilution would have been less severe.But Square and its advisers had underestimated the amount of retail interest, people briefed on the pricing discussions said at the time. Pricing is typically shaped by the big institutional investors, who tell issuers the price per share that they would be willing to pay. Bankers collect that information before setting the final price in the I.P.O. to ensure that they have the demand they need to fulfill the offering.In Square\u2019s case, the institutional demand was lower than the range they had been marketing. That forced Square to push the price down $2 per share, to $9.On the first day of trading, Square executives were surprised to see such a strong pop in the stock, which closed at a high of $13.07. Insiders attributed the surge to the interest from retail investors, like the millions of merchants that Square serves. Since the I.P.O., Square\u2019s stock has slipped a little more than 4 percent.Mr. Bajaj said he had held onto all the shares he acquired through the I.P.O., with an eye to doing so for the next few quarters, depending on the market. He\u2019s still grateful he got in on the deal early.\u201cWe are a small mom-and-pop shop,\u201d Mr. Bajaj said. \u201cWe don\u2019t typically have opportunities like folks on Wall Street have to participate in an I.P.O.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Key to Success of Climate Pact Will Be Its Signals to Global Markets", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLE BOURGET, France \u2014 As diplomats here work through the final points of a sweeping new climate change accord, experts said the ultimate measure of success of the agreement will be whether it sends a clear signal to global financial investors that they should move money away from fossil fuels and toward clean-energy sources such as wind and solar power.Without that signal, there is little chance that emissions will be reduced enough to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of global warming.The appeal to investors remained a question mark early Friday morning after Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who is presiding over the United Nations conference on climate change, released a near-final draft text.It addressed many sticking points of the talks, and largely cleared the way for a final deal that accomplishes many of the goals that climate-policy advocates say are necessary to start reducing global emissions.But the draft dodges the issue of how countries would monitor, verify and report their levels of planet-warming pollution.The impact of the deal hangs on that one section, experts say, because without it, no one will be able to trust that governments are doing what they say they will do to cut emissions. Without that certainty, investors will be skittish about shifting to renewable energy.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of what kind of signal you give to investors and people who decide where the dollars go,\u201d said Nathaniel Keohane, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, and a former adviser to the Obama administration. \u201cThey decide whether to invest in one kind of electric power plant or another.\u201dHundreds of negotiators have spent nearly two weeks in this compound of tents on the outskirts of Paris hammering out countless details in the substance of a deal, which could be passed into international law as soon as Friday night.A new version was released of the international agreement that negotiators at the Paris climate conference have been haggling over for more than a week.The emerging pact would require countries to enact plans to cut their fossil fuel emissions, set up a system for rich countries to pay for poor countries to mitigate and adapt to the ravages of climate change, and establish a legally binding timetable for countries to ratchet up the strength of their emissions plans over time.Such a transition would fundamentally transform the energy system that has powered the global economy since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas, now make up about 80 percent of the world\u2019s energy mix. The combined stock value of the world\u2019s coal, oil and gas companies is about $5 trillion. By comparison, stocks related to renewable energy are valued at about $300 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm.The questions about transparency will define Friday\u2019s negotiations.At the heart of the emerging deal are pledges by 186 countries outlining ways in which they will lower their greenhouse gas emissions through 2030.When combined, those pledges would still reduce planet-warming emissions by about half as much as is necessary to stave off a temperature increase above the catastrophic limit of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 the point at which the planet will be locked in to devastating climate consequences.However, poor and vulnerable countries, including low-lying island nations that are already experiencing the effect of sea level rise, have successfully pushed for the Paris deal to include language that would set an aspirational, although not legally binding, goal of cutting emissions enough to avoid an atmospheric warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius.Reaching that goal would prevent further devastation but require far more rapid and stringent economic action than governments have pledged. The new deal would require countries to come back to the table every five years and offer up new, stronger emissions reductions plans.\u201cThe text is trending towards the better than half-full outcome of what\u2019s been on the table \u2014 which would be historic,\u201d said Andrew Deutz, director of international government relations at the Nature Conservancy.\u201cThere are still details to be worked out on transparency and reporting, on markets, and on finance,\u201d he said, as well as sorting out the different obligations of developed countries compared with developing ones. \u201cThe deal isn\u2019t done yet, but we can see a clear path to success.\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.By early Friday morning, negotiators were hammering out language that would require countries to monitor, verify and report on how well they are reducing their emissions compared with their publicly stated targets.Secretary of State John Kerry is the chief advocate at the talks for aggressive transparency measures, and has been pushing to create a regime in which all government numbers on emissions reduction are made publicly available, and subject to verification by an outside body of experts \u2014 a sort of carbon emissions auditor.He said in an interview this week that he believes the final deal will succeed in creating that all-important signal to business markets.\u201cThere will be a sea change,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will see more money begin following those outcomes, flowing to wind and solar, because there\u2019s trillions of dollars in profit to be made.\u201dSeven simple guidelines on how your choices today affect the climate tomorrow.While the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest carbon polluter, is pushing for strong transparency measures, China and India, the world\u2019s largest and third-largest polluters, still oppose those proposals.They demand that the Paris deal reflect a division of responsibility inscribed in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which created lighter emissions monitoring and verification requirements for developing economies.\u201cWe already have a thorough system of accounting,\u201d said Ashok Lavasa, secretary of India\u2019s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Of the proposal for an outside emissions auditor, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t understand the need for a superinspector going around and seeing what we\u2019re doing.\u201dFor now, the language in the draft climate change pact is too vague to please either side.Unless it is refined, the final deal may be too weak to influence investors to put money into solar companies rather than coal companies.\u201cIn the Paris agreement, corporations will need to see these numbers,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University. \u201cThat affects what they put in their spreadsheets, their decision-making.\u201dAn article on Friday about whether the new climate agreement reached in France will send a clear signal to global financial investors that they should move money away from fossil fuels and toward clean-energy sources transposed the names of the countries that are the world\u2019s largest and third-largest carbon polluters. China is the world\u2019s largest, and India is the third largest.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s important, however, to keep two things in mind: A rate hike means that the economists at the Fed, as they review voluminous statistical data, believe that the economy is actually improving; and with rates at virtual all-time lows, a measly one-quarter percent increase should certainly not be devastating.In reality, it\u2019s only an increase from basically zilch to still very little.JOSEPH P. HUBERPlantation, Fla.The writer is a retired financial adviser.To the Editor:This is a purely symbolic gesture. An increase of 0.25 percent will have no material effect on the markets. What it will do is appease the credit markets, showing that the Fed will stand and fight inflation. Never mind that commodity prices are plummeting all over the world and we are on the edge of a deflationary spiral. Why let reality get in the way of politics?What will happen is that inflation will remain low and the right will claim a victory that raising rates kept inflation at bay. Let them have their hollow victory.This is not a one-way street. The Fed could just as easily drop rates in six months. Most likely, the Fed is looking for an interest level that the economy can tolerate. Then it will have a place from which to drop rates when things slow down too much. Conditions are already pretty slow, so we may not have to wait long for rates to drop.BRUCE ROZENBLITKansas City, Mo.To the Editor:Many of your articles about interest rates, such as this one, talk about the dangers of raising interest rates. How about the risks of keeping interest rates this low for this long? Insurance companies and pension funds are making risky investments in order to get enough yield to manage their business. In addition, there has been a huge distortion of capital flow from low-risk bonds to high-risk bonds and stocks.The recession was not caused by high interest rates and will not be cured by low interest rates. Jobs are threatened by automation and competition from abroad, and low interest rates will not cure those ills. Low interest rates are inflating stock prices and setting us up for another crash. If we enter another recession and interest rates remain this low, there will be no way to stimulate the economy with monetary policy.It\u2019s time we examine the negative impact of the current Fed policy.ERIC NEIKRUGSarasota, Fla.To the Editor:Oh my gosh, whatever shall I do with the extra dollar my savings might earn in interest next year?VANESSA HALLMillersburg, Mo.Advertisement"}

The moves are aimed at bolstering an economy predicted to grow by 0.4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Yet the devaluation is likely to mean hardship in the short term for many Argentines as prices shoot up. It subsequently risks stirring social unrest in a nation where large street protests are commonplace and trade union leaders are influential.\u201cThis is going to affect me because my salary is not going to keep up,\u201d said Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez, 24, who earns about $715 a month for delivering cosmetics to stores here.\u201cMacri doesn\u2019t care about the middle class; he only aspires to favor the rich,\u201d he added, doubting whether the actions of the new president, who is from a wealthy family, would ever benefit him.Mr. Prat-Gay said that the policies were geared toward ending poverty, one of Mr. Macri\u2019s campaign promises.\u201cThe devaluation was inevitable,\u201d said Gast\u00f3n Rossi, a former deputy economy minister and director of LCG, a consultancy in Buenos Aires. \u201cThe economy wasn\u2019t sustainable.\u201dMrs. Kirchner, who saw the gains of a devaluation nearly two years ago vitiated by inflation, left another devaluation to her successor because the political cost was too high, Mr. Rossi added. Some economists expect Mr. Macri\u2019s changes to result in a recession or anemic growth next year, followed by a rebound in 2017 of about 3 percent.Pointing to tensions between supporters of Mr. Macri and supporters of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s party, which proposed more gradual economic changes, Axel Kicillof, a lawmaker and Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s former economy minister, warned this week, \u201cBrusque devaluations bring great disarray.\u201dThe exchange rate is officially 9.8 pesos per dollar, but because of the unpopular controls that limit access to dollars, they sell in a black market for about 14.5 pesos.The devaluation will especially benefit Argentina\u2019s influential farmers, who have been hoarding stocks of grain harvests for export, like soy, as they speculated about the move. Mr. Prat-Gay said the government had agreed to a deal with them to liquidate billions of dollars in stocks over the next three weeks.An article on Thursday about a move by Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, to devalue the nation\u2019s currency misstated, in some editions, the International Monetary Fund\u2019s forecast for Argentina\u2019s economy and the name of the Buenos Aires consultancy where Gast\u00f3n Rossi, a former deputy economy minister who said the devaluation was inevitable, is a director.

{"Headline": "With Fed\u2019s Interest Rate Move, a Test of the Stock Markets", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe extraordinarily low interest rates of the last seven years have stoked a bull market in stocks, fueled a global boom in commodities, prompted a wave of corporate mergers and led companies to borrow trillions of dollars in the markets.Longtime Wall Street analysts and traders said that they could never remember a time when an increase in interest rates had gotten so much attention.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the Fed get a bigger spotlight than today,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of his own investment firm.Some analysts said the scrutiny was warranted, because, they contended, the Fed may be raising the cost of borrowing too soon.\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting point in history; the Fed has never had to make a decision like this,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, who was working on Wall Street in the early 1980s, when the Fed drove interest rates sharply higher under very different economic conditions.Investors widely expected the Fed to increase interest rates on Wednesday, and they piled into the market after digesting the comments of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, at a news conference.Stocks rose broadly Wednesday afternoon. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, a benchmark favored by investment professionals, rose 29.66 points, or 1.45 percent, to 2,073.07, giving it a slight gain for the year. Every sector in the index, but one, energy, advanced. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 224.18 points, to 17,749.09, and the Nasdaq composite closed up 75.78 points, at 5,071.13.The stock market slumped in the summer in response to fears of a slowdown in global growth. If the S.&P. 500 ends ahead for 2015, it would be its seventh consecutive year of gains, an astonishing run in a time of subpar economic growth.There was a muted response in bond markets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, rose slightly, to 2.30 percent from 2.27 percent on Tuesday, still low by historical standards.The belief that the Fed was doing much to stimulate the economy instilled confidence among investors in the difficult years after the financial crisis of 2008. The Fed\u2019s support helped mute the volatility of United States markets for long periods. Markets kept rising, and Wall Street kept selling debt and doing deals.Yet even as markets climbed, investors fretted over the impact of higher interest rates.Such nervousness first hit stock and bond markets in developing countries, which exploited the low interest rates to borrow heavily. The worries surfaced closer to home in recent weeks, in the market for junk bonds, which has been rocked by a wave of selling. Last week, a mutual fund that invested in risky debt decided to bar investors from withdrawing their money.Investors are now debating whether rising interest rates \u2014 the Fed is expected to increase them at least a couple more times next year \u2014 will cause turbulence in other markets. A broad pullback on Wall Street could restrict the flow of credit into the economy, potentially slowing hiring and wage growth. A decline in stocks could damage the financial standing of households, whose holdings of stocks have increased in value by over $5 trillion since 2009.The Fed itself closely watches for signs that disruptions in the markets are spilling into the economy, something Ms. Yellen underscored on Wednesday. If changes in financial conditions affected the Fed\u2019s outlook for the economy, she said that \u201cwe would, of course, take them into account.\u201dAnd the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, which raised the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, said in its statement that it would raise rates further only if it were justified by economic conditions, a message that will soothe Wall Street.\u201cThe committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\u201d the statement said.Some critics of the Fed\u2019s monetary largess have asserted that it stirred up a huge amount of financial activity that may fall off sharply as soon as borrowing costs go up.Since 2008, United States mergers and acquisitions have totaled over $8 trillion, while United States companies have sold over $11 trillion of debt to investors, according to data from Thomson Reuters. United States stocks, measured by the S.&P. 500 index, have been in a bull market for 81 months, the third-longest since at least the 1930s.One school of bearish investors says stock valuations are expensive and there is evidence of unsustainable speculation, particularly in Silicon Valley. Such conditions, they say, can leave markets vulnerable to even small increases in the cost of borrowing. The Fed, for instance, increased interest rates steadily in 1999 and 2000, when there was also fervor for technology investments. The stock market then lost nearly half its value.Other analysts say the conditions that the Fed must now grapple with are in many ways unique.Inflation shows no signs of reaching levels that would force the Fed to slam on the brakes, a reaction that nearly always roils markets. Yet at the same time, the analysts contend that the economy and corporations appear to lack fundamental strengths that are needed to keep stocks moving higher.\u201cYellen is doing this interest-rate hike without any buffer,\u201d said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so different from other cycles.\u201d The concern is that companies will now struggle to meet expected earnings targets, and investors will dump stocks in response.But Ms. Yellen expressed doubt about the notion that the current expansion is destined to slow the older it gets.\u201cI think it\u2019s a myth that expansions die of old age,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BATS Exchange to Try Again at an I.P.O.", "Date": "2015-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince then, BATS has faced new competitive threats and the increasing regulatory scrutiny of the role of high-speed trading in the securities markets.Founded in 2005 by a wheat and stock futures trader who set out to develop an alternative to Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, BATS grew to prominence as part of a new generation of electronic trading sites that courted traders who used sophisticated computer algorithms.BATS, which is owned by 13 Wall Street banks and electronic trading firms, is now the second-largest exchange in the United States by market share and the largest exchange for exchange-traded funds. Through the first nine months of this year it had a 21 percent share of the United States equity market, according to the filing.BATS attempted a stock offering in 2012, only to withdraw its debut on the same day because of technology system errors. The incident was not just an embarrassing turn of events for BATS. It drew a fresh round of introspection on the complexity and vulnerability of the American stock markets, where high-speed trading has taken on an increasingly dominant role.There have been attempts to push back against the high-speed traders. Investors Exchange, or IEX, applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to become a full-blown exchange in September. The firm, which is owned by hedge funds like Greenlight Capital and Pershing Square and mutual funds like Franklin Resources, casts itself as a place that protects retail investors from predatory high-speed traders.IEX\u2019s system imposes a 350-microsecond delay, essentially a speed bump, on traders who place and cancel orders in large quantities, a common tactic of high-speed traders.BATS once championed itself as the underdog against the market establishment. But that was in 2005, when regulatory changes helped propel its growth. In January 2014 it acquired Direct Edge Holdings, a rival electronic exchange.BATS continues to be owned by Wall Street banks and high-speed trading operations, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citadel, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Instinet, JPMorgan Chase, Knight Capital Group, Lime, Morgan Stanley, Tradebot Ventures and Wedbush.One of the risk factors noted in BATS\u2019s filing on Wednesday is the interconnectedness of its operations with the competing strategies of its Wall Street owners.\u201cWe generate a significant percentage of our total revenues from, and are provided with significant liquidity in our markets by, customers who are affiliates of our principal investors, who are not contractually obligated to continue to use our services,\u201d the filing said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Delay for an Upstart Stock Exchange", "Date": "2015-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThe commission originally set a deadline of Dec. 21 to move on the application. The extension suggests that a handful of IEX\u2019s critics \u2014 high-frequency trading outfits and exchanges that compete with IEX \u2014 are making headway with decision makers at the S.E.C. IEX\u2019s application has received overwhelming support from small and large investors alike.IEX is a trading platform created in October 2013 by Bradley Katsuyama, a former head of electronic sales and trading at a unit of Royal Bank of Canada, and eight co-founders. IEX aims to offer investors an alternative to exchanges that provide information advantages to participants prepared to pay a hefty fee for an inside track.One advantage comes in the form of proprietary data about trading action in stocks. The other is something known as co-location, which cuts down on the time it takes to transmit a buy or sell order for execution. Both systems allow preferred investors to react ahead of others.The company has received praise, and business, from institutional investors concerned that their trades are being disadvantaged on other systems. While still small when compared with the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq, IEX has increased its trading volumes significantly. This month, it clocked average daily volume of 127 million shares, up from five million in December 2013. It recently handled just under 2 percent of daily stock trades nationally.IEX\u2019s volume would most likely grow even faster if it were to become an exchange. For example, if IEX were offering the best price on a stock, buyers and sellers would have to execute their trades there. In its current form, traders can skirt IEX even when it posts the best bid or offer on its system.Last summer, IEX applied to the S.E.C. to become a recognized exchange. Under its plan, IEX would operate an electronic order book matching buyers and sellers of stocks. The orders would come from its brokerage firm members.In correspondence with the S.E.C., IEX said that it sought exchange status to protect investors from practices on the dominant exchanges that \u201cunduly focus on the speed of quoting and trading, and unduly rely on ever-increasing fees for both access and market data that their members are effectively required to pay in order to trade for themselves and to seek best execution of their customers\u2019 orders.\u201dThe crucial difference between IEX and others involved in trading stocks is the speed bump it imposes, delaying all participants\u2019 trades by 350 microseconds. Imposing such a delay on IEX customers means that none will be able to trade on IEX in reaction to price movements that may appear elsewhere but that have not yet been recorded on the exchange.\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at the quality of executions that we\u2019re getting back from IEX and we see some real advantages versus some other venues we trade at,\u201d Mr. Brooks said in an interview. \u201cThe central part of their design is specifically geared to taking out that structural speed advantage for some participants.\u201d\u201cIEX presents a free-market and competitive solution that is really meant to put all market participants on a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Schrank said. \u201cThe incumbent exchanges are no longer in the game of matching buyers and sellers to earn a straightforward fee. They enable one class of trader to pay more for enhanced and exclusive market data as well as closer and faster access to the exchange\u2019s matching engine.\u201d\u201cThis strikes me,\u201d Mr. Schrank added, \u201cas being in direct opposition to the purpose of the capital markets.\u201dMany individual investors have also written to the S.E.C. saying that granting the application is a matter of market fairness. Edwin James Boyce, an individual investor in North Carolina, was particularly colorful in his commentary: \u201cWe have a life boat in IEX in the rough seas filled with sharks.\u201dA clue to why established exchanges aren\u2019t keen on the IEX application can be found in a recent initial public offering statement filed by BATS Global Markets.When those interests conflicted, the S.E.C. said at the time, \u201cthe commission believes that its clear responsibility is to uphold the interests of long-term investors.\u201dSo what is the S.E.C. waiting for? That\u2019s what Vincent Bohr, an investor based in Paris, wants to know. \u201cIt is high time,\u201d he said in his comment on the IEX application, \u201cto have a non-rigging exchange.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Assume a Fed Action Will Move the Market", "Date": "2015-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewHumans don\u2019t behave like computers. That makes life interesting, but it has a serious downside for economists: It is exceedingly difficult to predict the short-term directions of major markets, even when events seem to be entirely predictable.The forthcoming decision of the Federal Reserve on interest rates is a humbling example. Consider that after seven years of virtually zero percent short-term interest rates, the Federal Open Market Committee is almost universally expected to raise rates slightly at its Dec. 15-16 meeting.What this means for the markets isn\u2019t clear, however. We can\u2019t rely on historical precedent. The last time rates rose after remaining very low for so long was in 1941. That was a long time ago, and when there has been only one previous example, in very different circumstances, historical statistics won\u2019t prove much of anything.There are other ways of analyzing the likely effects of the Fed actions, but all have severe limitations.First, logic tells us that if short-term Treasury rates rise, low-risk Treasury bills may become more attractive in comparison with riskier alternatives like stocks. That suggests that the stock market should weaken because people will become even more wary than they may be right now about share prices, which have tripled since 2009. Home prices should weaken too, because rising interest rates can be expected to make mortgages more expensive. In other words, this line of thinking is quite negative about the general effect of a rate increase on market prices.There is another way to look at this, though. If the Fed raises rates in December it could be seen as good news because the Fed wouldn\u2019t take that action unless it viewed the economy as relatively strong. That could buoy market prices.This approach immediately leads to further complications. Good news about the economy might be bad news about inflation, which tends to rise when economic growth picks up. On the other hand, if inflation rises, even if the Fed raises rates slightly, the real, or inflation-corrected, interest rate might actually be lower, not higher. Confused? That is understandable: This line of thinking might lead us into a muddle very quickly. But don\u2019t be surprised if you hear circuitous commentary like this in the weeks ahead.Then again, the prevailing wisdom might be reflected in yet another common argument, which may be summarized in one word: boring. The markets already know everything there is to know about rates, or so this line of thinking goes, and because a rate increase is expected it should already be \u201cdiscounted into\u201d current share prices. This is a very simple version of the efficient markets theory, which holds that all available information is already fully reflected in market prices, so only true surprises really matter.All of which is to say that we don\u2019t know what will happen if and when the Fed raises rates. And the problem becomes much more complicated when you include human psychology in your economic analysis, as we try to do in the emerging field of behavioral finance. In fact, from a psychological perspective, the whole efficient markets idea that only real surprises matter and there should be no reaction to \u201cnews\u201d that is well known in advance is a little off base. People often don\u2019t know in advance how they will react until news becomes real.In the near zero-interest-rate environment of recent years, people have naturally searched for alternative investments, and that may have led them into wishful thinking. People might be viewing high prices in the stock and housing markets as evidence of the inherent worth of these assets, disregarding the role that low interest rates have played in bolstering those prices. Some people have undoubtedly taken personal pleasure in their investing success, interpreting it as proof of their own self-worth. Identity and ego may be an issue, and that can be very dangerous.People may have strong reactions when their identity is connected to things that turn out to be disappointing, after the initial reason for their excitement is gone. After the financial crisis in 2008, for example, many highfliers found that their identities as smart stock pickers or home buyers were severely challenged. It could happen again. But I\u2019m afraid we will just have to wait and see.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Slips on Oil\u2019s Big Drop ", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks & BondsOil futures of American benchmark crude settled at $35.62 a barrel, down 3.1 percent, their lowest level since December 2008. At the time, during the depth of the recession, they dropped as low as $32.40 a barrel.The drop on Friday pushed down the stocks of energy companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Baker Hughes, the rig and oil services company. But the sell-off was broad, with all 10 sectors of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ending down.By the end of the day, the S.&P. 500 had lost 39.86 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,012.37. That put it down 3.8 percent for the week, its worst showing since August.The Dow industrial average was down 310 points, or 1.8 percent, to 17,265.21. The Nasdaq declined 111.71 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,933.47.Investors shifted money into government bonds, especially Treasuries. The yield on the 10-year note skidded to 2.13 percent from 2.23 percent late Thursday, a big move. The reasons for the sustained decline in oil this week \u2014 and through much of the year \u2014 differ from seven years ago, when economies around the world screeched to a halt. Now, demand is growing but energy markets are reacting to a glut of oil, driven in part by the strategy of Saudi Arabia and other major producers to pump flat out.\u201cThere is incredible bearishness about the short-run prospects for oil as well as for the long-run prospects for oil,\u201d said Jan Stuart, chief energy economist at Credit Suisse. \u201cWhat\u2019s the old saying \u2014 there are more sellers than buyers.\u201dOil prices have dropped by nearly two-thirds in the past 16 months, but there were fresh developments behind this week\u2019s decline. Talk that a ban on oil exports from the United States might be lifted and the victory of the opposition party in Venezuela were both interpreted as events that would encourage more production in the next few years.But the biggest fundamental change in the oil market remains the decision by Saudi Arabia to force high-cost energy producers, particularly shale producers in the United States, out of the market by driving down prices.Instead of acting as a swing producer and curtailing its output to keep prices from dropping, Saudi Arabia has focused instead on preserving its market share. The predictable result is a glut of oil that has filled up inventories.Meeting in Vienna with other producers of the OPEC cartel last week, Saudi Arabia signaled once again that its full-tilt strategy would remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.\u201cWhat happened last week gave a green light to sell,\u201d Mr. Stuart said.The sustained drop in prices is starting to be felt among United States producers. For instance, the number of active rigs fell by the most in two months this week, according to Baker Hughes. The International Energy Agency also said on Friday that low prices were starting to take a toll on high-cost producers.But the agency also said oil supplies were still expected to grow next year, which provided more incentive for sellers Friday.\u201cThere is evidence the Saudi-led strategy is starting to work,\u201d the agency said in its monthly energy report. Still, it concluded \u201cthere will still be a lot of oil weighing on the market\u201d in 2016.For consumers, the drop in oil has been a boon. Still, the energy agency warned of the long-term consequences of low energy prices. \u201cSustained low prices will not necessarily create benefits for importing countries in the longer run as it could complicate the transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obscure Corner of Wall St. Draws Skepticism From Investors", "Date": "2015-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost companies listed on American stock exchanges are conventional, familiar businesses like Apple or Exxon Mobil, but the stock market also contains many obscure, even mysterious, specialized sectors that operate with much less public awareness.In recent months, one of those groups of specialty firms has been drawing attention as controversy has increased over some of its tactics and results.Known as business development companies, or B.D.C.s, the firms were created by Congress in 1980 to encourage investment in small businesses whose growth may generate jobs. They sell stock to the public and then use some of the proceeds to make loans to emerging businesses for a variety of needs.The category has grown tenfold over the last decade, to $64 billion in assets. That is partly because business development companies offer higher yields in exchange for the high-risk nature of their assets, and partly because they cater to a market that big banks have retreated from since the financial crisis.In the last four months, several business development companies have become targets of activist or dissident investors who are dissatisfied over management and performance issues and are waging proxy contests or seeking sales. In September, one company, TICC Capital faced multiple challenges to its plan to sell its asset manager to another concern. In October, an investor demanded that another, KCAP Financial, be sold. In November, the activist investor Elliott Management challenged a spinoff plan by a third, American Capital. And a shareholder of a fourth company, FifthStreet Finance, started a proxy challenge seeking three board seats.One of the most criticized business development companies, however, is Prospect Capital.With $6.6 billion in assets, Prospect is a large player in the category. But in the last year and a half, its stock price and net-asset value per share have been steadily sinking. Even before the recent junk-bond market upheaval, Prospect and three of the other business development companies being challenged have traded at discounts to net-asset-value of more than 30 percent this year, well below the average of less than 20 percent for such firms.Some analysts have accused Prospect of charging what they say are conspicuously high fees, even as investor returns have faltered. And others have taken issue with the compensation paid its chief executive, John F. Barry III \u2014 more than $100 million annually in recent years, according to estimates by former employees and an outside analyst.By comparison, Malon Wilkus, chief executive of the largest internally managed business development company, American Capital, earned $16.9 million in 2014. Prospect\u2019s president, M. Grier Eliasek, and the firm\u2019s head of investor relations, Michael Cimini, who talked enthusiastically about Prospect\u2019s stock and its 12 to 13 percent dividend in interviews they initiated in January, did not respond to emails and phone messages seeking comment on questions about Prospect\u2019s performance.Not all such companies have disappointed investors. Main Street Capital, for one, trades at a 40 percent premium, based on the steady growth of a more sustainable dividend in the 6 percent range, lower fees and returns which topped the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in three of the five years that ended in 2014.The reversal of fortune at Prospect is striking, given its promising start.The firm went public as Prospect Energy in 2004 after a $121 million offering at $15 a share. It specialized in investments in energy firms and rode a surge in energy prices that peaked in 2008. It also made a shrewd $201 million acquisition in 2009 of Patriot Capital Funding, a specialty finance company, at a 54 percent discount to book value.The stock price rose to $18.79 in late 2006, and in total returns, it beat the S.&P. 500 in three of its first four calendar years as a public company, according to the research firm Morningstar.But since then, the stock price has fallen by 61 percent. Prospect has twice cut its dividend, which is now $1 a share, from its peak of $1.62 in 2009. And despite reducing its exposure to energy investments, its returns have trailed the S.& P. 500 in all but one year since 2008.Some investors who specialize in business development companies avoid Prospect stock partly because, they said, the firm inflates the fees it pays its management firm, Prospect Capital Management, a separate company owned largely by Mr. Barry.\u201cThey have earned incentive fees even though they have lost shareholder value on a per-share basis,\u201d said David Miyazaki, who focuses on specialty finance companies at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis.Prospect\u2019s fees, like those of many business development companies, are similar to those of private equity funds. Its external manager charges a 2 percent annual management fee on all assets plus an incentive fee of 20 percent of certain income gains \u2014 and administrative expenses \u2014 at the high end of the sector. For its fiscal year that ended in June, the Barry-owned manager received fees and expenses totaling $240 million, or about 3.5 percent of its total assets, according to the company\u2019s annual report.Some analysts say Prospect has often paid out dividends above its earnings, and sold stock below its book value, both of which can hurt investors. Both moves have helped Prospect raise its assets tenfold since 2008, also increasing fees.\u201cDividends in excess of earnings aren\u2019t really dividends, they are returns of investors\u2019 capital, and they lead directly to falling net asset value per share,\u201d David B. Golub, chief executive of Golub Capital BDC, a low-fee competitor, said about business development companies in general.Since 2007, Prospect\u2019s net asset value per share, or book value, has fallen 33 percent to $10.17, partly because of the high dividends.Some analysts have also objected to various tactics they say allow Prospect to inflate income, increasing incentive fees due its manager. For example, Prospect charges above-market interest rates to some companies it controls and receives some of the interest in noncash debt securities that count toward current incentive fees \u2014 leaving shareholders at risk of nonpayment.Four Prospect companies pay interest of 20 percent or more on debt they owe Prospect \u2014 typically 10 percent in cash and 10 percent in noncash pay-in-kind debt, according to its reports.In an August call with a Prospect staff banker who questioned imposing such high rates on the companies, Mr. Barry described the interest payments as \u201ca brand new road freshly paved to have net investment income come in to Prospect,\u201d according to a record of the call. By contrast, he said, with an equity interest in the same company, \u201cyou get to walk across a minefield\u201d before earning profits.The son of a partner at the law firm of Lord Day & Lord, Mr. Barry, who is in his mid-60s, had what he sometimes alludes to as a \u201csilver spoon\u201d upbringing, graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton and Harvard Law School. He joined Prospect Capital Management in 1990 after stints at a law firm and two investment banks.Mr. Barry works mainly from his home in Riverside, Conn., often coming into Prospect headquarters near Bryant Park in Manhattan on Fridays. He generally conducts business remotely, via email and lengthy phone calls with groups of employees.Starting last summer, Prospect and other business development companies experienced a series of adverse events.In early 2014, Prospect suspended its stock and bond sales for a few months pending a review of its accounting by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which required Prospect to clarify the accounting for its owned subsidiaries.Business development company stocks were also hit last year when several big index providers dropped them, based on regulatory guidance requiring index mutual funds to reflect their hefty fees in the index funds\u2019 own fees. This year, they fell further as concerns grew about energy exposure and rising future defaults.Some investors say the wide discounts to book value represent a good buying opportunity, especially with activist investors popping up. The whole business development sector is \u201con sale,\u201d said Gregg T. Abella, an adviser at Investment Partners Asset Management in Metuchen, N.J. Prospect, he added, \u201clooks cheap to me\u201d based on its earnings, income and low energy exposure.In December 2014, Prospect said it would cut its dividend a second time. With its shares down 34 percent in the last 17 months, Prospect has curtailed new stock sales. As a result, growth of its assets slowed to 5 percent in its latest fiscal year from an annual rate of 58 percent over the previous five years.One reason for Prospect\u2019s big discount to net-asset value, now 28 percent, is that some investors are skeptical of the value Prospect reports for some assets.Robert Dodd, a Raymond James analyst, said he had not had a buy rating on the stock since 2008. Given all the questions and unknowns, he said, \u201cthere is no price at which I would be a buyer of Prospect.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B. Announces Further Stimulus Measures, but Investors Are Unimpressed", "Date": "2015-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the reaction to stimulus measures the central bank announced on Thursday \u2014 steps more timid than had been widely expected \u2014 suggested that Mr. Draghi somehow miscommunicated with the traders, pundits and prognosticators who set the course of financial markets.Around Europe, stock prices fell on Thursday after the central bank said it would extend its program of buying bonds and other assets by six months but would not raise the amount of monthly purchases. The central bank also changed a key interest rate to encourage banks to lend more, but did not cut key borrowing rates.Based on recent statements by Mr. Draghi and other top officials at the European Central Bank, investors had thought there would be much, much more.\u201cHe typically has underpromised and overdelivered,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, practice head for Europe at the consultancy firm Eurasia Group. \u201cThat is not the case this time around. What we\u2019ve got is the bare minimum of what people were expecting.\u201dIt was either a rare case of Mr. Draghi failing to send clear enough signals, or a sign that his proposals had met unexpected resistance among the 25 members of European Central Bank\u2019s Governing Council, which met in Frankfurt on Thursday morning. At a news conference explaining the new steps, Mr. Draghi would say only that the moves had been approved by a \u201cvery large majority\u2019\u2019 of the Governing Council.The central bank is trying to give the lumbering eurozone economy a shove at the same time the Federal Reserve is getting ready to risk slowing down the United States economy by raising interest rates.The eurozone economy grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the third quarter \u2014 compared with a 2.1 percent rate in the United States. And unemployment across the 19-country euro currency union is 10.7 percent \u2014 more than double the United States\u2019s jobless figure.Mr. Draghi rebutted reporters\u2019 questions about why the new measures seemed more limited than what the economy might need. He described the steps as a recalibration of the central bank\u2019s stimulus program, which he said had been a success since it began in March.\u201cWe are doing more because it works, not because it fails,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to consolidate something that has been a success.\u201dBut some analysts said that Mr. Draghi had probably been unable to win over members of the Governing Council who think more stimulus is unnecessary, or who want to keep some monetary weapons in reserve in case the economic situation gets worse. Mr. Draghi acknowledged that terrorist attacks in Paris, along with the European influx of migrants from Syria, presented risks to the eurozone economy that are not yet possible to gauge.\u201cDraghi is now evidently coming up against more opposition,\u201d J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said in a note to clients. Mr. Draghi \u201cdoes not have sufficient support within the E.C.B. Council to act on a grand scale,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00e4mer said.The Governing Council did decide to extend monthly purchases of government bonds and other assets, a way of pumping money into the economy, at least through March 2017.The bank also said it would increase the penalty it charges banks to keep money in its vaults as a way of pressuring them to lend more. Banks will pay interest of 0.3 percent to keep money at the central bank, compared with the previous rate of 0.2 percent.And the central bank expanded its purchases of bonds to include debt issued by regional and local governments.But the central bank did not announce an outright increase in its monthly spending on bonds beyond the current level of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, as many analysts had expected. And though it said it would be spending more as it reinvests repayments of principal from the bonds and other assets it acquires, the central bank provided no estimate of how big those receipts might be.Nor did it take other steps on interest rates that might encourage commercial banks to increase lending that might help revive the nearly dormant eurozone economy. Some analysts had expected a cut in the rate that banks pay to borrow short-term funds from the central bank. Their hope had been that the rate would drop to zero from its current 0.05 percent.The bond-buying program was originally planned to run at least through September 2016. Mr. Draghi said on Thursday that it could be extended beyond March 2017, \u201cif necessary.\u201dThe Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone equities, a key indicator, began falling even as Mr. Draghi was still speaking and ended the day off 3.6 percent. The euro rose more than 2 percent against the dollar, to $1.09, as investors raised their expectations of the returns they are likely to receive on money kept in European assets.A stronger euro is generally negative for the eurozone economy because it makes exports from the region more expensive for foreign customers. In addition, the central bank is trying to make market interest rates go down. A stronger euro means investors expect the rates to go up.Mr. Draghi had signaled in recent months that he was dissatisfied with the performance of the eurozone economy and that the central bank would intensify its already significant efforts to energize the economy and raise the region\u2019s worrisomely low inflation to a healthier level. Whether the measures announced on Thursday will make a difference remains to be seen.Eurozone inflation, at an annual rate of only 0.1 percent in November, is far below the European Central Bank\u2019s official target of just below 2 percent. Mr. Draghi and other members of the bank\u2019s governing council had all but promised that more stimulus measures would be coming on Thursday unless there was a substantial improvement in economic data.To skeptical questions from reporters on why the central bank was not doing more, in light of the recent data, Mr. Draghi defended the measures and the effects of the stimulus program so far.He said that eurozone government bond yields, a measure of governments\u2019 borrowing costs, had fallen since the stimulus program began, and that commercial bank lending rates were also lower.Economists are skeptical that the bank\u2019s stimulus measures so far have had a substantial effect on increasing the availability of credit in the eurozone, which is one of the program\u2019s goals. Many banks have other problems, like large numbers of troubled loans, that are keeping them from lending, no matter how cheaply they can borrow from the central bank.\u201cAll these measures have had an effect on the economy,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think our communication was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThese measures need time to be fully appreciated.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

For instance, a 10-bullet magazine can be quickly removed by pressing the tip of a loose bullet into a recessed button, allowing for a high-capacity magazine to be inserted in its place. A vast majority of guns used in 19 recent mass shootings were bought legally and with a federal background check.This release feature \u2014 called a \u201cbullet button\u201d \u2014 is installed, legally, by gun manufacturers on rifles sold in California; the high-capacity magazine is illegal in the state.Other restricted features, like pistol grips and folding stocks \u2014 which allow greater control of the weapon while firing for a long period of time \u2014 can also be added to some guns after their sale.The police in San Bernardino said Thursday that the husband-and-wife suspects, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, had at least four high-capacity magazines and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. Law enforcement specialists who briefed congressional officials on Thursday said that Mr. Farook bought two pistols legally and that another person bought the two .223-caliber rifles \u2014 a DPMS A-15 and Smith & Wesson M&P15 \u2014 legally.The weapons were purchased in 2011 and 2012, but the briefers did not specify which were bought when. It is not clear how those two guns ended up with the couple, and whether the seller complied with laws requiring that gun purchases go through a licensed dealer to ensure a background check is conducted.Times readers responded by the thousands to a simple question: How often, if ever, do you think about the possibility of a shooting in your daily life?\u201cThere\u2019s a substitution effect,\u201d said Mr. Michel, who counts among his clients the National Rifle Association. \u201cIf you ban Rifle X, people will use Rifle Y.

More than 100,000 such weapons are registered.A bullet, for this purpose, is considered \u201ca tool\u201d because it can be pushed into the recessed button created by gun manufacturers in order to continue selling semiautomatic rifles legally in California, said Lindsay Nichols, a senior lawyer at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, based in San Francisco.\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThe intent of the Legislature was clearly to prohibit assault weapons, but the gun manufacturers have exploited a loophole in the law. It means that a whole set of guns that should be banned in California are still available.\u201dGun makers argue that the bullet button was approved by state officials in 2000 and should not be viewed as a loophole. Rather, it was \u201csimply the industry trying to comply with the State of California\u2019s law and regulations\u201d in order to continue selling a popular firearm, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents manufacturers.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Deal Between Dow and DuPont Could Create Value", "Date": "2015-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe biggest benefit might be that asset rejiggering would allow costs to be slashed. That may be what investors who pushed up both companies\u2019 shares by more than 10 percent on Wednesday are counting on.Merging two sprawling companies seems counterintuitive, especially given the involvement of activist investors like Daniel S. Loeb at Dow and Nelson Peltz at DuPont. Such agitators typically detest conglomerates, partly because they often suffer from a valuation discount.But the appeal of the deal is not creating one supersize agglomeration out of two old-school blue chip companies. It\u2019s what could come next: The two companies\u2019 collection of assets would be separated into three entities focused on agriculture, materials and specialty chemicals.Such a divvying up is consistent with recent activist thinking. Companies with more clearly defined businesses can be an easier sell with investors. They are often easier to manage. The agricultural spinoff, for example, could focus on the biology needed to create new seeds. The specialty chemical offshoot would be more about chemistry. And the materials business would worry about securing the cheap gas it needs to make plastics and other products.There might be financial benefits from all of that, but in this case, it does not look as if there is a big conglomerate discount that would evaporate. The sum of the parts of the two companies, based on peers\u2019 valuation multiples, is not far from where their stocks trade.But combining related pieces of Dow and DuPont would allow hefty cost savings. CNBC reported that the two companies might find $3 billion of annual synergies. At roughly 3 percent of combined sales, that sounds plausible. The present value of these, taxed and capitalized on a multiple of 10, would be $20 billion or more.Investors added about $12 billion to the combined market value of the two firms on Wednesday. That leaves room for upside, but caution is appropriate. No deal has been announced, and a merger of two big companies followed by a split into three could easily run into trouble. One early challenge would be to make the chemistry work.\u00a0Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Proposed Extension of Tax Credits for Renewable Energy Would Have Uneven Effect", "Date": "2015-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut even as renewable energy stocks rallied \u2014 SolarCity\u2019s shares surged more than 40 percent \u2014 and advocates and executives cheered, some sectors of the industry appeared to benefit more than others.The solar and wind industries got much of what they wanted, energy specialists said, while some technologies, like fuel cell storage and geothermal, were largely left off the table. Biofuels were somewhere in the middle.For the solar industry, the proposed extension, up for action in Congress this week, is better than many executives and analysts had expected. For example, the investment tax credit for solar projects, which was to fall to 10 percent at the end of 2016, is to stay at 30 percent until 2019, then gradually decline to 10 percent by 2022. And, in another gain, projects will be required only to begin construction, rather than operation, as is the case now, to qualify for the credit.The effect, specialists say, will be to make large, commercial-scale projects more viable, like the roughly two gigawatts\u2019 worth scheduled to come online in Texas for 2017.For example, Tony Clifford, chief executive of Standard Solar, a developer and builder based in Rockville, Md., said that the company had passed up or abandoned close to $100 million worth of business, including a large wastewater treatment plant in the Midwest, because it did not think it could get them up and running by the end of 2016. Now he is hopeful that if the legislation passes as proposed, some of that business could return.In addition, said Shayle Kann, who leads GTM Research, more states, including Ohio, Illinois and Florida, could become strong residential markets for solar by the end of the decade.\u201cThe market wasn\u2019t going to disappear,\u201d without an extension of the 30 percent solar investment tax credit, he said. \u201cWhat you weren\u2019t going to have is the bunch of new states pick up that are going to become economically viable over the next few years. The big impact for distributed solar is just more geographic diversity.\u201dWind industry executives and proponents were similarly bullish about how the extension would affect them. The production tax credit, which expired at the end of 2014, is to be extended retroactively through 2016 and then decline in value each year until it is phased out in 2020. The five-year step-down offers one of the longest periods of certainty in more than a decade.In the near term, developers may proceed with projects that had stalled in the face of questions about meeting federal construction requirements, said Michael Garland, chief executive of Pattern Energy. But longer term, the new time horizon would help the industry to continue bringing costs closer to those of conventional fuels, even cheap natural gas.\u201cThe manufacturers know the goal they have to get to,\u201d Mr. Garland said, \u201cand we can push them a bit to get there.\u201dNonetheless, he said, the industry would still not end up on a level playing field with conventional fuels, which have access to tax advantages that wind does not, or solar, which would largely retain a permanent 10 percent investment tax credit.But Lee Peterson, a senior tax manager in the Renewable Energy Industry Practice at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said the differences among the industries made sense, given that wind developments benefit from much larger economies of scale and have had access to subsidies and development financing longer than solar.\u201cEven a massive solar system is still dramatically smaller than a wind project \u2014 it\u2019s sort of like comparing the difference between a bus and a fleet of taxi cabs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it makes sense that they would have different treatments.\u201dThe inclusion of biofuel incentives, while welcome, seemed unlikely to give those fuels as big a boost as the incentives aimed at conventional oil, which will stay in place longer, said Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. A tax credit for producers of cellulosic biofuels applies only to gallons produced and sold, so while it will help companies that have plants up and running, it would have a limited ability to spur the development of more.\u201cA company like DuPont that is just now opening up a commercial-size facility in Nevada, Iowa, is given a real opportunity to sell that product competitively,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be up and running and producing before you\u2019re going to see any benefit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dow Chemical and DuPont Set Merger and Plans to Split", "Date": "2015-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet all the work of those bankers and lawyers in combining two industrial titans, with a shared history of more than three centuries, will ultimately go toward a much bigger goal: breaking up the newly united chemical company.As Dow and DuPont formally announced their merger, the two companies made clear that they intend to separate into three companies, a path expected to be littered with complex deals, thousands of job cuts and months of government scrutiny.It is a path that DuPont\u2019s chief executive of two months, Edward D. Breen, has trod before, having previously broken up Tyco into three pieces. And it is the culmination of the dream of his counterpart at Dow, Andrew Liveris, who has long sought a huge deal to strengthen his own company.Mr. Liveris wasted no time in calling his fellow chief executive after Mr. Breen was named DuPont\u2019s interim chief in early October.\u201cWhen the board asked me to step in as C.E.O., Andrew called me that day,\u201d Mr. Breen said in a phone interview. \u201cI chuckled because I knew why he was calling.\u201dThe two met the following Sunday and spent the afternoon discussing logistics. Mr. Liveris initially proposed merging and splitting into two companies, and Mr. Breen said three. Three it would be.What the two devised is what they describe as a merger of equals, putting together DuPont, the 213-year-old inventor of Kevlar, with Dow, the 118-year-old maker of plastics and chemicals. Shareholders of each company are expected to own half of the newly combined business \u2014 to be called DowDuPont \u2014 while the combined corporation will maintain headquarters in both Wilmington, Del., and Midland, Mich.Mr. Liveris would become the executive chairman of the combined company, while Mr. Breen would become the chief executive.Yet the new company, which garnered roughly $83 billion in pro forma sales last year, may not exist in its huge form for long. After the merger closes, which is expected to be during the third quarter next year, the business will be split up in 2018.What will emerge are three business: one specializing in agricultural chemicals, with $19 billion in pro forma sales last year; one in plastics and other materials, with $51 billion in annual revenue; and a third in specialty products like those for electronics and nutrition, which would have about $13 billion in annual sales.Of those businesses, agriculture has received the most attention. Once combined, the two companies would command about 25 percent of the agriculture market, according to Argus Research. Regulators may require minor divestitures, but nothing that should jeopardize the deal, said people briefed on the deal discussions, who asked for anonymity because the talks were private.Farmers \u2014 the end customers of Dow and DuPont\u2019s products, who are already worried about rising prices \u2014 could still feel an effect.\u201cJust a handful of large chemical companies including Dow and DuPont already control most of the seed supply used to grow crops like corn and soybeans,\u201d said Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit organization, said in an emailed statement. \u201cAny merger that consolidates this market into fewer hands will give farmers fewer choices and put them at even more economic disadvantage.\u201dJob reductions are expected to result from the merger, as well. Dow employs 53,000 people, while DuPont had 63,000 employees at the end of 2014.The companies did not discuss layoffs in their announcement, but DuPont, in a separate statement, said it expected to record a charge before taxes of $780 million, consisting of roughly $650 million in employee separation costs. DuPont said 10 percent of its global work force would be affected.In all, the companies plan to strip away more than $3 billion in costs from the deal and say there are potential growth synergies of $1 billion.Under the terms of the merger, Dow shareholders would receive one share of the new combined company for each of their shares, while DuPont shareholders would receive 1.282 shares for each. Under the merger\u2019s exchange ratio, DuPont shareholders would receive $68.43 a share, based on Friday\u2019s closing stock price, or a total of roughly $60 billion. The companies said the new company would have a combined market capitalization of $130 billion.The work of dividing the combined company will not wait until after the transaction closes. In many ways, it has already begun. The companies have already formed groups to design the separation. Mr. Breen will lead the agriculture and specialty products committee, while Mr. Liveris will lead the material science committee.The two said that finding the right people for each of the three divisions will be a major focus.\u201cWho leads the companies is what\u2019s going to create the value,\u201d Mr. Breen said. \u201cHaving done this many times in my life, we know that you have to get the management.\u201dWhile DuPont argued that its stock had outperformed traditional measures like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, Trian said that the company had not cut enough costs and had repeatedly missed financial performance targets.On Friday, a Trian representative said, \u201cTrian fully supports this transformative transaction and believes that the combination of DuPont and Dow is a great outcome for all shareholders.\u201dOther investors were not as enthusiastic. Shares of Dow fell 2.8 percent to $53.37, while DuPont shares slumped 5.5 percent to $70.44. Both stocks, however, had surged on Wednesday after reports that the companies were in advanced talks.Dow also said on Friday that it planned to restructure its ownership with Dow Corning by becoming a full owner, up from a 50-50 joint venture. The law firm Shearman & Sterling is advising Dow on the Dow Corning restructuring, while Kirkland & Ellis advised Corning.Among Dow\u2019s advisers in the deal with DuPont are Michael S. Klein, a former Citigroup rainmaker who has since helped lead multibillion-dollar mergers on his own; Lazard; Morgan Stanley; and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges.DuPont turned to Evercore Partners, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

{"Headline": "Spoofing Case Shows Fine Line Between Fair and Fraud", "Date": "2015-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe more complex a system is \u2014 the federal tax code, for example \u2014 the easier it will be to exploit. The financial markets have become much more fragmented in the last 20 years, which has led the Securities and Exchange Commission to start trying to crack down on those who try to profit from the complexity.But it can be difficult to separate out those who play the loopholes in the system to their advantage from someone engaging in fraud. Just ask any tax lawyer, who will tell you there sometimes is not all that much difference between good planning and improper avoidance.Trading in stocks and options takes place on 11 exchanges and dozens of alternative trading systems that have become so highly automated that most orders are entered and filled in milliseconds. Trading that was once done by telephone and reported on a ticker tape hours later has been transformed into lightening execution by firms looking to exploit price discrepancies of less than a penny.What has developed in the securities markets is the \u201cmaker-taker\u201d model for pricing in which exchanges pay rebates to draw orders that add liquidity to the market, called the maker, and impose an access fee, which can be no more than 30 cents per 100 shares, for orders that remove liquidity, the taker. The typical rebate is 20 cents for a 100 share order, so the exchange makes money by seeking out a roughly equal number of maker and taker orders, giving it about 10 cents for each trade of 100 shares.This pricing structure has drawn criticism because it creates a potential conflict of interest for brokers to route customer orders to the market that pays generous rebates, which can result in higher costs for investors even though they get the best price. It has also led to a proliferation of different types of orders that go far beyond the basics of a market or limit order to attract firms to trade there. For example, there are \u201cmarket to limit\u201d orders or \u201cauction-only\u201d orders intended to draw high-frequency trading firms seeking out rebates to supplement their trading profits.The charges against the Afshar brothers and Mr. Kenny reflect how they played the markets to take advantage of the rebate system. One tactic involved using the rules for filling options orders that give priority to ordinary customers ahead of professional traders and impose lower fees on their trades. The exchanges put this in place because they want to give a small measure of protection to individual investors from the sophisticated firms that look for every slight advantage.Qualifying as a customer means placing no more than 390 options orders per day. If that number is exceeded, then at the end of the quarter the designation of \u201cprofessional\u201d is attached to the account and its orders do not receive priority treatment.The defendants created two limited liability companies and told their broker that they were separately owned by each of the twin brothers when, according to the S.E.C., Behruz Afshar had an ownership interest in both. One company would engage in heavy trading until it was designated as a professional, and then they would shift their trading to the other to have its orders designated as receiving customer priority. By switching back and forth, they received about $2 million worth of rebates and fee reductions.The second way they generated rebates involved figuring out how to enter large \u201cAON orders,\u201d or all-or-nothing orders, at a price just above or below the current market price that was not displayed to other traders. They would then place a small order on the opposite side to try to attract others to put in similar orders so that their AON order would be filled, then canceling the small order once the larger one was filled. Under the exchange\u2019s rules, this was a \u201cmaker\u201d order that qualified for a rebate, generating about $225,000.The S.E.C. described this as spoofing, a tactic that has recently drawn more attention from market regulators looking to put a stop to practices aimed at fooling others into trading by entering orders with the intent of quickly canceling them to give the impression of greater market activity than actually exists.In spoofing cases, the victims are other traders who were misled by the orders resulting in losses or at least higher costs. But in this case, it is the exchanges that are the immediate victims, even though they are the ones that set up the system of rebates and order types that allowed this to take place.What the Afshars and Mr. Kenny did can be seen in one way as taking \u201cfront cuts\u201d \u2013 as we used to call it in elementary school \u2013 to get their trades executed before others and reap the benefits that come from being first. At what point does that constitute securities fraud rather than just a sharp practice exploiting a gap in programs created by the exchanges to strengthen their own business?The actual trades were not fraudulent because the Afshars and Mr. Kenny completed the transactions, so the exchanges got the liquidity they sought in exchange for the rebates and reduced fees. The S.E.C.\u2019s cases focuses on the tactics used to take advantage of the rebates being offered and priority afforded to smaller investors, not the message sent out by the orders that might have deceived investors about the market.The Afshars and Mr. Kenny figured out a way to make their trading more valuable by using marketing tools employed by the exchanges to increase their volume of transactions. There is no requirement that exchanges provide rebates or allow for so many different order types.The fact that the defendants were able to take advantage of the rules that cost exchanges more than $2 million certainly gives the appearance of being deceptive. One instant message cited by the S.E.C. quotes Behruz Afshar telling another trader that \u201cyou should see all the [expletive] we are doing here . . . too funny.\u201dMore than anything else, the case focuses on whether going too far in taking advantage of the rules is a violation by customers trolling the markets for any edge. If it does, then this is another warning shot to traders that they must tread carefully when using strategies intended to exploit the market.Advertisement"}
