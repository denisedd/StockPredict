{"Headline": "European Court Upholds British View on Euro Clearinghouses", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In a judgment with political and financial ramifications, a European court on Wednesday ruled that the European Central Bank cannot require financial houses that clear trades of euro-denominated securities to be in eurozone countries.The central bank had defended the geographical requirement as a policy statement rather than a rule it would try to enforce. But Britain, which is part of the European Union but uses its own currency, the pound, challenged the central bank in the General Court, Europe\u2019s second-highest.The British government, seeking to protect London as a global financial hub, had feared that big clearinghouses like LCH.Clearnet might come under pressure to shift some of its euro-denominated operations to cities on the European Continent, like Paris. Significant sums of money could be at stake. In 2013, LCH Clearnet alone had revenue of 380 million euros, or about $425 million.The legal action had become something of a political test case for Britain, where a public debate is underway about how much influence the country has and should have within the European Union \u2014 and even, among some politicians, whether Britain should remain part of the bloc.British policy makers have also long suspected that rival financial centers in Frankfurt and Paris would try to take advantage of Britain\u2019s self-exclusion from the euro currency union to lure business from London. Clearinghouses, including the London operations of CME Clearing Europe and ICE Clear Europe, are intermediaries in trades like stocks, bonds or derivatives and ensure that transactions are completed even if one party fails to honor its obligations.After the court ruling was announced, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described it as a \u201cmajor win for Britain and a major win for all those who want to see a European economy that is both open and successful.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Osborne also argued that the ruling upheld the primacy of Europe\u2019s single market, which ensures the freedom to trade throughout the union, which has a population of around 500 million.\u201cWe have been consistently clear there needs to be a level playing field for all countries in Europe\u2019s single market, whether they are in the eurozone or not,\u201d Mr. Osborne said.The European Central Bank said in a statement on Wednesday that it would \u201ccarefully consider the General Court\u2019s judgment and decide on the way forward as soon as such analysis will be completed.\u201dWednesday\u2019s ruling came at a sensitive time in Britain. A general election is set for May, and Prime Minister David Cameron has promised that, if re-elected, he will hold a referendum by 2017 on British membership in the European Union.Critics of the bloc would have gained fresh ammunition had the ruling, from the Luxembourg-based General Court of the European Union, gone the other way.Underlying Mr. Osborne\u2019s legal challenge was a worry that, as the 19-nation eurozone integrates more closely after its debt crisis, Britain will be increasingly marginalized.Even supporters of British membership in the European Union sometimes fear that divisions between those inside and outside the eurozone could undermine the bloc\u2019s single market \u2014 a key attraction for the British.At issue was a policy laid out by the European Central Bank in July 2011, which said that bodies that settle euro-denominated transactions should be legally incorporated in the euro area. Full managerial and operational control and responsibility, overall core functions, should be exercised from within that single currency zone, it suggested.The European Central Bank argued that oversight would be easier if clearing houses with a net daily credit exposure of more than 5 billion euros, or about $5.6 billion, were in the eurozone.The court ruled that such a requirement went beyond oversight and strayed into regulation. The court concluded that the central bank did not have the legal right to regulate the activity of securities clearing systems.The ruling was welcomed by Britain\u2019s main business lobby organization, the Confederation of British Industry, whose director general, John Cridland, described it as a \u201clandmark judgment upholding the E.U.\u2019s single market, setting the boundaries of what the E.C.B. can do to support the eurozone without the agreement of non-euro member states.\u201dIntegration of the eurozone \u201ccannot and should not compromise the principle of the single market,\u201d Mr. Cridland added.But there was a more skeptical reaction from Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Business for Britain, an organization that wants a renegotiation of the terms of Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union and a referendum on whether to stay.Mr. Elliott described the ruling as \u201cgood news\u201d but added, \u201cit\u2019s a pity that the U.K. was forced to resort to such drastic measures in the first place.\u201d\u201cWe have a wider battle to win to protect our position as a non-eurozone member state, and we need to vehemently resist any attempts to introduce this policy via the other European institutions,\u201d he said.The European Central Bank could appeal, on legal points, to Europe\u2019s top court, the European Court of Justice, which is also in Luxembourg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigerian Army Noticeably Absent in Town Taken From Boko Haram", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA helicopter transported Chadian troops in Damasak, northern Nigeria. Soldiers from Chad and Niger liberated the town from Boko Haram after a fierce firefight that stretched into this week.The other unmistakable sign of the Islamist militants\u2019 recent presence is that very few residents remain in a once-thriving town of 200,000. They have either fled to the state capital, Maiduguri, or been killed by Boko Haram. Every looted and battered storefront yawns open to the dusty roadside.Mostly, the only sound in the hot, still air is from military vehicles, carrying soldiers from the neighboring countries of Chad and Niger as they make their way through the wreckage of the deadly five-month Islamist occupation of this Nigerian town. From time to time, the Chadian soldiers ululate to celebrate their victory against the militants in a fierce firefight that stretched into last week.The Chadians ushered a small group of journalists around for a brief look last week, offering a rare glimpse into the group\u2019s northern Nigerian stronghold, and into the dimensions, and difficulties, of a cross-border, four-nation fight against the Islamists.Rather than revealing important regional cooperation in the battle against Boko Haram, the visit pointed out some of the confusion and resentment creating tension among neighbors. The soldiers from Chad and Niger had succeeded here, but there was not a single Nigerian soldier to be found. The force members were bewildered to find themselves as foreign liberators without any help from the country benefiting from the liberation.Even as the Nigerian government, with a national election looming, insists that its forces have chased Boko Haram fighters out of much of their northern territory, the deserted streets and all-foreign force here paint a different picture. Hundreds of thousands of Nigerians still cannot return home to towns that have been, nominally at least, freed from Boko Haram.But the foreign soldiers here say they do not want to occupy somebody else\u2019s country, and worry that the Islamist fighters will simply return if they leave and the Nigerians have not arrived to take over.Hundreds of miles away in Ndjamena, the capital of Chad, officials are expressing anger at the near-total absence of cooperation from the Nigerians in a crucial regional battle, even as Nigerian officials are discounting the extent of Chad\u2019s role.The disquiet of the Chadian officials was echoed in the words of the front-line Chadian soldiers here who wonder why they, and not the Nigerians, are holding towns like Damasak, several days after the last Boko Haram fighter has fled or been killed.Maps showing the violent rise of the Islamist militant group that is waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria.\u201cWe asked them to come, to receive this town from us, but they have not come,\u201d said Second Lt. Mohammed Hassan, resting in the shade of the armored vehicle he had manned with his company.\u201cIt is because they are afraid,\u201d Lieutenant Hassan added, spitting out the words, his face half hidden against the 107-degree heat in a black turban.Around him hundreds of soldiers from Chad and Niger were camped out under the broiling sun. The senior Chadian officers tried to shoo away a handful of journalists, but a few of the soldiers, like the lieutenant, still wanted to talk about the battle.\u201cWe fought on the night of the 14th, and the last attack was on the 15th,\u201d Lieutenant Hassan said. As for the Nigerians, \u201cwe called them on the 16th\u201d \u2014 after the fight for Damasak had ended \u2014 \u201cand told them to come; they didn\u2019t believe we were here,\u201d Lieutenant Hassan said.More politely, his country\u2019s foreign minister, Moussa Faki Mahamat, two hours away by military transport plane and helicopter in Ndjamena, offered a similar appraisal in an interview Thursday.\u201cThe Nigerian Army has not succeeded in facing up to Boko Haram,\u201d Mr. Mahamat said.\u201cThe occupation of these towns, this is up to Nigeria,\u201d he added. \u201cMy fondest wish is that they assume their responsibilities.\u201dThe soldiers around Lieutenant Hassan, savoring their victory over Boko Haram, displayed a pile of battered rifles captured from the Islamists, some with Arabic exhortations on the stocks. The men said that they had thoroughly searched the looted town and its parched savanna surroundings in the days after the fighting and that there was not a single Boko Haram fighter to be found.The fight was definitely over, several of the men said with satisfaction, noting with wonder the strange fighting habits and beliefs of their opponents.\u201cYou would say that these are people ready to die, to commit suicide,\u201d Lieutenant Hassan said.He recounted how, after the battle, a Boko Haram prisoner seemed terrified by the Chadians\u2019 superior mat\u00e9riel \u2014 Chad has perhaps the region\u2019s best-equipped army after decades of war, civil and external. The captured fighter insisted that the lieutenant\u2019s armored personnel carrier was self-driving and ate its opponents.As a convoy of military vehicles rumbled down the deserted main street, a solitary older couple could be glimpsed at the back of a mud-walled compound. The woman raised clenched fists to the sky, despairingly, as the trucks passed. The soldiers said that the handful of people left in Damasak were simply too feeble to move.Since then, Damasak has become a regional headquarters for Boko Haram, officials in Maiduguri said. \u201cDamasak is where they were doing their planning and operational business,\u201d said an official close to the governor of Borno State, of which Maiduguri is the capital.The number of substantial buildings bearing the Boko Haram insignia was testimony to the town\u2019s strategic role for the group. \u201cThey were coordinating and doing all their training there,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Now Damasak, like much of northeastern Nigeria, is in a vacuum. Boko Haram has been chased away for now, but it is not clear that the Nigerian Army is ready to occupy and hold this and other towns.Underscoring that point, soldiers from Chad and Niger discovered on Friday what appeared to be a mass grave at the edge of town, and some of the bodies appeared to have been beheaded. Refugees from Boko Haram-controlled towns have said the group frequently decapitates young men.\u201cIt is up to them to hold the town, not us,\u201d said Lieutenant Hassan, referring to the Nigerians. \u201cOur role is offensive. Our mission is to chase the terrorists,\u201d he added.\u201cWe are ready to disengage, right away,\u201d said Mr. Mahamat, the Chadian foreign minister.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vivendi Chairman\u2019s Group Increases Stake in Company", "Date": "2015-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Vincent Bollor\u00e9, the chairman of the French media group Vivendi and one of France\u2019s richest men, appears to be gearing up for a fight.The family-controlled Bollor\u00e9 Group said on Friday that it had raised its stake in Vivendi in the face of attack from an American hedge fund that included demands that it turn over more money to shareholders and sell the Universal Music Group, the company behind artists like Katy Perry and Kanye West.Mr. Bollor\u00e9 \u201cmust see more value in Vivendi at the moment than he does in Havas,\u201d said Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s putting more of his money into Vivendi may convince shareholders that his interest there will be more closely aligned with theirs.\u201dThe statement on Friday did not explain Mr. Bollor\u00e9\u2019s rationale, and the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Vivendi\u2019s shares were trading at just under \u20ac23 on Friday; they are up about 21 percent over the last year.\u201cVivendi is undervalued relative to its intrinsic value of approximately \u20ac25-\u20ac27.50 per share and should restructure its capital allocation strategy to close the discount to its sum of the parts valuation,\u201d the American hedge fund said in a news release. The fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Vivendi argues that meeting the hedge fund\u2019s cash demand would reduce its flexibility and options for growth. It notes that last year it handed back \u20ac1.3 billion to shareholders and is planning to return an additional \u20ac5.7 billion over the next three years through a combination of dividends and stock buybacks.Universal Music is the world\u2019s biggest music company, last year generating about half of Vivendi\u2019s annual revenue of \u20ac10.1 billion. Universal Music represents, along with Canal Plus, the French pay-television business, almost all of what will be left of Vivendi after the company completes the asset disposals it has undertaken as part of its strategy of becoming a pure, global media company.A sale of the music unit would represent a rejection of that strategy and, in effect, a dismantling of the company. There are some who think that is precisely the point.\u201cI struggle to understand the logic\u201d in Vivendi\u2019s approach, Mr. Aspesi said. \u201cThis is Vivendi\u2019s third management team, dating back more than a decade, trying to find tangible synergies between the music business and the rest of the media portfolio. I\u2019m skeptical that they ever will.\u201dThe problem, he said, is that Vivendi is trying to hold onto a model that most media companies are rejecting, with Time Warner, which spun off its Warner Music Group and Time Inc., being the most famous example.On its way toward remaking itself, Vivendi has unloaded assets worth about $30 billion, including the French cellphone company SFR, Maroc Telecom and GVT, its wholly owned Brazilian telecommunications subsidiary.If Universal Music were to go on the market, there would probably be no shortage of potential buyers. In recent years, both John C. Malone\u2019s Liberty Media and the Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank Corporation have been said to be interested. Analysts put the value of a stand-alone Universal Music at \u20ac8 billion or more.Mr. Aspesi acknowledged that spinning off Universal Music would have the benefit of allowing the market to set its value, but he argued that there was no rush to sell. Rather, Vivendi might find that its value rises if streaming services like Deezer and Spotify make the unit\u2019s catalog more valuable.Still, there may not be any major fireworks at the shareholders\u2019 meeting next month. The American investor\u2019s stake is too small to affect the final outcome, and the default for most shareholders is to support management.The only surprise might be if proxy advisers urge investors to vote against the Florange law plan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Entry Will Help an Antiquated Dow Catch Up", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe fact that Apple will replace its original iPhone telecom partner in the Dow is a reminder of the march of time, technology and, specifically, smartphones. The change will help the Dow catch up somewhat with the importance of information technology to the broader economy. But it\u2019s a hint of the average\u2019s antiquated construction that this was prompted by a stock split planned by Visa \u2014 a move with no real-world significance.The Dow Jones industrial average dates from a simpler, computer-free era when working out the average of 30 stock prices counted as financial added value.

Apple\u2019s growth has been the biggest story in the American market over the last decade, and the Dow has missed it. A Reuters analysis shows that inserting Apple in place of any of the 30 stocks except Visa would have made the index perform better since last June, when the iPhone maker split its stock and brought its price into a range that the Dow\u2019s committee deemed acceptable.The market value-weighted Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and other similar but broader benchmarks are the more scientific choices \u2014 $1.9 trillion of passive investments track the S.&P. index, according to McGraw Hill.

{"Headline": "Americans\u2019 Retirement Funds Increasingly Contain Tech Start-Up Stocks", "Date": "2015-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retirement accounts of millions of Americans have long contained shares of stalwart companies like General Electric, Ford and Coca-Cola. Today, they are likely to include riskier private stocks from Silicon Valley start-ups like Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest.Fidelity\u2019s Contrafund includes $204 million in Pinterest shares, $162 million in Uber shares, and $24 million in Airbnb shares. Over all, there were 29 deals last year in which a mutual fund bought into a private company, and they were worth a collective $4.7 billion, according to CB Insights. That was up from six such deals, worth a combined $296 million, in 2012. T. Rowe Price was the most active big investor, making 17 investments in private tech companies.Because these tech companies are not required to issue financial reports and are not traded on traditional exchanges, they are the sort of speculative investments not normally found in retirement accounts. Increasingly, however, investors are betting that these companies will be bought or go public at prices that exceed their latest funding rounds, a prospect that is anything but guaranteed.\u201cI think it goes beyond what mutual funds were set up to do,\u201d said Leonard Rosenthal, a professor of finance at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the portfolio manager, but it\u2019s not necessarily in the interest of the shareholders of the fund. If investors are looking for a portfolio of risky securities, there are plenty of stocks to trade in the public market.\u201dThe dilemma for big fund managers is that fast-growing technology companies are so reluctant to sell private stock to the public that there is now a term \u2014 \u201cunicorns,\u201d reflecting just how wonderful and magical they are considered to be \u2014 for the dozens of private firms worth $1 billion or more. Several, including the ride-hailing company Uber, the room rental site Airbnb and the digital scrapbook Pinterest are worth more than $10 billion. Those lofty valuations, combined with the eagerness investors show in bidding them up, have created a shadowy market for private stock issued to tech companies\u2019 early investors and employees. For the last few years, mutual funds have sat on the sidelines.Now, they are racing to get in. \u201cMore and more, the big lopsided growth is happening away from the public markets,\u201d said Andrew Boyd, head of global capital equity markets at Fidelity.Take Uber, which was valued around $40 billion in its latest round of financing, up from $3.5 billion in mid-2013. That is more than 1,000 percent growth, compared with 28 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index over the same time period.Yet the many billions of dollars in new wealth being created by private tech companies is largely being funneled to a handful of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and early employees. For the most part, the broader public is left out. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of wealth creation happening, and a very narrow set of people are benefiting from it financially,\u201d said Scott Kupor, who, as a managing partner and chief operating officer at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 a major investor in many of the unicorns \u2014 is among that narrow set.Big money managers argue that they are broadening this pool by giving everyday investors access to tech\u2019s money machine. And despite the many risks, they say they believe the companies they are buying into are big enough and established enough that the investments are not all that much riskier than those in public companies of a similar size.\u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near the two guys in the garage,\u201d said Mr. Boyd of Fidelity. \u201cWe are near companies with hundreds of employees and billions of dollars in revenue.\u201dAnd while the dollar figures being invested are large, managers say individual holdings of any one stock make up a small part of big mutual funds, making the investments less risky. Fidelity\u2019s Uber stock, for example, represents less than 1 percent of each fund\u2019s total holdings.For investors, of course, that is a mixed blessing: Their retirement stays safe, but when a company like Uber appreciates 1,000 percent, they get only a sliver of the profits.Private technology stocks are not new, but there have never been so many, and they were never this big. In the 1990s, when going public was more common, company founders would sometimes pool shares into what amounted to a kind of exchange fund that allowed them to swap their own equity for shares in other start-ups.But for anyone to see a significant return, a company had to be bought or go public, which helps explain why \u201990s tech firms were so eager to have initial public offerings.In the late 2000s, as companies started to stay private longer, founders and venture capitalists began to look for ways to sell their shares for cash, opening the door for employees to do the same.Then came Facebook, whose private valuation went as high as $100 billion, creating a vast market for private shares. So many people, from big mutual funds to smaller investors, got their hands on so many shares that Facebook was pressured to go public earlier than it otherwise might have.That example has prompted many companies to try to limit how many shareholders they take in. And investors have enabled those efforts by writing lots of big checks, allowing companies to avoid the scrutiny of a public offering for many years longer than would have been possible a decade ago.As is characteristic of pretty much every investment boom, what began as a select few has grown so large that the earliest and biggest investors are finding innumerable ways to sell their shares to the masses of outsiders hungry to get in.The interest in private tech companies has become frenzied enough that the market for private shares has moved well beyond big institutional investors to investors with a few thousand dollars. Take SharesPost, a broker for private shares, which last year started the SharesPost 100 fund, allowing anyone with $2,500 to buy into what amounts to a mutual fund made of private shares in companies like Jawbone and DocuSign.This comes with plenty of risk. For starters, the fund is made up of shares that are illiquid, meaning they are hard to move under normal circumstances and nearly impossible to move when there is even a whiff of bad news about the company. Furthermore, many of the larger and early-stage investors have perks that no normal person can get. Preferred investors, for instance, are often first in line to get their money back, meaning that if the company is liquidated, they will be paid before other investors.And no matter if investors are big or small, there is still no guarantee that private start-ups will be public market stars. \u201cWith some of these companies,\u201d said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee that they will go public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Warren Buffett\u2019s Annual Letter, More Hints, but Still No Confirmation, of a Successor", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn it, he repeated previous statements that the board of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had identified his successor as chief executive, but again he did not reveal that person\u2019s identity.\u201cBoth the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as C.E.O. \u2014 a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down,\u201d Mr. Buffett, 84, wrote. \u201cIn certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.\u201dBut the vice chairman, Charlie Munger, writing in a separate letter to commemorate Mr. Buffett\u2019s 50th year at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, suggested that either Ajit Jain, an insurance executive at the company, or Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire\u2019s energy business, was most likely to receive the job. Mr. Buffett\u2019s son Howard will become nonexecutive chairman when his father no longer serves in that role.Matthew Rose, chief of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Berkshire\u2019s big railway, was previously mentioned as a potential successor. However, Mr. Buffett expressed some rare criticism for Burlington Northern, saying the company \u201cdisappointed many of its customers\u201d last year after service delays. Mr. Rose was not mentioned in the letter.In an indication of how seriously Mr. Buffett took problems at the railway, he said Berkshire would spend $6 billion on plant and equipment improvements there next year, calling the company \u201cBerkshire\u2019s most important noninsurance subsidiary.\u201dFor the most part, however, the letter\u2019s tone was relentlessly optimistic. Berkshire\u2019s market value increased by $18.3 billion last year. Over the last 50 years, the stock is up 1,826,163 percent.Mr. Buffett\u2019s five largest non-insurance businesses recorded a record $12.4 billion in pretax earnings last year, up from $11.1 billion in 2013. Those businesses, which Mr. Buffett refers to as the \u201cPowerhouse Five,\u201d are Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the toolmaker IMC, the chemical maker Lubrizol and the industrial group Marmon.\u201cIn effect, the world is Berkshire\u2019s oyster \u2014 a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those realistically open to most companies,\u201d he wrote, discussing how Berkshire\u2019s size gave it the capacity to invest in almost any new business. Last year, Berkshire increased its ownership stake in its four largest investments: American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo.And while Berkshire did not strike any megadeals last year, it continued to grow by making 31 smaller so-called bolt-on acquisitions that will cost a total of $7.8 billion. The largest of these deals, the $4.7 billion acquisition of the battery maker Duracell, is scheduled to close this year.\u201cCharlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote. \u201c(Most deals offered us aren\u2019t.)\u201dBerkshire acted as a financing partner to 3G Capital in its acquisition of Tim Hortons last year, and Mr. Buffett said he would like to join with 3G on another deal like the takeover of Heinz.He also reiterated Berkshire\u2019s interest in making a deal worth $5 billion to $20 billion, but he said that many of the deals pitched were of inferior quality.\u201cWe\u2019ve found that if you advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels,\u201d he wrote. At several points, he assailed investment bankers, accusing them of possessing dubious judgment and expensive tastes.Mr. Buffett acknowledged that he had made a mistake when he was slow to sell shares of the British supermarket chain Tesco, which wound up costing $444 million.\u201cAn attentive investor, I\u2019m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI made a big mistake with this investment by dawdling. Charlie calls this sort of behavior \u2018thumb-sucking.\u2019 (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)\u201dMr. Buffett did note that the nearly half-billion-dollar loss amounted to only 0.2 percent of Berkshire\u2019s net worth.He defended Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s conglomerate structure, making the case for a collection of disparate businesses \u2014 be they insurance companies or candy manufacturers \u2014 in an era when most companies focus on doing one thing well.He also brushed aside speculation that Berkshire should spin off some of its businesses. \u201cWe would lose control value, capital-allocation flexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote.Similarly, Mr. Buffett said that the decision whether to pay a dividend was at least 10 to 20 years away.After such an extraordinary 50-year run, Mr. Buffett cautioned investors not to have unrealistic expectations for Berkshire\u2019s performance in the years ahead, not to bet on quick gains in Berkshire stock and not to borrow money to buy new shares.\u201cThe bad news is that Berkshire\u2019s long-term gains \u2014 measured by percentages, not by dollars \u2014 cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe numbers have become too big. I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won\u2019t be great.\u201dThey weren\u2019t that bad, though. Last year, once again, Berkshire Hathaway shares surpassed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, rising 27 percent in 2014 compared with a gain of 13.7 percent for the S.&P.Advertisement"}

Buyers of top-tier debt can\u2019t help but keep looking further downward.Fears of deflation, government bond buying, slow growth and a lack of alternatives are squeezing interest rates in developed countries. Germany, for example, persuaded investors to pay for the privilege of lending to it for five years. The United States bond markets are a bit less desperate. The government here is paying 2.09 percent for 10-year debt.That has left corporate issuers in a sweet spot, especially those edging toward junk. When Verizon issued $49 billion of debt rated BBB-plus, it caused a stampede. There was more than $100 billion of demand for a yield of 2.25 percentage points over 10-year Treasuries, or a rate of about 5.2 percent at the time.Only 18 months later, Actavis encountered nearly the same level of demand. Yet the $83 billion company, rated two notches below Verizon, is paying only 3.84 percent on its 10-year bonds, or a spread of 1.75 percentage points.There\u2019s no sign of fear in the bond market yet. Many funds carry mandates that preclude them from straying into the high-yield market.

{"Headline": "Retirement Reality Is Catching Up With Me ", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI am an idiot.That, at least, is the impression I get from personal finance websites and magazines and books. They all seem to say I\u2019m doing pretty much everything wrong when it comes to my financial life, basically because I don\u2019t pay that much attention to my finances. Now, I understand that nobody buys a magazine that affirms our choices and tells us we are in good shape. No parenting magazine could last long if it didn\u2019t suggest that its advice will make the difference between raising a future Ivy Leaguer and a basement-dwelling knucklehead. Money advice, to be profitable to the advice giver, must start from the position that you\u2019ll go broke without this help. In publishing, sex may sell, but insecurity sells even better.In my case, they could be right. I wouldn\u2019t know, because \u2014 as I said \u2014 I don\u2019t pay all that much attention to my finances. Like many of you, dear readers, I am a pre-retirement worker of an economic class well above the poverty line but well below the 1 percent. I set up a 401(k) when I get a job, and set an automatic contribution, and then basically do my best to forget it\u2019s there. This set-it-and-forget-it approach served me well for several decades of gainful employment, but lately my ignorance has been anything but blissful. More and more, it\u2019s all been gnawing at me, a kind of unease that I can\u2019t block out. So I decided to take a hard look at where I stand.I\u2019m better off than that, and in fact we\u2019re pretty lucky compared with many Americans. For one thing, I have always worked for companies that pay reasonably well and provide pensions, which they have fully funded. Those companies have also sponsored retirement plans for employees and encouraged them to build 401(k) accounts, and I have. Also, I\u2019ve been able to hold on to jobs over the years in a business that\u2019s seen plenty of layoffs. Our household budgets have been tight, but aside from an ill-fated apartment purchase in my 30s, our family hasn\u2019t suffered the kind of financial setback or catastrophic illness that destroys many a family\u2019s nest egg. We had breathing room, but I had no idea where we stood in terms of being able to retire someday. I\u2019d all but stopped looking at the envelopes from Vanguard after 2007, when my funds lost about 40 percent of their value \u2014 not an unusual dip, given the economic crisis and recession, but a painful one. I knew that the accounts had bounced back, but hadn\u2019t been tracking them closely and hadn\u2019t worked through whether they would be part of a cushion for my wife and me in our golden years. The gnawing convinced me at last that this was the year to get our finances together. Maybe past time, if the numbers didn\u2019t come out right. And while I hope to have many good years of productive work ahead, I also have to think about retirement and plan for it \u2014 to look at whether I\u2019m on the right track for comfort in retirement or ruin, and to begin addressing some of the other issues, including life insurance and a will, that I\u2019ve been avoiding all these years.Where to start? With an industry built around retirement planning, diving in seemed like a good first step. But that choice led to more choices. How do I find a retirement consultant? Those who work on commission might be tempted to sell financial products that increase their incomes, not mine. And those who charge a flat fee might try to keep things quick and easy (for them) to ensure that their time is well spent. I had no intention of being a quick hit on somebody\u2019s conveyor belt.As it happens, the 401(k) accounts I built up at the three publications I have worked for over the last 30 years are all under the same roof, the mutual funds giant Vanguard. That promised to make things relatively easy, and the company offers free counseling from a certified financial planner to clients of employer-sponsored plans who are over 55. So one night in January, I made the call to Vanguard\u2019s 800 number. After navigating the voice command system, I ended up talking to an upbeat guy named Jeff, who told me that I could either set up an appointment for a phone session with one of their certified financial planners, or I could get a more thorough counseling session by first filling out a survey that would give the planner a \u201cmore holistic view\u201d of my financial picture before our conversation. The result, he said, would be a \u201cpersonalized financial plan.\u201dFilling out the survey \u201ctakes about 45 minutes,\u201d he said. As I hung up, Jeanne, sitting across the living room on the couch, asked, \u201cAny luck?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re going to send a 45-minute questionnaire,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can fill it out together.\u201d\u201cThrilling,\u201d she said.I found the survey. The very first question stumped me. It asked the age I plan to retire.Well, see, this is part of the problem. These are precisely the questions I\u2019ve been avoiding all these years! Jeanne and I had never discussed it. I love my job \u2014 journalism is the kind of career that calls for hard work, but it rarely feels like work. So we were starting with a big, big question. (Jeanne has worked part time for years, so her questions have less impact on our retirement picture.)We knew that Social Security kicks in at 62, but that you can earn more if you hold out longer \u2014 say, until 66. Medicare begins at 65. And after hunting around online, it appeared that sticking with gainful employment until 70 would lead to the biggest Social Security benefit. Jeanne, a pragmatist, noted ominously, \u201cYour retirement isn\u2019t under your control, entirely.\u201d My employer has a lot to say about it. But we could project a best case, and decided that sticking it out to 70 would be the likeliest course to set us up in terms of our investments, Social Security and pensions. She laughed. \u201cThat was more than 45 minutes.\u201dIt was going to be a long night. The first answer had taken so long that the Vanguard website had logged me out for inactivity. I went back in, entered the answer. And soon came to an ever more difficult question: How long do you expect to live?Well, holy cow. Let me check my appointment book. We had moved abruptly from economics to metaphysics. Here, too, however, we decided to plan for a good outcome while understanding that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune could make best estimates meaningless. Our four parents are still going strong in their 80s. My father is 88 and still working; he\u2019d have laughed at the idea of quitting at 70. So we again filled in some rather optimistic estimates and then marched on through questions about whether I was likely to sell stocks in a market downturn (no), whether I would invest in a fund based on a casual conversation or tip (heck, no) and suchlike. As Jeanne and I discussed these things, I realized we had never really talked about whatever passed for my investment strategy. I offered to. Jeanne said, \u201cMy strategy is not to know your strategy.\u201dStill, I did my best to express my amorphous thoughts on investing. I explained that I\u2019d been skeptical of financial advice programs about hard-core investing by gurus like Jim Cramer. I knew I was not the kind of guy who could beat the market. That\u2019s how I came up with my laissez-faire approach. I had a hard time remembering how much of my income I had assigned to the funds 14 years ago when I came to The Times. (After doing some research, I discovered that it was 10 percent.) Jeanne said, \u201cI approve.\u201d Which, after more than 40 years together, is nice to hear.Proceeding through the questionnaire, I then had to track down what we could expect to receive from Social Security each month at age 70 \u2014 a pretty easy figure to find from ssa.gov \u2014 and what my various pensions might bring in. That process could not be handled from my easy chair, as I had to ask former employers to come up with estimates. One would answer during the course of a single phone call; the other took weeks to calculate an estimate and send it by mail. Anticipating a slog, I decided I\u2019d had enough for the night.When I shut my laptop, four hours had passed from the time I had started the survey, and I was far from done. But we were thinking about the right questions at last. The next day, Jeanne sent me an email mentioning a conversation she\u2019d had with a co-worker who had asked \u201ca quality-of-life question.\u201d If you wait until you are 70 to retire you might get a bigger payout, but will you be in any condition to enjoy it?I responded:\u201cAn excellent question. If 70 is the new 50, yes. If 70 is the old 70, no.\u201dOur parents, as I said, had been very young 70-year-olds. It seemed like a safe bet. But I decided to ask the counselor to look at the numbers under a couple of different retirement ages. Over the next few days, I finished the form. Soon after that, Vanguard came back with a report generated from my answers. It said I should be more heavily invested in bonds; considering my age, I had too much money in stocks. Vanguard had been telling me that for a while, so this advice was no surprise. But then I saw words that seemed to levitate off the page:\u201cYou\u2019re on track to meet your retirement goals.\u201dIt was a beautiful thing. If we continued the way we were going, if the financial markets didn\u2019t collapse, if the magical fairies that govern employment and health were good to us, we would make it. I was, frankly, surprised. Jeanne was exultant. She said, \u201cWe won\u2019t be eating cat food!\u201dA week later, I had the conversation with the financial adviser, an upbeat guy named Greg. We discussed how to get on what he somewhat ominously called the \u201cglide path\u201d to a more balanced portfolio for retirement. He explained that the allocation between stocks and bonds mentioned in the report was, in fact, a big deal \u2014 \u201cthe most important one you make as an investor,\u201d even bigger than deciding which funds we invest in, since bonds help cushion your investments against stock market drops. And he had some suggestions on Vanguard funds that could get us the balance we need. He also explained what we could expect if we wanted to retire in our 60s. His estimates put us a little closer to the margins, but could, with a little luck, deliver us to comfort if not prosperity.It felt good to be done. But we weren\u2019t, of course. This is only the beginning. We have plugged a bunch of hypothetical numbers into a model and gotten a nice picture back. Much is still left to chance. Every decision leads to others, and opening one door leads on to more. We still don\u2019t have a will. We have to look at life insurance \u2014 whether to go beyond the amount that my benefits plan offers at low cost. A hard look at health insurance, long-term care insurance and issues like medical directives and power of attorney are ahead. Answering the next questions won\u2019t give us control over the future, either, but they might offer a buffer against misfortune. It isn\u2019t over. But then nothing ever is, until everything is.John Schwartz is a science writer for The Times and the author of a memoir, \u201cOddly Normal.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Restaurant Review: Bowery Meat Company in the East Village", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurantsThe chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald have brought forth a \u201cmeat company\u201d whose website says it is \u201cnot a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu.\u201dWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.I\u2019m starting to worry about the steakhouse.It used to be a rock of stability. The shifting winds of fashion did not bend it. Its basic formula was so firmly set that you could go to a steakhouse in San Bernardino and then one in Baltimore and have the same meal without looking at the menu. Now steakhouses are swerving all over the road. Their menus read like competitions to see who can stray furthest from plain beef and potatoes. The more desperate they grow in their attempts to prove they\u2019re not like the staid steakhouses of yore, the more they seem to converge. Just between us, Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu, balanced or otherwise. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef and a burger, potatoes cooked at least four ways and a spinach side dish. Mr. Capon appears at certain tables presenting masses of raw beef draped on a cutting board. And while the wine list has admirable and enticing range, its foundation is a cache of broad-beamed cabernets that are obviously meant to be married off to bricks of dry-aged beef. Is it possible that Bowery Meat Company doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a steakhouse, the way Bruce Willis in \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s a ghost?In this retro room, prime beef makes as much sense as Mr. Capon\u2019s swell nods to old-school Italian-American classics, like shrimp scampi, woozy with garlic and butter, or broiled oysters under slightly scorched bread crumbs, New Orleans style. His zucchini carpaccio dotted with creamed feta, chopped pistachios and fresh mint is very good now; it will be excellent when squash is in season.He also makes a terrine of chicken livers and foie gras, smooth in all the right ways and served with onion jam and toasted brioche. This is true luxury, not the mock luxury of a garden-variety deviled egg trying to pass itself off as a $25 appetizer by dressing up in caviar. Mr. Capon is not given to rash experiments. He knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them. (So does his pastry chef, Katie McAllister. Her desserts are unabashedly sweet, sometimes to the point where you lose interest, although the s\u2019mores sundae is uncannily precise, down to the ice cream that tastes exactly like a campfire marshmallow.) So his duck lasagna is not some bold invention but a gooey casserole in which the duck rag\u00f9 is essentially a seasoning and the bulk of the work is done by loads of melted caciocavallo. It is meant to serve two but could probably bring four people to a dead stop. And there is more. Much more. In the end, I barely put a dent in the menu, though it left its mark on me. Connoisseurs of ultratender burgers will go wild for Mr. Capon\u2019s hefty but loosely packed version on an extremely yielding bun. I like a burger that puts up more of a fight, but I loved the flavors of the melted raclette and caramelized onions.The most imposing of the meats is the veal chop, thick and quartz-pink. It\u2019s rubbed with paprika, coriander and fennel seeds for a whiff of the souk, but what gives it energy is the juice of a grilled orange half. That citrus-spice alchemy is a terrific solution to the boredom sometimes caused by plain broiled lumps of animal muscle. Another solution may be a smaller chop costing less than $52, but Bowery Meat Company understands that one of the jobs of any steakhouse, traditional or not, is to help carnivores spend lavishly. There is, as you\u2019d expect, a proprietary cut of meat from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, the $54 \u201cBowery steak.\u201d (Imagine the things \u201cBowery steak\u201d might have been a euphemism for 20 years ago.) A mosaic of trimmed rib-eye cap, it\u2019s intensely flavorful, but I wish Mr. Capon would leave the garlic-heavy raw chopped herb sauce on the side.The 14-ounce New York strip is $55, is served naked except for some roasted shallots and has a fine dry-aged tang. It was missing only a rough, satisfying crust of the kind the kitchen put on the c\u00f4te de boeuf, a 38-ounce marvel of careful dry-aging and extensive marbling that costs $138. This is why (he said, adopting a Viennese accent) the steakhouse has been acting so peculiar lately: It is trying to unite what\u2019s left of its core audience with the new herd of refugees from the small-plates revolution. Maybe Bowery Meat Company and places like it should just forget about defining themselves in relation to the steakhouse. Instead, they could come up with a new name for a place where you eat an appetizer followed by six or more ounces of meat, poultry or seafood.

{"Headline": "Citigroup\u2019s Roaring Revival on Wall Street", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCitigroup\u2019s Wall Street operations took the bank to the brink seven years ago. But now, in a little-noticed revival, Citigroup\u2019s traders and investment bankers have come roaring back.The bank\u2019s resurgence on Wall Street is all the more remarkable because it is taking place as many of its rivals pull back in the face of new regulations intended to make the financial system safer. The Wall Street operations of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, for instance, have remained steady or shrunk during the last four years.Citigroup\u2019s advance has involved acquiring vast amounts of derivatives, the financial instruments that gained notoriety during the 2008 financial crisis. It has at times snapped up derivatives from other banks that have been selling them to comply with new rules.Citigroup has not trumpeted its comeback. Its most senior executives have largely emphasized streamlining operations that have little to do with Wall Street. For instance, the bank announced this month that it had agreed to sell a large unit that focuses on subprime loans to consumers.\u201cCiti is much simpler, smaller, safer and stronger than it was before the crisis,\u201d Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said in a statement. \u201cWe have been growing selected businesses in a careful and responsible manner, consistent with regulatory requirements and market environment. Our improved position in the industry is a consequence of earning a greater share of our clients\u2019 business.\u201dCitigroup\u2019s investment bank is also no longer involved in the toxic activities that were most dangerous to the bank\u2019s health. The bank also has substantially higher levels of capital, the financial buffer that reflects a bank\u2019s ability to absorb losses.Such steps have helped it slowly regain favor with regulators, although last year the bank failed the stress tests that the Federal Reserve administers annually. Citigroup and other banks will find out on Wednesday whether they have passed this year\u2019s tests.Still, figures for Citigroup\u2019s Wall Street operations show a bank that is on something of a tear.The unit that encompasses the firm\u2019s investment bank, for instance, had $1.06 trillion of assets at the end of last year, a 12 percent increase from the level in 2010. Over the same period, Goldman\u2019s assets dropped 6 percent while those in JPMorgan\u2019s investment banking and commercial banking divisions rose 4 percent.The unit that contains Citigroup\u2019s investment bank is now generating most of the company\u2019s profits. In 2012, it earned roughly $200 million more than the consumer bank. In each of the last two years, however, its earnings have exceeded those of the consumer bank by more than $2.5 billion.Perhaps most astonishing is Citigroup\u2019s meteoric growth in derivatives, the financial contracts that allow banks and investors to place bets without actually owning an underlying stock, bond or currency. Derivatives often earn bigger profits for Wall Street dealers than stocks and bonds. But new rules, including higher capital requirements, have started to take their toll, persuading many banks to cut back on the amount of derivatives they hold.That has not been the case at Citigroup. In 2009, Citibank, Citigroup\u2019s main banking subsidiary, had $32 trillion in derivatives, according to regulatory filings. That figure more than doubled, to $70 trillion, in the third quarter of 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a head scratcher,\u201d Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at the brokerage and investment group CLSA, said. \u201cWhy is this the best use of Citi\u2019s capital?\u201d Over the same five-year period, derivatives in JPMorgan\u2019s main banking unit declined by 17 percent, to $65 trillion. (The derivatives holdings are stated using their notional value, an industry measure that does not reflect the actual amount that the banks could lose.)Citigroup has also flexed its muscles behind the scenes to protect its derivatives business from certain new rules. The bank\u2019s lobbyists helped draft a bill that gutted a crucial provision of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law that aimed to withdraw taxpayer support from some types of derivatives. The bill recently became law.Ms. Romero-Apsilos, the Citigroup spokeswoman, said that the increases in derivatives had been \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201crisk managed,\u201d adding that the higher totals were for derivatives linked to interest rates and currencies, not those linked to the creditworthiness of borrowers. She also noted that Citigroup\u2019s derivatives were increasingly going through central clearinghouses, which back trades and are meant to prevent problems in one bank\u2019s derivatives business from spreading to the wider financial system.Still, within the enclosed world of derivatives, Citigroup\u2019s remarkable ascent has not gone unnoticed.International Financing Review, a trade publication for deal makers and traders, gave Citigroup its top derivatives honors in 2013 for its ability to expand its business in the new regulatory environment. \u201cThe seemingly unending overhaul of banks\u2019 derivatives businesses in response to a changing regulatory regime left the door wide open for those that were first-movers in postcrisis recovery,\u201d the magazine wrote.Rival bankers also contend that the relative laxness of United States regulations is helping Citigroup increase its derivatives holdings.Citigroup\u2019s investment banking business and its derivatives holdings may be growing because the bank\u2019s executives may have calculated that it has enough capital to fuel the growth. James A. Forese, who worked at Salomon Brothers, the high-rolling bond-trading firm, is chief executive of the institutional clients group, which includes Citigroup\u2019s Wall Street operations. A November presentation by Mr. Forese listed \u201cgrowing our franchise\u201d as one of the group\u2019s main goals.One question is whether the growth is leading to strong levels of profitability. To gauge performance, banks state their profits as a percentage of the capital, or equity, that they have deployed in a division. Citigroup does not break out how much equity it has in the institutional clients group, but Mr. Forese said last year that its profits were equivalent to about 15 percent of its \u201ctangible common equity,\u201d a return that would rank it above other large Wall Street firms.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Mystery in Hedge Fund Investing", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyWhen I look at hedge funds, there are three data points that keep bothering me. They create a pattern that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. I hope you can help me understand what I\u2019m missing.1. Hedge fund performance has been terrible.I know, I know, that\u2019s only one year. And one year doesn\u2019t equal a track record. But how about a decade?We\u2019ve all heard the stories about hedge fund managers who won big and walked away with billions. Although it\u2019s not impossible to identify these fund managers before their big wins, it\u2019s highly improbable. Most of the rest of the people who made a lot of money with them were probably just lucky.2. Hedge fund expenses are insane.The amount you pay for an investment has a direct, mathematical correlation to how much money you\u2019ll end up with. John C. Bogle, the Vanguard founder, refers to it as \u201cthe relentless rules of humble arithmetic.\u201d The more you pay, the less you keep.With those \u201crelentless rules\u201d in mind, the typical hedge fund charges 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains, though some may charge more or less. Using humble arithmetic, compare those numbers to low-cost, diversified index funds that charge people 0.25 percent (or less, as many do). Now, we\u2019ve reached the point where the data gets really confusing to me. People pay much more and have gotten much less of late when they invest in hedge funds.3. People continue to invest in hedge funds anyway. Investors sank more than $88 billion into hedge funds in 2014. Why do people keep doing this?One assumption might be that they don\u2019t know that hedge funds are just really expensive, underperforming mutual funds for rich people. But given how much people have written on the subject, it\u2019s probably something else.Maybe hedge funds give people something to talk about at parties. Based on what I hear at different events, some people love sharing the news that they own XYZ hedge fund. It sounds cool, right? Not everyone can invest because of various rules and screenings, so it does convey some sort of social standing, I suppose.The attraction could also be in the pure entertainment value. Some people enjoy watching ESPN, reading a book or heading outdoors. The really wild people enjoy taking a walk with their spouse or spending time with their children. Perhaps hedge fund investors want the entertainment of buying really expensive things that probably won\u2019t work, on the off chance that they will once in a while.Or the reason could be more subtle. Americans have a hard time admitting they\u2019re average. Hedge funds have gone out of their way to push the idea that they are better than average. For wealthier people, the desire to claim that golden ticket, to be better than average, may be worth every penny of the insane fees they pay.Perhaps, however, I\u2019m not giving people who are buying hedge funds enough credit. Maybe they are actually looking for a hedge \u2026 fund. You know, something that really and truly hedges against market downturns by betting that certain stocks or market segments will fall. In that case, I can understand the confusion. Given the tear the market has been on, it might make sense to be looking for ways to protect yourself in case of a steep correction.In fact, that\u2019s what hedge funds were supposed to do in the first place, and there are still funds that do it. You may have to look hard to find them though, because many of today\u2019s so-called hedge funds aren\u2019t really hedges against a sharp drop in the market. They\u2019re audacious, all-in bets on a variety of big market moves or the funds\u2019 fancy computers and software that quickly scrape pennies off transactions valued in the millions. People seeking a true hedge fund need to proceed with caution and make sure a hedge fund isn\u2019t really something else in disguise.Obviously, I could be totally wrong here. I\u2019m just a guy from the hills in Utah, and this pattern of decision-making could make perfect sense. You may be completely happy with your really expensive, underperforming mutual fund. If so, who am I to burst your bubble?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Markets Lose Their Luster as Crises Mount", "Date": "2015-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Russia, it\u2019s assassinations and war. In Brazil, a corruption scandal may derail the economy. And in Turkey, the president is attacking the country\u2019s senior central banker.Emerging markets, not long ago seen as a necessary ingredient for the common portfolio, have lately taken on a more toxic quality as messy politics and staggering economies are prompting some investors to reassess their investment rationale.Compounding these concerns has been the dollar\u2019s upward march and the growing acceptance that the Federal Reserve will soon increase interest rates as the United States economy outpaces the rest of the world\u2019s.Emerging-market currencies, an accurate barometer of investor mood swings, are now suffering the consequences. The Turkish lira and the Brazilian real have touched multiyear lows against the dollar while the Russian ruble remains volatile after its 65 percent plunge.Even the currencies of economies seen to be in better shape, like the Mexican peso, which is trading at record lows against the dollar, and the Indian rupee are under pressure.\u201cYou are seeing all the bad things about emerging markets that originally made them sub-investment grade,\u201d said Daniel Tenengauzer, an emerging-market specialist at the Royal Bank of Canada. \u201cThe whole thesis that emerging markets are emerging is being questioned right now.\u201dMr. Tenengauzer points to Brazil as the main culprit. Allegations of kickbacks and bribes at Petrobras, the country\u2019s energy giant, threaten to engulf the country\u2019s business and economic elites. Petrobras, which has relied on global bond markets to finance its ambitious investment plans, is now retrenching \u2014 a bad omen for Brazil\u2019s investment-starved economy, which is not expect to grow this year.But the outlook is no better in Russia, where a war with Ukraine and President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s erratic ways \u2014 combined with a collapse in the price of oil \u2014 have rattled investors. And in Turkey, the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has added to existing currency jitters by suggesting that the head of the Turkish central bank is beholden to foreign speculators because he has not lowered interest rates fast enough.Beyond these surface problems are deeper vulnerabilities in these and other emerging markets that, analysts say, will become more acute as the dollar continues to race ahead.In a report published last week, Mr. Tenengauzer highlighted how, in the last five years of extraordinary central bank easing, emerging markets have taken on more debt as developed markets have done the opposite.This dollar-based leveraging up has been led by capital-hungry companies that cashed in on a broad investor desire for high-yielding bonds. Chinese short-term debt has exploded to $850 billion from $101 billion since 2008; in Brazil, the increase was to $112 billion from $47 billion, and Turkey\u2019s near-term liabilities jumped to $95 billion from $56 billion.When their currencies were strong and the dollar weak, such a strategy made sense. But when the reverse is true, foreign investors take their money elsewhere, and these dollar debts become harder to pay off.Of course, it is a mistake to treat emerging-market problems as uniform. For example, while Brazil and Russia suffered last year, stocks and bonds soared in India under a new reform-minded government. Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines also attracted investor interest because of their successful economic policies.And while currencies have been volatile, capital flows out of emerging markets, although weaker of late, have not yet approached the levels of a year ago.According to the Institute of International Finance, the trade group for global banks, global flows into emerging markets nearly halved last month, to $12 billion from $23 billion, with money flowing out of Brazil, Ukraine and Thailand and into Indonesia and India.Since the beginning of the year, investors in the world\u2019s largest emerging-markets investment vehicle, the $38 billion Oppenheimer developing markets fund, have withdrawn just $400 million \u2014 an amount by no means indicative of investor panic.Still, emerging-market experts say that the fact that the dollar is on a tear and that interest rates in the United States are moving up will entice investors to hunt for juicy returns in the United States as opposed to Brazil and Turkey.Further cementing the United States\u2019 appeal is rising doubt about senior-level decision making in some of the developing countries.In Turkey, for example, Mr. Erdogan has been pressuring his central bank, which is nominally independent, to bring interest rates down even though inflation remains high and the lira shaky.Standard economic theory has it that higher interest rates quell inflation and support the currency.\u201cThis is a vulnerable period,\u201d said Michael Harris, a Turkey specialist at Renaissance Capital in London. \u201cThe market assumes that Turkey is one of the big victims of Fed tightening, so we need a spell now when politicians don\u2019t throw more fuel on the fire.\u201dIn Brazil, the Petrobras scandal has added to longstanding fears that the country became too reliant on the commodity boom of the previous decade and gorged on debt.Now, with Petrobras debt being recently downgraded to junk status, investors fear that a downgrade of the country\u2019s government bonds could follow.So far this year, the Brazilian real has lost 15 percent and the Turkish lira has lost 12 percent against the dollar, making them the worst-performing currencies among major developing markets.Brazil and Turkey have taken steps to reassure investors.Late last year, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, under fire for her ties to Petrobras, appointed a new market-friendly finance minister, Joaquim Levy, to oversee Brazil\u2019s cost-cutting drive.And last week, a weighty delegation of Turkish politicians, headlined by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and the country\u2019s finance minister, swept into New York to meet with anxious fund managers.But as long as turmoil and scandal persist, such measures, while helpful, run the risk of being too little too late.Mr. Tenengauzer, the emerging-market expert, said he had been barraged by phone calls from investors about the chaos in these markets. \u201cIt\u2019s really affecting the asset class.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Clintons, a Hedge Fund in the Family", "Date": "2015-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince marrying Chelsea Clinton five years ago, Marc Mezvinsky, a money manager, appears to have settled into his life as Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s son-in-law. He has regularly appeared at charitable events, once introducing the former president at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s celebrity poker tournament by dryly saying, \u201cYou may have heard of my father-in-law.\u201d And at the recent N.B.A. All-Star Game, Mr. Mezvinsky took a seat next to Mr. Clinton and his partner in charitable endeavors, Dikembe Mutombo, the former basketball star.Beyond the glamour, being part of the Clinton family has provided Mr. Mezvinsky with another perk: access to wealthy investors with ties to the Clintons. When Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners began raising money in 2011 for a new hedge fund firm, Eaglevale Partners, a number of investors in the firm were longtime supporters of the Clintons, according to interviews and financial documents reviewed by The New York Times. Tens of millions of dollars raised by Eaglevale can be attributed to investors with some relationship or link to the Clintons. The investors include hedge fund managers like Marc Lasry and James Leitner; an overseas money management firm connected to the Rothschild family; and people from Goldman Sachs, including the chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein. Some of the investors in Eaglevale have contributed campaign money to the former president and Mrs. Clinton, who is widely expected to run for president again in 2016. Some have also contributed to the family\u2019s foundation. Identifying who put money into Eaglevale, a roughly $400 million fund that has had underwhelming returns for much of its brief history, is difficult because hedge funds do not publicly disclose their investors. Still, the overlap between at least some of Eaglevale\u2019s investors and backers of the Clintons illustrates how politics and finance can intersect and shows the fine line the Clinton family must navigate as their charitable and business endeavors come under scrutiny in an election cycle. A person briefed on the matter and close to the firm said the amount of investor money recruited by Mr. Mezvinsky is not large, amounting to less than 10 percent of the firm\u2019s total outside capital. Clinton supporters also say there are more direct ways to cultivate favor with the family, such as giving to the foundation, where Chelsea Clinton is vice chairwoman, than by investing with a hedge fund that her husband co-founded. For a brief period in 2013, after Eaglevale had been up and running for about a year, Rock Creek sublet temporary office space to Mrs. Clinton after she stepped down as secretary of state. Mr. Lasry, a co-founder of the big hedge fund Avenue Capital and a longtime friend and financial backer of both the former president and Mrs. Clinton, said he invested $1 million in Eaglevale. In an interview in his Park Avenue office, adorned with many photos of him with the former president, he said that he recommended that his relative by marriage, Craig Effron, another hedge fund manager, also invest in the fund. \u201cI gave them money because I thought they would make me money,\u201d said Mr. Lasry, whose $13 billion firm was one of the first places Chelsea worked after graduating from Stanford. A number of other investors reached by The Times declined to be interviewed. Some investors in Eaglevale, and other people briefed on the firm\u2019s management, said that Mr. Mezvinsky\u2019s more veteran partners, Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, have played crucial roles in raising money for the fund. Mr. Grau and Mr. Mallon have long track records as successful traders at Goldman, and Mr. Grau\u2019s involvement was said to be a particular draw to financial investors who run other hedge funds and money management firms. Mr. Mezvinsky worked for Mr. Grau at Goldman for a while. Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners declined to be interviewed for this article. Kamyl Bazbaz, a Clinton Foundation spokesman, said, \u201cWhere our supporters choose to invest is obviously their personal prerogative and has nothing to do with the foundation in any respect.\u201d Mr. Mezvinsky, 37, is the most prominent executive at Eaglevale, a so-called macro fund that makes trades based on global economic and political events. The fund is a relatively small one in an industry with roughly $3 trillion in assets.Mr. Mezvinsky is a Stanford graduate who is the child of political parents himself. His father, Edward M. Mezvinsky, was a two-term member of Congress from Iowa, and his mother, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, served a term in Congress from Pennsylvania. Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.Mr. Mezvinsky worked at Goldman Sachs for eight years before moving to a private equity firm. He is widely credited with spearheading Eaglevale\u2019s big bullish bet on Greek bank stocks and Greek debt. Unfortunately for investors in Eaglevale \u2014 named after a bridge in Central Park \u2014 that trade has largely resulted in disappointing returns. When Mr. Mezvinsky worked on Wall Street, his responsibilities included pitching investment ideas to hedge funds before he moved onto the trading desk. Among his partners, Mr. Mezvinsky is the one most at ease with appearing on panels to discuss investment strategies, one of which was the firm\u2019s bet on beaten down Greek banks. In 2013, he took part in a small private meeting a Wall Street bank arranged in New York for a number of hedge fund managers with Greece\u2019s prime minister at the time, Antonis Samaras. Goldman Sachs, where Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners had met years earlier, was also important to Eaglevale\u2019s start. Among Eaglevale\u2019s earliest investors were Goldman partners, including Mr. Blankfein, who let his name be used to market the fund. The fund has also relied on multiple Wall Street banks to provide back-office services, including Goldman, which made introductions to investors like Rock Creek. Goldman has a close connection to the Clintons, and its executives have been political contributors over the years. More recently, Goldman has made donations of more than $1 million to the family\u2019s foundation, which in recent years has leased office space in a Goldman building downtown. (A Goldman spokesman, Andrew Williams, said the foundation had asked to break its lease, but the Wall Street company refused.) Mr. Williams, though, said Mr. Blankfein had invested with Eaglevale because of his friendship with Mr. Grau, a longtime colleague and the fund\u2019s chief investment officer. In 2012, Eaglevale raised $15 million from an investment vehicle in the domain of Jacob Rothschild, who with members of his far-flung family has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The investment, financial records show, came before President Clinton spoke at a conference in Oxford that was sponsored by the Rothschild Foundation, of which Mr. Rothschild is chairman. Mr. Rothschild declined to comment through Tom Burns, a spokesman for his firm, RIT Capital Partners. A person briefed on the matter and close to Eaglevale, but not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Clinton\u2019s appearance at the conference had nothing to do with the investment from the Rothschild-managed firm, Trading Capital Holdings. Eaglevale\u2019s flagship fund, with about $380 million in assets, is up about 10 percent this year, but that follows a poor performance in 2014. Last year that fund lost 3.6 percent largely because its bets on an economic recovery in Greece failed to pay off. By comparison, hedge funds using the same kinds of macro strategies as Eaglevale on average rose 5.62 percent in 2014, according to Hedge Fund Research, an industry performance tracking firm. Some investors in Eaglevale have withdrawn from or reduced their investments. The investment linked to the Rothschild fund, for example, withdrew about half of its allotment. The two public pension investors that invested in Eaglevale at the recommendation of the Rock Creek Group are out of the fund altogether. Calpers left the fund as part of a retreat from hedge fund investments. The other pension fund, whose identity could not be determined, left because of the firm\u2019s poor performance, said another person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In letters to its investors month after month last year, Mr. Mezvinsky and his partners sounded an upbeat and confident note that Greece would soon be on the path to a \u201csustainable recovery.\u201d It was not until the end of last year that Eaglevale finally acknowledged, \u201cOur recent predictions regarding Greek politics have proved incorrect.\u201d Eaglevale\u2019s flagship fund has since withdrawn from much of its Greek trading. The firm is now betting big on the United States dollar to outperform a number of foreign currencies. That is a trade some investors attributed largely to Mr. Grau.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Birdman", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "Did Arlan Galbraith really think he could turn pigeon meat into the next chicken? Or was he running an elaborate Ponzi scam all along?Supported byIt was December 2013, and Galbraith was being tried in Ontario Superior Court in Kitchener for engineering what a prosecutor described as \u201cone of the biggest frauds in our history.\u201d He was 66 and heavyset with graying hair, narrow eyes and a listless, nasal voice. \u201cA very nice-looking, trusting face,\u201d is how one woman, who invested $80,000 in his company, described him.The suit Galbraith wore was dark, and we know it was his only suit because one of the many outlandish questions he put to witnesses during the monthlong trial was this: \u201cDo you believe that this suit is the only suit I own and that I bought it in 1997? Do you believe that?\u201d He worked into the same rambling cross-examination the fact that he was now \u201chomeless,\u201d staying in a friend\u2019s 16-square-foot cabin in the \u201cremote bush of far northern Ontario\u201d \u2014 a detail that, like his only suit, he felt undermined the idea that he could have stolen money from hundreds of people. Two days later, he mentioned to another witness that the cabin had no indoor toilet.Galbraith\u2019s reign as Pigeon King lasted seven years, from 2001 to June 2008, when his empire imploded. The prosecution likened his company, Pigeon King International, to a Ponzi scheme \u2014 much like Bernard Madoff\u2019s operation, which happened to crumble just months after Galbraith\u2019s, except that where Madoff\u2019s scheme centered on stocks and securities, Galbraith\u2019s used live birds. Pigeon King International sold breeding pairs of pigeons to farmers with a guarantee to buy back their offspring at fixed prices for 10 years. Initially, Galbraith told farmers that the birds were high-end racing pigeons and that he planned to sell the offspring to the lucrative markets that support the sport overseas. Later, Galbraith changed his story, telling farmers that the birds were part of his trailblazing plan to elevate pigeon meat, known as squab, from a fringe delicacy in North America into the next ubiquitous chicken. But in the end, \u201cthey were neither,\u201d the prosecutor said; Galbraith never sold a single pigeon for sport or meat. He seemed to have merely taken the young birds he bought from Pigeon King International farmers and resold them, as breeding pairs, to other Pigeon King International farmers, shuttling pigeons from one barn to another. And this meant continually recruiting new investors so he would have the cash to buy the pigeons his existing investors produced every month. When Galbraith\u2019s scheme finally fell apart, Pigeon King International had almost a thousand breeders under contract in five Canadian provinces and 20 U.S. states. He\u2019d taken nearly $42 million from farmers and walked away from obligations to buy back $356 million worth of their baby birds, ruining many of those investors. A forensic accountant determined that signing up enough new pigeon breeders to pay off those contracts would have dug him into an even deeper, $1.5 billion hole. (All figures in this article are in Canadian dollars.)As more details came to light, Pigeon King didn\u2019t look like a reasonable business. But it didn\u2019t make much sense as a scam either. For seven years, until the day Galbraith shut down the company, he picked up breeders\u2019 young pigeons on time and never broke a contract or missed a payment. In one three-year period, he paid out $30 million to farmers and other creditors. Many of his early investors walked away with six-figure returns. \u201cI was doing the opposite to what a criminal would do,\u201d Galbraith argued at the end of the trial. He paid the business\u2019s major expenses in full, sometimes months in advance, and didn\u2019t vanish when it was clear his company was coming apart. Instead, he stuck it out and wound up with virtually nothing. (Some years, Galbraith paid himself about $400,000, but he used much of that money to bail out the company.) Even his paranoid-sounding claims that he was taken down by a \u201cfear-monger\u2019s smear campaign\u201d turned out to be basically true. He had no trouble signing up new investors until his credibility was attacked by a prominent Amish intellectual, an eccentric with a bullhorn and a small, muckraking farming magazine.\u201cI am not a lawyer,\u201d Galbraith told the jury, summing up his case. \u201cI am just a farmer and an entrepreneur, trying to defend myself against charges, which, I believe, should have never been brought against me in the first place.\u201d He compared himself to Steve Jobs, a \u201crisk taker and visionary,\u201d and explained that all he ever wanted was to put \u201cjoy on people\u2019s faces, by providing them with a better life through pigeon farming.\u201d Even a few of his victims weren\u2019t sure whether he meant to con them. During the trial, Galbraith asked a farmer named Ken Hoffman, \u201cIn spite of losing approximately $125,000, if Arlan Galbraith invited you to join him for dinner, to talk about the past, the present and the future, would you have dinner with him?\u201d Without hesitation, Hoffman responded, \u201cI certainly would.\u201dThe story Galbraith was telling was simple: He started a business and failed. Then again, the prosecution\u2019s story was even simpler: Galbraith was a liar. \u201cUse your everyday common sense,\u201d the prosecutor told the jury. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d The legal case against Galbraith seemed irrefutable: He misled many people, destroying lives. But to actually understand who the Pigeon King was \u2014 skilled con man or hapless businessman or hapless con man or all three \u2014 it may help to put common sense aside.The pigeon-racing world is small, but over the past 20 years, it has become much more professionalized. While the members of a local club in the Bronx might get together on weekends to compete for a couple of hundred dollars, international promoters stage bigger races with astronomically larger purses. In January, the 19th annual Million Dollar Pigeon Race in South Africa paid its first-place finisher $150,000. As the stakes have risen, the atmosphere around races has intensified \u2014 testing pigeons for doping is now standard practice \u2014 and the value of the pigeons has soared. Birds from top-performing breeders are auctioned off to racers wanting to inject their own flocks with quality genes. In 2013, a gifted Belgian pigeon named Bolt, after the Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, sold for $400,000 to a Chinese businessman.Galbraith, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told a court official that he started raising pigeons when he was 6, during a much simpler era for the sport. He was apparently introduced to the hobby in the 1950s by aging neighbors in Stouffville, Ontario, northeast of Toronto. His parents came from farming families, and Galbraith knew from an early age that he wanted to be a farmer, too. He dropped out of school after 11th grade \u2014 he was disappointed in the teachers and bored, he recalled \u2014 and bought a farm with his parents and older brother, Norman. They raised and slaughtered their own pigs and cattle. But the business faltered, and they declared bankruptcy in 1980, when Galbraith was in his early 30s. With his own family to support, he moved around, picking up farm work. On the side, he bred high-end rabbits and exotic birds for show. For a time, he had a tame cockatiel who had the run of the house.In February 1989, Galbraith\u2019s wife, Elizabeth, was en route to a nursing seminar in Toronto when a snowstorm hit, whiting out the highway, and another vehicle slammed into her car. The wreck left Elizabeth a quadriplegic, and Galbraith spent several years caring for her and their two small children until the couple separated. This was difficult for Galbraith, a family member explained: He \u201chas a strong sense of duty,\u201d and the divorce was \u201clargely\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s decision.Through all this strain and upheaval, pigeons appear to have been a constant in Galbraith\u2019s life. For decades, he was active in Ontario\u2019s pigeon-racing and pigeon-fancying circles. At his trial, he proudly noted membership in several organizations: the Canadian Racing Pigeon Union, the Canadian National Tippler Union, the National Birmingham Roller Club. He was charter president of the Saugeen Valley Fur and Feathers Fanciers Association.By 2001, when Galbraith started running ads in small farming magazines, recruiting investors for Pigeon King International, he\u2019d been breeding pigeons for about 50 years. He referred to himself as the Pigeon King and claimed to have developed his own genetic line, which he called Strathclyde Genetics, after his ancestral region of Scotland. He also showed many farmers a photograph of Mike Tyson, the world\u2019s most famous pigeon racer, to whom he claimed to have sold birds. Galbraith always insisted he had a clear business plan \u2014 he\u2019d mention the big money paid for racing pigeons in the Middle East or allude to contacts he had in Saudi Arabia \u2014 but offered few specifics. Many farmers respected that reticence. If Galbraith had found a niche market, it was smart to keep it to himself.Investors describe Galbraith as talkative but low-pressure. \u201cHe could care less whether you invested or not,\u201d one said. In a promotional mailing, he recommended that farmers visit families already breeding for Pigeon King and wait until they were \u201cabsolutely satisfied\u201d before investing \u2014 even if it took years. A large share of his investors, especially at first, were Amish and Mennonite families, people for whom trusting others is central to living a meaningful life. Prosecutors would argue that Galbraith deliberately targeted these groups, that he exploited their credulousness and knew that Mennonites, especially, are committed to absolute forgiveness, typically unwilling to participate in the legal process and unlikely to bear witness against him. (An employee would testify that he overheard Galbraith mocking the Amish as \u201caliens.\u201d) Often, Galbraith threaded his rhetoric with biblical-sounding aphorisms. He signed an early flier: \u201cHe who does not trust is not to be trusted. My business is built on everlasting trust.\u201dWhen Pigeon King International grew enough to move out of Galbraith\u2019s basement into a proper office, he taped a sign with that credo on the front door.Christine Bults is 50 but looks much younger; when we met last fall, she wore muted gold eye shadow and a denim jacket. She remembered that Galbraith talked about his family, recounting his wife\u2019s accident, and explained that raising pigeons, unlike larger livestock, was oriented around family. Christine and the kids could do the work together safely, while Ron worked his job off-farm. They talked for more than three hours. Galbraith insisted they do some research and think it over.Several months later, the Bultses borrowed $125,000 against their farm and bought 360 pairs of pigeons at $165 a pair. There were only a few dozen Pigeon King breeders at the time, but Christine had learned what she could and didn\u2019t feel especially suspicious. Still, she\u2019s strong-minded and vigilant by nature; she has her father\u2019s temper, she told me, adding, \u201cMy husband\u2019s a little afraid of me when I get pissed.\u201d At one point, she glared at Galbraith across the kitchen table and heard herself telling him, \u201cIf this goes bad, I will come and find you.\u201d Ron, shocked, kicked her under the table. They were trying to do business with the guy, after all.There\u2019s a temptation to dismiss farmers who were taken by Galbraith as ignorant or blinded by greed. But typically, their motivations were nuanced, their ambitions modest. Families dreamed of giving each child his or her own bedroom or keeping both spouses from having to take second jobs away from the family and the farm. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see dollar signs,\u201d one man told me. \u201cWe saw more time together.\u201d And many, like the Bultses, did their due diligence only to find that watchdogs and regulators were unconcerned about Galbraith, even after a former Pigeon King employee says he warned Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs about the company in 2006. An Ohio couple who lost $250,000 (U.S.) described, in an affidavit, how they called half a dozen agricultural and law-enforcement agencies, as well as Better Business Bureaus in the United States and Canada, and turned up no red flags.Feeling compassion for Galbraith\u2019s victims \u2014 and possibly, understanding this story at all \u2014 may also mean getting past some disparaging stereotypes of pigeons. To a New Yorker, a pigeon is flying trash; but to a small poultry farmer, accustomed to stretching and diversifying, the bird could reasonably be seen as one more animal with potential value. At the time, commodity prices were low. Even the market for pregnant-mare urine had tanked. (Mare urine, which is used in hormone-replacement therapy, was a longstanding sideline in farming communities.) Many investors were simply looking for a way to ease the strain of running a small family farm. They saw Galbraith as one of them, and he offered a means to preserve the way of life they believed in. He called the values and work ethic they shared Pigeon Religion.As Galbraith hired salesmen and pushed across Ontario and into Pennsylvania and the American Midwest, the monthly newsletter he started, The Pigeon Post, became a sort of small-town newspaper for the community he was building. Among the pigeon nutrition tips, pigeon trivia and mazes for kids were testimonials from Pigeon King investors. One chronicled the escalating misfortunes of a family with eight children \u2014 one with a brain tumor, another in a wheelchair with spina bifida \u2014 who lived in a falling-down old house, then ended: \u201cAnd then came the pigeons. WHAT A BLESSING.\u201dThe man on the log was David J. Thornton. He is 73, and runs a website called CrimeBustersNow, a one-man vigilante regulatory force bent on taking down pyramids and Ponzi schemes. In conversation, Thornton comes off as erratic, abrasive and unnervingly fixated on the sins of the con men he calls \u201cdream stealers\u201d; when we spoke, he had difficulty relaying information chronologically, or even in linear fashion, and broke down crying more than once. He has been arrested many times \u2014 for harassment, disturbing the peace and assault, he said. In 2010, for example, he got into an altercation with an elementary-school girl while handing out CrimeBustersNow literature outside a school near Toronto. According to court documents, Thornton grabbed at the girl\u2019s wrist to get her to pay attention. The school\u2019s vice principal had to intervene. (Thornton was convicted of assault and breach of probation but later won an appeal on procedural grounds.) Thornton told me that he was living off a pension, rent-free in the basement of a friend in Quebec, and he seemed almost debilitated by the impassioned tunnel vision with which he goes after his enemies. \u201cI\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d he said. And yet he was one of the first people to see through Galbraith\u2019s operation.Thornton began investigating Pigeon King in the summer of 2007 after being tipped off by a Mennonite nut grower. \u201cIt was just like Madoff,\u201d he told me. \u201cI saw this thing could destroy all the farming communities in North America.\u201d He knew the only way to stop a scheme like Galbraith\u2019s was to choke off new investment. So he posted screeds about the company online, then started phoning bankers and feed companies in agricultural areas around North America, urging them to spread the word. (To reach Amish farmers, he called blacksmiths.) He contacted television stations and law enforcement and visited the federal prosecutor\u2019s office near Pigeon King\u2019s headquarters, where he was escorted out by the police. He then stood outside with a bullhorn, shouting about Pigeon King.By the fall of 2007, almost in spite of himself, Thornton was starting to hamstring Pigeon King. Bankers referred farmers to the CrimeBustersNow site when they came in for pigeon loans. Many farmers called Thornton, and Thornton began collecting numbers and cold-calling others pre-emptively. He apparently talked many people out of investing. But because he often phoned late at night, and also asked for money to fund various CrimeBustersNow campaigns, it was hard for many farmers to take him seriously. \u201cHe sounded like he was on a tirade against anyone and everyone,\u201d one American investor told the police. A farmer in Ontario named Dale Leifso told me, \u201cHe sounded slightly unhinged.\u201d Leifso was already skeptical of Pigeon King when Thornton called him late one night, but Thornton sounded so unbalanced that Leifso thinks he may have even wound up defending Galbraith. Leifso eventually cut a check to Pigeon King for $125,000. The company folded before he could sell back any birds.In early December 2007, Pigeon King was attacked again. Better Farming, a magazine with a full-time editorial staff of three, working out of an office on the editor\u2019s own farm in eastern Ontario, published a 16-page \u201cspecial investigation\u201d of Pigeon King International, by far the longest piece of reporting the magazine had ever tackled. Its editor, Robert Irwin, told me that Better Farming was stonewalled by provincial and federal authorities. (\u201cThe police had no interest in what was going on,\u201d he said.) Even so, Irwin\u2019s team assembled an exhaustive and devastating expos\u00e9, a heroic piece of public-interest journalism that pulled together all kinds of agricultural data and quotes from pigeon fanciers and squab processors to undermine Galbraith\u2019s claim that there could be a market for so many birds.The bad press crippled Pigeon King. Farmers were showing the Better Farming article to salesmen, asking for explanations. One salesman, Mark DeWitt, drove out to Better Farming\u2019s office \u2014 Irwin\u2019s farmhouse \u2014 to photograph it; he seemed to think that showing investors the magazine\u2019s unimpressive headquarters would undercut its credibility. There was an altercation. In a letter Galbraith sent to breeders, DeWitt said that Irwin \u201cwent absolutely ballistic,\u201d jabbing a shovel in his face. (Irwin told me he put the shovel up to block DeWitt\u2019s camera, and DeWitt grabbed it through the driver\u2019s side window of his truck and wouldn\u2019t let go.) DeWitt explained that he then drove off with one end of the shovel still in his truck. Irwin says he was dragged for several yards; DeWitt denies this. Eventually, Better Farming published an investigative profile of DeWitt, reporting that he was a disbarred lawyer who swindled clients out of at least $100,000 in the 1980s and that he still owed Better Farming for some classified ads he took out years earlier. DeWitt denies these allegations. Documents provided by Better Farming show that the disbarred lawyer, Mark DeWitt, and the pigeon salesman, Mark DeWitt, happen to have the same middle initial and date of birth.\u201cThe global demand for quality squab at reasonable prices is unlimited,\u201d Galbraith insisted, and he was resolute, even cocky, as the assaults kept coming. Soon, the attorney general of Iowa issued a civil investigative demand, asking Galbraith for proof that his company was not \u201ca Ponzi-type of investment scheme\u201d if it wanted to keep doing business in the state. Maryland and Washington followed with similar actions. \u201cI feel like an old oak tree with a very strong wind trying to blow me down,\u201d Galbraith wrote in The Pigeon Post in the spring of 2008. \u201cI have been battered and wounded, but I am still standing.\u201dInside the company, though, Galbraith was scrambling. A year earlier, Pigeon King didn\u2019t have enough pigeons to supply all its new breeders with birds. Now there was a backlog. The so-called holding barns \u2014 facilities that Pigeon King rented across the United States and Canada to house pigeons it purchased from farmers, before shipping them off to new investors \u2014 were filling up. Desperate to lure in new business, Galbraith offered referral fees and progressively more lucrative contracts. He pushed salesmen into the untapped territory of western Canada. \u201cYou could tell he was just log-jammed with pigeons,\u201d the owner of one holding barn in Ontario told me. \u201cThere was clearly no way to get rid of them.\u201dIn a typical Ponzi scheme, like Bernie Madoff\u2019s, the scammer moves money between investors, to pay what he claims are dividends on an investment that doesn\u2019t actually exist. But Galbraith didn\u2019t have a fake investment as a front. He had birds \u2014 lots of birds, and those birds created more birds, which he, in turn, was obligated to buy, then house, feed, water and medicate at considerable cost until he could sell them off to someone else. He appeared to miss the whole point of a Ponzi: He took the hidden, fungible fictions that give the scam its power and turned them into tangible liabilities.There were 14 holding barns in Ontario alone. The largest ones held upward of 40,000 pigeons. The fact that Galbraith maintained those flocks instead of killing or releasing them \u2014 that he kept behaving as if the pigeons weren\u2019t disposable props but products with genuine value \u2014 suggests either that he didn\u2019t believe he was running a Ponzi or that he was just exceptionally bad at it. During the trial, one former employee remembered Galbraith unlocking his desk drawer one day, pulling out a ledger and telling him, \u201cYou realize we\u2019re going to have to sell $125 million worth of contracts in 2008 and 2009 to use up all the birds.\u201dWhen Christine Bults got the news, she sat on her kitchen floor and cried. For the last three years, Galbraith had picked up her young pigeons himself every month, buying them back at $25 a head. He and Bults would chat while loading the crates onto his pickup or over a cup of coffee. Galbraith would write her a check for the pigeons on the spot, for $4,000 or more, often without double-checking her count. Soon, Bults had enough money to give her oldest daughter a proper wedding; the family was living comfortably for the first time in 15 years.Still, as she watched Galbraith drive so many pigeons off her property every month, she wondered where they could be going. Initially, Galbraith told her he wanted 100 investors, but she saw him expand relentlessly beyond that target. The contracts and referral fees advertised in The Pigeon Post suggested he was desperate for cash. Months before the Better Farming story broke, Bults had become convinced that Pigeon King International was unsustainable, if not an outright scam. She just had a feeling that \u201csomething stupid is going to happen,\u201d she told me, and no longer felt comfortable offering tours of her barn to prospective investors. But she didn\u2019t want to make too much noise. Her attitude, she would confess regretfully at the trial, became \u201csurvival of the fittest.\u201d She wanted to sell enough pigeons to Galbraith to pay down her loan and get out.When Pigeon King crashed, the Bultses still owed about $86,000. It took Christine a day, maybe two, to decide what to do next. Her first thought was to crate up her pigeons and have a truck-driver friend leave them on Galbraith\u2019s lawn. Ron, her husband, nixed that idea. So instead, Christine began her own investigation, half-hoping to prove to herself that the company hadn\u2019t been a scam. She phoned breeders, who connected her with other breeders, and she listened patiently to dozens of victims vent or weep. Galbraith was incommunicado, but Bults pieced together where he lived, in part from a woman who cleaned his house, and while Ron hollered, \u201cChris, get back in the vehicle,\u201d she circled the property, going window to window, until she was sure Galbraith wasn\u2019t there.When Wagler got word the company was finished, Wagler was on his way to promote Pigeon King at an agricultural expo in Saskatchewan and had just checked in to a hotel near the Toronto airport. He considered Galbraith a friend and felt hurt that he hadn\u2019t called him after the collapse. \u201cHave you ever heard the saying, \u2018There\u2019s none so blind as he who will not see?\u2019 \u201d Wagler asked me last fall. \u201cMaybe I was guilty of that.\u201dSeveral hundred farmers attended the meeting in Stratford. Wagler joined a committee tasked with finding another market for everyone\u2019s pigeons and, after connecting with a processed-food entrepreneur, the group began meeting monthly at Wagler\u2019s church. The entrepreneur worked up gourmet recipes for the committee to taste \u2014 smoked pigeon breast, pigeon soup \u2014 and the meetings became makeshift dinner parties. \u201cHe\u2019d bring dessert and everything,\u201d Wagler remembered. The dishes were delicious, but it turned out the pigeons yielded so little meat that even if the farmers charged $30 for what Wagler called these \u201cglorified TV dinners for two,\u201d they still had little hope of turning a profit.Around North America, it was dawning on Pigeon King breeders that their birds were worthless \u2014 too small for squab, not refined enough to be taken seriously by any racer. (\u201cI saw these birds, and they made no sense to me,\u201d a longtime supplier to pigeon hobbyists told me. \u201cWhat he had was a bunch of junk \u2014 crossbreeds and just nothing.\u201d) In his letter, Galbraith told investors they were free to do what they pleased with the pigeons, even to open their barn doors and set them free. Officials in Ontario realized they had a potential avian refugee crisis on their hands. Farmers in the province had been left holding an estimated 400,000 pigeons \u2014 birds they suddenly had no incentive to keep. There was concern the pigeons could swarm into downtown Toronto like a plague.The province\u2019s agricultural ministry was inundated with calls. It gave out advice about euthanasia and resources for proper disposal. Then in July, the agency began clearing out some of the largest barns itself. Crews gassed 175,000 pigeons in five weeks, working 16-hour days, six days a week. An internal assessment noted that, in retrospect, it would have been wise to have grief counselors on hand; many breeders had grown attached to their pigeons.Christine Bults served on the same committee with Wagler and hung on to her birds as long as she could. \u201cFinally,\u201d she told me, \u201cone day, I came home and said, \u2018Today\u2019s the day.\u2019 \u201d Like many investors, the Bultses kept their pigeons in an old barn that couldn\u2019t be sealed off for gassing, so when the sun went down and the pigeons became docile, Christine, Ron and their five children trapped them in feedbags and drowned them in a trough. (Other farmers I spoke to wrung their pigeons\u2019 necks by hand \u2014 even the day-old babies, one woman confessed.) Bults told me, \u201cI cried the whole time.\u201d There were about 3,000 birds in her barn. The work took two and a half hours.Galbraith, meanwhile, had retreated to Sacred Dove Ranch, the planned site of his future processing plant. Years earlier, he built a home and guest cottage there and hired two caretakers, Debbie Zabek and Del Mountain. Now, Zabek told me, Galbraith \u201ckind of went into seclusion.\u201d He was living in the basement of the main house; all the lights upstairs were off, the shades drawn. \u201cHe might have been falling apart,\u201d she said. In an interview with a Canadian news show that November, Galbraith was unrepentant. When asked what his ruined investors were supposed to do now, he blared: \u201cSame thing as me! Try to put their life back together!\u201dPigeon King International declared bankruptcy with less than $50,000 in assets. Eventually, Galbraith would declare personal bankruptcy, too. In the end, the Pigeon King was left to clean up the same mess as his subjects. Zabek recalled looking out the window one day and watching Galbraith remove bulging garbage bags from Sacred Dove\u2019s pigeon barn, load them onto the back of a four-wheeler and drive off. Zabek figured he was snapping the birds\u2019 necks and dumping them in the bush.It was hard to watch. Lies and misdirection aside, Galbraith always seemed to sincerely love the birds. In the past, Zabek would sometimes see him release a group of pigeons, then stand in the cold with his head up, watching them circle. \u201cTo each his own, I guess,\u201d she said.Robinson and her investigators started tracing the whole maze of sensational subplots. They discovered a couple of chilling instances when Galbraith\u2019s affable farmer persona fell away and a more ruthless Pigeon King could be glimpsed beneath it. One involved a company bookkeeper, Darryl Diefenbacher, a chartered accountant, who didn\u2019t piece together that Pigeon King was a Ponzi scheme until he\u2019d been working in the office for four months. He would later testify that when he confronted Galbraith, in the summer of 2007, Galbraith told him coldly, \u201cThis is a very awkward discussion we\u2019re having.\u201d Diefenbacher responded: \u201cNo, Arlan. This is nothing like the one you\u2019re going to have with the F.B.I. \u201dWilliam Top, Pigeon King\u2019s first U.S. salesman, forced his own cinematic confrontation with Galbraith in early 2006. Top explained to me how his doubts about the company were cemented through a series of coincidences, including a chance encounter with a crowd of fanatical pigeon fanciers in a Pennsylvania Waffle House. (Top compared the old men to Shriners: \u201cButtons and vests and funny hats.\u201d) They\u2019d never heard of Galbraith, which seemed impossible to Top, given how small the pigeon-breeding world is. Eventually, Top went to Galbraith\u2019s office demanding answers. When the Pigeon King explained that he was, as Top put it, \u201cstrictly in the business of selling breeders,\u201d with no outside customers for his birds, Top admonished him for running a scam. Galbraith bowed his head. \u201cAnd then when he raised his head,\u201d Top would tell the jury, there was \u201ca different look on his face. It was a different Arlan.\u201d Galbraith threatened to ruin Top\u2019s reputation, and that of his family, if he exposed Pigeon King. Top quit on the spot. He told me he subsequently called many farmers and other employees to warn them, but everyone was making good money; many didn\u2019t want to upset the arrangement. \u201cPeople loathed me,\u201d Top said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my life threatened.\u201dThe story Lynn Robinson saw unspooling was elaborate and unwieldy. And because there was no money to recover for the victims, her job was to find an efficient way to send Galbraith to jail, without paying to fly in dozens of witnesses or getting bogged down in a 20-month trial. Her office decided to let all of the company\u2019s employees off the hook. She would narrow the scope of the case to the 917 farmers who had signed with Galbraith since 2005 and prosecute the Pigeon King for fraud.Galbraith was charged in December 2010, two and half years after he sold his last pigeon. Then came three years of postponed court appearances and other delays, with Galbraith periodically slowing the procedural machinery by firing his lawyer or filing odd motions.The long lag disillusioned many farmers. It felt as if the peculiarities of the fraud \u2014 and the fact that, as Christine Bults put it, Galbraith was a farmer moving pigeons between barns in rural areas, not a banker moving numbers around a spreadsheet on Wall Street \u2014 gave authorities permission not to take his victims seriously. It had taken the police seven months from the time Pigeon King imploded to open an investigation and another year to complete it. By comparison, seven months after Bernard Madoff\u2019s scam fell apart, Madoff was already in prison, serving 150 years.Witnesses portrayed the Pigeon King as a commandeering and eccentric businessman \u2014 he didn\u2019t let employees sign checks or open the mail \u2014 but often in ways that didn\u2019t seem crooked or even calculating, just weird. Each month, for example, Galbraith would pay off his salesmen\u2019s credit cards in full (upward of $40,000 in gas and travel expenses), then cut up the cards and issue new ones. And though there were reasons that opening a squab-processing plant at a remote site like Sacred Dove Ranch seemed foolish, Galbraith made a plausible case, during his cross-examination of the engineer he hired to draw up the plans, that he was serious about constructing it anyway.Maybe Pigeon King had been a scam from the start, or maybe it had devolved into one at some unknown point, as sales to farmers swelled and Galbraith lost control. It was tempting to reread his Pigeon Post columns for some veiled confession. The essence of Pigeon Religion, he wrote in January 2007, was this: \u201cUnited people are builders of the positive. Negative people divide and knock down a good thing.\u201d Really, he was describing the psychological architecture of a Ponzi scheme, a community fused precariously by optimism and trust.Robinson expected Galbraith to stitch together a convoluted counternarrative that she\u2019d have the pleasure of shredding. (\u201cBe careful,\u201d a veteran lawyer warned her. \u201cThe only defense to a big fraud is a bigger fraud.\u201d) But it never happened. Galbraith declined to take the stand and called only one witness. He didn\u2019t even make an opening statement. His story emerged piecemeal from assertions that he slipped into the proceedings. They expanded on his earlier rebuttals to Thornton and Better Farming: The pigeons that farmers were left holding when Pigeon King collapsed, he explained, were only \u201cbreeding stock\u201d \u2014 an intermediary step on the path to Hinterland Squabs. Galbraith even brought a visual aid to illustrate his sophisticated \u201cup-breeding\u201d program, but never figured out how to introduce it as evidence. He tried to unveil it repeatedly during one cross-examination, but the judge, Justice G.E. Taylor, kept disallowing it, because the witness had never seen the document. \u201cYour honor, I\u2019m not allowed to show him this genetic formula?\u201d Galbraith finally asked the judge glumly. Then he gave up.In general, his clumsiness as an attorney so disrupted the flow of the trial that Justice Taylor, and even Robinson, repeatedly stepped in to assist him. The jury was occasionally excused so Galbraith could be given longer tutorials. Still, Galbraith kept floating bizarre hypotheticals while cross-examining witnesses and lacing his questions with insults and accusations. Because there were often no legitimate questions to answer, witnesses frequently took the opportunity to tell Galbraith off. At one point, Dale Leifso, the Ontario farmer, erupted at him: \u201cI\u2019ve got places I gotta be, I\u2019ve got a thousand things to do at home, and I\u2019m sitting here in a courtroom answering these stupid questions!\u201d The defense Galbraith was mounting, in other words, seemed just as rudderless as his company. And that, however unwittingly, may have been the best evidence he offered in his favor.Christine Bults was the first breeder called by the prosecution, and she seized every opportunity to dress Galbraith down. But as Galbraith\u2019s cross-examination wore on, something extraordinary happened: The Pigeon King\u2019s own wounded feelings became just as conspicuous as hers. The catharsis was happening on both sides. Knowing him so well, Galbraith asked Bults, didn\u2019t she understand he was too \u201cparalyzed with depression\u201d to call farmers once his company fell apart?\u201cI was depressed, too!\u201d Bults said shakily. \u201cWas I not?\u201dHe told her \u2014 again, ostensibly in the form of a question \u2014 how shocked and disappointed he was that, after years of what he considered friendship, she would turn against him.\u201cSeriously?\u201d Bults shot back. \u201cWhat a dumb question, Arlan! I didn\u2019t turn against you. You walked away from us!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a cross-examination anymore; it was an unrestrained showdown between two estranged friends. Soon, Galbraith was lashing out. \u201cDo you realize,\u201d he asked, \u201cyou\u2019re a prime example of a two-faced, fair-weather friend, ready to stab me in the back when things don\u2019t go your way?\u201d But Bults interrupted him, which meant that after some refereeing from the judge, Galbraith was asked to repeat the question. He did, verbatim.\u201cAre you done?\u201d Bults asked this time, goading him.\u201cYes,\u201d he said.It was her moment, and she tried to rise to it, pushing the final words out slow and hard. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t stab me in the back,\u201d she said, \u201cmy fair-weather friend?\u201dGalbraith had finally hired a lawyer, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do at this point. He merely noted that his client was a senior citizen with no criminal history, whose life had taken a tragic turn after his wife\u2019s accident. The prosecution was asking for nine to 12 years, which Galbraith\u2019s lawyer called a \u201ccrushing sentence\u201d for a man who, as these last months showed, clearly wouldn\u2019t fare well in prison. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly a diminished man,\u201d he said.The judge was not sympathetic. Galbraith, he said, appeared to have a \u201clack of insight into his serious criminal conduct\u201d and absolutely no sympathy for his victims. The judge had read through statements that farmers filed with the police, outlining their stories. They were devastating. Farmers with too much pride to file for bankruptcy wrote vulnerably about their deep feelings of shame and regret. \u201cEvery day I feel that I have let my children down,\u201d one said. Another explained, \u201cAll the hours that my husband spent away from our babies when they were little \u2014 all for nothing.\u201dMarriages suffered. \u201cWe are still together,\u201d one man wrote, \u201cbut we do not talk about the pigeon deal at all.\u201d Victims\u2019 children were ridiculed at school. There were anxiety attacks, depression, suicidal thoughts, heart attacks, teeth falling out from stress. \u201cCancer has come back into my life after a 30-plus-year absence,\u201d one woman wrote. Worst of all, the experience broke some fundamental decency in many people. \u201cWe have learned not to trust,\u201d one couple confessed. \u201cThis is against our very nature.\u201dThe judge sentenced Galbraith to seven years and three and a half months. The Pigeon King said nothing at the hearing. He is now in a prison in northern Ontario and, last year, quietly dropped his appeal. Christine Bults told me she was grateful to prosecutors for putting Galbraith away, but it was hard to appreciate his sentence as justice when she was still paying $1,000 a month on her loan. Then she thought about it and added that, as a taxpayer, \u201cIt\u2019s costing me money again to have him sit in jail.\u201dBults attended the entire four-week trial and told me that, during a lunch recess one day, she came back from having a cigarette and found Galbraith sitting on a bench in an empty hallway of the courthouse with his head down. Bults sat on the bench right across from him. She stared at him, hard. \u201cI never moved,\u201d she told me. \u201cI just stayed there.\u201dShe was trying to force Galbraith to look at her, to acknowledge her. At one point, the Pigeon King finally lifted up his head. For a split second, Bults caught his eye. Then he looked away.Jon Mooallem is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "A Scary Movie: Filling Your 401(k) With Company Stock", "Date": "2015-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyThe company filed for bankruptcy protection last month, after years of lackluster interest from customers who once flocked to the stores for their doodads and gizmos. The company\u2019s stock trades over the counter for spare change, after a slow-motion disintegration over the last five years.So the lawyers and the bankers are now the protagonists, as they have been in all of these movies. But an obvious question lingers: Why do so many companies and employees keep signing up to be a part of all this drama?Employer stock in 401(k) plans is less common than it used to be, but it\u2019s still in plenty of them. According to Aon Hewitt\u2019s 2013 survey data, 39 percent of employers offer their stock as an investment option. Among those companies, 12 percent go much further, requiring that the employer match of workers\u2019 contributions from their paychecks be in company stock. Most let employees swap it for something else right away, but inertia often keeps them from doing so.The Plan Sponsor Council of America, using a different data set, lays out the results of such policies: When employees have the option (or are required because of a match) to invest in company stock through a 401(k) plan, a fair number do. On average, about 18.1 percent of assests are invested that way, while the median is 13 percent. At least the number of companies where more than half of the 401(k) plan assets are in company stock has fallen over time; in 2004 it was 13 percent, but in 2013 it was just 2.2 percent.Why do companies allow and encourage such investments? There were once plenty of good theories. If employees owned a lot of stock, they might vote their shares with management if hostile forces were trying to take the company over. And encouraging employees to have skin in the game is good, as it gives them incentive to work hard and rewards them for greater effort.All of this, however, is incredibly risky. When you\u2019re getting your income from an employer \u2014 and your livelihood literally depends on that company \u2014 it makes little sense to make a big bet on the company stock with money that you\u2019ll need if you ever want to stop working when you\u2019re old and gray someday.Employees do this anyway, however, and they do not seem to get themselves out of the investments even when the warning signs are already all around them.This is what seems to have happened at RadioShack, where the average number of shares that employees held through the 401(k) plan increased in recent years even as the company\u2019s share price fell steadily. The lawsuit will determine whether the company should have stopped its employees from making what turns out to have been a foolish bet.The message of this and other movies like it is clear for employees: Don\u2019t do this. If your employer matches your 401(k) contribution in company stock, set a calendar alert to remind yourself to sell it a few times each year and then reinvest it. If your employer restricts your ability to sell it right away and makes you keep it for a few years, complain loudly to human resources; most companies don\u2019t do that anymore.Even if an employer stock fund is one choice among many in your 401(k) plan, ask yourself this: Given the employment risk you already face by getting your income from a single source, do you really want to bet even part of your retirement money on that company? How much do you really know about its prospects, its competitors and forces way beyond your control? And how much are you willfully blind to?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nasdaq Changed in Its Climb to 5,000", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseThat the Nasdaq composite index closed over 5,000 this week for the first time in 15 years is not just a reminder of the virtues of patience. It\u2019s even more a testament to the transformative power of capitalism.\u201cJoseph Schumpeter was spot on when he said capitalism is all about creative destruction,\u201d said Richard Sylla, an economics professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and a specialist in the history of markets, referring to the Austrian-American economist who described the phenomenon in 1942 in \u201cCapitalism, Socialism and Democracy.\u201dMany investors have forgotten that the plunge in the Nasdaq that began in 2000 was no steeper than its rise in the late 1990s \u2014 a classic formation and bursting of an investment bubble, as a glance at a chart of the Nasdaq over the past 20 years makes clear. The plunge was so severe in large part because the index\u2019s steep rise resulted from not one, but two simultaneous bubbles \u2014 one in dot-com stocks and the companies that supplied them, the other in telecommunications.The Nasdaq was up 15.67 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,982.81 on Thursday.No one thinks the Nasdaq composite, or any other broad stock index, is in bubble territory today, despite the prolonged rally that began in 2009. \u201cToday\u2019s levels are justified by the fundamentals,\u201d said Paul Wick, who has lived through both boom and bust as portfolio manager of the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund, which he began managing in 1989.He notes that the Nasdaq index trades today at a far lower price-to-earnings ratio than it did in 2000. \u201cThe biggest company in the index is Apple,\u201d he said. \u201cBy every yardstick, it\u2019s a great company and it\u2019s very modestly valued.\u201dProfessor Sylla suggested that investors, now twice burned by market plunges in 2000 and 2008, were far more cautious than in the late 1990s. \u201cThe dot-com bubble was just 15, 16 years ago, so just about everyone 35 or older, an age when people begin to have money to invest, remembers it,\u201d he said. \u201cThese folks have learned some lessons about bubbles, fortunately. So current valuations, while high by most historical standards, are more reasonable than they were 15 years ago.\u201dNevertheless, at the market\u2019s current elevated levels, he said, \u201ccaution is warranted.\u201dMr. Smith, of Nasdaq, said that as a group, Nasdaq companies today \u201care bigger, older and more mature,\u201d though still younger, on average, than those in the Dow Jones industrial average or the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, the other leading market indexes.They are also more diversified. Although the Nasdaq is often considered a proxy for technology companies, they now make up about 43 percent of the Nasdaq listings, down from nearly 65 percent in 2000, according to Nasdaq. Among the nontechnology companies ranked among the top 20 today are the biotechnology companies Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Celgene and Biogen Idec as well as the retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance, Costco, eBay and Priceline, and the coffee chain Starbucks.\u201cYou could argue that these are 2000-era stocks,\u201d Mr. Wick said. \u201cTo some degree, there are always people who are willing to roll the dice. They want to own companies that might be the next big thing, and they\u2019re just wired to take the chance that some companies might turn into that. They look at exponential revenue growth, and it\u2019s easy to imagine that somewhere down the road, they\u2019re going to be hugely profitable.\u201dBut there\u2019s a different tone even with these highflying stocks, Professor Sylla said. \u201cUnlike in 1999, when adding dot-com to your name caused your company\u2019s valuation to soar, in these more mature, more sober times the recipe for stratospheric valuations is a promising product (Tesla cars) or fast-growing revenues and widespread product acceptance (Amazon), coupled with charismatic leadership.\u201d\u201cI think our markets are still doing what they long have done, namely financing entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo one can know the future, but the markets encourage investors to make bets on it and some of those bets pay off, for investors and buyers of innovative products. Wall Street is much more than the rich man\u2019s racetrack, as some have described it. It\u2019s what helps to move our economy and our standard of living forward.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plenty of Noise, but Not Much Guidance From Fed or Company Reports", "Date": "2015-02-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe markets are suffering from information overload. Investors have been receiving guidance about the future, but it\u2019s not clear what they should do about it. I\u2019m thinking of the guidance coming from two sets of important sources. One is the Federal Reserve, which controls short-term interest rates and influences longer-term rates, too. The other is the array of publicly traded American corporations reporting earnings for the last three months of 2014 \u2014 and opining about earnings prospects well into the future.Because investors should care about what will happen to their money in the future, all of this guidance could be very helpful. Yet, except as an exercise in elaborate signaling behavior, there\u2019s little evidence that it has been useful. First, let\u2019s look at what the Fed has been saying. Edward Yardeni, an independent market researcher, put it this way: \u201cShe said the Fed will be \u2018data dependent\u2019 \u2014 and basically that means that once the Fed knows what it\u2019s doing, it will let the rest of us know.\u201d There\u2019s more to the Fed guidance, including new market signals, which Ms. Yellen explained. It centers on the word \u201cpatient\u201d \u2014 the Fed\u2019s characterization of its attitude about raising rates. For the moment, the stock market took the new Fed information as a signal that nothing much had changed. It barely moved over the course of the week, although stocks fell a bit on the second day of Ms. Yellen\u2019s testimony, when she had spirited exchanges with House Republicans who criticized the Fed\u2019s expansive monetary policy. The market has been rising \u2014 for the most part \u2014 since March 2009, in no small measure because of that policy, which makes stocks and other assets relatively attractive, compared with low-yielding fixed-income instruments. Ms. Yellen\u2019s prepared testimony seemed aimed at keeping the market calm \u2014 not only now but whenever the Fed actually decides to raise interest rates.Recently, the market has been rising despite a barrage of corporate reports that might suggest that stock prices are overextended. After all, growth in both revenue and earnings for the last quarter has decelerated. For the 440 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index that had reported by Wednesday, revenue for the fourth quarter rose only 1.5 percent over the period a year ago, compared with a 4.1 percent growth rate for the third quarter at the same point in the previous earnings season, Mr. Yardeni said.Comparable numbers for earnings were an annual increase of 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter, versus a 10.4 percent rise at the same point in the previous earnings season. The strong dollar, falling oil prices and a sluggish global economy have all taken their toll. What\u2019s worse, guidance for future earnings turned extremely pessimistic. Bespoke Investment Group examined 1,680 publicly traded companies that reported earnings between Jan. 12 and Feb. 19. After subtracting downgraded guidance from upgrades, it found that, on average, companies had downgraded their earnings prospects by \u201ca ridiculously low\u201d net 9.5 percentage points. Corporate guidance hasn\u2019t been that bleak since the end of the financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009.Companies that lowered their guidance were punished for it. On average, this earnings season, their shares declined 2.7 percent on the day of the announcement. Yet despite the mediocre profit performance and warnings of worse to come, the market has remained buoyant. \u201cWe\u2019re in danger of a market melt-up,\u201d a surge that isn\u2019t supported by fundamentals, Mr. Yardeni said. \u201cThe problem with a melt-up,\u201d he said, \u201cis that it will lead to a meltdown.\u201dOf course, corporate executives have been known to engage in signaling behavior of their own \u2014 deliberately lowering expectations ahead of time so their company will register \u201ca positive earnings surprise.\u201d Companies facing an earnings squeeze may be paving the way for positive surprises later.That\u2019s why Laszlo Birinyi, an independent strategist who has been bullish since 2009, says most of these signals mean very little. \u201cApple\u2019s made an art form of lowering expectations and then beating them,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe other companies are learning from them.\u201d Canny investors should learn from this behavior, he said. Fundamentally, he says, in the months before a Fed rate increase, the stock market has tended to rise, and he expects that to happen now. \u201cBull markets usually continue until there is a big shock or a recession, which we can\u2019t predict,\u201d he said.Most of the deluge of information is maneuvering, signaling and just plain noise, in his view. \u201cI don\u2019t see a recession coming right now. And in the meantime, while the market may run into some trouble, we\u2019re still in a bull market \u2014 until we\u2019re not, but we don\u2019t know when that will be.\u201d The recent guidance won\u2019t help with that.

{"Headline": "At JPMorgan Chase, Business Tilts Toward the Consumer Side and Away From Wall St.", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA reversal of fortunes within the financial industry is illustrated in few places more vividly than JPMorgan Chase. A few years ago, the company\u2019s consumer bank, Chase, was struggling under the weight of the mortgage crisis and a slow economy while the JPMorgan investment bank thrived.More recently, however, it was the head of the consumer bank, Gordon Smith, who was sounding upbeat and jocular as he spoke, with his English accent, about his growing business during a presentation at the company\u2019s annual investor day, pointing to opportunities like the bank\u2019s new mobile app and the improving credit of the American consumer.A few hours earlier that same day, Daniel Pinto, the Argentine-born head of the company\u2019s investment bank, was notably less cheery as he reviewed billions of dollars in cuts his division will be making and reductions in his future financial projections, even as his team has gained relative to competitors.It was not discussed during the investor day last week, but it is Mr. Smith who is in line to succeed Jamie Dimon should JPMorgan Chase need a new chief executive in the near future, according to company executives briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.In the past, the succession line at JPMorgan Chase was generally thought to run through the more complicated and, at the time, more profitable investment bank. When it came time for Mr. Dimon to speak to the company\u2019s investors, he joked about the unexpected nature of a situation in which it is the Wall Street power brokers who are on the back foot.\u201cI tell Daniel and all the guys, all the folks from the investment bank, it\u2019s really weird to feel sorry for the investment bank, isn\u2019t it? You have to confess,\u201d Mr. Dimon said, drawing a laugh from the audience.The diverging prospects for JPMorgan\u2019s biggest businesses reflect a split within the broader financial industry. Investors are betting that banks like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp, which focus primarily on American consumers, will grow much faster than firms like Goldman Sachs, which are concentrated on Wall Street business.JPMorgan is a particularly stark indication of the trends because it has maintained dominant operations in both consumer and investment banking.The investment bank led by Mr. Pinto has been improving its position relative to competitors, gaining market share in areas like stock trading and European banking, cementing its place as the largest investment bank in the world. But while profits at JPMorgan Chase rose to a record level last year, profits from the investment bank fell 16 percent from the previous year to the lowest level since 2011. Mr. Pinto still oversees an enormous operation that accounts for about a third of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s total revenue. When judged by the returns it provides to shareholders, though, the investment bank has become the worst performing major division in the company. The return on equity \u2014 a commonly used measure of profitability \u2014 was around 20 percent in the consumer division last year. In the Wall Street operation it was half that. Moving forward, Mr. Pinto lowered his projected returns for future years to 13 percent from 15 percent, bringing it below even the struggling mortgage lending operation. The gap between the different businesses inside JPMorgan is a large part of the reason an analyst at Goldman Sachs suggested that the company might be worth more if the investment bank was broken off as a separate business. JPMorgan\u2019s executives resist any suggestion that the bank should be split up. But the lagging performance is forcing Mr. Pinto to consider cutting expenses more sharply than other divisions of the company must. Over the last four years, the investment bank has already reduced costs by 10 percent, largely by cutting front-office salaries. And last week Mr. Pinto outlined another round of cuts that he expected to bring expenses down an additional 13 percent. \u201cIt is a point where you really need to embrace the change, disrupt your model and do what it takes in order to maintain the leadership position that we have going forward,\u201d he said. The recalculation is being brought on by several factors, some of them temporary. The regulatory pressure on the investment bank remains strong as it faces potential fines over accusations that traders colluded to manipulate various financial benchmarks; it is not alone in facing this pressure.The continuing low interest rates have also reduced activity on trading desks across the industry, something that Mr. Pinto suggested was likely to change soon. Indeed, he suggested that trading revenue during the first weeks of 2015 had improved significantly.But even if that continues, the trading desks that provide a majority of the investment bank\u2019s revenue face major headwinds that are not likely to fade away. In 2014, the single biggest driver of falling returns was the increased amount of loss-absorbing capital that JPMorgan needed to allocate for every trade it did \u2014 a result of the stepped-up capital requirements put forward by the Federal Reserve. Such capital costs the investment bank real money that is not required, to the same degree, by the consumer bank, and reduced returns for Mr. Pinto by 1.8 percentage points last year. In the coming years, JPMorgan is likely to have to raise even more capital, and more so than other banks because of JPMorgan\u2019s size and complexity. Most of the rising capital requirements are tied to the capital-intensive operations under Mr. Pinto\u2019s purview.Mr. Pinto said he was taking several steps to curtail business lines that require disproportionate amounts of capital. That could force the firm to potentially stop clearing certain derivatives trades for customers and holding deposits for some clients, like foreign banks.Mr. Dimon said that he got a note from one of his top deputies, reminding him that in past years it was the investment bank that was \u201ccarrying the load while we were sucking wind in card and mortgage. And it\u2019s hard to remember today.\u201dThe bank chief said the situations would most likely reverse again, but his executives provided no timeline for when that might happen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Partying Like It\u2019s 1995", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix years ago, Paul Ryan, who has since become the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the G.O.P.\u2019s leading voice on matters economic, had an Op-Ed article published in The Times. Under the headline \u201cThirty Years Later, a Return to Stagflation,\u201d he warned that the efforts of the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve to fight the effects of financial crisis would bring back the woes of the 1970s, with both inflation and unemployment high.True, not all Republicans agreed with his assessment. Many asserted that we were heading for Weimar-style hyperinflation instead.Needless to say, those warnings proved totally wrong. Soaring inflation never materialized. Job creation was sluggish at first, but more recently has accelerated dramatically. Far from seeing a rerun of that \u201970s show, what we\u2019re now looking at is an economy that in important respects resembles that of the 1990s. To be sure, there are big differences between America in 2015 and America in the \u201990s. TV is much better now, the situation of workers much worse. While stocks are high and there is talk of a new technology bubble, there\u2019s nothing like the old euphoria. There is also, unfortunately, no sign that the great productivity surge of 1995-2005, brought on as businesses adopted information technology, is coming back.Still, we\u2019re now adding jobs at a rate not seen since the Clinton years. And it goes without saying that low inflation combined with rapid job growth makes nonsense of all those predictions that Obamacare, or maybe just the president\u2019s bad attitude, would destroy the private sector. But pointing out yet again just how wrong the usual suspects on the right have been about, well, everything isn\u2019t the only reason to note parallels with the 1990s. There are also implications for monetary policy: Recent job gains have brought the Fed to a fork in the road very much like the situation it faced circa 1995. Now, as then, job growth has taken the official unemployment rate down to a level at which, according to conventional wisdom, the economy should be overheating and inflation should be rising. But now, as then, there is no sign of the predicted inflation in the actual data.The Fed has a so-called dual mandate \u2014 it\u2019s supposed to achieve both price stability and full employment. At this point price stability is conventionally taken to mean low but positive inflation, at around 2 percent a year. What does it mean to achieve full employment? For the Fed, it means reaching the Nairu \u2014 the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, which is consistent with that inflation target. The Fed currently estimates the Nairu at between 5.2 percent and 5.5 percent, and the latest report puts the actual unemployment rate at 5.5 percent. So we\u2019re there \u2014 time to raise interest rates!Or maybe not. The Nairu is supposed to be the unemployment rate at which the economy overheats and an inflationary spiral starts to kick in. But there is no sign of inflationary pressure. In particular, if the job market really were tight, wages would be rising quickly, whereas they are in fact going nowhere.The thing is, we\u2019ve been here before. In the early-to-mid 1990s, the Fed generally estimated the Nairu as being between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, and by 1995, unemployment had already fallen to that level. But inflation wasn\u2019t actually rising. So Fed officials made what turned out to be a very good choice: They held their fire, waiting for clear signs of inflationary pressure. And it turned out that the United States\u2019 economy was capable of generating millions more jobs, without inflation, than it would have if the Fed had reined in the boom too soon.Are we in a similar situation now? Actually, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but neither does the Fed. The question, then, is what to do in the face of that uncertainty, with no inflation problem yet in sight.To me, as to a number of economists \u2014 perhaps most notably Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary \u2014 the answer seems painfully obvious: Don\u2019t yank away that punch bowl, don\u2019t pull that rate-hike trigger, until you see the whites of inflation\u2019s eyes. If it turns out that the Fed has waited a bit too long, inflation might overshoot 2 percent for a while, but that wouldn\u2019t be a great tragedy. But if the Fed moves too soon, we might end up losing millions of jobs we could have had \u2014 and in the worst case, we might end up sliding into a Japanese-style deflationary trap, which has already happened in Sweden and possibly in the eurozone.What\u2019s worrisome is that it\u2019s not clear whether Fed officials see it that way. They need to heed the lessons of history \u2014 and the relevant history here is the 1990s, not the 1970s. Let\u2019s party like it\u2019s 1995; let the good, or at least better, times keep rolling, and hold off on those rate hikes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Goldman Sachs, Stress Test Results Could Endanger an Important Profit Source", "Date": "2015-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConcerns have emerged that Goldman Sachs \u2014 long the leader on Wall Street \u2014 may lose an important engine of profitability. On the Federal Reserve stress tests last week, Goldman performed poorly compared with other big banks. Now analysts and investors are worried that the bank could be barred by regulators from buying back its own stock or increasing dividends.Goldman has used dividends and share buybacks to appeal to investors at a time when other elements of the bank\u2019s business have faced challenges. When companies buy shares of their own stock on the open market, it generally increases the amount of profits attributed to every share, an important metric for investors.Several analysts have released research questioning whether the Federal Reserve would allow Goldman to continue its buyback programs given the results of the stress tests. Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, estimated that if Goldman is unable to repurchase shares, it could earn 42 cents a share less than expected this year, and $1.78 a share less than expected next year.\u201cThere is an expectation that they could be at risk,\u201d said Steve Chubak, a bank analyst with Nomura.Shares of Goldman fell 1.7 percent on Friday, the day after the stress tests, while the broader bank sector was up.The bank\u2019s predicament highlights how the Fed\u2019s stress test, which has become a powerful tool for Wall Street regulators, can trip up even a bank like Goldman, which came out of the financial crisis looking stronger than many rivals.The stress tests are intended to ensure that banks have an adequate cushion to sustain losses if another financial crisis hits. The Fed does not allow banks to give money back to shareholders if it would leave the banks with less of a cushion than they would need in a severe crisis.The Fed will not publicly give its final verdict on Goldman\u2019s buyback plans until Wednesday. Its decision is likely to hinge on how it analyzes the results of the stress test, and it may have determined that Goldman is strong enough to use profits to buy back shares.But Goldman\u2019s poor showing on the stress tests, relative to other banks, is the latest question mark facing the bank\u2019s vaunted business model. Goldman was essentially the only big bank that was expected to face problems in winning Fed approval for its dividend and buyback program, among analysts who released reports last week. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look pretty, just based on that,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with CLSA.According to Mr. Mayo\u2019s calculations, the stress tests could leave Goldman able to spend only $700 million on increased dividends and stock buybacks this year, in comparison with the $5.5 billion it spent on buybacks alone last year.But Mr. Mayo noted that Goldman could propose actions to the Fed that would allow the bank to increase the amount it can distribute to shareholders. Such actions might include cutting assets and issuing new securities. A Goldman spokesman had no comment on the stress test results.Goldman has already faced challenges to its business model because of the relatively slow trading activity in recent years in the markets where the bank makes much of its money.The same trading operations have also been the subject of more stringent regulations since the financial crisis. The so-called Volcker Rule forced Goldman to get rid of proprietary trading operations and investments that had been big drivers of profit.Several of the bank\u2019s competitors have responded to the new rules by cutting back the operations that are the subject of the rules, like commodities trading and hedge fund investing. But Goldman has bet that it will benefit when markets bounce back and it has fewer competitors.The stress tests this year came down hard on banks that rely on Wall Street trading desks. The Fed looked at how the banks would fare in a financial crisis in which the stock market fell 60 percent. In this situation, the Fed estimated that Goldman would lose $23.8 billion in its trading operations, more than almost any other bank. If that loss occurred, the Fed said that by one important measure, Goldman would have only a bit more loss-absorbing capital than the minimum expected by the Fed.The results of the stress test reflect the fact that Goldman has recently been returning a majority of its profits to its shareholders through buybacks and dividends, leaving it with less capital than it would have otherwise had at the beginning of the tests.Over the last three years, Goldman has spent $16.3 billion buying its own stock, around 70 percent of the bank\u2019s total profits during this period.That strategy has proved popular with shareholders, and the bank\u2019s executives have highlighted it as an important part of their strategy. But it is a strategy that the bank may now have to scale back.Peter Eavis contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2015-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHUNDER BAY, Ontario \u2014 The trip to pick up a load of iron ore powder in Conneaut, Ohio, was supposed to take four days by way of the Great Lakes.It was a 24-day ordeal, and the ship returned to its home port in Wisconsin without picking up the cargo.A deep freeze this winter left much of the Great Lakes blanketed in thick ice, sidelining the ship lines and companies that move vast amounts of grain, cement and other commodities through this system of waterways. And now the spring thaw, which creates piles of impassable ice, will most likely create more delays.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ice out there, and we need to understand the impact of that ice,\u201d said Mark Barker, the president of the Interlake Steamship Company, which carries mostly iron ore, coal and limestone on its nine ships. \u201cLast year, we pretty much lost the month of April.\u201dCold spells and snowstorms have taken a bite out of businesses across the Northeast and Midwest of the United States, as well as in Canada. Car manufacturers have blamed the weather for weak sales. Housing starts, too, have slumped. And blizzards in places like Boston have been brutal for many local businesses.Michael Dolega, who analyzes the United States economy at the Toronto-Dominion Bank, says he expects that the weather will cut first-quarter growth by as much as three-quarters of a percentage point. And not all of that loss will be made up later in the year, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a welcome development,\u201d said Mr. Dolega, who is based in Toronto.The Great Lakes shipping trade largely hibernates during the late winter months, with occasional sailings for supplies like road salt. The Arthur M. Anderson was making its last run of the season in early February when it became stuck.Shipping is usually up and running again by March. But the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the critical system of locks that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, has been postponed until April 2. Even when the locks open, there is no assurance that all of the lakes, particularly choke points prone to ice buildup, will be navigable.Last year\u2019s ice-induced delays reduced early shipments from the United States by seven million tons, according to the Lake Carriers\u2019 Association, which represents American shipowners. That amounts to about 10 percent of all American shipments on the lakes.The Great Lakes are a vital conduit for companies in a wide range of industries. Grain from farms in Western Canada makes its way to markets around the world. Iron ore travels to steel mills along the shorelines. Power plants depend on the coal that travels via the lakes. Companies in steelmaking, electrical generation, construction and agriculture \u2014 like Cargill, United States Steel and Lafarge \u2014 all need the waterways.For companies now facing dwindling stockpiles, there are few alternatives to ships for restocking. Shipping by rail is more costly, even if the tracks were not already overloaded. And hauling large quantities of, say, iron ore by truck is neither practical nor cost-effective. Replacing a single Great Lakes ore-carrying ship requires about 2,400 tractor-trailer trucks.During a normal winter, some ships can continue to make relatively short treks without much trouble, particularly when ice cover is light. But the last two winters have been particularly harsh.In 2014, ice cover peaked at 92.5 percent, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. Ice persisted in some places until June. This year, ice cover was 89.1 percent.\u201cTwo especially severe winters back to back \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen that in a long time,\u201d said George A. Leshkevich, who tracks the ice for the research laboratory. \u201cAll the lakes seem pretty brutal.\u201dIt has created nightmarish troubles for vessels that must continue to attempt runs through the worst of winter.Truck and train cargo that is too dangerous or too large for the bridge and tunnels spanning the international border between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, must instead travel the Detroit River. But dense ice stopped the Detroit-Windsor Truck Ferry for 31 days this year, 25 of them consecutively. At one point the ferry\u2019s tug was stuck in Windsor with its barge separately frozen to a dock in Detroit.Ed Bernard, vice president of the Toronto-based Precision Specialized Division, a heavy haul company, said he waited more than two weeks to ferry across the river sections of large chimneys destined for Ohio.Gregg Ward, the co-owner of the ferry, said, \u201cOur expenses continue, so it\u2019s a tragedy for us. By the time this is over, we\u2019ve lost 20 percent of the year.\u201dAs the thaw gets underway, the shipping situation can actually worsen if wind causes ice to pile up in stacks. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a 235-foot Coast Guard ship going full speed ahead, and when it hit one of those, the ship shuddered to a stop,\u201d said Lt. Davey Connor of the Coast Guard district in Cleveland, which is responsible for the Great Lakes.Many companies are now playing the waiting game.A United States Coast Guard icebreaker made initial attempts at breaking up ice last week in the port here. Eight imposing grain elevators, which collectively have the largest storage capacity in North America, make the Thunder Bay port an important hub for Canadian exports heading to the Atlantic Ocean.Once again this year, the season\u2019s first ships will not get loaded in March as they normally are. As the Canadian Wheat Board\u2019s elevator nears capacity, Paul Kennedy, its manager, says that he may soon be forced to stop daily unloadings of 90 or so rail cars, which have come from the western part of the country.\u201cThey\u2019re starting to hunt and peck a little bit for space,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said of his employees in the concrete elevator. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get to the point where you can\u2019t unload any more cars and you\u2019ve got loaded cars sitting on track.\u201dRailroads impose a $100-a-day charge for every loaded but idle car stuck on their tracks. Last year, when shipping didn\u2019t start in Thunder Bay until April 26, Mr. Kennedy estimates that about 2,000 rail cars destined for the eight grain elevators along the city\u2019s shoreline were backed up in rail yards.The delays are just as painful for the companies that depend on the various commodities.Robert Lewis-Manning, the president of the Canadian Shipowners Association, said that last year, two large steel makers \u201cwere getting awfully close to having to lay off people\u201d because their stockpiles of iron ore, coal and coke almost ran out in the spring. He declined to identify the companies.As his fleet of 22 ships gears up to resume service, Allister Paterson, the president of Canada Steamship Lines, said he expected that the most anxious customers would be suppliers and users of road salt along the lakes and the east coast of North America. With their stocks all but wiped out, such players will need to immediately start the long process of rebuilding.\u201cThey were still recovering from last year, trying to get inventories up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we have another brutal winter, so I suspect they will be in a restocking mode for quite a while.\u201dIan Austen reported from Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Mary M. Chapman from Detroit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Warren Buffett Is Worth $72 Billion and You\u2019re Not", "Date": "2015-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From the OracleConsider these two truthful sentences:Academics who study corporate finance overwhelmingly believe that conglomerates \u2014 giant companies that operate in a wide range of industries, often built through acquisitions \u2014 are an awfully inefficient way to organize businesses.And one of the most successful American companies of the last 50 years is a conglomerate called Berkshire Hathaway, run by the renowned investor Warren Buffett, which is the fourth-most valuable firm in the United States, behind Apple, Google and Exxon Mobil. It employs 340,000 people, roughly the population of Honolulu.It helps to understand why finance economists don\u2019t much like the idea of conglomerates in the first place. Back in the 1960s, a popular strategy was to buy up random industrial companies and use accounting tricks to create the illusion of growth even when the underlying performance of the acquired companies was no better, and often worse, than it had been when they were run separately.Finance theory would say that there is no real reason for all those unrelated businesses to be underneath the same corporate umbrella. The company is an extreme example of decentralization, with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s corporate headquarters in Omaha employing only 25 people to oversee this vast empire. All meaningful operational responsibility remains with executives who run all those portfolio companies.\u201cAt Berkshire, we can \u2014 without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs \u2014 move huge sums from businesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise. Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to pressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That\u2019s important: If horses had controlled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\u201dIn effect, Mr. Buffett is arguing that he and the vice chairman, Charlie Munger, and their 25-person team in Omaha are better at deciding the appropriate allocation of capital among different potential investments than the entire infrastructure of the modern financial system \u2014 banks, stock and bond markets, buyout funds and so on \u2014 that are supposed to do just that.The key advantages that Berkshire may have, in other words, are that the company decides how to allocate capital with neither the self-interested decision-making of many operating executives (most people don\u2019t want to dismantle the company they lead, after all, even if its business prospects have collapsed), nor the high fees and short-term perspective of private equity and other buyout artists.If you believe Mr. Buffett, Berkshire is able to achieve the analytical rigor of the latter mixed with the long-term perspective of the former.But there\u2019s a bit more to his success than just being really good at capital allocation. There are surely thousands of people who can match Mr. Buffett\u2019s talent for evaluating the prospects of a business and deciding which should get more investment and which less. But most of them won\u2019t end up with a $72 billion net worth and 340,000 employees.Mr. Buffett acknowledges a second reason for his company\u2019s success: \u201cWe are now the home of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.\u201d In other words, if you are a family looking to cash out of a business but want to leave the company intact and keep longtime employees in place to run it, selling to Berkshire Hathaway looks mighty attractive. But there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re going to have to accept less money than a private equity firm or a strategic acquirer would offer.However, if you want to chalk up Berkshire\u2019s success to its ability to persuade sellers of businesses to accept less than a market value for some of the Buffett Mystique, the new leadership, whenever it takes charge, will face a steep challenge in building the same sort of reputation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eaton Vance Charts Exchange-Traded Future", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThomas E. Faust Jr. does not come across as an industry disrupter. He is the chief executive of Eaton Vance, a midsize fund company in Boston that has carved out a solid yet unspectacular niche as a provider of investment funds and advice.But since last November, when his company won regulatory approval for a new fund vehicle that seeks to marry the best features of active and passive investing, Mr. Faust has been arguing that the mutual fund industry \u2014 or stock-picking funds at least \u2014 must either embrace his model or die.\u201cWe are changing the social contract with mutual fund investors,\u201d said Mr. Faust, who was in New York this week to make his case to asset managers and investment advisers that his way is the future of the business. \u201cThis really can be transformational.\u201dMr. Faust is focusing on the $10 trillion that investors entrust to mutual funds run by portfolio managers who think they can outsmart the market by picking their own mix of stocks and bonds. Of late, though, the market has been outsmarting them. Last year was the worst one for active managers in quite some time.According to Morningstar, 74 percent of equity mutual funds lagged behind their benchmark index. Bond investors fared a bit better, but even so, 65 percent missed their target index. Upset with poor performance and management fees of 1.5 percent and above, investors have been switching to low-cost index trackers, with so-called exchange-traded funds leading the way.These funds trade like stocks and provide exposure to a basket of stocks or bonds that can track a broad index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index or a riskier asset slice like leveraged loans or Indian stocks.Investors, from retirees to sophisticated hedge funds, are drawn to the low fees, limited tax consequences and freedom to trade at will. Then there is the transparency: The portfolio of assets is available for all to see all the time.Over the last 20 years, exchange-traded assets have rocketed from negligible levels to $2 trillion.Eaton Vance\u2019s innovation is to take this structure and introduce it to active fund management.So instead of an exchange-traded fund tracking an index, Eaton Vance could, for example, offer one directed by a portfolio manager who specializes in United States growth stocks.Unlike a traditional exchange-traded fund though \u2014 and this is the company\u2019s special twist \u2014 the new vehicle would not have to disclose its daily basket of stocks, a crucial concern for managers who worry about speculators getting in front of their trades.\u201cI really believe it\u2019s a more efficient structure,\u201d said Mr. Faust, a former equity research analyst who became chief executive of the firm in 2007. \u201cNow, all we need is for the asset managers and the broker dealers to embrace it.\u201dBecause it took four years for Eaton Vance, which oversees $295 billion in assets, to receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Faust is not expecting another firm to come up with a better model. In fact, the S.E.C. rejected a competing idea backed by the fund giant BlackRock and others last year.Eaton Vance is aiming to introduce 18 of what it calls NextShare funds later this year, but in Mr. Faust\u2019s view, the real money to be made is by licensing the company\u2019s technology to other fund companies.\u201cWhat is 5 basis points of $10 trillion?\u201d he mused, referring to the 0.05 percent charge of overall assets that funds using the structure would pay to Eaton Vance. That, he said, would be more or less equal to the company\u2019s stock market value, which is about $5 billion.To Mr. Faust\u2019s point, after the fund\u2019s approval was disclosed, shares of Eaton Vance soared 20 percent in a day as investors bet that the innovation would transform the company.Still, the asset-management industry can be slow to change, and there is no guarantee that it will rush to adopt an untried model being trumpeted by a competitor. Moreover, analysts say, exchanges like Nasdaq as well as broker dealers will have to make significant investments to accommodate the new funds.\u201cThere are a lot of operational hurdles for them to clear,\u201d said Dave Nadig, a specialist at ETF.com, an industry research firm based in San Francisco. \u201cThat is a lot of work to do for just one product from one company.\u201dTrue enough, Mr. Faust concedes.But, he insists, the clock is ticking for the old-style mutual fund as performance suffers and assets flee to index-tracking exchange-traded funds.\u201cIf the industry does not do this,\u201d he said, \u201ca lot of people will be out of jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Thirteen people died.One of the oldest Bloody Sundays involved protests over Irish internment, too, as well as unemployment. On Nov. 13, 1887, 75 people were injured in clashes with police officers in London.A very violent Sunday, in 1905, is said to have led to a revolution in Russia that year. Estimates of the dead in St. Petersburg ranged from 100 (the czar\u2019s official count) to 4,000 (an antigovernment figure).On that Sunday in Selma, 17 protesters were hospitalized.

{"Headline": " How Many Mutual Funds Routinely Rout the Market? Zero", "Date": "2015-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe bull market in stocks turned six last Monday, and despite some rocky stretches \u2014 like last week, when the market fell \u2014 it has generally been a very pleasant time for money managers, who have often posted good numbers. Look more closely at those gaudy returns, however, and you may see something startling. The truth is that very few professional investors have actually managed to outperform the rising market consistently over those years.In fact, based on the updated findings and definitions of a particular study, it appears that no mutual fund managers have. It included 2,862 broad, actively managed domestic stock mutual funds that were in operation for the 12 months through 2010. The S.&P. Dow Jones team winnowed the funds based on performance. It selected the 25 percent of funds with the best returns over those 12 months \u2014 and then asked how many of those funds actually remained in the top quarter in each of the four succeeding 12-month periods through March 2014.The answer was remarkably low: two. Just two funds \u2014 the Hodges Small Cap fund and the AMG SouthernSun Small Cap fund \u2014 managed to hold on to their berths in the top quarter every year for five years running. And for the 2,862 funds as a whole, that record is even a little worse than you would have expected from random chance alone. The study seemed to support the considerable body of evidence suggesting that most people shouldn\u2019t even try to beat the market: Just pick low-cost index funds, assemble a balanced and appropriate portfolio for your specific needs, and give up on active fund management. The data in the study didn\u2019t prove that the mutual fund managers lacked talent or that you couldn\u2019t beat the market. But, as Keith Loggie, the senior director of global research and design at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview last week, the evidence certainly didn\u2019t bolster the case for investing with active fund managers. \u201cLooking at the numbers, you can\u2019t tell whether there is skill involved in what they do or whether their performance is just a matter of luck,\u201d Mr. Loggie said. \u201cI believe that many of them do have skill. But even if they do have it, based on how they\u2019ve done in the past you really can\u2019t predict how they will perform in the future.\u201d Still, those two funds did manage to perform splendidly in that study. Their stubborn persistence at the top of the heap over that five-year period suggested that there was some hope for active fund managers. If they could do it, after all, others could, too.But we\u2019re now about two weeks away from the completion of another 12 months since the end of that study, and it\u2019s been a mediocre stretch, at best, for those two mutual funds. When the month is over, to borrow from Agatha Christie, it looks as though we\u2019ll be saying: And then there were none. Here are the dismal statistics: The SouthernSun Small Cap fund has actually lost money for investors over the 12 months through Thursday. It was down 3.2 percent, according to Morningstar, and for the nine months through December, it was in the bottom quartile of funds in the S.&P. Dow Jones study. The Hodges Small Cap fund has done better, gaining almost 6 percent through Thursday. S.&.P. Dow Jones Indices says that put it in the third quartile \u2014 or second-to-worst one \u2014 through December. While it\u2019s mathematically possible, it is highly unlikely that either will climb to the top quartile in the next few weeks, Mr. Loggie said. Late last year, Mr. Hodges said, his fund was hurt by falling energy prices, which pulled down the returns of several of its holdings. \u201cThat kind of thing will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can expect that.\u201d Last summer, he told me that over the long run \u2014 which he said is probably 50 years or more \u2014 he expects that his fund will do better than average. And he reiterated that view last week. \u201cWe\u2019ll come out all right in the end,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you pick a good manager, someone you believe in and you think you can trust, you\u2019ve got to stick with him for a long time, and if he\u2019s good, he\u2019ll perform for you.\u201d Mr. Loggie and his crew are continuing their regular monitoring of mutual fund performance. Right on schedule, they did another winnowing of mutual funds through the five years that ended in September \u2014 and they will do another one for the five years ending this month. The September performance derby produced more funds that ended up consistently in the top quartile \u2014 nine of them, Mr. Loggie said. \u201cThat\u2019s not surprising,\u201d he said. \u201cSome periods you have more funds, some periods you have less.\u201d But what you never have, he said, is any indication that past performance predicts future returns. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that any one of these funds will beat the market over the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them will do that. But the problem is that we don\u2019t know which of them will do that in advance.\u201d And that, in a nutshell, is the kernel of the argument for buying index funds. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "BlackRock\u2019s New Breed of Exchange-Traded Bond Fund Prizes Stability Over Swagger", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 You will not see Scott Radell on CNBC. Nor does he inhabit a jaw-dropping mansion.While he may not live the life of a swaggering bond market pro, Mr. Radell, a bond manager at the fund giant BlackRock, is challenging a strategy that has rewarded some of his flashier peers: the pursuit of high-risk, high-return investments.The weapon that Mr. Radell will be using is a new variety of exchange-traded fund, or E.T.F., which tracks an index of stocks or bonds but trades like a common stock, allowing investors to jump in and out.For years now, these funds have been a hit with passive investors. Now, BlackRock is introducing a new breed of bond E.T.F. that aims to blend the best of active investing (security selection) with index investing (cost and consistency).\u201cWe don\u2019t have any \u2018key man\u2019 risk \u2014 no one is trying to shoot the lights out here,\u201d Mr. Radell said, referring to the muscular investment style that has turned the likes of William H. Gross, the Pimco co-founder who is now at the Janus Capital Group, and the equally outspoken Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital, into bond market celebrities. \u201cWe are just trying to build a nice portfolio over time.\u201dThe history of Wall Street is littered with fads and inventions that have aimed to strike a balance between making money for the product innovator and for the investor. Of late, though, few if any of these confections have been as successful as E.T.F.s, which hardly existed 15 years ago and now, at $2 trillion, make up close to 15 percent of the mutual fund industry.Be it a cautious retiree buying Treasury securities or a hedge fund looking to scoop up hard-to-trade high-yield bonds, investors have flocked to E.T.F.s. As a consequence, the iShares division has become a crucial profit driver for BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund company, accounting for close to a quarter of its $4.6 trillion assets under management.The rush into E.T.F.s has come at a time when the performance records of mutual fund portfolio managers, especially on the equity side, have been poor. According to Morningstar, 74 percent of equity mutual funds trailed their benchmark index last year.Recently, the fastest-growing area of the E.T.F. market has been so-called smart beta funds, which track specialized and predominantly equity indexes that are not composed of the highest-valued securities, like the S.&P. 500. For example, a fund that follows an index made up of United States stocks with a history of paying dividends might be attractive to a yield-hungry investor.Because these funds target a specific area of demand in the market but follow an index, they are seen by their champions as joining the best aspects of active and passive fund management.Yet because the cult of the bond manager still holds sway, there have been few if any quasi-active bond funds that have thrived.\u201cThere is a void in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cBut sometimes there are voids for a reason.\u201d BlackRock faces pressure to keep up with a fast-innovating marketplace not just because it is the industry leader. With its $787 billion in E.T.F.s in the United States, it is far ahead of Vanguard, with $462 billion. It is also because iShares, BlackRock\u2019s San Francisco-based E.T.F. unit, was formerly Barclays Global Investors, which first popularized these types of funds in the late 1990s. BlackRock bought the company for $13 billion from a retrenching Barclays in 2009. About a third of BlackRock\u2019s revenue now comes from iShares, and analysts expect that the firm will someday earn a majority of its fees from E.T.F.s.For a company that has evolved as a bond manager focused on institutions under its current chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, this tilt toward a market segment that is very much driven by retail investors represents a significant shift in strategy.That is why the early predictions of a successor to Mr. Fink, who has no plans to step down anytime soon, favor Mr. Wiedman, an ambitious 44-year-old executive and onetime top official at the United States Treasury, who has overseen the business since 2011.With such growth has come criticism. In particular, there have been two academic studies \u2014 and a lawsuit (which was later dismissed) \u2014 that claim E.T.F. providers like BlackRock have taken advantage of investors by retaining too large a share of some of the side benefits of the business.For example, BlackRock made $477 million in revenue last year by lending the stocks and bonds in its various funds to banks, which passed them on to hedge funds that needed to borrow the securities to bet against them through short sales. Most of the fees were returned to the E.T.F.s, and BlackRock said that the money it kept allowed for low fees.Still, some experts have questions.Last month, the Institute of International Finance, a trade group for global banks, warned of the extraordinary flows into corporate bond E.T.F.s, pointing out that many of the investors were sophisticated institutions reaching for yield. Given how illiquid the market has become for these types of bonds, any sustained selling frenzy could have wider consequences, the institute cautioned. All told, Mr. Radell oversees 81 bond E.T.F.s for BlackRock, representing $153 billion in assets. When he sits down in front of his bank of trading screens at 5:15 a.m., just before the market gets going in New York, one of the first things he checks is liquidity.He looks at how the E.T.F.s are trading, and if there are more buyers (or sellers) of a certain E.T.F., he keeps a close eye on how the underlying market for, say, high-yield or investment-grade bonds is handling the increased activity.These days, however, his eyes are drawn to his new bond fund, which everyone on the company\u2019s sun-bright trading floor refers to by its symbol, INC. The bigger bond E.T.F.s under Mr. Radell\u2019s watch may rake in the fees, but it is INC, he believes, that represents the future.His voice catches as he explains why.\u201cThis is what makes me so excited,\u201d he said, pointing to a screen that showed INC doing almost as well as the E.T.F.s of BlackRock\u2019s main competitors, Pimco and DoubleLine, and ahead of most diversified bond funds. The returns are similar, he said, but because INC follows a clear set of rules, there is less risk that a manager will make a bad call that sends the fund reeling.Investors have been slow to share in Mr. Radell\u2019s enthusiasm so far, and the E.T.F., which started trading late last month at $75 million, has barely budged. \u201cIt\u2019s been slow,\u201d Mr. Radell acknowledged. \u201cBut I really think we have created something that will last for ages.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Schwab\u2019s Service for Investors Seeking Thrifty Advice Raises Eyebrows", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut whether it is truly free, or is just intended to seem that way, is up for debate.Schwab, with $2.46 trillion in assets, has the potential to trounce the competition given its established brand name and size. Vanguard\u2019s version, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, which has been in pilot mode since 2013, is managing $10 billion, in part because it moved some existing customers to the program.Naureen Hassan, an executive vice president of Schwab, explained that the firm was trying to minimize paperwork and fees that deter many investors, while structuring portfolios that minimize risk. \u201cWe wanted to create a product that would appeal to the masses and get more people into well-diversified portfolios,\u201d she said. Although the program does not officially become available to customers until later this month, its federal regulatory filing and website contain many of its details.Many robo-advisers charge 0.15 to 0.50 percent of assets under management, plus the cost of underlying investments. Live advisers, who offer a wider range of guidance, generally charge 1 percent or more, while others working on commissions may offer far more expensive investments. Schwab says it will not charge a separate fee for investment advice. But customers will pay the fees on the underlying investments, which at Schwab range from 0.04 percent of the money invested to 0.48 percent. These companies offer help picking and rebalancing index and exchange-traded funds or similar investments, and none charge more than about 0.5 percent of your assets each year for the privilege.Even though Schwab will not charge investors directly, that does not mean it will not be paid. It will make money from some of its exchange-traded funds \u2014 both from the funds it manages and from exchange-traded fund providers who pay Schwab to gain access to its program. The company said that compensation did not factor into the exchange-traded funds it selects, which must meet a long list of criteria. Schwab will also earn money by selling its trade orders to other firms that will execute them.That is not much different from the way many other large financial services firms generate revenue, but it stands in stark comparison to the robo-advisers who simply charge one transparent fee for their advice.Perhaps the biggest source of criticism is the company\u2019s decision to allocate significant parts of the portfolios \u2014 at least 6 percent and as much as 30 percent of an individual\u2019s money \u2014 to cash, held in an Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured account. The cash allotment will often be larger than many financial advisers recommend. Many financial planners recommend keeping roughly six months\u2019 worth of expenses in cash, but say a portfolio should be fully invested in a mix of stocks and bonds.Beyond the cash recommendations, several financial planners took issue with the way certain portfolios were constructed.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem a stretch to guess that Schwab\u2019s been driven to the riskier bonds by their insistence on using the large cash position as a way of getting paid, while looking cheaper than their robo-competitors. In other words, just like many other fund managers, they need to try to \u2018juice the returns\u2019 by dipping into riskier assets in order to solve the fee equation.\u201dSchwab said it had nothing to hide, and would post more information about the portfolios when the service starts this month. \u201cWe are all about transparency,\u201d Ms. Hassan said.Advertisement"}

Loeb, now sits on the auction house\u2019s board \u2014 and Darden Restaurants are among the other companies recently set upon by multiple agitators. Sometimes, as with Bank of New York Mellon, they broadly agree on the target\u2019s shortcomings, if not how to fix them.Aggressive investors force companies to examine their capital allocations, governance and management and to make changes, including buying and selling businesses, that can increase market valuations. As long as the benefits reach all shareholders, the cage-rattlers help bridge the gap between companies and dispersed owners. In that sense, the more the merrier.Too much clamor at once, however, can distract from sensible initiatives already underway. Marcato\u2019s 118-page critique of Bank of New York Mellon shows that the fund run by Mick McGuire, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the activist investor William A. Ackman, conducted detailed analysis. That doesn\u2019t mean it adds much to what the bank\u2019s board already knows.Efforts by Edward P. Garden, Trian\u2019s representative on Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s board, other directors and the current chief executive to identify practical solutions for the basic problem \u2014 expenses growing faster than revenue \u2014 are probably supported privately by big investment institutions, at least for now. That may matter more than Marcato\u2019s very public contribution.It\u2019s all a warning sign for investors in activist funds. They\u2019ve done well of late, collecting 21 percent in 2012 and 16 percent in 2013 on average, according to Hedge Fund Research. Even last year\u2019s anemic 6 percent return beat the hedge fund industry average. Yet despite huge gains in 2014 for Ackman\u2019s Pershing Square Capital Management, among others, Hedge Fund Research\u2019s figures for average activist performance have been declining in absolute and relative terms since the 2012 peak.More than 200 practitioners made demands of almost 350 companies last year, according to Activist Insight, in each case approaching three times the number in 2010. More and more cash chasing a dwindling number of good investment ideas may, before long, turn fund investors into the agitators.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Diversification Is the Sane Alternative to Betting Big on One Investment", "Date": "2015-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch GuyWhat were you thinking? Clearly you missed a big opportunity in 2014. You should have skipped diversifying and gone all in on United States stocks.This is the problem with the diversification strategy you stubbornly insist upon. Every year you\u2019re going to be unhappy with something in your portfolio. Most years, if you own five distinct asset classes, one or two might do well, one will sit in the middle, and two will perform badly. And you can\u2019t tolerate that, no way. After all, why would anyone settle for anything less than top performance?Luckily, the solution is an easy one. On Jan. 1 of each year, just figure out which asset class will do really well and move all your money into that investment. Forget diversification. Just pick the winner!Lest you think all of the sarcasm up until this point does not reflect the worldview of many investors, I had a client in my past life whom we will call Dave. He had a lot of money. I remember having a conversation in which he was really mad over this very issue. He said to me, \u201cThis is simple. All I want you do is tell me what to buy before it goes up and what to sell just before it goes down. That\u2019s it.\u201d I remember replying, \u201cReally? Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201dBut seriously, with no proven model for picking the next winner, can you really afford to bet big on any one investment? If you had to, could you even pick one, and only one, investment for the rest of this year? The answer can\u2019t be no! Don\u2019t you know by now who the winner will be in 2015? How can you not know?So in all seriousness, perhaps the better choice really is to stay diversified. Yes, a diversified portfolio all but guarantees you\u2019ll be unhappy with at least one investment each year. But the investments that make you unhappy change from one year to the next. One set of investments zigs while another set zags. Take this unhappiness as a sign you\u2019re doing diversification right. That\u2019s the way markets work, after all.Plus, on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being abject misery, I\u2019m willing to bet your unhappiness with a diversified portfolio comes in at about a 5, maybe a 6. But your unhappiness if you guess wrong on your one and only investment for the year? That goes to 11.Beyond diversifying, there\u2019s rebalancing, which is something else that will probably make you unhappy. You\u2019re selling at least some of an investment that\u2019s done well and buying more of one that hasn\u2019t. This unnerves people. They don\u2019t see it as buying something on sale but as trading a winner for a loser.In years like 2014 with an obvious winner, diversification becomes everyone\u2019s favorite whipping boy. One type of investment does so much better than the others, it seems insane to diversify, let alone rebalance.But that\u2019s the problem with judging a tool like diversification from one year to the next. You need to judge diversification\u2019s value over the long term, and by long, I\u2019m referring to decades. You\u2019re not diversifying because of how stocks or bonds did last year. You keep diversifying because you don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll do over the next 10 years.Sure, your brother or sister-in-law or some talking head on television may have tried picking the investment winner of 2014 and gotten it right. In that year. But if you try and get it wrong, make sure you have a calculator handy. You\u2019ll need it to figure out how much longer you\u2019ll have to keep working to make up for the loss.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Your N.C.A.A. Brackets Teach About Investing and Bias", "Date": "2015-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChoosing WiselyIt also, along the way, teaches some important lessons about overcoming biases to make smart decisions in investing, and in life.The good news is that all of these sources of tournament projections present broadly similar forecasts. There are no major disagreements between them on which teams are most likely to win it all (Kentucky. Definitely Kentucky.) and which have little chance of winning even a single game (sorry, Coastal Carolina).Consider some of the teams that Times readers overweight relative to the teams\u2019 purely quantitative measures (the numbers are from Tuesday evening, and may have shifted by the time you read this). They tend to be one or more of the following: 1) based in the Northeast, where there is the heaviest concentration of Times readers; 2) academically elite or 3) teams that have had either recent high-profile success in the N.C.A.A. tournament or a long track record of excellence.Here are a few of them:Butler (recent N.C.A.A. success)Percentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 58 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 48.3 percentMichigan State (long record of N.C.A.A. success)Percentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 76 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 64.3 percentDavidson (academically elite, recent N.C.A.A. success)Percentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 49 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 43 percentSt. John\u2019s (in Northeast)Percentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 50 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 44.3 percentHarvard (academically elite)Percentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 19 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 16 percentU.C.L.A. (history of N.C.A.A. success)Percentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game 44 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 38 percentMeanwhile, the teams whose likelihood of success appears to be undervalued by Times readers relative to quantitative projections are the opposite of that: colleges from outside the Northeast without a track record of success in the tournament that are also not very academically selective. The list weights heavily toward non-flagship state universities.Here are three examples:Wichita StatePercentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 56 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 68.5 percentOklahoma StatePercentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 48 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 56 percentGeorgia StatePercentage of NYT readers picking to win Round of 64 game: 15 percentAverage of FiveThirtyEight, Sagarin and Pomeroy: 21.7 percentIt\u2019s easy to see how the familiarity heuristic is at work here. Rather than forecasting basketball success with methodical analysis using all the statistical information at our disposal, entrants to our bracket are letting their judgments be influenced by the colleges they are familiar with because they or a friend went there, the college is near where they live, or they recall that team having tournament success in the past.The good news is that this opens up a market opportunity for people who think about things more analytically, and thus make predictions that are undervalued by the marketplace.This has a close analogue in investing. It is easy to invest in flashy companies that are widely known and whose products you use. But often the highest-return investments are \u201cvalue stocks,\u201d companies that are more obscure and less popular. In this metaphor, Butler, Harvard and U.C.L.A. are the Google, Facebook and Apple of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Wichita State and Oklahoma State are the obscure industrial companies that aren\u2019t talked about on the financial pages very often but offer high potential returns.There\u2019s a big difference between playing an N.C.A.A. bracket game and investing, of course. The former is for amusement, the latter to build wealth. So if people want to be a little bit irrational with their tournament picks, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. (I am guilty of this myself; my bracket predicts stronger-than-consensus performances by Georgetown, whose games I attend sometimes, and Wofford, a college located in my hometown.)That\u2019s all fun and games. But when saving for retirement, the consequences of letting familiarity, rather than clearheaded analysis, guide your decisions can be quite a bit more costly.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wondering What the Fed\u2019s Statements Mean? Be Patient", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseWhat, exactly, does it mean if the Fed keeps \u201cpatient\u201d in its outlook for monetary policy, or, as investors now seem to think more likely, drops the word?Billions of dollars in profits and losses will be riding on the outcome. The market has been gyrating on every comment by the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who has had to explain at length just what \u201cpatient\u201d means.But 10 years later, the public, news media, financial analysts and investors are still struggling to figure out what the Fed\u2019s words mean. I don\u2019t doubt that Ms. Yellen and her colleagues at the Fed are trying hard to carry out Mr. Bernanke\u2019s mandate for better communication. But they also seem more comfortable with what seems to be a deliberate level of ambiguity.To better understand why that is the case, I reached out to some experts in the field of linguistics rather than economists or market experts. I wondered: Is language itself up to the task?Take the market\u2019s current epistemological fixation. \u201cPatient\u201d would seem a virtue, especially as opposed to its opposite (\u201chasty\u201d or \u201cimpetuous\u201d), and a quality that one would hope would be second nature to central bankers.Last Dec. 17, the Fed injected the word \u201cpatient\u201d into its statement on monetary policy, saying it would be \u201cpatient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.\u201d Even this shows a drift back into Fedspeak: \u201cNormalize the stance of monetary policy\u201d seems a needlessly convoluted way of saying \u201craise interest rates.\u201d That aside, what was new?That seems a lot of baggage for one adjective. But by now it seems clear that \u201cpatient\u201d has become a term of art, a word with a meaning specific to the Fed. That\u2019s because the meaning of \u201cpatient,\u201d like many adjectives, depends on context. Lawrence Solan, who has both a law degree and a doctorate in linguistics and teaches at Brooklyn Law School, cited three distinct situations: standing in line at a Staples store to have a copy made, waiting to see a doctor and waiting to get a mortgage approved. \u201cPatient\u201d in the first example might mean five minutes. For the doctor, perhaps a half-hour to an hour. For the mortgage, several weeks.\u201cWhen have you waited long enough to have been \u2018patient\u2019 so you can politely complain again in the doctor\u2019s office, the copy shop or to your mortgage bank? There is no real answer,\u201d he said.As another example, he cited the adjective \u201ctall.\u201d A \u201ctall\u201d first grader is likely to be far shorter than a \u201ctall\u201d professional basketball player.\u201cWe automatically contextualize \u2018patient\u2019 to fit the context of the Fed\u2019s decision, just the way we do for other quite specific situations,\u201d Professor Solan said. \u201cThere really can be a meaning of \u2018patience\u2019 that applies only to the Fed, the same way there can be a meaning of \u2018tall\u2019 that applies only to first-grade children. Of course, it really isn\u2019t the meaning that has changed. Rather it is the context that has changed for a word whose application is highly context-sensitive.\u201dSteven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard and author of \u201cThe Language Instinct,\u201d agreed that context was essential to understanding the Fed\u2019s meaning. \u201cIt\u2019s more akin to the language of diplomacy, politeness, tact, innuendo, euphemism, veiled threats and bribes and oblique sexual come-ons,\u201d he said. \u201cCases in which the content of a speech act is highly fraught.\u201d\u201cWhen the chair of the Fed speaks, she knows that she is not just conveying information about the Fed\u2019s plans, but sending a signal that changes the way that millions of people will behave, and how each will expect all the others to behave,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors not only interpret the remarks but try to guess how other investors will interpret the remarks. In that regard, her words are like an oath or a pronouncement of a jury verdict or marriage ceremony, or a prayer or a magical incantation \u2014 the mere act of uttering them changes the world. So the words take on formulaic meanings, and she is aware of that fact when choosing them.\u201d\u201cClever language users can make use of ambiguity and what linguists call \u2018modals\u2019\u00a0\u201d \u2014 words like \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cmay\u201d and \u201ccould\u201d \u2014 \u201cto indicate possibilities, while staying vague about actual plans or detailed strategies,\u201d said David Pesetsky, professor of modern language and linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cMy feeling is that such language doesn\u2019t necessarily violate a commitment to transparency, while at the same time it is less informative than it might be.\u201dProfessor Solan made a similar point. \u201cWhen Yellen speaks of patience having its limits, she is saying that while the Fed will not raise interest rates as soon as doing so is justifiable, neither will it wait until raising rates is an immediate necessity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis tells us very little, of course. But it tells us much more than nothing, which is why there is so much chatter about it. If Yellen had said, \u2018We can\u2019t be patient any longer\u2019 or \u2018We will remain patient for at least another year,\u2019 the reaction would have been quite different.\u201dAll should become clear next week, when the Fed holds its March meeting and Ms. Yellen is scheduled to give a news conference. Or will it?So much for clear and succinct.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spray Deodorants Are Rehabilitated, With Help From Europeans", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkin DeepThe underarm area is about the size of a Post-it note, but our individual notions about what keeps it dry and decent smelling are as impassioned as if it were a more substantial patch of skin.Most of us swear by solid sticks. In 2013, Americans spent $2.4 billion on them. Others reach for roll-ons, clear gels or creams. Natural types evangelize \u201cthe rock,\u201d rubbing an alum stone directly on their armpits.One format Americans rarely rhapsodize about is sprays. They make up only 2 to 5 percent of the market here, according to estimates by various industry sources.Aerosol underarm protection fell out of favor in the United States in the 1970s and \u201980s when it became clear that the chlorofluorocarbons in the propellants were bad for the environment, and despite occasional appearances in seventh-grade gym lockers or on your French friend\u2019s bathroom shelf, they mostly disappeared.But now, like other totems of that time \u2014 bangs and baby-doll dresses, say \u2014 they are starting to reappear, a resurgence spurred by their popularity in the rest of the world. In Europe and Latin America, sprays make up more than 60 percent of the market.In December, Unilever introduced antiperspirant sprays for five of its brands: Dove Women, Dove Men + Care, Degree Men, Degree Women and Axe. They are nearly identical to those the company sells internationally but reformulated to comply with federal regulations.\u201cLots of people will still like their stick,\u201d said Matthew McCarthy, senior marketing director for antiperspirants and deodorants for Unilever. \u201cBut a couple of years ago, we said, \u2018What does the future look like?\u2019 We didn\u2019t need to look further than the format that\u2019s our No. 1 elsewhere in the world. It hasn\u2019t been rocket science.\u201d(Antiperspirants, by the way, stop sweating, while deodorants keep funky smells at bay, usually with essential oils that zap bacteria, but don\u2019t stop sweating itself.)Smaller companies, like Weleda from Switzerland and Aesop from Australia, are also promoting their nonaerosol deodorant sprays here. Kate Hudson and Carolyn Murphy use Weleda Wild Rose natural deodorant spray, and Aesop is advertising its lemon-grass-and-clove spray deodorant in stores with a black-and-white photo of woman deeply inhaling a man\u2019s underarm.\u201cThe benefit of having the product in a spray in a water and alcohol mixture is that it all evaporates quickly, and you\u2019re left with essential oils,\u201d said Kate Forbes, head of products and research and development for Aesop.The main draw of sprays, aficionados agree, is that they dry as soon as you spray them on, so there is no flapping your arms up and down before putting on your shirt. And they don\u2019t leave excess goop or white crumbles under your arms.Will swapping your morning swipe for a spray make you smell better or sweat less?David Pariser, a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology, said that with antiperspirants, which use aluminum-based compounds to plug the sweat glands, the format doesn\u2019t have anything to do with how dry it will keep you. \u201cThe effectiveness is based on the active ingredients, not whether it\u2019s delivered in a solid and spray,\u201d he said. He points out, though, that all prescription-strength antiperspirants are liquids.Another advantage of a spray is that it can be used on areas like hands, where people tend to sweat a lot. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to want to put a solid on your hands,\u201d Dr. Pariser said. \u201cIt\u2019s all goopy. That\u2019s a technical term.\u201dFor some people, though, sprays, whether antiperspirants or deodorants, can be irritating, depending on the ingredients. \u201cIf it has alcohol in it, or some ingredient that would cause it to dry quickly, they may end up causing more irritation than sticks or roll-ons,\u201d Dr. Pariser said.But the well traveled and foreign born are fans. The model Karlie Kloss told Elle she stocks up on Dove aerosol spray overseas. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than putting on a couture gown and leaving a deodorant mark,\u201d she said.One London-bred man, who now lives in New York, said he brings as many cans of Nivea Men spray as he can carry back to the United States each time he visits home.\u201cI really liked the application of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was similar to a perfume. It heightened the experience of putting something in your armpit and made it more glamorous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Warren Buffett Does It", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuffett describes his approach in those days as \u201ccigar butt\u201d investing; buying shares of troubled companies with underpriced stocks was \u201clike picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff remaining in it,\u201d he writes. \u201cThough the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free.\u201d He continues: \u201cMost of my gains in those early years ... came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices.\u201d But that approach had limits. It took Charlie Munger, the Los Angeles lawyer who has been his longtime sidekick, to show him that there was another way to win at the investing game: \u201cForget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices,\u201d Munger told him. \u201cInstead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.\u201d Which is what Buffett\u2019s been doing ever since.He has done it in two ways. First \u2014 and this is what he is renowned for \u2014 he has bought stock in some of the great American companies of our time, stock that he has held not just for years, but for decades. Second, he has turned Berkshire Hathaway into a true conglomerate, which owns not just stocks but entire companies. Although Berkshire\u2019s front office employs only 25 people, its companies have, in total, some 340,500 employees. How successful has the Buffett-Munger approach been? In the 50 years since Buffett took over Berkshire, its stock has appreciated by 1,826,163 percent. That is an astounding number.You would think, given Buffett\u2019s success, that more people would try to emulate his approach to investing. It is not as if he hasn\u2019t tried to explain how he does it. Every year, you can find a Buffett tutorial in his annual letter that the rest of us would do well to absorb \u2014 and practice.In the current letter, for instance, he makes the case \u2014 which has been made many times before \u2014 that a diversified portfolio of stocks \u201cthat are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions\u201d are less risky over the long term than other investment vehicles that are tied to the dollar. Clearly, that\u2019s been his approach. He then goes on to bemoan the fact that too many investors \u2014 both little guys and investment professionals \u2014 do things that add risk: \u201cActive trading, attempts to \u2018time\u2019 market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary fees ... and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner of equities would otherwise enjoy.\u201d LTV, as conceived by Ling, of course, ceased to exist decades ago (though the company would go through several transformations and bankruptcy court before shuttering its last vestige in 2002). \u201cNever forget that 2 + 2 will always equal 4,\u201d writes Buffett. \u201cAnd when someone tells you how old-fashioned that math is \u2014 zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks at cheap prices.\u201dIf it\u2019s really this simple, why don\u2019t more people try to invest like Buffett? One reason, I think, is that sound investing \u2014 buying when others are selling, holding for the long term, avoiding the hot stocks \u2014 requires a stronger stomach than most people have. When a stock is plummeting, it takes a certain strength to buy even more instead of selling in a panic. Most of us lack the temperament required for smart investing. The fundamental equanimity required to be a great investor is a rare thing.In a few months, the faithful will flock to Omaha to attend Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting \u2014 \u201cWoodstock for capitalists,\u201d Buffett likes to call it. For six hours, Buffett and Munger will be on stage, before some 40,000 people, cracking wise, while making their investment decisions sound like simplicity itself.But, in coming to pay their annual homage, the throngs will not be acknowledging the simplicity of Buffett\u2019s approach, but the genius behind it.

{"Headline": "Pension Funds Trail Individuals in Embracing Index Funds", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore individuals are pouring money into so-called passive investing or index funds, which aim to match the performance of the main stock and bond markets, but larger institutions like pension funds and endowments have been slower to follow suit, despite the potential for higher returns and lower fees.Jeff Hooke, an investment banker at Focus Securities in Washington, who favors the greater use of index funds by public funds to save taxpayer dollars, says he thinks many public fund officials favor active management despite its higher costs because they don\u2019t want to \u201cindex themselves out of a job.\u201d He said some of the officials might have ties to Wall Street or might be swayed by some of the perks of active management, like fancy investment conferences in Florida or Bermuda.But the percentage of institutional investments in index-tracking strategies is a good deal smaller \u2014 about 19.2 percent for public pension plans and 11.2 percent for corporate plans, according to Greenwich Associates in Stamford, Conn. While the total for public funds has risen recently, the move has been offset by institutions\u2019 hefty commitments to alternatives. These higher-fee alternatives include private equity, hedge funds, real estate and commodities, some of which offer the hope of higher or less volatile returns than those produced by public markets.One institution that went the index route was the $509 million Montgomery County Employees Retirement Plan in Pennsylvania. In 2013, it shifted most of its investments to index funds. The move saved the plan an estimated $1.3 million in annual management fees while potentially improving performance, said Josh Shapiro, chairman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, was elected in 2011 in a reform tide that swept through the county, an affluent, historically Republican enclave northwest of Philadelphia. He is now pressing two of the state\u2019s largest pension funds to follow his lead \u2014 a cause taken up on Tuesday by Tom Wolf, the governor of Pennsylvania, a Democrat.But some of the 15 outside money managers who were dropped by the fund in the shift warned that the move was a mistake, said Uri Monson, the county\u2019s chief financial officer. One said the fund would be increasing its risk of losses in a market downturn, Mr. Monson added. \u201cAnother one angrily said, \u2018You\u2019ll come crawling back.\u2019\u00a0\u201dHowever, Mr. Shapiro said the fund as a whole underperformed market benchmarks from 2004 through mid-2013, despite fees for active management that amounted to $1.9 million a year as of early 2013. Over the last 18 months, he said, returns on the county\u2019s new stock and bond index funds at the Vanguard Group improved on the fund\u2019s earlier performance pattern.Malcolm Cowen, a consultant to the Montgomery County fund from 2006 to 2013 at Cornerstone Advisors Asset Management in Bethlehem, Pa., said the fund\u2019s former managers had been chosen to reflect a conservative, defensive style. The goal was to control volatility and risk because the county wasn\u2019t making required contributions. The result: The county outperformed market benchmarks during the severe market downturn of 2008 but lagged during the rebound in 2010 to 2012.Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Monson said they decided to pursue indexing after research that included meeting in 2012 with Vanguard\u2019s founder, John C. Bogle, at the company\u2019s headquarters in nearby Valley Forge. Mr. Bogle persuaded the two that \u201cno one is smart enough to beat the market over a sustained period of time,\u201d Mr. Shapiro recalled.To show how pension managers can be seduced into choosing certain expensive managers, Mr. Monson forwarded several invitations from among the dozens he has received to conferences in exotic locales like Dubai, Panama City and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.Mr. Shapiro has spoken with Governor Wolf about indexing investments at the two largest state funds, the $53 billion Public School Employees Retirement System and the $27 billion State Employees Retirement System. Mr. Monson estimates that the funds both slightly trailed a passive portfolio from 2006 to 2013 and could have cut their annual fees by $476 million and $140 million respectively through indexing.In a budget address on Tuesday, Mr. Wolf said, \u201cOur state has been wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on Wall Street managers to handle state pension accounts.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201ca safe, conservative account would produce a similar return over the long term while eliminating these excessive management fees.\u201dThis would probably be resisted by the current army of consultants and managers. The school system fund had 57 percent of its assets as of mid-2014 in higher-fee categories than plain stocks and bonds. They included 160 funds in private equity, private debt and venture capital, and 96 real estate partnerships. The school system fund has four consultants. The state system fund has 428 funds in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital and real assets totaling 45 percent of the fund.For the decade that ended in 2013, the school system fund\u2019s annual return of 6.9 percent, and the state fund\u2019s 7.4 percent return appear to have outpaced the median performance of comparable big public funds tracked by the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service. Over the last five years, both funds have trailed the Wilshire median. Wilshire did not provide data on specific funds.In separate statements, the funds said that over 15 or 20 years, the fees they spent on active management more than paid for themselves in extra returns. They both said they already index about one-fifth of their assets. What may work for a \u201csmaller\u201d fund like Montgomery County, or even individual investors, \u201cmay not be prudent for a large multibillion pension fund like P.S.E.R.S.,\u201d that fund\u2019s chief investment officer, James H. Grossman Jr., said.In an interview, Mr. Grossman attributed his fund\u2019s recent underperformance to a reduction in risk that cut its allocation of stocks to 40 percent from 70 percent in 2009 \u2014 around the market bottom \u2014 driven by underfunding and resulting cash deficits.How Governor Wolf\u2019s call will fare isn\u2019t yet clear. It could become part of the legislative budget process or be considered by the funds\u2019 boards. While the governor appoints a majority of the smaller fund\u2019s board, those seats are now occupied by his predecessors\u2019 choices. And he names only three of the school fund\u2019s 15 board members.Mr. Bogle said indexing for the big Pennsylvania funds has a good chance of adoption, partly because their performance has been \u201cnot that good.\u201d Still, he added, there is \u201ca lot of politics involved, a lot of money changing hands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Many Buyers for Subprime Auto Loan Bundle", "Date": "2015-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDelinquencies on auto loans have been rising, more Americans are losing their cars to repossession, and inquiries have begun into the subprime auto industry\u2019s lending practices.Many of the loans bundled into the $712 million deal went to borrowers with significantly lower credit scores than in many of Santander\u2019s past bond deals. Moody\u2019s Investors Service expects losses as high as 27 percent on the bond, much larger than the 17 percent loss that the ratings firm had projected on a bond that Santander sold last year.Risks in the market may be multiplying, and some lenders are pulling back. But Santander\u2019s latest deal shows that Wall Street\u2019s appetite for subprime auto loans remains as strong as ever.\u201cYou do deals when there is demand,\u201d said Christopher R. Donat, an analyst with the investment bank Sandler O\u2019Neill. \u201cAnd this deal indicates that there is demand out there for subprime auto paper.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to see the attraction for investors. Yields on the highest rated slice of the Santander bond were 1.02 percent, compared with the equivalent Treasury bond yield of 0.12 percent, according to Empirasign Strategies, a market data firm. In short, investors could earn about eight times as much yield, while ostensibly taking the same amount of risk.A spokeswoman for Santander Consumer declined to comment on the deal, which sold out in a matter of hours on Thursday. The deal came a day after the auto lender\u2019s parent company, Santander Holdings USA, which is owned by the Spanish financial giant Banco Santander, flunked the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress test for the second consecutive year.Still, Santander Consumer, which is based in Dallas, has been riding a broad resurgence in subprime auto lending.Over all, auto loans to subprime borrowers \u2014 typically people with credit scores at or below 640 \u2014 have more than doubled since the financial crisis.One reasons for the surge: Investors like mutual funds and insurance companies, which have struggled to find high-yielding debt investments while the Fed keeps interest rates near zero, have been buying billions of dollars of bonds like Santander\u2019s most recent deal.Last year, such securitizations increased 28 percent from 2013 and were up 302 percent since 2010, according to Thomson Reuters IFR Markets.Amid the rapid growth in the auto loan market, regulators have raised concerns about whether growing competition among lenders is fueling lax lending standards. Federal and state prosecutors are looking into whether car dealerships have been falsifying borrowers\u2019 loan applications to help them qualify to buy a car.Santander Consumer is among the lenders that have received subpoenas from federal and state authorities requesting information about its securitizations.Santander Holdings USA, the parent company, has struggled with regulatory issues of its own. As part of the banking stress test, the Fed analyzed the auto lender, as well as Santander\u2019s retail banking operations in the United States.It is not clear what role, if any, Santander Consumer\u2019s auto business played in the Fed\u2019s decision to reject the bank\u2019s broader capital plan.The Fed found that Santander Holdings had ample capital to weather severe economic shocks.But the Fed failed it on qualitative concerns, citing \u201ccritical deficiencies\u201d in areas including \u201crisk identification and risk management\u201d in the bank\u2019s capital planning. Santander Consumer USA, which was started as a regional subprime lender before most of the company was acquired by Banco Santander in 2006, has developed a reputation for deftly managing the risks of lending to troubled borrowers.Investors say Santander uses a series of algorithms to predict a borrower\u2019s chance of default \u2014 a system that goes beyond a bank\u2019s traditional method of risk assessment.In its latest bond deal, according to the ratings firm Standard & Poor\u2019s, roughly 13 percent of the loans went to borrowers without FICO credit scores, one of the most common predictors.\u201cThose who are putting their faith in Santander are looking at how these algorithms have performed in the past,\u201d said Mark Palmer, an analyst with BTIG, a broker dealer.Still, the investors that scooped up last week\u2019s bond deal \u2014 large asset management firms \u2014 were afforded some protections.As part of the deal, Santander agreed to take the first 25 percent of any losses that the bond might suffer, according to Moody\u2019s. In a deal last year, Santander agreed to take 10 percent of the losses.For Santander, the latest bond represented a shift.Santander has always made loans to borrowers with very tarnished credit. But the lender has usually financed those loans through private deals or held them on its books, instead of tapping the public market, according to a person briefed on the matter. The latest bond deal was the first time that it has publicly sold securities backed by auto loans with such low credit quality since the financial crisis. The timing of the deal was driven by two factors: investor demand and a desire by Santander to free up more capital. The lender was hearing from investors, the person briefed on the matter said, who were clamoring for more bonds to scoop up, especially those with higher yields.The highest-yielding and lowest-rated slice of the bond was the first to sell out, the person said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Health Account Can Add to a Nest Egg Too", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs savings vehicles go, Health Savings Accounts, or H.S.A.s, are rainy day funds with generous benefits.The funds are tax-advantaged accounts that have been available since 2003 to taxpayers with high-deductible health plans (currently plans with deductibles of at least $1,300 for individuals and $2,600 for families). They were intended to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses, yet H.S.A.s have lesser-known advantages. They can be used to supplement retirement savings, providing tax benefits not only when you contribute but also, in many cases, when you withdraw money. You can also take them with you if you change jobs.The Internal Revenue Service limits the amount of H.S.A. contributions and deductions, as it does with all tax-deferred vehicles. For 2015, taxpayers with individual medical coverage can invest and write off $3,350. For those with family coverage, the limit is $6,650. Each year, those limits are adjusted to reflect consumer inflation. As employers have increasingly passed on more out-of-pocket medical expenses to employees, H.S.A.s have become popular additions to workers\u2019 benefits. As of the end of 2014, there were more than 10 million H.S.A.s, with assets of $22 billion compared with four million accounts with $6 billion in assets in 2008, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Fifty million Americans will have health savings accounts in four years, predicts the Institute for Healthcare Consumerism, an industry group, although only 15 percent of H.S.A. holders make the maximum yearly contribution today.Unlike flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses, with which H.S.A.\u2019s are sometimes confused, health savings accounts do not have to be emptied every year. The money in them can accumulate and grow year to year if not spent. If used for medical bills, H.S.A. withdrawals are tax free; if used for other purposes, a 20 percent penalty is charged, but not if the account holder is 65 or older. That is what makes the accounts useful for retirees. They offer attractive saving and spending options.Not only can you enjoy tax-deferred benefits when you contribute to an H.S.A., you do not have to start withdrawing money in a \u201crequired minimum distribution\u201d at age 70 1/2 as you do with other retirement accounts. You can leave the money in as long as you like.If you don\u2019t need to use H.S.A. money for out-of-pocket medical expenses, you can use it to back up other savings.\u201cFor those who are qualified to use them, H.S.A.s behave in the same way as tax-deferred I.R.A.s,\u201d says Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa.\u201cThey have the extra benefit that if the withdrawals are for qualified medical expenses, then no taxes are due. So in a sense, they are supercharged I.R.A.s and should even take a higher place than an I.R.A. in one\u2019s hierarchy of funding priorities with savings.\u201dLet\u2019s say you start an H.S.A. and deposit $5,000 in it. You are married with family coverage with a high-deductible plan and contribute $100 a month in addition to the $5,000, and the account grows at a modest 4 percent a year.Your savings would total nearly $22,000 after 10 years. That assumes that you did not need to withdraw the money in the interim for medical expenses. The longer you keep the money in, the higher the total can become.Although the accounts have several tax benefits, you will need to be careful how you invest the money in an H.S.A., just as you would with any other retirement account.You will need to beat inflation to keep up with the cost of living, so it probably makes little sense to invest in money market funds or low-yielding bonds, unless you simply want to avoid higher-risk stock funds and protect your principal. Still, there is a risk trade-off between \u201csafe\u201d income investments that rarely beat inflation and growth funds that invest in stocks and can outpace the cost of living. Note that in the example above, your real return is actually $16,458 after you subtract a 3 percent inflation rate. That is why it is probably worth shopping around, comparing several providers to check performance of various funds and vet any fees charged for administration and investment management.David Lyon, chief executive of Main Street Financial in Chicago, who owns an H.S.A., suggests checking with banks or other financial institutions where you may already do business because they \u201cmay offer low-cost mutual funds\u201d within such an account. It is also worth thinking about how an H.S.A. fits into the pecking order of retirement financing.Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner with T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says it is advisable to fund your 401(k) up to your employer\u2019s matching contribution first before considering fully funding an H.S.A. The combined savings can compound handsomely over time.Although Mr. Ritter says \u201cthere\u2019s no way to estimate\u201d how much cash you should put into an H.S.A. to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses over time, if you have \u201cchronic expensive illnesses,\u201d he suggests fully funding the account.The main drawback of the H.S.A. is that it is available only to people with high-deductible health policies. You cannot open an H.S.A. independently if you have other coverage or if you are already enrolled in Medicare. But if you can open one, and contribute to it, the account can be a useful fail-safe in your older years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Awesome Feat at Berkshire Hathaway, Revisited", "Date": "2015-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWarren Buffett is taking a victory lap, and on the 50th anniversary of his reign at Berkshire Hathaway he is entitled to it. From a failing New England textile company, Berkshire became the vehicle for one of capitalism\u2019s greatest investing feats.Until now, he has favored another method for measuring success: the change in the book value of the shares. That\u2019s an accounting metric. It is, basically, net assets, and he has said it is better than Berkshire\u2019s transitory market price at tracking the company\u2019s true worth. However you analyze it, Berkshire\u2019s long-term performance has been awesome. Using market value, he says, its shares gained 21.6 percent annually compared with 19.4 percent for book value and 9.9 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, with dividends. Using market returns, the shares gained a cumulative 1,826,163 percent since he took control.Consider that at the end of 2014, an investment of $100 in the 1965 Berkshire shares would be worth $1,826,163. For the same period, $100 in the index, with dividends, would have grown to $11,196. That\u2019s not shabby. But it\u2019s a lot less than the Berkshire investment \u2014 $1,814,967 less. So it may seem churlish to quibble. But it\u2019s worth raising some questions, if only because Mr. Buffett has invited them. Performance is critical. He says that if he doesn\u2019t outperform the market, investors shouldn\u2019t trust him with their money.Until this year, he has invoked book value: Page 2 of his letter would include the book value return, the S.&P. return and a third column, \u201crelative results,\u201d which showed how he was doing in comparison with the index. Now that comparison is gone. If that column existed in the current report, it would show that he trailed the S.&.P. again, using book value. By shifting to the market value metric \u2014 for the first time in 50 years \u2014 his returns look better. Would he have added a table on his golden anniversary showing market value if it had been a bad year for Berkshire in the stock market, whose judgment he has often disdained? I don\u2019t know. Mr. Buffett declined to comment.In the current letter, Mr. Buffett says that book value and intrinsic value \u2014 his estimate of the true value of the company, which he will not publicly reveal \u2014 have diverged since Berkshire\u2019s early years. (Intrinsic value, which is at the core of his investing, represents \u201cthe discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life,\u201d in his words. That calculation is subjective, depending on judgments about factors like a business\u2019s prospects, its management\u2019s ability now and in the future, and the likely path of interest rates and the economy.)In that letter, he says: \u201cOur emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these are worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how much the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value and its book value has materially widened.\u201dThat makes sense. Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries, like See\u2019s Candies, Geico, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company, are being carried on Berkshire\u2019s books at a fraction of their real value, he says. On the other hand, retained earnings from those companies, which are reinvested, do, in large part, show up elsewhere in the ledger. That\u2019s why, over the long run, he has said, book value is a worthwhile metric.\u201cThe new numbers don\u2019t change my probability analysis,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. \u201cWarren Buffett has been an extraordinary investor. But he hasn\u2019t been doing as well recently.\u201d Mr. Mehta\u2019s calculations show that over his first 25 years at Berkshire, Mr. Buffett\u2019s average annual return was 24 percent using book value and 30 percent using market value, compared with 10 percent for the S.&P. 500. Over his second 25 years, his performance was still outstanding: 15 percent for book value, 14 percent for market value and 10 percent for the index. The last six years reveal a different picture: 13 percent for book value, 15 percent for market value and 17 percent for the index. That\u2019s no disaster, but Mr. Buffett didn\u2019t meet his own standard: He frequently underperformed the market.There\u2019s no shame in that. Virtually everyone underperforms the market sometimes. To outperform it consistently, as Mr. Buffett has done over most of his career, is exceedingly rare. That\u2019s worth celebrating, even if it\u2019s also worth asking why the recent years haven\u2019t been extraordinary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spanish Lender Offers to Buy TSB Banking Group of Britain", "Date": "2015-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 TSB Banking Group, the lender spun out of Lloyds Banking Group last year, said on Thursday that it had received a preliminary takeover offer from Banco Sabadell of Spain.The deal, if completed, would greatly expand Sabadell\u2019s presence in Britain, where it primarily offers business accounts and banking services to Spanish companies.Under the terms of the offer, Sabadell would pay 3.40 pounds in cash for each share of TSB, valuing the company at \u00a31.7 billion, or about $2.6 billion, TSB said.Shares of TSB jumped 21 percent to \u00a33.20 in early trading in London on Thursday.TSB said its board of directors had indicated to Sabadell that it was willing to recommend that shareholders accept an offer at the proposed price, subject to reaching an agreement on other terms and conditions.The transaction would be subject to regulatory approvals, and TSB said the discussions \u201cmay or may not result in a formal offer for the entire share capital of the company.\u201dThe takeover approach by Sabadell is the latest evidence that Spanish banks, bolstered by recent capital increases, are looking to expand again overseas. The country\u2019s banking sector required a European bailout in 2012 to keep Bankia and other ailing savings banks afloat.Caixabank, which, like Sabadell, is based in the northeastern region of Catalonia, is pursuing a full takeover of BPI, a Portuguese bank, despite opposition from BPI\u2019s second-largest shareholder, Isabel dos Santos, who is pushing for an alternative merger plan with another Portuguese bank.Banco Popular, another Spanish bank, considered buying some of Citigroup\u2019s businesses in Central America, although news reports on Wednesday said it had dropped out of the bidding.Sabadell was not among the Spanish banks that required European bailout money. Instead, it snapped up, for the symbolic sum of 1 euro, one of the suffering savings banks \u2014 Caja de Ahorros del Mediterr\u00e1neo \u2014 as part of a sweeping consolidation of the savings banks, or cajas, encouraged by the Madrid government.In late 2013, Sabadell strengthened its capital when it brought in Latin American investors, including Jaime Gilinski, a Colombian billionaire, as part of a capital increase that involved selling 1.4 billion euros, or $1.49 billion, in new shares.\u200bAfter being briefly suspended from morning trading on Thursday, shares in Sabadell continued their slump and were down about 9 percent to \u20ac2.26 by midday in Madrid.Even if Sabadell\u2019s push into the British market took investors by surprise, it is not the first time the Spanish bank has sought to buy assets from Lloyds. In 2013, it acquired the retail Spanish subsidiary of Lloyds for about \u20ac84 million in a stock deal that also resulted in Lloyds becoming a shareholder in Sabadell, with a stake of 1.8 percent. In a separate deal a month later, Sabadell then agreed to buy the private banking unit of Lloyds, which is based in Miami.Lloyds is required to divest itself of the TSB network of 631 branches under the terms of its \u00a317 billion bailout. Lloyds had said before that it planned to sell its remaining stake in TSB by the end of this year.Lloyds said on Thursday that it was in discussions with Sabadell over a sale of its holdings in TSB and \u201cwould be minded to accept an offer at this price,\u201d subject to certain terms and conditions.With about 4.5 million retail customers, TSB is the seventh-largest retail bank in Britain. In 2014, the lender posted a profit of \u00a3134.5 million.TSB said its directors believed that Sabadell would \u201csupport and accelerate TSB\u2019s retail growth strategy\u201d and its expansion into lending for small to medium businesses.\u201cSabadell recognizes the achievement of TSB\u2019s management and employees and would continue to operate TSB as a robust competitor in the U.K. banking market, building on the TSB brand name,\u201d TSB said.Founded in 1881 in Catalonia, Sabadell is one of Spain\u2019s largest lenders. It posted a profit of \u20ac371.7 million in 2014 and has about 17,500 employees.The company provides international business banking services in 22 countries outside Spain, including the United States.Sabadell opened its first office in Britain in 1978 and its first operating branch in London in 1986. In Britain, it primarily provides business banking services but sees the market as attractive for future investment.Citigroup and Rothschild are acting as financial advisers to TSB, while Goldman Sachs is advising Sabadell.Chad Bray reported from London, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trans-Pacific Partnership Seen as Door for Foreign Suits Against U.S.", "Date": "2015-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 a cornerstone of Mr. Obama\u2019s remaining economic agenda \u2014 would grant broad powers to multinational companies operating in North America, South America and Asia. Under the accord, still under negotiation but nearing completion, companies and investors would be empowered to challenge regulations, rules, government actions and court rulings \u2014 federal, state or local \u2014 before tribunals organized under the World Bank or the United Nations.Backers of the emerging trade accord, which is supported by a wide variety of business groups and favored by most Republicans, say that it is in line with previous agreements that contain similar provisions. But critics, including many Democrats in Congress, argue that the planned deal widens the opening for multinationals to sue in the United States and elsewhere, giving greater priority to protecting corporate interests than promoting free trade and competition that benefits consumers.The chapter in the draft of the trade deal, dated Jan. 20, 2015, and obtained by The New York Times in collaboration with the group WikiLeaks, is certain to kindle opposition from both the political left and the right. The sensitivity of the issue is reflected in the fact that the cover mandates that the chapter not be declassified until four years after the Trans-Pacific Partnership comes into force or trade negotiations end, should the agreement fail.Conservatives are likely to be incensed that even local policy changes could send the government to a United Nations-sanctioned tribunal. On the left, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, law professors and a host of liberal activists have expressed fears the provisions would infringe on United States sovereignty and impinge on government regulation involving businesses in banking, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and other sectors.Members of Congress have been reviewing the secret document in secure reading rooms, but this is the first disclosure to the public since an early version leaked in 2012.\u201cThis is really troubling,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the Senate\u2019s No. 3 Democrat. \u201cIt seems to indicate that savvy, deep-pocketed foreign conglomerates could challenge a broad range of laws we pass at every level of government, such as made-in-America laws or anti-tobacco laws. I think people on both sides of the aisle will have trouble with this.\u201dThe United States Trade Representative\u2019s Office dismissed such concerns as overblown. Administration officials said opponents were using hypothetical cases to stoke irrational fear when an actual record exists that should soothe worries.Such \u201cInvestor-State Dispute Settlement\u201d accords exist already in more than 3,000 trade agreements across the globe. The United States is party to 51, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Administration officials say they level the playing field for American companies doing business abroad, protect property from government seizure and ensure access to international justice.But the limited use of trade tribunals, critics argue, is because companies in those countries do not have the size, legal budgets and market power to come after governments in the United States. The Trans-Pacific Partnership could change all that, they say. The agreement would expand that authority to investors in countries as wealthy as Japan and Australia, with sophisticated companies deeply invested in the United States.\u201cU.S.T.R. will say the U.S. has never lost a case, but you\u2019re going to see a lot more challenges in the future,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for these companies.\u201dTo supporters of the TPP, the Methanex case was proof that regulation for the \u201cpublic good\u201d would win out. For opponents, it showed what could happen when far larger companies from countries like Japan have access to the same extrajudicial tribunals.But as long as a government treats foreign and domestic companies in the same way, defenders say, it should not run afoul of the trade provisions. \u201cA government that conducts itself in an unbiased and nondiscriminatory fashion has nothing to worry about,\u201d said Scott Miller, an international business expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has studied past cases. \u201cThat\u2019s the record.\u201dSimilar chapters exist in the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Central American Free Trade Agreement, but their use has been limited against the United States. Over 25 years, according to the trade representative\u2019s office, the United States has faced only 17 investor-state cases, 13 of which went before tribunals. The United States has lost none.Civil courts in the United States are already open to action by foreign investors and companies. Since 1993, while the federal government was defending itself against those 17 cases brought through extrajudicial trade tribunals, it was sued 700,000 times in domestic courts.In all, according to Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, about 9,000 foreign-owned firms operating in the United States would be empowered to bring cases against governments here. Those are as diverse as timber and mining companies in Australia and investment conglomerates from China whose subsidiaries in Trans-Pacific Partnership countries like Vietnam and New Zealand also have ventures in the United States.More than 18,000 companies based in the United States would gain new powers to go after the other 11 countries in the accord.Senator Brown contended that the overall accord, not just the investment provisions, was troubling. \u201cThis continues the great American tradition of corporations writing trade agreements, sharing them with almost nobody, so often at the expense of consumers, public health and workers,\u201d he said.Under the terms of the Pacific trade chapter, foreign investors could demand cash compensation if member nations \u201cexpropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly.\u201d Opponents fear \u201cindirect expropriation\u201d will be interpreted broadly, especially by deep-pocketed multinational companies opposing regulatory or legal changes that diminish the value of their investments.Included in the definition of \u201cindirect expropriation\u201d is government action that \u201cinterferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations,\u201d according to the leaked document.The cost can be high. In 2012, one such tribunal, under the auspices of the World Bank\u2019s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, ordered Ecuador to pay Occidental Petroleum a record $2.3 billion for expropriating oil drilling rights.Under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a member nation would be forbidden from favoring \u201cgoods produced in its territory.\u201dCritics say the text\u2019s definition of an investment is so broad that it could open enormous avenues of legal challenge. An investment includes \u201cevery asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristic of an investment,\u201d including \u201cregulatory permits; intellectual property rights; financial instruments such as stocks and derivatives\u201d; construction, management, production, concession, revenue-sharing and other similar contracts; and \u201clicenses, authorizations, permits and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law.\u201d\u201cThis is not about expropriation; it\u2019s about regulatory changes,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch and a fierce opponent of the Pacific accord. \u201cYou now have specialized law firms being set up. You go to them, tell them what country you\u2019re in, what regulation you want to go after, and they say \u2018We\u2019ll do it on contingency.\u2019\u201dIn 2013, Eli Lilly took advantage of a similar provision under Nafta to sue Canada for $500 million, accusing Ottawa of violating its obligations to foreign investors by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs.All of those disputes would be adjudicated under rules set by either the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.The Obama administration pressed for \u2014 and won \u2014 clear transparency rules mandating that tribunals be open to the public and arbitration documents be available online. Outside parties would also be allowed to file briefs.\u201cHere\u2019s what I can tell you as these negotiations proceed,\u201d President Obama told reporters in Brussels last year when questioned on the trade deals in the works. \u201cI have fought my entire political career and as president to strengthen consumer protections. I have no intention of signing legislation that would weaken those protections.\u201dThere are other mitigating provisions, but many have catches. For instance, one article states that \u201cnothing in this chapter\u201d should prevent a member country from regulating investment activity for \u201cenvironmental, health or other regulatory objectives.\u201d But that safety valve says such regulation must be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the other strictures of the chapter, a provision even administration officials said rendered the clause more political than legal.One of the chapter\u2019s annexes states that regulatory actions meant \u201cto protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety and the environment\u201d do not constitute indirect expropriation, \u201cexcept in rare circumstances.\u201d That final exception could open such regulations to legal second-guessing, critics say.An article on Thursday about provisions in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as outlined in a classified document, that would allow foreign corporations to sue the United States over actions that hurt their business or investment expectations misstated when the document was made available to members of Congress. Drafts were available for review soon after being written; it is not the case that the latest document was not made available until last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delight or Dread as Euro Falls", "Date": "2015-03-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 For Herv\u00e9 Montjotin, chief executive of the French trucking and logistics group Norbert Dentressangle, the euro\u2019s steep plunge against the dollar could not be more welcome.In the months since his company bought Jacobson, an American contract logistics company, the currency\u2019s decline \u2014 down about 23 percent over the past year \u2014 has meant a windfall when dollars earned in the United States are translated back into euros.\u201cWe bought a profitable business, and that business now makes 20 percent more in euros than when we got it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve either been very skilled or very lucky.\u201dMillions of businesspeople on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as tourists planning trips in one direction or the other, are now watching with delight or dread as Europe\u2019s main currency drops ever closer to parity with the dollar.On Wednesday afternoon in Paris, the euro was trading at $1.0567. The currency has declined nearly 13 percent in the first months of 2015 alone and is at its lowest level since early 2003. The euro peaked at almost $1.60 in April 2008, as the European Central Bank was warning of impending interest rate increases despite the financial crisis that was beginning to be felt in the United States.The current plunge reflects differences in economic outlook, interest rates and monetary policies in Europe and the United States that in many ways favor the Americans \u2014 unless they are American companies trying to sell their wares to Europeans.For the United States, which already runs a substantial trade deficit with the rest of the world, a weaker euro might only widen that gap, as German cars, Spanish wines and French luxury goods become more price-competitive. Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, warned that the strong dollar was \u201ca major headwind\u201d for American companies and said that executives were \u201cless happy\u201d than they were a few months ago.\u201cPeople recognize that the dollar is strengthening for the right reasons,\u201d Mr. Moutray said, citing the relatively strong United States economy and the signals that the Federal Reserve may be closer to raising interest rates \u2014 a lure to foreign investors and a further spur to the dollar \u2014 even as the European Central Bank is keeping interest rates at historical lows. Still, he added, \u201cthe dollar is getting to a level where it\u2019s harder to compete against the Europeans.\u201dThe happier Americans would be tourists, who during the coming spring break or summer months will find that a meal in a fancy French restaurant or a Mediterranean beach holiday costs much less than it would have a year ago. Europeans visiting New York or California, of course, will find that their euros won\u2019t stretch nearly as far this year.The sagging euro is only part of the story. The dollar is on its biggest surge since the mid-1990s \u2014 up 19 percent over the past 12 months against a basket of global currencies that includes the Japanese yen and the British pound.But the euro is the standout. And it has further room to fall, in many analysts\u2019 view. \u201cThe market is starting to get parity in its sights,\u201d Lee Hardman, a currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London, said, estimating that a one-to-one exchange rate could be reached within weeks. \u201cThe momentum is clearly for a weaker euro.\u201dPart of the euro\u2019s downturn stems from the existential questions that continue to dog the currency bloc, as dramatized by Greece\u2019s continuing struggle with its creditors over revised bailout terms.The bigger factor, though, is the impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s program, which began this week, to buy \u20ac1.1 trillion in bonds by September 2016, while also holding its official interest rates at low, or in some cases even negative, levels. Those policies are meant to stoke the economy, but they are prompting global investors to seek better places to get a return on their money \u2014 like dollar-based stocks and bonds.Even before the central bank\u2019s bond-buying began, investor anticipation was pushing European interest rates to new lows. On Wednesday, the yield on 10-year German government bonds was about 0.23 percent \u2014 while the comparable United States Treasury bill was yielding about 2.00 percent.That is the largest such gap, or \u201cspread,\u201d since 1989, according to Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. And it has unleashed a tsunami of capital flows from Europe to the United States. That trend seems likely to continue for now, whether or not the euro reaches parity with the dollar.\u201cParity is a nice psychological thing, but it has no real meaning,\u201d Mr. Chandler said. \u201cBefore it\u2019s over I think we\u2019ll test the euro\u2019s historic lows.\u201d That would be around 82 United States cents, he said, a level last hit in October 2000, when American interest rates were significantly higher than in Europe.The euro could hit a new trough next year, he said, noting that although the European Central Bank\u2019s easy money policy was set to run through at least early autumn 2016, by that time the Federal Reserve might have raised its main interest rate target above 1 percent \u2014 up from near zero currently.That could mean continued struggles for American exporters.A Duke/CFO Magazine survey of United States companies published on Wednesday found that around two-thirds of the big American exporters polled reported a negative impact from the strong dollar.\u201cWe are in a midst of an ugly contest to see whether the eurozone, Japan or Canada can depreciate the most against the U.S. dollar, and China is probably next,\u201d Campbell R. Harvey, a Fuqua School of Business professor, said in a statement accompanying the survey. \u201cU.S. exporters are being punished by these competitive depreciations, and this will lead to lower profits and less employment.\u201dIf the strong dollar does continue to pose those sorts of economic threats, of course, the Fed might alter its thinking about when to raise interest rates. So far, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, has said that she sees factors like the strong dollar and weak oil price to be largely balanced.But for the struggling eurozone, where unemployment is still averaging above 11 percent and where economies have stalled in most of the currency union\u2019s 19 member countries, there is much to recommend a weaker euro.Speaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, credited the falling currency, along with lower oil prices and the central bank\u2019s own policies, with having recently lifted the outlook for economic growth in the bloc. A weak euro also helps the central bank in its battle to rekindle inflation from its worrisome lows, since it raises the prices of imported goods.Mr. Montjotin, the Norbert Dentressangle chief, noted that the weak euro was also helping his business by making companies in France, Spain and Italy more competitive globally and thus raising demand for his company\u2019s services.He acknowledged some drawbacks. The company\u2019s American debt is now 20 percent heavier in euro terms, he noted. And as the euro falls, it negates part of the positive impact of the lower price of oil, which is priced in dollars.\u201cOn balance, though,\u201d Mr. Montjotin concluded, \u201cit is positive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quiet Start to Central Bank Bond-Buying Program for the Eurozone", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite predictions that the central bank would have trouble finding enough government bonds to buy, officials in Frankfurt said they were not encountering any problems \u2014 at least on the first day of purchases.European stock markets slipped slightly for the day, while the euro rose initially against the dollar before retreating to about $1.085. The effective interest rate or yield on German 10-year bonds fell to 0.31 percent from 0.39 percent, though it was not clear if the central bank\u2019s buying was the main reason. Bond yields fall as prices rise.\u201cE.C.B. and eurosystem national central banks have, as previously announced, started purchases under the Public Sector Purchase Program,\u201d the central bank said on Twitter.The eurosystem refers to the network of eurozone national central banks, which are doing most of the purchasing on bond markets. Typically they are buying the bonds from large banks that act as dealers.The goal of the program is to drive up inflation, which has slipped into negative territory and has raised the specter of deflation, a broad decline in consumer prices that can eventually undercut corporate revenue and force companies to cut staff.Central banks in the United States, Britain and Japan have used quantitative easing, but it had never been tried in the eurozone until Monday.The European Central Bank has said bonds will be purchased on the open market \u2014 not directly from bond issuers, in part to avoid accusations that it is violating a ban on central bank financing of eurozone governments. And it will wait several days before buying newly issued bonds to give financial markets time to determine a price.But one side effect of the program could be to relieve pressure on government budgets. Most of the purchases are being conducted by national central banks, which will buy their own governments\u2019 bonds and collect interest payments and other profits.Later, the central banks will pass the profits back to their national governments. That means the debt effectively becomes free of cost to the issuing country.One unresolved issue is how to deal with any losses suffered in countries like Germany, where many government bonds with maturities of seven years or less carry negative interest rates and thus will return less money than they cost. Opposition to the bond-buying program remains fierce in Germany.\u201cThe bond purchase program will make the problems in Europe even worse,\u201d L\u00fcder Gerken, director of the Center for European Policy in Freiburg, Germany, said in a statement. \u201cBy lowering interest rates on government bonds the E.C.B. will further remove reform pressure on member states. At the same time the flood of money will lead to false allocation of capital and strongly raise the risk of bubbles.\u201dThe European Central Bank aims to buy \u20ac60 billion ($65 billion) in government bonds and other assets each month, spread out evenly over the month. The purchases will continue until September 2016, or until the bank\u2019s Governing Council is confident that inflation is heading back toward the official target of below, but close to, 2 percent.Much of the effect of the central bank\u2019s policies was already reflected in the rising prices of stocks and bonds. The central bank said in January that it would begin buying government bonds, and it had signaled well before then that quantitative easing was imminent.Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the central bank\u2019s executive board, said in an interview on Sunday with Politis, a newspaper in Cyprus, that the asset-purchase program had already had a positive effect on the eurozone economy, by pushing down the cost of credit.\u201cLending rates to households and firms have come down since the summer across the entire euro area,\u201d Mr. Coeur\u00e9 said in the interview.The purchases are being made roughly in proportion to the economic weight of each of the 19 countries in the eurozone.In addition to bonds issued by governments, the European Central Bank and national central banks will also buy debt issued by government institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone bailout fund, and the Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, a German development bank.The European Central Bank said it would disclose details of the bond purchases on a weekly basis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Starve a Landfill", "Date": "2015-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The nation\u2019s first citywide composting program based largely on shame began here in January.City sanitation workers who find garbage cans filled with aging lettuce, leftover pizza or even the box it came in are slapping on bright red tags to inform the offending household (and, presumably, the whole neighborhood) that the city\u2019s new composting law has been violated.But mandated composting reflects a deeper shift in the mood of the nation\u2019s cooks, one in which wasting food is unfashionable. Running an efficient kitchen \u2014 where bruised fruit is blended into smoothies, carrot tops are pulsed into pesto, and a juicy pork shoulder can move seamlessly from Sunday supper to Monday\u2019s carnitas to a rich pot of broth for the freezer \u2014 is becoming as satisfying as the food itself. The ethos stretches from Manhattan\u2019s best restaurants to the homes of people like Kathleen Whitson, 44, who cooks for her family of four in West Seattle.Ms. Whitson, who didn\u2019t discover fresh garlic until she was out of college, now drops vegetable trimmings in a compost bucket on the counter and keeps a list of what\u2019s in her chest freezer on the refrigerator door. A stockpot simmers on the stove and kombucha ferments in the pantry. She cooks more like her grandmother than her mother, a woman she said raised her to believe in the magic of processed food. \u201cIn spite of the fact that it drives me crazy sometimes, I can\u2019t imagine cooking any other way now,\u201d Ms. Whitson said. \u201cIt just makes me feel better. Like, I love knowing I have raspberries from our yard in the freezer.\u201dTo be sure, the cook\u2019s pursuit of thrift and efficiency is not new to American food culture. Sausage, home-churned butter and fermented cabbage were as much delicious foundations of farm life as they were essential to Depression-era survival.Homemakers during World War II considered themselves soldiers of the kitchen, with conservation their battle cry. In the 1970s, ecology drove the urge to make good use of kitchen waste.Somewhere along the line, the art of kitchen efficiency was lost amid grocery stores packed with pre-made pizza shells, bagged lettuce and fruit so perfect it needed no knife work. Dinner was almost as likely to come from the drive-through or the new corner bistro as from the stove.How were home cooks supposed to know what to do with a leftover chicken carcass if they didn\u2019t know how to roast the chicken in the first place?Now, in this era of nose-to-tail eating, by-catch seafood suppers and farmers\u2019 markets, the discarded is becoming delicious.\u201cWe are starting to really celebrate the curve of the vegetable,\u201d said the Atlanta chef Steven Satterfield, \u201cand not peeling things and showing off a little of the tap root or the green on the top of the radish to remind you of where the vegetable came from.\u201d His new book, \u201cRoot to Leaf,\u201d is a deep study of vegetable cookery, with instructions for making stocks from corn cobs and mushroom stems.Eating better may cost more, she said, but an efficient cook can make up the difference. \u201cWe are so price sensitive in the store, and 10 cents will swing us one way or other,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the kitchen we throw out so much money without even thinking about price.\u201dLater this spring, a former Trader Joe\u2019s executive will open Daily Table, a restaurant and grocery store in Roxbury, Mass., that is dedicated to ugly fruit and food past its sell-by date. Even in Europe, where classic dishes like pot-au-feu or the Tuscan soup ribollita sprang from a history of kitchen efficiency, 2014 was declared the year against food waste, a move that came six years after the European Union lifted its ban on selling produce that was knobby, excessively curved or otherwise misshapen. Last year, the French grocery chain Intermarch\u00e9 took things one step further and started a campaign to celebrate and sell what it called \u201cinglorious fruits and vegetables\u201d with special pricing and ads. \u201cThe best restaurants today are focusing on how to utilize what\u2019s unknown and largely uncoveted,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cThat has turned dining on its head so fast we tend to not even recognize it.\u201dFor his project, which begins on March 13, Mr. Barber and his cooks are putting kale ribs into a pressure cooker and turning them into vegetable rice and deep-frying skate bones with fish-head sauce for dipping. He has created a burger from the vegetable pulp left over from a fresh juice company. He tops it with cheese trimmings from Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont and serves it with pickles made from cucumber butts and ketchup rendered from beets rejected by plant breeders at the University of Wisconsin.Even the food left on diners\u2019 plates at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, his restaurant in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., feeds the restaurant\u2019s laying hens.Considering how to use all the food that comes into Mr. Humm\u2019s restaurants is a constant concern but offers opportunities for innovation. For a while, he was preparing a broccoli dish that produced copious amounts of stems. They became a gratin for the staff meal. \u201cThen I started liking the stems better,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you cook it right, it\u2019s as great as an asparagus. We ended up just using the stems for the dish and serving the florets to staff.\u201dMr. Barber admits that waste is perhaps not the best selling point on a menu, but he hopes that if he can inspire his fellow high-end chefs to turn it into something delicious, using waste will trickle down to the menus at restaurants like Ruby Tuesday, and into home kitchens, too.Some cooks are already there, particularly a generation of millennial cooks enamored with D.I.Y. projects, kitchen hacks and social causes like hunger and agricultural reform, said Brandi Henderson, an architect who became a pastry chef and blogger. She teaches about 40 cooking classes a month at the Pantry in Seattle, a city whose environmental sensibility made the composting mandate less controversial than it might be in a city like New York.

{"Headline": "If Only G.E. Had an Activist Investor Who Cared", "Date": "2015-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAlmost nothing General Electric does registers with its stockholders. A big asset sale? Shares hardly budge. A multibillion-dollar acquisition? Yawn. Aggressive shrinkage of its irritating financial business? Crickets. It seems investors no longer care about the company, a $254 billion conglomerate run by Jeffrey R. Immelt. If only G.E. had an activist who cared.The problem is that diagnosing General Electric\u2019s \u201cunchanged\u201d problem isn\u2019t so easy. It\u2019s not that the company owns poor assets or harbors an entrenched aversion to reordering its portfolio of businesses. Nor is it a case of demonstrably bad management or terribly allocated capital, the sorts of things that usually exercise investors to grasp the corporate cage and give it a good rattle.Rather, G.E. faces something slightly more existential, and pernicious, as an investment. The market seems to think its shares are dead money. As Microsoft showed in the days before Satya Nadella took over as chief executive, such a perception may be even more difficult to shake off.Mr. Immelt is by no means standing still. Though he has been at the company for nigh on 14 years, its corporate finance department has been a beehive of activity. As Mr. Immelt is quick to accentuate, including in the opening paragraph of his most recent letter to shareholders, issued on Monday: \u201cWe have been profoundly changing our company.\u201dJust in the past 12 months, G.E. sold its appliances business to Electrolux for $3.3 billion; began to spin off Synchrony Financial, a $26.5 billion retail financial services company, from GE Capital; and in its largest takeover, agreed to pay $17 billion for the power and grid businesses of France\u2019s Alstom last May. Sure, General Electric is a big company, but this $50 billion flurry of wheeling and dealing merited not even a golf clap.Despite all of the maneuvers and various hints that the company is moving as fast as banking regulators will allow to whittle down its exposure to the financial services business, over the past year G.E. stock has gained precisely 1.35 percent, or to put it in Wall Street parlance, \u201cunch.\u201d As in unchanged.Even on Monday, after announcing the sale of GE Capital\u2019s portfolio of credit cards and consumer loans in Australia for $6.3 billion, it was a snooze-fest for G.E. shareholders. The stock increased 1.5 percent. That may be a lot for a company the size of G.E., but in reality it was just a bit better than the overall market performance.\u201cWhat\u2019s most notable and concerning to us is that most large, long-term investors seem to have \u2018thrown in the towel\u2019 on G.E. stock,\u201d Scott Davis, an analyst who covers the company for Barclays Capital, wrote last year. Mr. Davis cited anecdotal evidence from his own experience: Although General Electric made up a third of the market value for industrial companies in his purview, it amounted to only 5 percent of incoming call volume from investors. A decade ago, it was 80 percent.It\u2019s not that Mr. Davis isn\u2019t worth calling for his views on General Electric. He\u2019s easily one of the best in the business. It\u2019s more indicative that General Electric\u2019s share roster is dominated by index funds and exchange traded funds that mimic the movement of the Dow Jones industrial average, in which General Electric has been a member since its 1896 formation.In short, the G.E. story has about as much flavor as a loaf of white bread. It houses best-of-breed businesses, like aircraft engines and energy turbines. The company hires talented people and trains them, and they generally like working there. Its headquarters are lean (nobody really much uses the helipad in Fairfield, Conn.) and it regularly prunes its portfolio. But Mr. Immelt\u2019s plans to reduce GE Capital\u2019s contribution to less than a quarter of the bottom line mean earnings are basically flat.In a way, General Electric\u2019s conundrum recalls that of another sprawling enterprise not so long ago: Microsoft. Until August 2013, shares of the software company captained by Steven A. Ballmer with a board led by founder Bill Gates had pretty much flatlined for more than a decade. As with General Electric, inertia wasn\u2019t an issue. In that time, Microsoft acquired aQuantive for $6 billion, Nokia\u2019s handset arm for $7.2 billion, Skype for $8.5 billion and a stake in Facebook. It also offered to buy Yahoo for $45 billion.And then, shortly after a quietly pushy investor, ValueAct Capital, took a shine to Microsoft, Mr. Ballmer bowed out and Mr. Gates stepped aside as chairman. The company\u2019s market value swelled by more than $100 billion from the day Mr. Ballmer said he would hand over the C.E.O. role to the time he left the board for good last August. Since taking over, Mr. Nadella hasn\u2019t really done much that could be considered splashy. He spent $2 billion on the maker of video game Minecraft, but otherwise has moved methodically and mostly avoided his predecessor\u2019s mistakes.Microsoft isn\u2019t the sort of comparison Mr. Immelt will relish. Shareholders are nevertheless fickle. Sometimes a change of face is all that\u2019s needed to revisit and reconsider long-held beliefs.Mr. Davis of Barclays recently updated his own view of General Electric two weeks ago with a simple conclusion: \u201cManagement changes down the road should help to get folks off the sidelines.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Adding Good Deeds to the Investment Equation ", "Date": "2015-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersEVERY two years, the residents of Richmond, Calif., a city long known for some of the highest rates of violence in the United States, gather to discuss its priorities. For years, the No. 1 concern was crime.But things have started to look up in Richmond, a city of about 100,000 people in the midst of Bay Area opulence. At the most recent meeting, Richmond residents were more concerned about blight. An obvious \u2014 and seemingly fixable \u2014 example was the city\u2019s 800 or so abandoned homes, which cost it thousands of dollars a year to maintain in their dilapidated state.Enter a twist on social impact bonds.Typically, social impact bonds are contracts, not bonds as investors think of them. If the group receiving the proceeds can improve a certain social condition, the investors are paid back with some interest; if it fails, the investors lose. The bonds have been used to reduce recidivism rates for criminals released from prison and to reduce teenage pregnancy rates.Jim Becker, president and chief executive of the Richmond Community Foundation, said he had found a way for the city to sell social impact bonds to raise money that the community foundation could use to buy the homes. Local workers would rehabilitate the homes, which would then be sold to people through first-time home buyer programs.A sale of $3 million in bonds is expected this month, pending final approval by the Richmond City Council. That would pay for the rehabilitation of 20 properties a year over five years. And Mr. Becker believes there is investor interest for another $3 million.\u201cThe challenge right now is these properties don\u2019t turn enough of a profit for a typical real estate investor,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cAn investor wants a 30 percent to 40 percent return.\u201d Under Mr. Becker\u2019s plan, investors receive a 2 percent return on the money they put in, and if the project is profitable, up to half of their original investments.While the bond issue is small, it is an example of increased investor interest in social impact projects, a niche that has long appealed to two types of investors: those who want to avoid companies that clash with their beliefs, and those with a desire to put a small portion of their wealth into an investment that could do some good, whatever the return. What has held social impact investing back is the perception that its returns are lower than those of investments without that social overlay.One type of social impact investment is green bonds, which focus on projects like wind power, clean water and sustainable agriculture. There is also a range of investing strategies known as environmental, social and governance investing, or E.S.G. Some strategies screen out companies that make certain kinds of products, like alcohol or tobacco; newer strategies look for positive screens, such as seeking companies that work in certain areas or employ best practices in their businesses.A spate of recent studies and a conference this week worked hard to show that the returns on investments with environmental, social and governance screens were similar to other investments \u2014 in both good and bad ways \u2014 and in some cases, were better when compared with indexes since the financial crash.Certain areas are growing rapidly, like green bonds. Since 2007, about $60 billion worth of green bonds have been sold, according to Marilyn Ceci, a managing director and the head of green bonds at JPMorgan Chase. But $37 billion of that came in 2014. One prediction at a U.S. Trust conference on Wednesday put that amount at more than $100 billion this year.Why do people invest in an area that does good but can be complicated to understand and has a reputation of modest returns? The reasons are varied.Banks make these investments because they help fulfill the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires them to meet a range of credit needs, \u201cwith the added bonus of qualifying for great P.R.,\u201d said Robert T. Esposito, a lawyer at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe. \u201cIf you\u2019re a foundation, you can meet your 5 percent distribution\u201d of assets as required by law, he said. \u201cOr if you\u2019re an impact investor, you must be willing to trade off some returns.\u201dBut Andy M. Sieg, head of global wealth and retirement solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, views this as a chance for retail investors to drive the creation of a new investment category. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of an innovation cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cClient demand emerges. Advisers become stimulated by this demand. It drives product creation. It\u2019s happened again and again, and it\u2019s taking place in the era of impact investing.\u201dHe said Merrill Lynch now has $9 billion in social impact investments, compared with $6.4 billion last year. (Over all, the firm has more than $2 trillion in assets.)Of course, the newest thing doesn\u2019t always catch on with everyone.In one study, 71 percent of investors were interested in making investments with an environmental, social and governance screen, and 72 percent thought companies benefited from carrying out those principles. But 54 percent believed they had to give up performance if they made such investments, said Audrey Choi, chief executive of the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing.Yet in a study not yet released of 10,000 equity mutual funds in the United States over the last seven years, Ms. Choi said, the returns of sustainable funds met or exceeded the median returns of traditional funds 64 percent of the time and had the same or lower volatility.In essence, sustainable funds could perform just as well or better than traditional funds and also just as badly.\u201cManager selection absolutely matters,\u201d Ms. Choi said. \u201cI often say just because you add the word sustainable into an investment, the laws of physics aren\u2019t suspended. If we want this market to really grow, we have to make sure we go into this in a \u2018best in class\u2019 way.\u201dCary Krosinsky, an adjunct professor at the Earth Institute at Columbia, found in research on the returns of 850 funds that social impact investments made with positive screens outperformed by more than four percentage points those made with screens that excluded sectors.While he also argued for the need for expertise in making environmental, social and governance investments, he said a bigger advantage to investors might be to make E.S.G. another factor in their analysis of an investment. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not doing anything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you do bring it in, you know you\u2019re not missing out.\u201dGreen bonds, for example, seem to be growing rapidly because they carry the risk of the issuer, say, a utility, and not that of the project they are financing, like a windmill. \u201cThe essence of green bond debt is the project,\u201d Ms. Ceci said. \u201cThe purpose is to transition to a low-carbon economy. But the risk is the credit decision of the issuer \u2014 you\u2019re not exposed to the project directly.\u201dLast year, when Massachusetts sold $350 million worth of green bonds, $260 million of that was bought by retail investors. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just investors from Natick, Newton and Wellesley,\u201d Ms. Choi said. \u201cThey had investors from California and around the country buying it.\u201dYet for those tempted to invest, these are still early days, with plenty of pitfalls. If the Richmond project fails, the investors get back whatever money the program still has and the titles to their properties. That is not exactly a double-digit return for tying up an investment for so long.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mario Draghi of E.C.B. Predicts an Improved Economy When Stimulus Program Begins Monday", "Date": "2015-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNICOSIA, Cyprus \u2014 The European Central Bank will begin its big new stimulus program on Monday, the bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said. He predicted improvements in the economy and in the eurozone\u2019s inflation picture as a result of the effort.\u201cOur monetary policy decisions have worked,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cIt\u2019s with some certain degree of satisfaction that the governing council has acknowledged this.\u201dIndications that the central bank plans to stick with its policies, and maintain an environment of low interest rates, briefly sent the euro currency below $1.10 for the first time in a dozen years. At the end of the European trading day it was at $1.1012.Despite the more promising outlook, the staff projections indicated that the central bank would not approach its inflation target of below, but close to, 2 percent until 2017 at the earliest.\u201cThe E.C.B.\u2019s macroeconomic assessment was much more upbeat than in previous months,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients on Thursday. In fact, Mr. Brzeski added, \u201ctoday\u2019s euphoria was in our view almost a bit overdone.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s suddenly sunny forecast may have been calculated. The central bank\u2019s policies, or so-called quantitative easing effort, will be more effective if investors, corporate executives and consumers believe in them. Supported by some genuinely positive economic data, like a dip in unemployment, Mr. Draghi appeared to be using the news conference to give a pep talk that would encourage more investment and spending.Markets fluctuated during the briefing, but stocks and bonds eventually rallied. Blue-chip shares in the eurozone ended the day up about 1 percent, while yields on most eurozone governments\u2019 bonds fell slightly.The monetary policy meeting was the first since the central bank said on Jan. 22 that it would begin buying eurozone government bonds and other debt at a monthly rate of 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, in an effort to push inflation back toward the official target.The European Central Bank\u2019s lending to Greece right now is 68 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 the highest in the eurozone \u2014 Mr. Draghi said. \u201cIn this sense, the E.C.B. is the central bank of Greece,\u201d he added.The central bank\u2019s governing council on Thursday decided to raise its emergency lending to Greek commercial banks by \u20ac500 million, Mr. Draghi said.And he indicated that the central bank would consider resuming its policy of letting the Greek banks use their government\u2019s bonds as collateral to obtain regular loans from the European Central Bank \u2014 but only when Athens demonstrated its commitment to making the economic changes the international creditors were demanding.Because Greek government bonds are rated below investment grade, the European Central Bank must grant a waiver to let the banks use them as collateral. The central bank decided in February to rescind its previous waiver, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the election of the new Greek government.With a note of sarcasm in his voice, Mr. Draghi rebutted suggestions by some analysts that the European Central Bank would not be able to find enough debt to meet its bond-buying goals.\u201cUntil a month ago, nobody had any doubts that public debt \u2014 sovereign debt \u2014 in the euro area was actually very, very big,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cNow some people worry we won\u2019t have enough bonds.\u201dBut the yields of 10-year bonds of eurozone countries all remain in positive territory.Bond buying is a way for the European Central Bank to effectively print money and inject it into the economy. But confidence in the central bank\u2019s ability to rekindle inflation could suffer if the market is so tight that it is unable to meet its goal of buying \u20ac60 billion of debt a month.The policy might already have had a beneficial effect. Market interest rates have been falling in anticipation of the bond-buying campaign. That is making it possible for companies to borrow money more cheaply than ever. What companies save on interest payments they can invest in expansion and hiring.Sweden, where Volvo is based, is not a member of the eurozone, but it closely tracks its monetary policy with that of the currency bloc, and the Swedish benchmark rate is below zero. Volvo\u2019s decision to renew its model line and rebuild market share in the United States was not prompted by low interest rates, Mr. Samuelsson said.\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s good timing for us.\u201dMr. Draghi on Thursday rejected criticism that monetary policy was helping only high-income people who own stocks and bonds. The benefits, he said \u201care being passed in the form of lower borrowing costs in the real economy.\u201dThe choice of Cyprus for the central bank meeting was noteworthy because the country continues to suffer from the effects of the collapse of its banks in 2013, and from a rescue plan that forced depositors to shoulder some of its cost.Some residents of Cyprus expressed their dissatisfaction with the central bank\u2019s behavior by staging demonstrations on Wednesday and Thursday outside the conference center where Mr. Draghi held the news conference.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Changes, an Overhaul of Wall Street Falls Short", "Date": "2015-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe TradeBut do Lloyd C. Blankfein and Jamie Dimon seem humbled to you?So which story line is right? Is banking really changing? Are bankers chastened? Are the banks safer, and has their political power waned? Is the economy less dependent on a corrosive financial sector that extracts, rather than creates, value?And if so, does any of it have anything to do with regulation?First, let\u2019s step back to see where finance stands compared with 2007, the year before the crisis. Using the widest lens, the biggest banks are bigger than they were. Of the six largest banks in the country, three have significantly more assets today: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Combined, the top six have almost $10 trillion in assets, compared with just over $8 trillion in 2007, according to SNL Financial.It\u2019s true that during the crisis, the government explicitly and implicitly supported mergers. Since 2009, some of the banks\u2019 assets have shrunk, but it has largely been an incremental movement. A different financial reform package could have undone the emergency consolidation that may (or may not) have been necessary at the peak of the panic, but President Obama and the Democrats who controlled Congress chose not to do that.Let\u2019s turn to net income. Revenues are squeezed, but what about profits? Four of the six biggest banks were more profitable last year \u2014 yes, even after all those supposedly onerous, gargantuan fines \u2014 than they were in 2007. Combined, the top six made $73 billion last year, compared with $57 billion the year before the crisis that supposedly changed the world.Hmm. So, what about pay? Are bankers being forced to take second jobs as Uber drivers? Hardly. Pay per employee for three of the top six banks is up from 2007, with compensation at Bank of America and Wells Fargo significantly outpacing inflation. It\u2019s off only modestly at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.To be fair, some things have changed since the crisis. Banks now have higher capital ratios, which really does make them safer. But it will always be the case that bankers will try to manipulate the system and hide their leverage. Some experts say it would be better to overcorrect, rather than try to fine-tune.\u201cAn engineer doesn\u2019t build a bridge for the exact weight of the truck,\u201d said Erik F. Gerding, a regulatory expert at the University of Colorado Law School.And the banks are still far too dependent on short-term funding. Given that the most immediate cause of the financial crisis was that banks faced runs in the short-term lending markets, this is a spectacular hole in financial reform. (The Fed has been working on it.)Another hole is that regulators haven\u2019t solved the problem of how to wind down failed giant banks. This is called resolution authority, where the banks write \u201cliving wills.\u201d It may be an insoluble problem. Executives have little incentive to get it right. Such a failure might not come for five, 10 or even 25 years. When it does, their bank will be dead and they will be out of jobs. Regulators, meanwhile, can\u2019t really do real-time tests to see whether a resolution plan has been done correctly.So there\u2019s been a lot of tinkering and incremental progress. But the real question facing society is whether financial reform has reversed the trajectory of financialization. For the good of the economy, finance needs to be a middleman, helping companies raise capital to help get products and services to the people who need and want them. Instead, finance has become a money-extraction machine, enriching itself while endangering society as a whole.This wasn\u2019t ever an explicit goal for financial reform, though that\u2019s hardly a defense of the efforts of Mr. Obama and Barney Frank.Nonetheless, are we on the path toward reversing the growth in finance?Somewhat.For about 150 years, finance has essentially charged a 2 percent fee on financial assets, like stocks, bonds and loans, according to research by a New York University economist, Thomas Philippon. That \u201cfee\u201d adds up the total costs that investment bankers, asset managers, brokers and other financial middlemen charge their clients. Even as financial assets in the economy doubled over the last few decades, that fee percentage stayed remarkably flat.Although assets at the biggest banks are up, overall assets in the economy are down since the financial crisis. Because of that, the share of gross domestic product going to finance is down. Is that because of regulation? Or is that a result of the natural aftermath of a crisis, as leverage comes down and people reduce debt? It\u2019s an open question.But here\u2019s another way of looking at it: The persistence of the high fee is astonishing. The higher the fee that finance charges, the less money goes to the economy for more productive uses.\u201cThe fees are too high,\u201d Professor Philippon said.Because assets were rising over the last several decades, the fee should have fallen because of economies of scale. Also, technology should have made finance more efficient, Professor Philippon says. He\u2019s optimistic that the fees will eventually decline.But that they haven\u2019t is something of an economic mystery. Which brings us to the financial industry\u2019s political influence.Without question, banking power has diminished compared with its level at the height of the bubble. Memories of the financial crisis persist. But they are fading.This is where the failure of the bailout and subsequent reforms will come to hurt us. Not today, but during the next boom when banks find it easy to loosen things up.Under the old financial regulatory system, we had offsetting powers and interests. In the 1980s, securities companies would sue regulators when they opened up the securities markets to the banks. (They weren\u2019t successful, but they did throw sand in the gears.) Now that commercial banks are investment banks and asset managers and vice versa, the financial industry is much more of a united bloc of political interests.As Mr. Gerding of the University of Colorado Law School said: \u201cWe\u2019ve done some good substantive things but haven\u2019t re-engineered or restructured the financial system,\u201d as we did during the Great Depression.To reduce finance\u2019s hold on our society in order to help our economy, we will need to stay on the path we so tentatively embarked on in 2009.That seems a dubious proposition for a political system that still allows Citigroup to write its own laws.Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.

{"Headline": "A New Tool to Investigate Inside Tippers", "Date": "2015-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe British philosopher Francis Bacon is attributed with saying that \u201cknowledge is power,\u201d and Wall Street pours enormous resources into obtaining information in the hope that greater knowledge will provide an edge on the market. But recent charges against a corporate officer show that passing along confidential information can be perilous, even if the intent is something other than insider trading.That sounds like a potential market manipulation case in which false information is released to help short-sellers profit from the anticipated decline in the stock price. But it turns out that was not the case because the information in the report was not necessarily false, or at least was not disclosed for the purpose of pushing the price down, which would be required to prove a violation.The case resembles the recent insider trading prosecutions involving expert networks that put hedge fund traders together with sources inside companies to provide information about industry trends. These relationships sometimes crossed the line into tipping confidential information about earnings and other corporate developments. Among those convicted of insider trading based on contacts developed through expert-networking firms were Mathew Martoma, a former hedge fund manager at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s SAC Capital Advisors, and Winifred Jiau, a consultant for Primary Global Research.But Mr. Dunham is not charged with tipping inside information that was used to trade. Detwiler Fenton has not been accused of misusing the information for its own profit or to help clients trade in advance of the research report, which is required for a securities law violation.Giving money for information could be viewed as akin to a bribe or kickback because of the benefit received. But it could also be seen as an ordinary business arrangement in which a corporate official is paid for insights into an industry that will be used to analyze the prospects of different companies.The mail and wire fraud statutes can fill a gap that allows prosecutors to address disclosures of confidential information that might not fit under the insider trading prohibition. But this tool is not available to the S.E.C. because only the Justice Department can enforce criminal laws.Whether the payments received by Mr. Dunham are bribes or kickbacks remains to be seen. Although he kept the arrangement secret from his company, it does not appear that the agreement itself was improper on Detwiler Fenton\u2019s part or that inside information was misused. If the Justice Department is successful in its prosecution, it opens a new avenue to police how confidential information is used in the markets.Peter J.
